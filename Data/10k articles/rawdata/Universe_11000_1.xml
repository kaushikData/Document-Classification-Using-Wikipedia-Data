      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4587">The '''1997 Guanabara Bay oil spill''' was one of three major [[oil spill]]s in [[Guanabara Bay]] in [[Brazil]]. It leaked from the [[oil refinery]] at [[Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro|Duque de Caxias]] (REDUC) operated by [[Petrobras]].

Petrobras estimated that a leaking pipeline released 600,000 [[liters]] (160,000 US gal) of [[oil]] into the bay, but according to [[Sindipetro]] - the petroleum industry's union - it was 2,000,000 liters (530,000 US gal) of oil that had been spilled.&lt;ref&gt;Taam, Mauricio (undated). "The Guanabara Bay Oil Spill Incident – “The Brazilian Exxon Valdez” An Institutional Perspective". [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Retrieved 5 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also had a large damaging effect on [[marine life]] in the [[ocean]]; as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area. Many fish suffered tragic deaths as they were washed up on the shore dead or 
covered in oil. In addition, the [[fishing industry]] suffered a great downfall and local fishermen were unable to work or fish in the bay.

== Effects ==
Following the oil spill there were many negative after effects on the Brazilian [[fishermen]], on the [[marine life]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. The fishing industry suffered tremendously as survival for the [[marine animal]]s grew more difficult. Marine animals such as, the [[fish]] and [[crab]]s were unable to get oxygen and as a result were not able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;International Environment Reporter: Current Report. Washington: Bureau of National Affairs,1978. Print. Perry, Chris, and Kevin Taylor. Environmental Sedimentology. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub,m 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[aquatic plant|aquatic plant life]] had also begun to die off and become non existent due to the oil resting on the surface of the water. This resulted in a loss of food for the [[marine animal]]s as they had no [[aquatic plant]]s to feed upon.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; The fishermen - who relied heavily on fishing in the bay for their own survival - were faced with tragic times, as it became more difficult to catch fish.  This resulted in a downfall in the demand for fishermen and lead to a loss of employment for such individuals.

== Cleanup costs ==
The cost of the clean-up exceeded just monetary value as it also affected the individuals that relied on the welfare of the bay. The [[Petrobras]] refinery took all responsibility and vowed to execute a cleanup process. In addition to the [[Guanabara Bay]], the contaminated areas included the beaches, and the surrounding areas leading to the [[beach]]es such as, the [[footpath|pathway]]s and [[tunnel]]s. The company experienced great losses in the cleaning up process as they had to compensate for damages and were fined heavily by the Brazilian government. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Economic impact ==
The oil spill had a dangerous impact on the Brazilian society and the overall [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]]. There was a drastic decrease in the number of fish species living in the bay after the spill, because the bay no longer remained a habitable environment. Almost 4000 [[fishermen]] - more than half - that had previously been employed to fish at the [[Guanabara Bay]] had to resort to alternative methods of income and working odd jobs to support their families.&lt;ref&gt;"Case study: An oil stained legacy - Greenpeace do Brasil versus Petrobras S.A." in Tulder, Rob Van; Zwart, Alex Van Der (2006-01-20). International Business-Society Management: Linking Corporate Responsibility And Globalization. Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415342414}}. Retrieved 6 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was unlikely that after the spill one would be able to catch more than 10 [[kilogram|kilos]] of fish, where in comparison to before the spill, the average of catching fish was almost 100 kilos. &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, the quality of the fish from the bay area had also been an issue as many buyers claimed that the quality of the fish had decreased because it was now [[contaminate]]d. As a result, the fish had been valued less and the prices had been reduced to about half. &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

The '''2005 Java–Bali Blackout''' was a [[power outage]] across [[Java]] and [[Bali]] on 18 August 2005, affecting some 100 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bffd3f32-1044-11da-bd5c-00000e2511c8.html?nclick_check=1|title=Indonesian outage leaves 100m without electricity|last=Donnan|first=Shawn |date=19 August 2005|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate impact==
Power went off at around 10:23&amp;nbsp;am ([[UTC]]+7) on 18 August 2005 across most areas of the two islands.

==Cause==
A transmission line between [[Cilegon]] and [[Saguling]], both in [[West Java]], failed at 10:23&amp;nbsp;am local time; this led to a [[cascading failure]] that shut down two units of the [[Paiton Power Station]] in [[East Java]] and six units of the [[Suralaya Power Station]] in [[West Java]]&lt;ref name=massive&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/08/19/massive-blackout-hits-java-bali.html "Massive blackout hits Java, Bali"]. ''The Jakarta Post'', 19 August 2005, 11:16&amp;nbsp;am; retrieved 19 February (Eastern Standard Time) or 20 (Indonesian time), 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Perusahaan Listrik Negara|PT. PLN]], the state-owned electricity company, confirmed that the electricity grid failed at several points throughout Java and the neighbouring island of [[Bali]], causing a supply shortfall of 2,700 [[Megawatt|MW]], roughly half of the original supply.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Jakarta]] lost power completely, along with [[Banten]]; there were blackouts in parts of [[Central Java]], along with parts of both [[West Java]] and [[East Java]].&lt;ref name=massive /&gt;

==Effects==
Due to the sudden supply shortfall, power went out in most areas of Java, including all parts of the capital and largest city in Indonesia, Jakarta. Other major cities in Java, such as [[Surabaya]], were also affected.

==Restoration of service==
Power resumed in most areas of Jakarta at about 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm (UTC+7) on the same day.

==Post-blackout==
PLN apologised for the incident and said about 293,235 customers will be compensated. Meanwhile, [[List of Presidents of Indonesia|President]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] ordered police and the national intelligence agency to assist PLN to trace the cause of the blackouts.

{{nihongo|'''Akabeko'''|赤べこ|Akabeko|''red cow''}} is a legendary [[cattle|cow]] from the [[Aizu]] region of [[Japan]], who inspired a traditional [[toy]]. Aizu legend claims that the toys are based on a real cow used to build the Enzō-ji temple of [[Yanaizu, Fukushima|Yanaizu]] in the ninth century.

The toy is made from two pieces of [[papier-mâché]]-covered wood, shaped and painted to look like a red cow or ox. One piece represents the cow's head and neck and the other its body. The head and neck hangs from a string and fits into the hollow body. When the toy is moved, the head thus bobs up and down and side to side. The earliest akabeko toys were created in the late 16th or early 17th century.

Over time, people came to believe that the toys could ward off [[smallpox]] and other illnesses. Akabeko has become one of [[Fukushima Prefecture]]'s most famous crafts and a symbol of the Aizu region. It has also been recognized as a symbol of the larger [[Tōhoku region]], of which Fukushima Prefecture is a part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-282521648.html TV commercials transmitting the attractions of Japan and Tohoku to the world], States News Service, 8 March 2012 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the legend==
[[File:Akabeko1.png|thumb|Artist rendition of the legendary Akabeko cow]]
According to an Aizu-area legend recorded by Thomas Madden, akabeko toys are based upon a real cow that lived in CE 807. At that time, a monk named Tokuichi was supervising the construction of Enzō-ji&lt;!-- 圓蔵寺 --&gt;, a temple in [[Yanaizu, Fukushima]]. Upon the temple's completion, the akabeko gave its spirit to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and its flesh immediately turned to stone.

Another version of the tale claims that the cow instead refused to leave the temple grounds after construction had been completed and became a permanent fixture there. The red cow was called {{nihongo|akabeko|赤べこ|akabeko|''beko'' is [[Tōhoku dialect|Aizu dialect]] for ''cow''}} and became a symbol of zealous devotion to the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

After [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] had solidified his power over Japan, his representative, [[Gamō Ujisato]], was sent to be the lord of the Aizu region in 1590. At his new post, Ujisato heard the story of akabeko and ordered his court artisans, who had accompanied him from [[Kyoto]], to create a toy based on the red cow. These early [[papier-mâché]] akabeko introduced most of the basic elements for which the toy is known.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

In the same period, Japan suffered a smallpox outbreak. People in Aizu noticed that children who owned akabeko toys did not seem to catch the illness.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt; The akabeko's red colour may have enhanced this association, since red amulets are thought to protect against that illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |title=Mingei: Japanese Folk Toys |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Schwartz |first=Nicole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204307/http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |archivedate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Dorothy (1991).

Facts on File. {{ISBN|0-8160-1934-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Akabeko toys became very popular as charms to ward off sickness, a Superstition that persists in modern times. The toy has since become one of the few crafts from [[Fukushima Prefecture]] to be known all over Japan&lt;ref name="Madden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.plala.or.jp/awia/AizuGlossary.html |title=Aizu Wakamatsu International Association |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Madden |first=Thomas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221103824/http://www6.plala.or.jp/awia/AizuGlossary.html |archivedate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }} (published May 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and a symbol of the Aizu area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-quart/14/jsps14.pdf|title=Introducing Japan: Aizu-Wakamatsu|journal=Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Quarterly|pages=15|issue=14|date=Winter 2005|last=Marasinghe|first=Chandrajith Ashuboda|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Akabeko are made from [[papier-mâché]] that is painted and [[lacquer]]ed. The toy consists of two main pieces: the body, and the head and neck. The body is hollow and open on one end. The neck and head fit into this opening, suspended from a piece of string. Whenever the akabeko is moved or jostled, its head bobs up and down and side to side.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

Akabeko are made by fewer than a dozen family-run workshops, whose members have passed down the technique for generations. The process takes about 10 days to complete. The artisan begins by wrapping wetted ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper) around two blocks of wood, one shaped like the cow's body, and the other shaped like the head and neck. These blocks have often been used for several generations. Once the paper dries, the artisan splits it in two lengthwise and removes the wooden blocks. The craftsperson then rejoins the pieces of molded paper by wrapping more layers of ''washi'' around them.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

The artisan paints the toy, beginning with black, then adding the characteristic red, and finally the white eyes and other details. The akabeko's markings vary from workshop to workshop. For example, the Igarashi family paints the [[kanji|Chinese character]] ''kotobuki'' (寿 ''longevity'' and ''luck'') on the cow's back and a sun and moon on its side; other workshops add gold markings. The artisan finishes the toy with a thin coat of lacquer.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

&lt;!--About the spelling of 'aluminium': this article is written using the IUPAC spelling of "aluminium" and so "ium" should be used. The article follows [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names]] for conventions on chemical names, so "sulfur", etc. should be maintained.--&gt;
{{Infobox aluminium}}
'''Aluminium''' or '''aluminum''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic and [[ductility|ductile]] [[metal]] in the [[boron group]]. By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the  [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Earth's crust]]; it is the third most abundant element after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]] and the most abundant metal in the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below. The chief [[ore]] of aluminium is [[bauxite]]. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that [[Native metal|native specimens]] are rare and limited to extreme [[Redox|reducing]] environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Nuclei and isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}

Aluminium's [[atomic number]] is 13. Of aluminium isotopes, only one is stable: &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al. This is consistent with the fact aluminium's atomic number is odd.{{efn|No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of isotopes of all elements, ten.&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; See [[Even and odd atomic nuclei]] for more details.}} It is the only [[Primordial nuclide|isotope that has existed on Earth in its current form since the creation of the planet]]. It is essentially the only isotope representing the element on Earth, which makes aluminium a [[mononuclidic element]] and practically equates its [[standard atomic weight]] to that of the isotope. Such a low standard atomic weight of aluminium{{efn|Most other metals have greater standard atomic weights: for instance, that of iron is 55.8; copper 63.5; lead 207.2.&lt;ref name="CIAAW2016"/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by Template:Infobox Aluminum --&gt;}} has some effects on the properties of the element (see [[#Bulk|below]]).

=== Electron shell ===

An aluminium atom has 13 electrons, arranged in an [[electron configuration]] of &amp;#91;[[Neon|Ne]]&amp;#93;3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.2}} with three electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Accordingly, the combined first three [[ionization energy|ionization energies]] of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone.{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.6}} Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions (see [[#Chemistry|below]]). The [[electronegativity]] of aluminium is 1.61 (Pauling scale).{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.29}}

A free aluminium atom has a [[atomic radius|radius]] of 143&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]].{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.30}} With the three outermost electrons removed, the [[ionic radius|radius]] shrinks to 39&amp;nbsp;pm for a 4-coordinated atom or 53.5&amp;nbsp;pm for a 6-coordinated atom.{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.30}} At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], aluminium atoms (when not affected by atoms of other elements) form a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic crystal system]] bound by [[metallic bonding]] provided by atoms' outermost electrons; hence aluminium (at these conditions) is a metal. This crystal system is shared by some other metals, such as [[lead]] and [[copper]]; the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals.&lt;ref name="Enghag2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Enghag|first=Per|title=Encyclopedia of the Elements: Technical Data - History - Processing - Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUmTX8yKU4gC|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-61234-5|pages=139, 819, 949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aluminium bar surface etched.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Etched surface from a high purity (99.9998%) aluminium bar, size 55×37 mm]]

Aluminium metal, when in quantity, is very shiny and resembles [[silver]] because it preferentially absorbs [[ultraviolet|far ultraviolet]] radiation while reflecting all [[visible light]] so it does not impart any color to reflected light, unlike the [[reflectance|reflectance spectra]] of [[copper]] and [[gold]]. Another important characteristic of aluminium is its low density, 2.70&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=4-3}}{{efn|Aluminium's low density (compared to the other metals) arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter, while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference.}} Aluminium is a relatively soft, durable, lightweight, [[ductility|ductile]], and [[malleable]] with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far [[infrared]] radiation. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.&lt;ref name="Polmear1995"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polmear |first1=I.

It is easily [[machining|machined]], [[casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[drawing (metalworking)|drawn]] and [[extrusion|extruded]].

Aluminium atoms are arranged in a [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure. Aluminium has a [[stacking-fault energy]] of approximately 200 mJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

Aluminium is a good [[Heat conduction|thermal]] and [[electrical conductor]], having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of [[Copper|copper's]] density. Aluminium is capable of [[superconductor|superconductivity]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[kelvin]] and a critical magnetic field of about 100 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (10 [[millitesla]]s).&lt;ref&gt;

== Chemistry ==

Aluminium's [[corrosion]] resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of [[aluminium oxide]] that forms when the bare metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further [[oxidation]],&lt;ref name="CorrAl"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&amp;pg=PA81|title=Corrosion of Aluminium|last=Vargel|first=Christian|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044495-6|origyear=French edition published 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521212331/https://books.google.com/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&amp;pg=PA81|archivedate=21 May 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process termed [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].  The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]].&lt;ref name="Polmear1995"/&gt; This corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

In highly acidic solutions, aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen, and in highly alkaline ones to form [[aluminates]]— protective passivation under these conditions is negligible.  Primarily because it is corroded by dissolved [[chlorides]], such as common [[sodium chloride]], household plumbing is never made from aluminium.&lt;ref name="Beal1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&amp;pg=PA90|title=Engine Coolant Testing : Fourth Volume|last=Beal|first=Roy E.|date=1 January 1999|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2610-7|page=90|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424071051/https://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&amp;pg=PA90|archivedate=24 April 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because of its general resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&amp;nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000&amp;nbsp;nm (near IR) by [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thin-film optical filters|last=Macleod|first1=H. A.|date=2001|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-7503-0688-1|pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium is [[oxidized]] by [[water]] at temperatures below 280&amp;nbsp;°C to produce [[hydrogen]], [[aluminium hydroxide]] and heat:
:2 Al + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. However, commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction, and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf|title=Reaction of Aluminum with Water to Produce Hydrogen|date=1 January 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914043825/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf|archivedate=14 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inorganic compounds ===

The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The [[coordination number]] of such compounds varies, but generally Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four [[Halide|trihalides]] are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the compactness of the [[fluoride]] ion, six of which can fit around the small Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; center. AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sublimes (with cracking) at {{convert|1291|°C|0|abbr=on}}. With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimeric]] or [[polymer]]ic with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. [[Acid]]ification of the oxides or [[hydroxide]]s affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centers that feature both halide and [[metal aquo complex|aquo ligands]]. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as {{chem|[AlF(H|2|O)|5|]|2+}}, {{chem|AlF|3|(H|2|O)|3}}, and {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}}. In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Aluminium forms one stable oxide with the [[chemical formula]] Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.&lt;/sub&gt; It can be found in nature in the mineral [[corundum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2NZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA718&amp;dq=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20forms%20one%20stable%20oxide,%20known%20by%20its%20mineral%20name%20corundum|title=A treatise on chemistry|last=Roscoe|first=Henry Enfield|last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|date=1913|publisher=Macmillan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium oxide is also commonly called [[alumina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MYAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20forms%20one%20stable%20oxide,%20known%20by%20its%20mineral%20name%20corundum|title=Pigment Compendium|last=Eastaugh|first=Nicholas|last2=Walsh|first2=Valentine|last3=Chaplin|first3=Tracey|last4=Siddall|first4=Ruth|date=2008-09-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136373930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]]. There are three trihydroxides: [[bayerite]], [[gibbsite]], and [[nordstrandite]], which differ in their crystalline structure ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful.

[[Aluminium carbide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides, it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is air-stable material with a usefully high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]] (AlP) is made similarly; it hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]]:

: AlP + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==== Rarer oxidation states ====
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species.

===== Aluminium(I) =====
AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition {{math|AlI}} is unstable at room temperature, converting to triiodide:&lt;ref name="al1" /&gt;

Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with silicon at {{convert|1800|°C|0|abbr=on}} in a [[vacuum]].&lt;ref name="al1"&gt;{{cite journal

With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium compounds exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as [[triisobutylaluminium]]. Such compounds{{which|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- only the immediately preceding topic (large R) or all organoaluminiums? --&gt; are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly [[pyrophoric]].

The history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of [[alum]]. The first written record of alum, made by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], dates back to the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=12}} The ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for city defense.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=12}} After the [[Crusades]], alum, an indispensable good in the European fabric industry,&lt;ref name="ClaphamPower1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapham|first1=John Harold|last2=Power|first2=Eileen Edna|title=The Cambridge Economic History of Europe: From the Decline of the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA682|year=1941|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-08710-0|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a subject of international commerce;{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=16}} it was imported to Europe from the eastern Mediterranean until the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/165383496|title=The papacy and the Levant: 1204-1571. 1 The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries|last=Setton|first=Kenneth M.|date=1976|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-127-9|oclc=165383496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of alum remained unknown. Around 1530, Swiss physician [[Paracelsus]] suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=25}} In 1595, German doctor and chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] experimentally confirmed this;&lt;ref name="Weeks1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Mary Elvira|title=Discovery of the elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6kPAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|volume=1|edition=7|publisher=Journal of chemical education|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1722, German chemist [[Friedrich Hoffmann]] announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} In 1754, German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding [[potash]].{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}}

Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to 1760.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=3}} The first successful attempt, however, was completed in 1824 by Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]] with potassium [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.&lt;ref name="(København)1827"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR25|title=Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs philosophiske og historiske afhandlinger|author=Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|author-link=Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|publisher=Popp|year=1827|pages=XXV–XXVI|language=da|trans-title=The philosophical and historical dissertations of the Royal Danish Science Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woehler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wöhler|first=Friedrich|date=1827|title=Ueber das Aluminium|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4433551;view=1up;seq=162|journal=[[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]]|series=2|volume=11|pages=146–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in 1825.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=36}}&lt;ref name="FontaniCosta2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck9jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=The Lost Elements: The Periodic Table's Shadow Side|last1=Fontani|first1=Marco|last2=Costa|first2=Mariagrazia|last3=Orna|first3=Mary Virginia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-938334-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, German chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]] repeated Ørsted's experiments but did not identify any aluminium.&lt;ref name="Venetski"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venetski|first1=S.|date=1969|title='Silver' from clay|journal=Metallurgist|volume=13|issue=7|pages=451–453|doi=10.1007/BF00741130}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in 1921.){{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=38}} He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium.&lt;ref name="woehler" /&gt; In 1845, he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=38}} For many years thereafter, Wöhler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium.&lt;ref name="Holmes1936"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Harry N.|date=1936|title=Fifty Years of Industrial Aluminum|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/15938|journal=The Scientific Monthly|volume=42|issue=3|pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wöhler's method could not yield great quantities of aluminium, the metal remained rare; its cost exceeded that of gold.&lt;ref name="Venetski" /&gt;

French chemist [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] announced an industrial method of aluminium production in 1854 at the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=39}} Aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium, which Wöhler had used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainte-Claire Deville  |first=H.

The first industrial large-scale production method was independently developed in 1886 by French engineer [[Paul Héroult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]]; it is now known as the [[Hall–Héroult process]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=55–61}} The Hall–Héroult process converts alumina into the metal.

Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass frames, optical instruments, tableware, and [[Aluminium foil|foil]] in the 1890s and early 20th century. Aluminium's ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=64–69}} During [[World War I]], major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingulstad |first=Mats |year=2012 |chapter='We Want Aluminum, No Excuses': Business-Government Relations in the American Aluminum Industry, 1917–1957 |pp=33–68 |title=From Warfare to Welfare: Business-Government Relations in the Aluminium Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Warfare_to_Welfare.html?id=TFS6NAEACAAJ |editor-first1=Mats |editor-last1=Ingulstad |editor-first2=Hans Otto |editor-last2=Frøland |publisher=Tapir Academic Press |isbn=978-82-321-0049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=69–70}} During the mid-20th century, aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material, with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work,{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=165–166}} and increasingly being used in military engineering, for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=85}} [[Sputnik 1|Earth's first artificial satellite]], launched in 1957, consisted of two separate aluminium semi-spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have been made of aluminium.&lt;ref name="aluminiumleader"/&gt; The [[aluminium can]] was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=135}}

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|lang=en|World production of aluminium since 1900]]

Throughout the 20th century, the production of aluminium rose rapidly: while the world production of aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons, the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tons in 1916; 1,000,000 tons in 1941; 10,000,000 tons in 1971.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/historical-statistics/|title=Historical Statistics for Mineral Commodities in the United States|chapter=Aluminum|year=2017|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|language=en|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity; it entered the [[London Metal Exchange]], the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world, in 1978.&lt;ref name="aluminiumleader"/&gt; The output continued to grow: the annual production of aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons in 2013.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;

== Etymology ==

Aluminium is named after alumina, or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature. The word "alumina" comes from "alum", the mineral from which it was collected. The word "alum" comes from ''alumen'', a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning "bitter salt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=alum|title=Alum|website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|last=Harper |first=Douglas|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alumen'' stems from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*alu-'' meaning "bitter" or "beer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pokorny |first=Julius |authorlink=Julius Pokorny |title=Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch |trans-title=Indo-European etymological dictionary |language=de |url=https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/whnjs.htm |date=1959 |publisher=A.

[[File:The Turner Brass Works ad 1897.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|1897 American advertisement featuring the ''aluminum'' spelling]]

British chemist [[Humphry Davy]], who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal, is credited as the person who named the element. In 1808, he suggested the metal be named ''alumium''.&lt;ref name=Davy1808&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|date=1808|title=Electro Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; with Observations on the Metals obtained from the alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam procured from Ammonia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kg9GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA353|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=98|page=353|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023|accessdate=10 December 2009|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France, Germany, and Sweden, who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide, alumina, from which it would be isolated.{{sfn|Richards|1896|pp=3–4}} In 1812, Davy chose ''aluminum'', thus producing the modern name.&lt;ref name="Davy1812"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjMwAAAAYAAJ|title=Elements of Chemical Philosophy: Part 1|last=Davy|first=Humphry|publisher=Bradford and Inskeep|year=1812|volume=1|page=201|chapter=Of metals; their primary compositions with other uncompounded bodies, and with each other|authorlink=Humphry Davy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is spelled and pronounced differently outside of North America: ''aluminum'' is in use in the U.S. and Canada while ''aluminium'' is in use elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Powell2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Mike |title=Amglish: Two Nations Divided by a Common Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5hXDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138|year=2015|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=978-1-4835-5100-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling ===

The ''{{nobreak|-ium}}'' suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, element names ending in ''{{nobreak|-um}}'' were known at the time; for example, [[platinum]] (known to Europeans since the 16th century), [[molybdenum]] (discovered in 1778), and [[tantalum]] (discovered in 1802). The ''{{nobreak|-um}}'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]] (as opposed to aluminia); compare to [[lanthana]], the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]], the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]], respectively.

Aluminium production is highly energy-consuming, and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive.&lt;ref name="WMP"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=1388|title=World Mineral Production 2003–2007|last1=Brown|first1=T.

=== Bayer process ===
{{Main|Bayer process}}

Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide by the Bayer process. Bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground. The resulting [[slurry]] is mixed with a hot solution of [[sodium hydroxide]]; the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric, dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into a relatively insoluble compounds:&lt;ref name="UllmannOxide"/&gt;

{{block indent|Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}

After this reaction, the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. It is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced. The bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded. The solution, free of solids, is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide; this causes decomposition of the [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions to aluminium hydroxide. After about half of aluminium has precipitated, the mixture is sent to classifiers. Small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents; coarse particles are reduced to aluminium oxide; excess solution is removed by evaporation, (if needed) purified, and recycled.&lt;ref name="UllmannOxide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last1=Hudson|first1=L.

=== Hall–Héroult process ===
{{Main|Hall–Héroult process|Aluminium smelting}}
The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten ({{convert|950|and|980|C|F}}) mixture of [[cryolite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[calcium fluoride]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] to produce metallic aluminium. The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off, and usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

[[File:Tovarna glinice in aluminija Kidričevo - kupi aluminija 1968.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|[[Extrusion]] billets of aluminium]]

Anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon—the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion—and either bake at the process or are prebaked. The former, also called Söderberg anodes, are less power-efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect, which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power, energy, and labor to prebake the cathodes. Carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash. Despite carbon's resistivity against corrosion, it is still consumed at a rate of 0.4–0.5&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. Cathodes are made of [[anthracite]]; high purity for them is not required because impurities [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] only very slowly. Cathode is consumed at a rate of 0.02–0.04&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. A cell is usually a terminated after 2–6 years following a failure of the cathode.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

The Hall–Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoopes process]]. This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium, and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpgTrFloOq0C&amp;pg=PA40|title=Handbook of Aluminum|last1=Totten|first1=G.

Electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the United States.&lt;ref name="Emsley2011" /&gt; Because of this, alternatives to the Hall–Héroult process have been researched, but none has turned out to be economically feasible.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Recycling===
{{Main|Aluminium recycling}}

Recovery of the metal through [[recycling]] has become an important task of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium [[beverage can]]s brought it to public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtX1nbel49kC|title=Aluminum Recycling|last=Schlesinger|first=Mark|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8493-9662-5|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as [[dross]] (ash-like oxide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/recycling/awareness/facts/benefits.htm|title=Benefits of Recycling|publisher=[[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624162738/http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/recycling/awareness/facts/benefits.htm|archivedate=24 June 2003|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross, with values reported below 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsinc.org/files/best%20practice%20energy-schifo-radia-may%202004.pdf|title=Theoretical/Best Practice Energy Use In Metalcasting Operations|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031072356/http://www.afsinc.org/files/best%20practice%20energy-schifo-radia-may%202004.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all|access-date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Transportation ([[automobile]]s, aircraft, [[truck]]s, [[railway car]]s, marine vessels, [[bicycle]]s, spacecraft, etc.). Aluminium is used because of its low density; 
* Packaging ([[aluminium can|cans]], foil, frame etc.). Aluminium is used because it is non-toxic, non-[[Adsorption|adsorptive]], and [[splinter]]-proof;
* Building and construction ([[window]]s, [[door]]s, [[siding]], building wire, sheathing, roofing, etc.). Since steel is cheaper, aluminium is used when lightness, corrosion resistance, or engineering features are important;
* Electricity-related uses (conductor alloys, motors and generators, transformers, capacitors, etc.). Aluminium is used because it is relatively cheap, highly conductive, has adequate mechanical strength and low density, and resists corrosion;
*A wide range of [[household]] items, from [[cooking utensil]]s to [[furniture]]. Low density, good appearance, ease of fabrication, and durability are the key factors of aluminium usage;
*Machinery and equipment (processing equipment, pipes, tools). Aluminium is used because of its corrosion resistance, non-pyrophoricity, and mechanical strength.

Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth crust, aluminium has no known function in biology. Aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic, [[aluminium sulfate]] having an [[Median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 6207&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500&amp;nbsp;grams for an {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}} person.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

=== Toxicity ===

In most people, aluminium is not as toxic as [[heavy metals]]. Aluminium is classified as a non-carcinogen by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name="Piero3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolara|first=Piero|date=21 July 2014|title=Occurrence, exposure, effects, recommended intake and possible dietary use of selected trace compounds (aluminium, bismuth, cobalt, gold, lithium, nickel, silver)|journal=International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition|volume=65|issue=8|pages=911–924|doi=10.3109/09637486.2014.937801|issn=1465-3478|pmid=25045935}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult,&lt;ref name="gitelman"&gt;Gitelman, H.

=== Effects ===

Aluminium, although rarely, can cause vitamin D-resistant [[osteomalacia]], [[erythropoietin]]-resistant [[microcytic anemia]], and central nervous system alterations. People with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk.&lt;ref name="Piero3"/&gt; Chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates (for excess gastric acidity control) may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals, such as [[iron]] or [[zinc]]; sufficiently high doses (&gt;50 g/day) can cause anemia.&lt;ref name="Piero3"/&gt; Since aluminium is excreted by kidneys, their function may be impaired by toxic amounts of aluminium.&lt;ref name="Balch2006" /&gt;

[[File:Al transport across human cells.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|There are five major aluminium forms absorbed by human body: the free solvated trivalent cation (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); low-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (LMW-Al&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); high-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (HMW-Al&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); low-molecular-weight, charged, soluble complexes (LMW-Al(L)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); nano and micro-particulates (Al(L)&lt;sub&gt;n(s)&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Exposure routes ===

Food is the main source of aluminium. Drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food;&lt;ref name="Piero3"/&gt; however, aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water.&lt;ref name="Yokel2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yokel RA|author2=Hicks CL|author3=Florence RL|date=2008|title=Aluminum bioavailability from basic sodium aluminum phosphate, an approved food additive emulsifying agent, incorporated in cheese|journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]]|volume=46|issue=6|pages=2261–6|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2008.03.004|pmc=2449821|pmid=18436363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food (due to its use in food additives, food and beverage packaging, and cooking utensils), drinking water (due to its use in municipal water treatment), and aluminium-containing medications (particularly antacid/antiulcer and buffered aspirin formulations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|author=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|url=http://abcmt.org/tp22.pdf|title=Toxicological profile for aluminum|last=|first=|date=1999|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary exposure in Europeans averages to 0.2–1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/week but can be as high as 2.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/week.&lt;ref name="Piero3"/&gt; Higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners, aluminium production workers, and [[dialysis]] patients.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://enviroliteracy.org/special-features/its-element-ary/aluminum/|title=Aluminum - The Environmental Literacy Council|work=The Environmental Literacy Council|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===

In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium, the only treatment is [[deferoxamine mesylate]] which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by [[chelation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/AlumToxDoc.htm|title=ARL: Aluminum Toxicity|website=www.arltma.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929 Aluminum Toxicity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203055539/http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929|date=3 February 2014}} from [[NYU Langone Medical Center]].

Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils.

Aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process. The major challenge is the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing. The most potent of these gases are [[Fluorocarbon|perfluorocarbons]] from the smelting process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Released [[sulfur dioxide]] is one of the primary precursors of [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A Spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' consumes the aluminium in [[compact disc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm |title=Fungus 'eats' CDs |date=22 June 2001 |publisher=BBC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/news010628-11 |author=Bosch, Xavier |title=Fungus eats CD |date=27 June 2001 |journal=Nature |doi-broken-date=2018-09-14 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2001/010627/full/news010628-11.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231163222/http://www.nature.com/news/2001/010627/full/news010628-11.html |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports all refer back to that report and there is no supporting original research.

'''Archibald Clark Robertson''' (15 September 1929 – 28 January 1978) was a Scottish [[association football|footballer]] who spent most of his career with [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], firstly as an [[Forward (association football)#Inside forward|inside right]] and latterly as manager.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Robertson joined Clyde from [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior]] side [[Rutherglen Glencairn]] in 1947, on a part-time basis as he continued his studies towards a [[university degree|degree]] in [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Lamming"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamming | first = Douglas | title = A Scottish Soccer Internationalists Who's Who, 1872-1986 | type = Hardback | publisher = Hutton Press | year = 1987 | id = ({{ISBN|0-907033-47-4}}) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next 14 seasons with the ''Bully Wee'', during which time he experienced relegation on three occasions, although he also helped the side win the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Division Two]] title twice, in [[1951-52 in Scottish football|1951-52]] and [[1956-57 in Scottish football|1956-57]].

Robertson also enjoyed success with Clyde in the [[Scottish Cup]]. In the [[Scottish Cup 1954-55|1955 final]] he scored Clyde's equalising goal direct from a corner kick in the 88th minute, forcing a 1-1 draw with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/post-war/|publisher=[[Clyde F.C.]]|title=History: Post War Boom|date=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde went on to win the replay 1-0 with a goal by [[Tommy Ring]]. He also played in the [[Scottish Cup 1957-58|1958 Cup final]] when Clyde defeated [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] 1-0.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

He eventually left the club when signed by [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] for £1,000 in the autumn of his career.&lt;ref name="Lamming"/&gt; A teammate was [[Allan McGraw]] who stated that he "Learnt a lot" from Robertson.&lt;ref name="Ton"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/sport/13996586/ |title=Revival of Ton|date=6 July 2009|publisher=Greenock Telegraph|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two seasons in [[Greenock]] before retiring in 1963.

===International===
While with Clyde, Robertson earned 5 caps for the [[Scotland national football team]] and played in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Sweden]]. He also earned selection for the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] representative side on two occasions.

==Manager==
Robertson began a managerial career with Second Division [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] in 1964 and spent three and a half mid-table seasons with the ''Blue Brazil''.&lt;ref name="Lamming"/&gt; In January 1968 he succeeded [[David White (football manager)|Davie White]] as manager of old club Clyde but was not able to replicate White's [[1966-67 in Scottish football|1966-67]] third-place finish as Clyde's league form gradually declined in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They eventually experienced relegation in [[1971-72 in Scottish football|the 1971-72 season]] and despite leading his team to the Second Division title the following campaign, Robertson ended his association with the club in 1973. His final footballing role was as [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s Scottish scout.&lt;ref name="Lamming"/&gt;

==Other work==
Throughout his career, Robertson combined his footballing role with another career. Following his graduation he worked in the scientific branch of the [[National Coal Board]],&lt;ref name="Lamming"/&gt; while in later years he was a science [[teacher]] at [[Hunter High School, East Kilbride|Hunter High School]] in [[East Kilbride]].&lt;ref name="Lamming"/&gt; One of his pupils was future Scotland striker [[Ally McCoist]] who credited the guidance of Robertson (in his role as the school team's coach) in his early development as a player.&lt;ref name="Ally"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12682858.Where_the_boy_done_good/|title=Where the boy done good|date=22 February 1994|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BAM phospholipid.png|alt=Complex phospholipid layer in liquid condensed phase in a Langmuir Trough, imaged by a Brewster angle microscope.|thumb|300x300px|Complex phospholipid layer in liquid condensed phase in a Langmuir Trough, imaged by a Brewster angle microscope.]]
A '''Brewster angle microscope''' ('''BAM''') is a [[microscope]] for studying [[thin film]]s on [[liquid]] surfaces, most typically [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir films]]. In a Brewster angle microscope, both the microscope and a [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] light source are aimed towards a liquid surface at that liquid's [[Brewster angle]], in such a way for the microscope to catch an image of any light reflected from the light source via the liquid surface. Because there is no [[p-polarized|''p''-polarized]] reflection from the pure liquid when both are angled towards it at the Brewster angle, light is only reflected when some other phenomenon such as a surface film affects the liquid surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/technology/brewster-angle-microscopy/|title=Brewster Angle Microscopy - Biolin Scientific|work=Biolin Scientific|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was first introduced in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/physik/OSMP/Soft/ws0607_ue05a.pdf|title=Design and Testing of a Low-Cost and Compact Brewster Angle Microscope|author=M.

== Applications ==
Brewster angle microscopes enable the visualization of Langmuir monolayers or adsorbate films at the air-water interface for example as a function of packing density. They can be used either to study the properties of the Langmuir layer, or to indicate a suitable deposition pressure for Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition. They can be used for example in the [[Nanoparticle deposition|LB deposition of nanoparticles]]. Applications include&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/zafepress.php?url=%2Fpdf%2FKSV%20NIMA%2FApplication%20Notes%2FKN-AN-09-Brewster-angle-microscopy-thin-films.pdf|title=Imaging the Structure of Thin Films: Brewster Angle Microscopy|last=|first=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Monolayer/film homogeneity.''' When combined with a Langmuir-Blodgett Trough, observation can be performed during compression/expansion at known surface pressures.

'''Optimizing the deposition parameters.''' Selecting optimal deposition pressure and other deposition parameters for LB coating.

'''Monolayer/film behavior.''' Observing phase changes, phase separation, domain size, shape and packing.

'''Monitoring of surface reactions.''' Photochemical reactions, polymerizations and enzyme kinetics can be followed in real time.

'''Monitoring and detection of surface active materials.''' For example protein adsorption and nanoparticle flotation.

{{infobox cadmium}}
'''Cadmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on [[steel]], and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow [[cadmium pigments|pigment]]s, to color [[colored glass|glass]], and to stabilize [[plastic]]. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is [[toxicity|toxic]] (it is specifically listed in the European [[ROHS|Restriction of Hazardous Substances]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s.

Although cadmium usually has an [[oxidation state]] of +2, it also exists in the +1 state.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous [[cadmium oxide]] (CdO); the [[crystal]]line form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to [[zinc oxide]]. [[Hydrochloric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[nitric acid]] dissolve cadmium by forming [[cadmium chloride]] (CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[cadmium sulfate]] (CdSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), or [[cadmium nitrate]] (Cd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and [[aluminium chloride]], forming the Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, which is similar to the Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation in [[mercury(I) chloride]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

===Isotopes===
[[File:Cadmium cutoff.png|thumb|left|The cadmium-113 total cross section clearly showing the cadmium cut-off]]
{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is 7.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years) and &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; years). The other three are &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and &lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Cd&amp;nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 14.1 years), &lt;sup&gt;115m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 44.6 days), and &lt;sup&gt;117m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 3.36 hours).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) to 131.946 u (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element 47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element 49 ([[indium]]).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt;

One isotope of cadmium, &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, absorbs neutrons with high selectivity:  With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5&amp;nbsp;eV, and neutrons below that level are deemed slow neutrons, distinct from intermediate and fast neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;

Cadmium is created via the [[s-process]] in low- to medium-mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10 [[Sun|solar masses]], over thousands of years. In that process, a [[silver]] atom captures a [[neutron]] and then undergoes [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Friedrich Strohmeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Friedrich Stromeyer]]]]
Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning "[[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]]", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals that was named after the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann]], both in [[Germany]], as an impurity in zinc carbonate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]] (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reducing the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, but the lack of cadmium limited this application.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the international [[ångström]] in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 wavelength = 6438.46963&amp;nbsp;Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thesciencedictionary.org/international-angstrom/ |title=International Angstrom |website=Science Dictionary |date=2013-09-14 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/angstrom.htm |title=angstrom or ångström |website=Sizes.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was adopted by the 7th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1927.

After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for [[plating]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YB1956"&gt;

The stabilizing effect of cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on [[Pvc|PVC]] led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined as a result of environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
At the same time, these decreases in consumption were compensated by a growing demand for cadmium for nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.&lt;!-- The overall consumption of cadmium has decreased by more than 90% from the 1970s till 2008.--&gt;&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web

The only cadmium [[mineral]] of importance, [[greenockite]] (Cd[[sulfur|S]]), is nearly always associated with [[sphalerite]] (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907,&lt;ref name="Cadold"/&gt; but wide use began after World War I.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;

==Applications==
Cadmium is a common component of electric batteries, [[cadmium pigments|pigments]],&lt;ref name="colors"/&gt; coatings,&lt;ref name="fff"/&gt; and electroplating.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt;

===Batteries===
[[File:NiCd various.jpg|thumb|Ni-Cd batteries]]
In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], predominantly in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. The cell consists of a positive [[nickel hydroxide]] [[electrode]] and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an [[alkaline]] [[electrolyte]] ([[potassium hydroxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krishnamurthy |first= N. |date= July 2, 2013 |title= Engg. Chemistry, 2/e |location= New York |publisher= PHI Learning Private Limited |pages= 82–83 |isbn= 978-81-203-3666-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;jsessionid=VN9WTn1VHCtTbGnQpnkrTsj2gh68QzJf581nbhhVpJSLNn2sLJsy!-561601488?uri=CELEX:32011L0065|title=EUR-Lex - 32011L0065 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:266:0001:0014:en:PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of battery based on cadmium is the [[silver-cadmium battery]].

===Electroplating===
[[File:CdSeqdots.jpg|thumb|A photograph and representative spectrum of [[photoluminescence]] from colloidal CdSe [[quantum dot]]s]]
Cadmium [[electroplating]], consuming 6% of the global production, is used in the aircraft industry to reduce [[corrosion]] of steel components.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=9yzN-QGag_8C|title = Mercury, Cadmium, Lead: Handbook for Sustainable Heavy Metals Policy and Regulation|first = Michael J.|last = Scoullos|author2 = Vonkeman, Gerrit H.|author3 = Thornton, Iain|author4 = Makuch, Zen| publisher = Springer|date = 2001|isbn = 978-1-4020-0224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coating is passivated by [[chromate]] salts.&lt;ref name="fff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFulltext/RTO/MP/RTO-MP-025///MP-025-15.pdf |title=Advances to Protective Coatings and their Application to Ageing Aircraft |author=Smith C.J.E. |author2=Higgs M.S. |author3=Baldwin K.R. |date=20 April 1999 |publisher=RTO MP-25 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517202722/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/ |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A limitation of cadmium plating is [[hydrogen embrittlement]] of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).

Titanium embrittlement from cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools (and the implementation of routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination) in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/breaking-through-technological-barriers.html|title = CIA&amp;nbsp;– Breaking Through Technological Barriers&amp;nbsp;– Finding The Right Metal (A-12 program)|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fission===
Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective "neutron poison" to control [[neutron flux]] in [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt; When cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor, cadmium absorbs neutrons, preventing them from creating additional fission events, thus controlling the amount of reactivity. The [[pressurized water reactor]] designed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] uses an alloy consisting of 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt;

=== Televisions ===
[[Quantum dot display|QLED TVs]] have been starting to include cadmium in construction. Some companies have been looking to reduce the environmental impact of human exposure and pollution of the material in televisions during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/are-quantum-dot-tvs-and-their-toxic-ingredients-actually-better-for-the-environment-35953|title=Are quantum dot TVs – and their toxic ingredients – actually better for the environment?|last=Maynard|first=Andrew|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compounds===

[[File:Cadmium sulfide.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Cadmium sulfide]]
Various cadmium salts are used in paint pigments, with CdS as a [[Cadmium pigments|yellow pigment]] being the most common. [[Cadmium selenide]] is a red pigment, commonly called ''cadmium red''. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — so much so that during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into [[watercolor]]s, [[gouache]]s, [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a [[barrier cream]] on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin&lt;ref name="colors"&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Cadmium Pigments|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=_OrB0ew_HgAC&amp;pg=PA121|pages = 121–123|isbn = 978-3-527-30363-2|publisher = Wiley-VCH|date = 2005|title =Industrial inorganic pigments|first1 = Gunter|last1 = Buxbaum|first2 = Gerhard|last2 = Pfaff}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.&lt;ref name = "ATSDR"/&gt;

In [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], cadmium was used as heat, light, and weathering stabilizers.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=YUkJNI9QYsUC&amp;pg=PA149|page = 149|first = Thomas C.|last = Jennings|isbn = 978-1-56990-379-7| publisher = Hanser Verlag|date = 2005|title = PVC handbook|chapter = Cadmium Environmental Concerns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of [[solder]] and bearing alloys, because it has a low [[coefficient of friction]] and fatigue resistance.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt; It is also found in some of the lowest-melting [[alloy]]s, such as [[Wood's metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= George Stuart|last1= Brady|first2= George S.|last2= Brady|first3= Henry R.|last3= Clauser|first4 = John A.|last4 = Vaccari|isbn = 978-0-07-136076-0|url = https://books.google.com/?id=vIhvSQLhhMEC&amp;pg=PA425|title = Materials handbook: an encyclopedia for managers, technical professionals, purchasing and production managers, technicians, and supervisors|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|date = 2002| page = 425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium is a component of some compound [[semiconductor]]s, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and [[cadmium telluride]], used for light detection and [[solar cell]]s. [[HgCdTe]] is sensitive to [[infrared]]&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt; light and can be used as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.

In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] research to stimulate [[proteasome]]-dependent degradation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|Hif-1α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Biochemistry|volume = 267|issue = 13|pages = 4198–4204|date = 2000|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01453.x|title = Cadmium blocks hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated response to hypoxia by stimulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha|first = Chun Y.

Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;Mann, Denise (23 April 2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426102047/http://news.yahoo.com/heavy-metal-foods-cosmetics-spur-breast-cancer-spread-200608223.html Can Heavy Metal in Foods, Cosmetics Spur Breast Cancer Spread?] HealthDayBy via Yahoo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jinzu River.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jinzū River]] area, which was contaminated with cadmium]]
There have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com" /&gt; In the decades leading up to [[World War II]], mining operations contaminated the [[Jinzū River]] in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed [[itai-itai]] disease and renal abnormalities, including [[proteinuria]] and [[glucosuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Environmental cadmium exposure, adverse effects, and preventative measures in Japan|first = Koji|last = Nogawa|journal = Biometals|date = 2004|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages =581–587|doi = 10.1023/B:BIOM.0000045742.81440.9c|pmid = 15688869|last2 = Kobayashi|first2 = E.|last3 = Okubo|first3 = Y.|last4 = Suwazono|first4 = Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[ROHS|Restriction on Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790) |date=14 October 2006|publisher=Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including kidney disease,&lt;ref name="zn-cd.diseases" /&gt; early atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 Cadmium Exposure can Induce Early Atherosclerotic Changes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135304/http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 |date=15 March 2012 }}, Medinews Direct, 7 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease in human populations, a necessary molecular mechanism has not been identified. One hypothesis holds that cadmium is an [[endocrine disruptor]] and some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different [[Hormone|hormonal]] signaling pathways. For example, cadmium can bind to the [[estrogen receptor]] alpha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[tobacco plant]] readily absorbs and accumulates [[heavy metals]], such as cadmium from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914011010952 |pmc=3586865|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2011.12.027|pmid=23493960|title=Preconcentration and determination of copper in tobacco leaves samples by using a minicolumn of sisal fiber (Agave sisalana) loaded with Alizarin fluorine blue by FAAS|journal=Talanta|volume=89|issue=1|pages=276–279|year=2012|last1=Dias|first1=Fábio de S.|last2=Bonsucesso|first2=Josemário S.|last3=Oliveira|first3=Lucas C.|last4=Dos Santos|first4=Walter N.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–73|date = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|date = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a non-smoking population, food is the greatest source of exposure. High quantities of cadmium can be found in [[crustacean]]s, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[offal]], and [[algae]] products. However, grains, vegetables, and starchy roots and tubers are consumed in much greater quantity in the US, and are the source of the greatest dietary exposure.&lt;ref name="efsa.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2551|title=Cadmium dietary exposure in the European population - European Food Safety Authority|website=www.efsa.europa.eu|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants bio-accumulate metal toxins like Cd, and when composted to form organic fertilizers yield a product which can often contain high amounts (e.g., over 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg) of metal toxins for every kilo of fertilizer. Fertilizers made from animal dung (e.g., cow dung) or urban waste can contain similar amounts of Cd. The Cd added to the soil from fertilizers (rock phosphates or organic fertilizers) become bio-available and toxic only if the soil pH is low (i.e., acidic soils).  Zinc is chemically similar to cadmium and some evidence indicates the presence of Zn ions reduces cadmium toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://innovareacademics.in/journals/index.php/ijpps/article/view/2305|title=MITIGATING ROLE OF ZINC AND IRON AGAINST CADMIUM INDUCED TOXICITY IN LIVER AND KIDNEY OF MALE ALBINO RAT: A STUDY WITH REFERENCE TO METALLOTHIONEIN QUANTIFICATION|first1=Obaiah|last1=Jamakala|first2=A.

Zinc, Cu, Ca, and Fe ions, and selenium with vitamin C are used to treat Cd intoxication, though it is not easily reversed.&lt;ref name="zn-cd.diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/CadmiumToxDoc.htm|title=ARL : Cadmium Toxicity|website=www.arltma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations===
Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the [[REACH Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm EUR-Lex]. Eur-lex.europa.eu (18 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain specifies that 2.5 μg/kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for humans.&lt;ref name="efsa.europa.eu"/&gt; The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be the provisional tolerable weekly intake level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jeceval/jec_297.htm|title=JECFA Evaluations-CADMIUM-|website=www.inchem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for cadmium at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has not set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for cadmium is 9&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MT ''Castillo de Bellver'' oil spill''' began on 6 August 1983, when the Spanish tanker caught fire off [[Saldanha Bay]], approximately 70 miles northwest of [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. It was carrying 250,000 tonnes (300,000 cubic metres) of [[light crude oil]], and was traveling through an environmentally sensitive area known for its seabird rookeries and important commercial fishing grounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cedre.fr/en/spill/castillo_de_bellver/castillo_de_bellver.php|title = Castillo de Bellver|date = 2010-06-15|accessdate = 2014-08-18|website = Cedre|publisher = |last = |first = |location = France}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burning vessel was abandoned and broke apart after drifting offshore.

The ''Castillo de Bellver'' was built in 1978 to carry light crude oil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Incident ==
On 6 August 1983, the Spanish oil tanker ''Castillo de Bellver'' was en route from the [[Persian Gulf]] to Spain&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/world/ship-breaks-up-off-cape-town-sending-oil-spill-toward-beaches.html|title = SHIP BREAKS UP OFF CAPE TOWN, SENDING OIL SPILL TOWARD BEACHES|last = |first = |date = 1983-08-07|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|newspaper = The New York Times|location = New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; transporting 250,000 tonnes (300,000 cubic metres) of light crude oil.

Around {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} off [[Table Bay]], South Africa, it exploded and proceeded to burn. The crew abandoned the ship, which proceeded to drift off the coast, eventually breaking in two at around 10 a.m.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langewiesche"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langewiesche|first1=William|title=Salvage Beast|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/12/nick-sloane-costa-concordia-salvage|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately {{convert|50000|-|60000|tonnes|lb|abbr=on}} of light crude was initially spilled into the sea, creating a flaming oil slick. By mid-morning, the ship trailed an oil slick {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A fishing trawler, ''Harvest Carina'', rescued 32 crew members from a lifeboat. A passing container ship rescued another crew member. Three additional persons were declared missing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The stern section of the ship capsized and sank on 7 August in deep waters, {{convert|36|km|abbr=on}} off the coast. There were {{convert|100000|-|110000|tonnes|lb|abbr=on}} of oil remaining in ''Castillo de Bellver''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s tanks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The bow had drifted towards an area that included the [[Langebaan Lagoon]] marine life sanctuary, a {{convert|15|mile|adj=on}}-long strip of coast south of Saldanha Port.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bow section was then towed away from the coast and was eventually sunk using explosives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A total of {{convert|78.5|MUSgal|Moilbbl|abbr=off}} of oil was released into the sea during the incident.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Response ==
The pollution threat to [[Cape Province]] beaches was initially considered "enormous", according to a Cape Town port official. He said that the current could move the oil slick away from the coast but that a {{convert|25|knot}} northwesterly wind could blow the oil towards the coast.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The oil initially drifted towards the coast. The wind then changed direction and took it offshore, where the slick entered the north-west flowing [[Benguela Current]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oilspillsolutions.org/majorspills.htm|title = Case Histories &gt; Major Spills|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|website = OilSpillSolutions.org|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather conditions proved to be conducive to spill response and helped prevent a major onshore environmental disaster.

Approximately {{convert|230|m3|gal}} of diluted chemical dispersant and {{convert|4|m3|gal}} of dispersant concentrate were sprayed at the edge of the slick, preventing it from coming within {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} of the shore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On August 10, the {{convert|150|km2|adj=on}} slick was almost {{convert|30|nmi}} offshore as the bow of the tanker was being towed out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116422483|title = Oil slick threat passes|last = |first = |date = 1983-08-10|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|newspaper = The Canberra Times|location = Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 12, over 200 oiled birds had been recovered "with feathers glued with oil" and taken to conservation centers in Cape Town. Many more were expected to be received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116422872|title = Operation to clean oil-covered birds|last = |first = |date = 1983-08-12|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|newspaper = The Canberra Times|location = Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IOPF/&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
The accident area is both ecologically and economically sensitive, rich in [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. It is also home to a large seabird population. Half of South African lobster and fish landings are caught within this zone, which is also an important nursery area for many fish species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The known environmental consequences of the spill were considered small. About 1,500 gannets that were gathered on a nearby island in preparation for breeding season were oiled. Some seals surfaced during dispersant spraying but are not believed to have been harmed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joyeresearchgroup.uga.edu/public-outreach/marine-oil-spills/other-spills/castillo-de-bellver|title = Castillo de Bellver|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|website = University of Georgia &gt; Joye Research Group &gt; Outreach|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

"Black rain" of oil droplets fell immediately to the east of the spill during the first 24 hours on wheat-growing and sheep-grazing fields, but no long-term damage was recorded.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The impact on local fish stocks was considered minimal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to tests conducted on sediment and water samples and plankton trawls, no abnormal presence of hydrocarbons was detected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <comment>Changed "sum" with "combined effects", because by reading "sum" some actually believe that it means "convection = diffusive transfer + advective transfer", therefore believing that you have convection even if you ONLY have brownian motion (diffusive transfer). If you find a better way to phrase it than mine then it would be great.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37744">[[File:Convection-snapshot.png|thumb|400px|right|This figure shows a calculation for thermal convection in the [[Mantle (geology)|Earth's mantle]]. Colors closer to red are hot areas and colors closer to blue are in warm and cold areas. A hot, less-dense lower boundary layer sends plumes of hot material upwards, and likewise, cold material from the top moves downwards.]]
'''Convection''' is the heat transfer due to bulk movement of [[molecule]]s within [[fluid]]s such as [[gas]]es and [[liquid]]s, including molten rock ([[rheid]]). Convection takes place through [[advection]], [[diffusion]] or both.
[[File:Ghillie Kettle Thermal.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of a newly lit [[Kelly Kettle|Ghillie kettle]]. The plume of hot air resulting from the convection current is visible.]]
Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place. Diffusion of heat takes place in rigid solids, but that is called [[Thermal conduction|heat conduction]]. Convection, however, can take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles can move past each other.

Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (e.g. a [[Bunsen burner]]) at the side of a glass filled with a liquid, and observing the changes in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer fluid circulating into cooler areas.

[[Convective heat transfer]] is one of the major types of [[heat transfer]], and convection is also a major mode of [[mass transfer]] in fluids. Convective heat and mass transfer takes place both by [[diffusion]] – the random [[Brownian motion]] of individual particles in the fluid – and by [[advection]], in which matter or heat is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the context of heat and mass transfer, the term "convection" is used to refer to the combined effects of [[wikt: advective|advective]] and diffusive transfer.&lt;ref name="Interop"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-471-51729-1 }} See Table 1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term "convection" is used to refer specifically to "[[free convection|free heat convection]]" (natural heat convection) which is due to temperature-induced differences in buoyancy, as opposed to "forced heat convection" where forces other than buoyancy (such as pump or fan) move the fluid. However, in mechanics the correct use of the word "convection" is the general sense, and different types of convection should be qualified for clarity.

Convection can be qualified in terms of being natural, forced, gravitational, granular, or [[thermomagnetic convection|thermomagnetic]]. It may also be said to be due to [[combustion]], [[capillary action]], or [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni]] and [[Weissenberg effect]]s. Heat transfer by natural convection plays a role in the structure of [[Earth's atmosphere]], its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be seen as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in [[thunderstorm]]s. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics.

==Terminology==
The word ''convection'' may have slightly different but related usages in different scientific or engineering contexts or applications. The broader sense is in [[fluid mechanics]], where ''convection'' refers to the motion of fluid regardless of cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics| first= Bruce R. |last=Munson |isbn= 0-471-85526-X |publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falkovich|first=G.|title=Fluid Mechanics, a short course for physicists|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-107-00575-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120034443/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|archivedate=2012-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[thermodynamics]] "convection" often refers specifically to heat transfer by convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics:An Engineering Approach|first= Yunus A. |last=Çengel |first2= Michael A. |last2 = Boles |isbn=0-07-121688-X |publisher =[[McGraw-Hill Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, convection includes fluid movement both by bulk motion ([[advection]]) and by the motion of individual particles ([[diffusion]]).  However, in some cases, convection is taken to mean only advective phenomena.  For instance, in the [[generic scalar transport equation|transport equation]], which describes a number of different transport phenomena, terms are separated into "convective" and "diffusive" effects, with "convective" meaning purely advective in context.

==Examples and applications of convection==
Convection occurs on a large scale in [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]]s, oceans, [[planet]]ary [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]s, and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the outermost interiors of our sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a [[hurricane]]. On astronomical scales, convection of gas and dust is thought to occur in the accretion disks of [[black hole]]s, at speeds which may closely approach that of light.

===Heat transfer===
{{Main|Convective heat transfer}}
[[File:Radiator FxJ v2.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A [[heat sink]] provides a large surface area for convection to efficiently carry away heat.]]

'''Convective heat transfer''' is a mechanism of [[heat transfer]] occurring because of bulk motion (observable movement) of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Yunus A. |last=Çengel | date = 2003 | title = Heat transfer-A Practical Approach | edition = 2nd | publisher = McGraw Hill Professional | page = 26 | isbn = 978-0-07-245893-0 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heat]] is the entity of interest being advected (carried), and diffused (dispersed). This can be contrasted with [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer, which is the transfer of energy by vibrations at a molecular level through a solid or fluid, and [[radiative heat transfer]], the transfer of energy through [[electromagnetic waves]].

Heat is transferred by convection in numerous examples of naturally occurring fluid flow, such as wind, oceanic currents, and movements within the Earth's mantle. Convection is also used in engineering practices of homes, industrial processes, cooling of equipment, etc.

The rate of convective heat transfer may be improved by the use of a [[heat sink]], often in conjunction with a fan. For instance, a typical computer [[CPU]] will have a purpose-made [[CPU fan|fan]] to ensure its [[operating temperature]] is kept within tolerable limits.

===Convection cells===
{{main|Convection cell}}
[[File:ConvectionCells.svg|thumb|right|300px|Convection cells in a gravity field]]

A '''convection cell''', also known as a '''[[Bénard cell]]''' is a characteristic fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a cold surface. In liquid, this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself.

===Atmospheric circulation===
{{main|Atmospheric circulation}}
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Idealised depiction of the global circulation on Earth]]

'''Atmospheric circulation''' is the large-scale movement of air, and is a means by which thermal energy is distributed on the surface of the Earth, together with the much slower (lagged) ocean circulation system. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic climatological structure remains fairly constant.

Latitudinal circulation occurs because incident solar radiation per unit area is highest at the [[heat equator]], and decreases as the [[latitude]] increases, reaching minima at the poles. It consists of two primary convection cells, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[polar vortex]], with the [[Hadley cell]] experiencing stronger convection due to the release of [[latent heat]] energy by [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] at higher altitudes during cloud formation.

Longitudinal circulation, on the other hand, comes about because the ocean has a higher specific heat capacity than land (and also thermal conductivity, allowing the heat to penetrate further beneath the surface ) and thereby absorbs and releases more heat, but the temperature changes less than land. This brings the sea breeze, air cooled by the water, ashore in the day, and carries the land breeze, air cooled by contact with the ground, out to sea during the night. Longitudinal circulation consists of two cells, the [[Walker circulation]] and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño / Southern Oscillation]].

===Weather===
{{see also|Cloud|Thunderstorm|Wind}}
[[File:foehn1.svg|right|thumb|300px|How Foehn is produced]]

Some more localized phenomena than global atmospheric movement are also due to convection, including wind and some of the [[hydrologic cycle]]. For example, a [[foehn wind]] is a down-slope wind which occurs on the downwind side of a mountain range. It results from the [[adiabatic]] warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Pidwirny|year=2008|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8e.html|title=CHAPTER 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere (e).

A [[thermal column]] (or thermal) is a vertical section of rising air in the lower altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface from solar radiation. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it. The warmer air expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass, and creating a [[thermal low]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=National Weather Service Forecast Office in [[Tucson, Arizona]]|year=2008|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon_whatis.php|title=What is a monsoon?|publisher=National Weather Service Western Region Headquarters|accessdate=2009-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsAJPPa?url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon_whatis.php|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Douglas G. | last1 = Hahn | author2-link = Syukuro Manabe | first2 = Syukuro | last2 = Manabe |year=1975|bibcode=1975JAtS...32.1515H|title=The Role of Mountains in the South Asian Monsoon Circulation|journal=[[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences]]|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1515–1541|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1975)032&lt;1515:TROMIT&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools by expansion at lower air pressures.

As it travels poleward, warm water transported by strong warm water current undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind driven: wind moving over water cools the water and also causes [[evaporation]], leaving a saltier brine. In this process, the water becomes saltier and denser. and decreases in temperature.  Once sea ice forms, salts are left out of the ice, a process known as brine exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russel |first=Randy |title=Thermohaline Ocean Circulation |url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/thermohaline_ocean_circulation.html |publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research |accessdate=2009-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325062339/http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/thermohaline_ocean_circulation.html |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two processes produce water that is denser and colder.

The Earth's surface is divided into a number of [[tectonic]] plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Creation ([[Accretion (geology)|accretion]]) occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a plate. This hot added material cools down by conduction and convection of heat. At the consumption edges of the plate, the material has thermally contracted to become dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction at an ocean trench. This subducted material sinks to some depth in the Earth's interior where it is prohibited from sinking further. The subducted oceanic crust triggers volcanism.

===Stack effect===
{{Main|Stack effect}}
The '''Stack effect''' or '''chimney effect''' is the movement of air into and out of buildings, chimneys, flue gas stacks, or other containers due to buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. The greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure, the greater the buoyancy force, and thus the stack effect. The stack effect helps drive natural ventilation and infiltration. Some [[cooling tower]]s operate on this principle; similarly the [[solar updraft tower]] is a proposed device to generate electricity based on the stack effect.

The convection zone of a star is the range of radii in which energy is transported primarily by convection.

Granules on the [[photosphere]] of the Sun are the visible tops of convection cells in the photosphere, caused by convection of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the photosphere. The rising part of the granules is located in the center where the plasma is hotter. The outer edge of the granules is darker due to the cooler descending plasma. A typical granule has a diameter on the order of 1,000 kilometers and each lasts 8 to 20 minutes before dissipating. Below the photosphere is a layer of much larger "supergranules" up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter, with lifespans of up to 24 hours.

==Convection mechanisms==
Convection may happen in [[fluids]] at all scales larger than a few atoms. There are a variety of circumstances in which the forces required for natural and forced convection arise, leading to different types of convection, described below. In broad terms, convection arises because of [[body force]]s acting within the fluid, such as gravity.

The causes of convection are generally described as one of either "natural" ("free") or "forced", although other mechanisms also exist (discussed below).  However, the distinction between natural and forced convection is particularly important for [[convective heat transfer]].

===Natural convection===
{{main|Natural convection}}
[[File:Thermal-plume-from-human-hand.jpg|thumb|This color [[schlieren]] image reveals [[thermal convection]] from a human hand (in silhouette) to the surrounding still atmosphere.]]

'''Natural convection''', or '''free convection''', occurs due to temperature differences which affect the density, and thus relative buoyancy, of the fluid. Heavier (denser) components will fall, while lighter (less dense) components rise, leading to bulk fluid movement.  Natural convection can only occur, therefore, in a gravitational field. A common example of natural convection is the rise of smoke from a fire. It can be seen in a pot of boiling water in which the hot and less-dense water on the bottom layer moves upwards in plumes, and the cool and more dense water near the top of the pot likewise sinks.

Natural convection will be more likely and more rapid with a greater variation in density between the two fluids, a larger acceleration due to gravity that drives the convection or a larger distance through the convecting medium. Natural convection will be less likely and less rapid with more rapid diffusion (thereby diffusing away the thermal gradient that is causing the convection) or a more viscous (sticky) fluid.

The onset of natural convection can be determined by the [[Rayleigh number]] ('''Ra''').

Note that differences in buoyancy within a fluid can arise for reasons other than temperature variations, in which case the fluid motion is called '''gravitational convection''' (see below). However, all types of buoyant convection, including natural convection, do not occur in [[microgravity]] environments. All require the presence of an environment which experiences [[g-force]] ([[proper acceleration]]).

===Forced convection===
{{main|Forced convection}}

In '''forced convection''', also called '''heat advection''', fluid movement results from external [[surface forces]] such as a fan or pump. Forced convection is typically used to increase the rate of heat exchange. Many types of [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] also utilize forced convection to distribute one substance within another. Forced convection also occurs as a by-product to other processes, such as the action of a propeller in a fluid or [[aerodynamic heating]]. Fluid radiator systems, and also heating and cooling of parts of the body by blood circulation, are other familiar examples of forced convection.

Forced convection may happen by natural means, such as when the heat of a fire causes expansion of air and bulk air flow by this means. In microgravity, such flow (which happens in all directions) along with diffusion is the only means by which fires are able to draw in fresh oxygen to maintain themselves. The shock wave that transfers heat and mass out of explosions is also a type of forced convection.

Although forced convection from thermal gas expansion in [[zero-g]] does not fuel a fire as well as natural convection in a gravity field, some types of artificial forced convection are far more efficient than free convection, as they are not limited by natural mechanisms. For instance, a [[convection oven]] works by forced convection, as a fan which rapidly circulates hot air forces heat into food faster than would naturally happen due to simple heating without the fan.

===Gravitational or buoyant convection===
'''Gravitational convection''' is a type of natural convection induced by buoyancy variations resulting from material properties other than temperature.  Typically this is caused by a variable composition of the fluid.  If the varying property is a concentration gradient, it is known as '''solutal convection'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.8288 |title=Pattern Formation in Solutal Convection: Vermiculated Rolls and Isolated Cells }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, gravitational convection can be seen in the diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil due to the buoyancy of fresh water in saline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raats|first= P. A. C.  |year=1969 |title=Steady Gravitational Convection Induced by a Line Source of Salt in a Soil|journal = [[Soil Science Society of America]] Proceedings |volume = 33 |pages = 483 | doi=10.2136/sssaj1969.03615995003300040005x |issue=4|bibcode=1969SSASJ..33..483R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variable [[salinity]] in water and variable water content in air masses are frequent causes of convection in the oceans and atmosphere which do not involve heat, or else involve additional compositional density factors other than the density changes from thermal expansion (see ''[[thermohaline circulation]]''). Similarly, variable composition within the Earth's interior which has not yet achieved maximal stability and minimal energy (in other words, with densest parts deepest) continues to cause a fraction of the convection of fluid rock and molten metal within the Earth's interior (see below).

Gravitational convection, like natural thermal convection, also requires a [[g-force]] environment in order to occur.

===Granular convection===
{{main|Granular convection}}

Vibration-induced convection occurs in powders and granulated materials in containers subject to vibration where an axis of vibration is parallel to the force of gravity.  When the container accelerates upward, the bottom of the container pushes the entire contents upward. In contrast, when the container accelerates downward, the sides of the container push the adjacent material downward by friction, but the material more remote from the sides is less affected.  The net result is a slow circulation of particles downward at the sides, and upward in the middle.

If the container contains particles of different sizes, the downward-moving region at the sides is often narrower than the largest particles. Thus, larger particles tend to become sorted to the top of such a mixture.  This is one possible explanation of the [[Brazil nut effect]].

===Solid-state convection in ice===

[[Sputnik Planitia#Convection cells|Ice convection on Pluto]] is believed to occur in a soft mixture of [[nitrogen ice]] and [[carbon monoxide]] ice.  It has also been proposed for [[Europa (moon)|Europa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103506000807 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.03.004 | bibcode=2006Icar..183..435M | volume=183 | title=On convection in ice I shells of outer Solar System bodies, with detailed application to Callisto | year=2006 | journal=Icarus | pages=435–450 | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = William B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other bodies in the outer solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103506000807 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.03.004 | bibcode=2006Icar..183..435M | volume=183 | title=On convection in ice I shells of outer Solar System bodies, with detailed application to Callisto | year=2006 | journal=Icarus | pages=435–450 | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = William B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermomagnetic convection===
{{main|Thermomagnetic convection}}
'''Thermomagnetic convection''' can occur when an external magnetic field is imposed on a [[ferrofluid]] with varying [[magnetic susceptibility]].  In the presence of a temperature gradient this results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to fluid movement. A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a [[magnetic field]].

This form of heat transfer can be useful for cases where conventional convection fails to provide adequate heat transfer, e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.

===Capillary action===
{{main|Capillary action}}

'''Capillary action''' is a phenomenon where liquid spontaneously rises in a narrow space such as a thin tube, or in porous materials. This effect can cause liquids to flow against the force of gravity. It occurs because of inter-molecular attractive forces between the liquid and solid surrounding surfaces; If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension and forces of adhesion between the liquid and container act to lift the liquid.

===Marangoni effect===
{{main|Marangoni effect}}
The '''Marangoni effect''' is the convection of fluid along an interface between dissimilar substances because of variations in surface tension.  Surface tension can vary because of inhomogeneous composition of the substances or the temperature-dependence of surface tension forces. In the latter case the effect is known as '''thermo-capillary convection'''.

A well-known phenomenon exhibiting this type of convection is the "[[tears of wine]]".

===Weissenberg effect===
{{Main|Weissenberg effect}}
{{see also|Reptation}}
The '''Weissenberg effect''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is placed into a solution of liquid [[polymer]]. Entanglements cause the polymer chains to be drawn towards the rod instead of being thrown outward as would happen with an ordinary fluid (i.e., water).{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation does not match with the main article nor the referenced text in the main article|date=July 2017}}

===Combustion===
In a [[zero-gravity]] environment, there can be '''no'''  buoyancy forces, and thus no natural (free) convection possible, so flames in many circumstances without gravity smother in their own waste gases. However, flames may be maintained with any type of forced convection (breeze); or (in high oxygen environments in "still" gas environments) entirely from the minimal forced convection that occurs as heat-induced ''expansion'' (not buoyancy) of gases allows for ventilation of the flame, as waste gases move outward and cool, and fresh high-oxygen gas moves in to take up the low pressure zones created when flame-exhaust water condenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_360.html Does a candle burn in zero-g?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317151841/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_360.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical models of convection==
Mathematically, convection can be described by the [[convection–diffusion equation]], also known as the [[generic scalar transport equation]].

===Quantifying natural versus forced convection===
In cases of mixed convection (natural and forced occurring together) one would often like to know how much of the convection is due to external constraints, such as the fluid velocity in the pump, and how much is due to natural convection occurring in the system.

The relative magnitudes of the [[Grashof number]] and the square of the [[Reynolds number]] determine which form of convection dominates. If &lt;math&gt;\rm Gr/Re^2 \gg 1 &lt;/math&gt;, forced convection may be neglected, whereas if &lt;math&gt;\rm Gr/Re^2 \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, natural convection may be neglected. If the ratio, known as the [[Richardson number#Thermal convection|Richardson number]], is approximately one, then both forced and natural convection need to be taken into account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8808">'''Dihydroxy-''E'',''Z'',''E''-PUFA''' are metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA) that possess two [[hydroxyl]] residues and three in series [[conjugated double bond]]s having the ''E'',''Z'',''E'' [[cis-trans]] configuration. These recently classified metabolites are distinguished from the many other dihydroxy-PUFA with three conjugated double bonds that do not have this critical ''E'',''Z'',''E'' configuration: they inhibit the function of [[platelets]] and therefore may be involved in controlling and prove useful for inhibiting human diseases which involve the pathological activation of these blood-borne elements.

== Biochemistry ==
'''Dihydroxy-''E'',''Z'',''E''-PUFA''' are metabolites of '''a)''' [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA, i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid), '''b)''' [[α-Linolenic acid]] (ALA, i.e. ''9''Z,12''Z'',15''Z''-octadecatrienoic acid), an '''c)''' arachidonic acid (AA); ''E'',''Z'',''E''-DHA and ''E'',''Z'',''E'' AA metabolites are termed poxytrins; ALA metabolites are termed linotrins.&lt;ref name="pmid25223888"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagarde M, Véricel E, Liu M, Chen P, Guichardant M | title = Structure-function relationships of non-cyclic dioxygenase products from polyunsaturated fatty acids: poxytrins as a class of bioactive derivatives | journal = Biochimie | volume = 107 Pt A | issue = | pages = 91–4 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25223888 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2014.09.008 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and perhaps most prominent member of this class of metabolites is protectin DX (PDX; i.e.  10''R'',17''S''-dihydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',11''E'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid). PDX is an [[isomer]] of (and sometimes confused with) [[neuroprotectin D1]] (NPD1; i.e. 10''R'',17''S''-dihydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',11''E'',13''E'',15''Z'',19''Z''-doxahexaenoic acid; also termed protectin D1 [PD1]). NPD1 is structurally identical to PDX except that its three conjugated double bonds have the ''E'',''E'',''Z'' configuration as opposed to the ''E'',''Z'',''E'' configuration of PDX. Both compounds are members of the [[specialized proresolving mediators]] class of PUFA metabolites in that they possess potent anti-inflammatory activity; however, only PDX inhibited human platelet aggregation responses.&lt;ref name="pmid24262603"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balas L, Guichardant M, Durand T, Lagarde M | title = Confusion between protectin D1 (PD1) and its isomer protectin DX (PDX).

== Activity ==
Stimulating agents such as collagen depend to platelets to make and release [[thromboxane A2]] (TXA2) to mediate and/or enhance their aggregating activity. 10''R'',17''S''-diHDHA and to slightly lesser degrees 10''R'',17''S''-diHDHA and PDX inhibit the human platelet aggregation response to collagen at ≥ 100–200 [[nanomolar]] concentrations. This inhibition appeared to reflect the ability of these metabolites to '''a)''' inhibit the activities of [[COX-1]] and [[COX-2]] thereby blocking the production of TXA2 and '''b)''' interfere with the activation of the TXA2 receptor ([[Thromboxane receptor]])  by TXA2.&lt;ref name="pmid25223888" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20833872" /&gt; The linotrins appear to have similar or slightly lower potencies than as well as  to use mechanism similar to the aforementioned metabolites.&lt;ref name="pmid25223888" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23740966" /&gt; These ''E,Z,E'' PUFA are 20- to 100-fold stronger in inhibiting human platelet aggregation than two mono-hydroxyl-containing [[eicosanoid]]s, 5-HETE and 12-HETE, which contain an ''E,Z'' conjugated double bond configuration.&lt;ref name="pmid6405751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Croset M, Lagarde M | title = Stereospecific inhibition of PGH2-induced platelet aggregation by lipoxygenase products of icosaenoic acids | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 878–83 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6405751 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291x(83)91699-6| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EKOenergy''' is an [[ecolabel]] for electricity. It is a not-for-profit initiative of the EKOenergy Network, a group of more than 40 environmental organizations from 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/Documents/Guidance/2016/CDP-technical-note-Accounting-of-Scope-2-Emissions-2016.pdf p.16, Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; EKOenergy started in 2013 in Europe. Its secretariat is based in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268514673_Dark_green_electricity_comes_from_the_sea_Capitalizing_on_ecological_merits_of_offshore_wind_power Hilda Toonen and Han Lindeboom, Dark green electricity comes from the sea, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, (42) 2015., p. 1029, Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, EKOenergy is the only international ecolabel for [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]]. It is available all over Europe and its material is available in more than 30 languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/Documents/Guidance/2016/CDP-technical-note-Accounting-of-Scope-2-Emissions-2016.pdf p.16, Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Every member organization (all [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] organisations) appoints one person to the EKOenergy Board, the Network’s highest governing authority. The Board takes decisions in consultation with the Advisory Group, which consist of experts from different stakeholder groups, including electricity industry, consumers and environmentalists, among others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/Documents/Guidance/2016/CDP-technical-note-Accounting-of-Scope-2-Emissions-2016.pdf p.16, Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criteria of the ecolabel ===
Only electricity from renewable sources can be sold as EKOenergy. But EKOenergy is more than just green electricity. EKOenergy also sets criteria for the following aspects:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aib-net.org/portal/page/portal/AIB_HOME/CERTIFICATION/Types_certificate/ICS_Certificates/EKOEnergy Association of Issuing Bodies. Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consumer information: Consumers get information about where and how the electricity has been produced.
* Sustainability: EKOenergy takes into account the impacts of electricity production on [[ecosystem]] services, [[habitat]]s and the [[biodiversity]] of species. Firstly, it does this by excluding the most environmentally degrading and problematic electricity production methods. Secondly, it finances river restoration through an Environmental Fund. 
* Climate: per every [[MWh]] sold, minimum 10 euro cents will be paid into the EKOenergy Climate Fund.
* Tracking of the electricity: The criteria are based on the European best practice, and on the recommendations of RE-DISS/EPED.
* Auditing and verification: All EKOenergy claims are verified by independent auditors.

== EKOenergy mentioned in other environmental standards ==

=== LEED ===
The European versions of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Standard explicitly recommend the use of EKOenergy labelled electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/education/sessions/green-power-how-buy-renewable-electricity-leed-and-carbon-accounting-9270893 Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings aiming at LEED certification can get extra points if the electricity used in that building is EKOenergy certified. The text “LEED 2009 BD+C Supplemental Reference Guide with Alternative Compliance Paths for Europe”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-2009-bdc-supplemental-reference-guide-alternative-compliance-paths-europe Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; gives EKOenergy the same status as Green-e certified [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|RECs]] in the US. They write: "The EKOenergy electricity certification scheme represents the best available pan-European option for the sustainable and additional consumption of renewable electricity within Europe. EKOenergy certifies renewable electricity that goes beyond the regulations of European directives and national governments of Europe."

=== Greenhouse Gas Protocol ===
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is a worldwide standard for [[carbon accounting]]. It is a joint product of the [[World Resources Institute]] and the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]. In January 2015, the Secretariat of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol published the Scope 2 Guidance, which gave advice about carbon accounting. The Guidance refers to EKOenergy several times. Chapter 11, which encourages companies to go one step further, refers to EKOenergy’s Climate Fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghgprotocol.org/scope_2_guidance Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstclimate.com/green-energy-first-climate-is-licensed-ekoenergy-partner/ Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CDP ===
[[Carbon Disclosure Project|CDP]] works with 5000 of the largest corporations in the world to help them calculate their [[carbon emissions]] and to help them develop effective carbon emission reduction strategies. On page 15 and 16 of its technical notes for accounting of scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions related to the production of purchased electricity), CDP explains how companies can do more. “Ecolabels are a way for companies to do more with their purchases. EKOenergy, mentioned by the GHG protocol Scope 2 guidance, is such an option: it is a mark of quality which comes on top of tracking certificates. Electricity sold with the EKOenergy label fulfills strict environmental criteria and raises funds for new renewable energy projects. Involvement, transparency and ‘deeds not words’ are important principles of EKOenergy’s work.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/Documents/Guidance/2016/CDP-technical-note-Accounting-of-Scope-2-Emissions-2016.pdf p.16, Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eternit''' is a [[registered trademark]] for a brand of [[fibre cement]]. Fibre is often applied in building and construction materials, mainly in [[roofing material|roofing]] and [[facade]] products.

==Material description==
[[File:Eternit Water Tank - September 2010.jpg|thumb|Old eternit water tank]]
The term "cement" originates from the Latin word "''Caementum''", which signifies chopped stone. Cement describes a binding substance, which will react chemically with water and develop into a material hard as stone.
In fibre cement there is a [[reinforced concrete|fibre reinforcement]], which contributes to making the fibre-cement material even stronger and to better withstand [[tensile strength|tension]]. Together with a carefully planned production process, fibre cement makes it possible to develop strong and long-lasting construction materials.&lt;ref name="Eternit"&gt;{{cite web

==Material history==
Fibre-reinforced cement-products were invented in the late 19th century by the Austrian [[Ludwig Hatschek]]. Principally he mixed 90% [[cement]] and 10% [[asbestos]] fibres with water and ran it through a [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] machine. Originally, the fibres were of asbestos and the material was commonly used as [[siding]] in house buildings due to its low cost, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], water tightness, light weight, and other useful properties. Asbestos is harmful to [[health]] and produces [[lung cancer]]s years after professional or occasional exposure ([[asbestosis]]). Starting from the seventies, asbestos use became progressively prohibited; however, in several countries, it is still used for building materials. Safer [[fibre]] alternatives, based on e.g. [[cellulose fiber]]s were developed in the eighties and applied to secure the widely known strength of fibre cement.

Fibre cement were probably amongst the latest materials on the market to have contained large quantities of asbestos. The reason is that the asbestos fibres are intimately bound to the cement matrix and were first considered to be well immobilized in the cement and less prone to be released in the environment, [[aerosol|suspended]] in the air, and [[inhalation|inhaled]] in the [[lung]] than in other materials or applications such as [[thermal insulation]] or [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] in which bare asbestos fibres were used. However, asbestos fibres are inevitably released during [[machining]] operations of the objects made of fibre-cement and by long-term erosion of the materials exposed to atmospheric [[weathering]] and [[wind]] when cement [[concrete degradation|degrades]]. [[Occupational health]] concerns and the protection of workers in the fibre-cement [[factory|factories]] have finally led to the progressive elimination of asbestos from these products.&lt;ref name="Eternit" /&gt; For health reasons, it is recommended that existing fibre-cement products that are in good condition are left undisturbed and possibly encapsulated, to prevent fibre release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byggahus.se/renovera/eternit-byta-ut-eller-bevara Bygga hus: Eternit - byta ut eller bevara]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material usage==
Fibre cement is a main component of long-lasting [[building material]]s. The main application areas are [[roofing material|roofing]] and [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]]. The list below gives some common applications. 

'''Internal cladding:'''
* Wet room applications – [[tile]] [[backer board (construction)|backer board]]s
* [[Fire protection]]
* [[Partition wall]]s
* [[Window sill]]s
* [[Ceiling]]s and [[floor]]s

'''External cladding:'''
* Flat sheets as base and/or architectural facing
* Flat sheets for e.g. wind shields, wall copings, and soffits
* [[wikt:corrugated|Corrugated]] sheets
* Slates as architectural full and partial facing
* Underroof
* [[Plank (wood)|Plank]]s

'''Roofing:'''
* [[Slate]]s
* Corrugated sheets

Fibre-cement products have found a wide usage in various sectors of construction: industrial, agricultural, domestic and residential buildings, mainly in roofing and cladding applications, for new constructions and [[Antiques restoration|refurbishment]] projects.

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''exergy''' of a [[System (thermodynamics)|system]] is the maximum useful [[Mechanical work|work]] possible during a [[Thermodynamic process|process]] that brings the system into [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with a [[heat reservoir]].{{ref|perrot}} When the [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]] are the reservoir, exergy is the potential of a system to cause a change as it achieves equilibrium with its environment.  Exergy is the [[energy]] that is available to be used. After the system and surroundings reach equilibrium, the exergy is zero.  Determining exergy was also the first goal of [[thermodynamics]]. The term "exergy" was coined in 1956 by [[Zoran Rant]] (1904–1972) by using the Greek ''[[wikt:ἐξ|ex]]'' and ''[[wikt:ἔργον|ergon]]'' meaning "from [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rant | first1 = Zoran | doi =  | title = Exergie, Ein neues Wort für "technische Arbeitsfähigkeit" | journal = Forschung auf dem Gebiete des Ingenieurwesens | volume = 22| pages = 36–37 | year = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|rant56|3|a}}, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]] in 1873.{{ref label|gibbs1873|4}}

Energy is neither created nor destroyed during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (''see [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]''). In contrast, exergy is always destroyed when a process is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]], for example loss of heat to the environment (''see [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]''). This destruction is proportional to the [[entropy]] increase of the system together with its surroundings. The destroyed exergy has been called anergy.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a system and its environment because it depends on the state of both the system and environment.  The exergy of a system in equilibrium with the environment is zero. Exergy is neither a [[List of thermodynamic properties|thermodynamic property]] of matter nor a [[thermodynamic potential]] of a system.  Exergy and energy both have units of [[joule]]s. The [[internal energy]] of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a  [[state function]].  Some authors define the exergy of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function.  Other writers prefer{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} a slightly alternate definition of the available energy or exergy of a system where the environment is firmly defined,  as an unchangeable absolute reference state, and in this alternate definition exergy becomes a property of the state of the system alone.

However, from a theoretical point of view, exergy may be defined without reference to any environment. If the intensive properties of different finitely extended elements of a system differ, there is always the possibility to extract mechanical work from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C. (Eds) |url= |title=Energy and time in the economic and physical sciences |publisher=North-Holland |year=1985 |pages=41–56 |quote= |isbn=0444877487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grubbström | first1 = Robert W. | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2007.01.003 | title = An Attempt to Introduce Dynamics Into Generalised Exergy Considerations| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 84| pages = 701–718 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term exergy is also used, by analogy with its physical definition, in [[information theory]] related to [[reversible computing]].  Exergy is also synonymous with: ''availability'', ''available energy'', ''exergic energy'', ''essergy'' (considered archaic), ''utilizable energy'', ''available useful work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work content'', ''[[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] work'', and ''ideal work''.

The exergy destruction of a cycle is the sum of the exergy destruction of the processes that compose that cycle. The exergy destruction of a cycle can also be determined without tracing the individual processed by considering the entire cycle as a single process and using one of the exergy destruction equations.

==Mathematical description==

===An application of the second law of thermodynamics===
{{See also|Second law of thermodynamics}}

Exergy uses [[System (thermodynamics)|system boundaries]] in a way that is unfamiliar to many. We imagine the presence of a [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]] between the system and its reference environment even though this engine does not exist in the real world.  Its only purpose is to measure the results of a "what-if" scenario to represent the most efficient work interaction possible between the system and its surroundings.

If a real-world reference environment is chosen that behaves like an unlimited reservoir that remains unaltered by the system, then Carnot's speculation about the consequences of a system heading towards equilibrium with time is addressed by two equivalent mathematical statements. Let ''B'', the exergy or available work, decrease with time, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;, the entropy of the system and its reference environment enclosed together in a larger [[isolated system]], increase with time:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} \le 0 \mbox{ is equivalent to } \frac {\mathrm{d}S_{total}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ge 0 \qquad \mbox{(1)} &lt;/math&gt;

For macroscopic systems (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]), these statements are both expressions of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] if the following expression is used for exergy:

:&lt;math&gt; B=U +P_RV -T_RS-\sum_i\mu_{i,R}N_i \qquad \mbox{(2)} &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Extensive quantity|extensive quantities]] for the system are: ''U'' = [[Internal energy]], ''V'' = [[Volume]], and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Mole (unit)|Moles]] of component ''i''

The [[Intensive quantity|intensive quantities]] for the surroundings are: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Pressure]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = [[temperature]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i, R
&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Chemical potential]] of component ''i''

Individual terms also often have names attached to them: &lt;math&gt;P_RV&lt;/math&gt; is called "available PV work", &lt;math&gt;T_RS&lt;/math&gt; is called "entropic loss" or "heat loss" and the final term is called "available chemical energy."

Other [[thermodynamic potential]]s may be used to replace internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001){{ref|alberty01}}. Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.

An alternative definition of internal energy does not separate available chemical potential from ''U''. This expression is useful (when substituted into equation (1)) for processes where system volume and entropy change, but no chemical reaction occurs:

:&lt;math&gt; B=U[\mu_1, \mu_2, ... \mu_n] +P_RV -T_RS=U[\boldsymbol{\mu}] +P_RV -T_RS \qquad \mbox{(3)} &lt;/math&gt;

In this case a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this thermodynamic potential. A [[phase (matter)|multi-state]] system may complicate or simplify the problem because the [[Gibbs phase rule]] predicts that intensive quantities will no longer be completely independent from each other.

===A historical and cultural tangent===
In 1848, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], asked (and immediately answered) the question

:Is there any principle on which an absolute thermometric scale can be founded? It appears to me that Carnot’s theory of the motive power of heat enables us to give an affirmative answer.{{ref|kelvin1848}}

With the benefit of the hindsight contained in equation (3), we are able to understand the historical impact of Kelvin's idea on physics.  Kelvin suggested that the best temperature scale would describe a constant ability for a unit of temperature in the surroundings to alter the available work from Carnot's engine. From equation (3):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}T_R}=-S \qquad \mbox{(4)} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Rudolf Clausius]] recognized the presence of a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant in Kelvin's analysis and gave it the name [[entropy]] in 1865 from the Greek for "transformation" because it describes the quantity of energy lost during transformation from heat to work.  The available work from a Carnot engine is at its maximum when the surroundings are at a temperature of [[absolute zero]].

Physicists then, as now, often look at a property with the word "available" or "utilizable" in its name with a certain unease.  The idea of what is available raises the question of "available to what?" and raises a concern about whether such a property is [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. Laws derived using such a property may not describe the universe but instead describe what people wish to see.

The field of [[statistical mechanics]] (beginning with the work of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in developing the [[Boltzmann equation]]) relieved many physicists of this concern.  From this discipline, we now know that macroscopic properties may all be determined from properties on a microscopic scale where entropy is more "real" than temperature itself (''see [[Thermodynamic temperature]]''). Microscopic kinetic fluctuations among particles cause entropic loss, and this energy is unavailable for work because these fluctuations occur randomly in all directions.  The anthropocentric act is taken, in the eyes of some physicists and engineers today, when someone draws a hypothetical boundary, in fact he says: "This is my system. What occurs beyond it is surroundings." In this context, exergy is sometimes described as an anthropocentric property, both by those who use it and those who don't.  Entropy is viewed as a more fundamental property of matter.

In the field of [[ecology]], the interactions among systems (mostly [[ecosystem]]s) and their manipulation of exergy resources is of primary concern.  With this perspective, the answer of "available to what?" is simply: "available to the system", because ecosystems appear to exist in the real world.  With the viewpoint of [[systems ecology]], a property of matter like absolute entropy is seen as anthropocentric because it is defined relative to an unobtainable hypothetical reference system in isolation at absolute zero temperature. With this emphasis on systems rather than matter, exergy is viewed as a more fundamental property of a system, and it is entropy that may be viewed as a co-property of a system with an idealized reference system.

===A potential for every thermodynamic situation===
In addition to &lt;math&gt;U\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; U[\boldsymbol{\mu}]&lt;/math&gt;, the other [[thermodynamic potential]]s are frequently used to determine exergy.  For a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and pressure, [[enthalpy]] ''H'' is used in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; B=H-T_RS \qquad \mbox{(5)} &lt;/math&gt;

For a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and volume, [[Helmholtz free energy]] ''A'' is used in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; B=A+P_RV \qquad \mbox{(6)} &lt;/math&gt;

For a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and pressure, [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' is used in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; B=G \qquad \mbox{(7)} &lt;/math&gt;

The potentials ''A'' and ''G'' are utilized for a constant temperature process.  In these cases, all energy is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free to perform useful work]] because there is no entropic loss.  A chemical reaction that generates electricity with no associated change in temperature will also experience no entropic loss. (''See [[Fuel cell]].'')  This is true of every isothermal process. Examples are [[gravitational potential energy]], [[kinetic energy]] (on a macroscopic scale), [[solar energy]], [[electrical energy]], and many others. If [[friction]], [[absorption (optics)|absorption]], [[electrical resistance]] or a similar energy conversion takes place that releases heat, the impact of that heat on thermodynamic potentials must be considered, and it is this impact that decreases the available energy.

===Chemical exergy===
Similar to thermomechanical exergy, chemical exergy depends on the temperature and pressure of a system as well as on the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical exergy versus thermomechanical exergy is that thermomechanical exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have exergy.&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Michael

|isbn=978-0-470-49590-2|pages=816–817|edition=7th}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of chemical exergy resembles the standard definition of thermomechanical exergy, but with a few differences. Chemical exergy is defined as the maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Szargut|first=Jan|title=Towards an International Reference Environment of Chemical Exergy|url=http://www.exergoecology.com/papers/towards_int_re.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Defining the exergy reference environment is one of the most vital parts of analyzing chemical exergy. In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=75.67%, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=20.35%, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g)=3.12%, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.03% and other gases=0.83%.&lt;ref name="moran" /&gt; These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.

C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the substance that is entering a system that one wants to find the maximum theoretical work of. By using the following equations, one can calculate the chemical exergy of the substance in a given system. Below, Equation 8 uses the Gibbs function of the applicable element or compound to calculate the chemical exergy. Equation 9 is similar but uses standard molar chemical exergy, which scientists have  determined based on several criteria, including the ambient temperature and pressure that a system is being analyzed and the concentration of the most common components.&lt;ref&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;\bar{e}_{x}^{ch}=\,&lt;/math&gt; The standard molar chemical exergy taken from a table
for the specific conditions that the system is being evaluated

Equation 9 is more commonly used due to the simplicity of only having to look up the standard chemical exergy for given substances. Using a standard table works well for most cases, even if the environment conditions vary slightly, the difference is most likely negligible.

====Total exergy====
After finding the chemical exergy in a given system, one can find the total exergy by adding it to the thermomechanical exergy. Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical exergy added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical exergy is very large and necessary to find the total exergy of the system.

===Irreversibility===
Irreversibility accounts for the amount of exergy destroyed in a closed system, or in other words, the wasted work potential. For highly efficient systems, the value of I, is low, and vice versa. The equation to calculate the Irreversibility of as closed system, as it relates to the exergy of that system, is as follows:&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;
{{cite web|title=Exergy (Availability) – Part a (updated 3/24/12)|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/Applied/Chapt.7_11/Chapter7a.html|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I = T_0s_{gen} \qquad \mbox{(10)} &lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt; s_{gen} &lt;/math&gt; is the entropy generated by the system processes.

If &lt;math&gt;I &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then there are irreversibilities present in the system.
If &lt;math&gt;I = 0&lt;/math&gt; then there are no irreversibilities present in the system.

The value of I, the irreversibility, can not be negative, as it is not a property. On the contrary, the availability is a different story, which is a property of the system.

Exergy analysis is based on the relation between the actual work and the maximal work, that could be obtained in the reversible process:

:&lt;math&gt; w_{act} = w_{max} - I \qquad \mbox{(11)} &lt;/math&gt;

The first term at the right part is related with the difference in exergy at inlet and outlet of the system:&lt;ref name="ohio" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w_{max} = \Delta B = B_{in} - B_{out} \qquad \mbox{(12)} &lt;/math&gt;

For an Isolated System:

No heat or work interactions with the surroundings occur, and therefore, there are no transfers of availability between the system and its surroundings. The change in exergy of an isolated system is equivalent, but opposite the value for irreversibility of that system.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta B = -I \qquad \mbox{(13)} &lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
Applying equation (1) to a subsystem yields:

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{If } \frac {\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{cases} &gt;0, &amp; \frac {\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mbox{ maximum power generated} \\ &lt;0, &amp; \frac {\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mbox{ minimum power required} \end{cases} \qquad \mbox{(14)} &lt;/math&gt;

This expression applies equally well for theoretical ideals in a wide variety of applications: [[electrolysis]] (decrease in ''G''), [[galvanic cell]]s and [[fuel cell]]s (increase in ''G''), [[explosives]] (increase in ''A''), [[HVAC|heating and refrigeration]] (exchange of ''H''), [[heat engine|motors]] (decrease in ''U'') and [[electrical generator|generators]] (increase in ''U'').

Utilization of the exergy concept often requires careful consideration of the choice of reference environment because, as Carnot knew, unlimited reservoirs do not exist in the real world.  A system may be maintained at a constant temperature to simulate an unlimited reservoir in the lab or in a factory, but those systems cannot then be isolated from a larger surrounding environment. However, with a proper choice of system boundaries, a reasonable constant reservoir can be imagined. A process sometimes must be compared to "the most realistic impossibility," and this invariably involves a certain amount of guesswork.

===Engineering applications===
Application of exergy to [[unit operation]]s in [[chemical plant]]s was partially responsible for the huge growth of the [[chemical industry]] during the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  During this time it was usually called ''availability'' or ''available work''.

As a simple example of exergy, air at atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, ''and composition'' contains energy but no exergy when it is chosen as the thermodynamic reference state known as [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient]]. Individual processes on Earth such as combustion in a power plant often eventually result in products that are incorporated into the atmosphere, so defining this reference state for exergy is useful even though the atmosphere itself is not at equilibrium and is full of long and short term variations.

If standard ambient conditions are used for calculations during chemical plant operation when the actual weather is very cold or hot, then certain parts of a chemical plant might seem to have an exergy efficiency of greater than 100% and without taking into account the non-standard atmospheric temperature variation can give an impression of being a perpetual motion machine.  Using actual conditions will give actual values, but standard ambient conditions are useful for initial design calculations.

One goal of energy and exergy methods in engineering is to compute what comes into and out of several possible designs before a factory is built. Energy input and output will always balance according to the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] or the energy conservation principle. Exergy output will not balance the exergy input for real processes since a part of the exergy input is always destroyed according to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] for real processes. After the input and output are completed, the engineer will often want to select the most efficient process. An [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] or ''first law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting as little energy as possible relative to energy inputs.  An [[exergy efficiency]] or ''second-law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting ''and destroying'' as little available work as possible from a given input of available work.

===Applications in natural resource utilization===
In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of [[industrial ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].  Defining where one field ends and the next begins is a matter of semantics, but applications of exergy can be placed into rigid categories.

Researchers in ecological economics and [[environmental accounting]] perform exergy-cost analyses in order to evaluate the impact of human activity on the current [[natural environment]].  As with ambient air, this often requires the unrealistic substitution of properties from a natural environment in place of the [[Heat reservoir|reference state]] [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|environment]] of Carnot.  For example, ecologists and others have developed reference conditions for the [[ocean]] and for the [[Earth's crust]].  Exergy values for human activity using this information can be useful for comparing policy alternatives based on the efficiency of utilizing [[natural resources]] to perform work. Typical questions that may be answered are:

:Does the human production of one unit of an [[economic good]] by method ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than by method ''B''?

:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than the production of good ''B''?

:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize a resource's exergy more efficiently than the production of good ''B''?

There has been some progress in standardizing and applying these methods.

Measuring exergy requires the evaluation of a system’s reference state environment.&lt;ref name="exergoecology"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system requires the assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, it is becoming increasingly imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources,&lt;ref name="gcep.stanford"&gt;

Referencing the inherent qualities of a system in place of a reference state environment&lt;ref name="exergoecology" /&gt; is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a system, and the reference substances&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;

There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the [[atmosphere]], solids within the Earth’s crust, and [[molecules]] or [[ions]] in seawater.&lt;ref name="exergoecology" /&gt; By understanding these basic models, it’s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of [[solar radiation]] on plant life.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.

Other qualities within a reference state environment include temperature, pressure, and any number of combinations of substances within a defined area.&lt;ref name="exergoecology" /&gt; Again, the exergy of a system is determined by the potential of that system to do work, so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the exergy of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.&lt;ref name="exergoecology" /&gt;

Today, it is becoming increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage.&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the ramifications of these practices, exergy is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of [[exhaust gas|emissions]], [[fuels]], and other sources of energy.&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt; [[Combustion]] of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing the environmental impacts of burning [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]]. The current methods for analyzing the [[exhaust gas|emissions]] from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="gcep.stanford" /&gt; In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.

===Applications in sustainability===
In [[systems ecology]], researchers sometimes consider the exergy of the current formation of natural resources from a small number of exergy inputs (usually [[solar radiation]], [[tidal force]]s, and [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal heat]]).  This application not only requires assumptions about reference states, but it also requires assumptions about the real environments of the past that might have been close to those reference states.  Can we decide which is the most "realistic impossibility" over such a long period of time when we are only speculating about the reality?

For instance, comparing oil exergy to coal exergy using a common reference state would require geothermal exergy inputs to describe the transition from biological material to fossil fuels during millions of years in the Earth's crust, and solar radiation exergy inputs to describe the material's history before then when it was part of the biosphere.  This would need to be carried out mathematically backwards through time, to a presumed era when the oil and coal could be assumed to be receiving the same exergy inputs from these sources.  A speculation about a past environment is different from assigning a reference state with respect to known environments today. Reasonable guesses about real ancient environments may be made, but they are untestable guesses, and so some regard this application as [[pseudoscience]] or pseudo-engineering.

The field describes this accumulated exergy in a natural resource over time as [[embodied energy]] with units of the "embodied joule" or "emjoule".

The important application of this research is to address [[sustainability]] issues in a quantitative fashion through a [[sustainability measurement]]:

:Does the human production of an economic good deplete the exergy of Earth's [[natural resources]] more quickly than those resources are able to receive exergy?

:If so, how does this compare to the depletion caused by producing the same good (or a different one) using a different set of natural resources?

===Assigning one thermodynamically obtained value to an economic good===
A technique proposed by systems ecologists is to consolidate the three exergy inputs described in the last section into the single exergy input of solar radiation, and to express the total input of exergy into an economic good as a ''solar embodied joule'' or ''sej''. (''See [[Emergy]]'') Exergy inputs from solar, tidal, and geothermal forces all at one time had their origins at the beginning of the solar system under conditions which could be chosen as an initial reference state, and other speculative reference states could in theory be traced back to that time. With this tool we would be able to answer:

:What fraction of the total human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?

:What fraction of the total human and non-human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?

No additional thermodynamic laws are required for this idea, and the principles of [[energetics]] may confuse many issues for those outside the field.  The combination of untestable hypotheses, unfamiliar jargon that contradicts accepted jargon, intense advocacy among its supporters, and some degree of isolation from other disciplines have contributed to this [[protoscience]] being regarded by many as a [[pseudoscience]].  However, its basic tenets are only a further utilization of the exergy concept.

===Implications in the development of complex physical systems===
A common hypothesis in systems ecology is that the design engineer's observation that a greater capital investment is needed to create a process with increased exergy efficiency is actually the economic result of a fundamental law of nature.  By this view, exergy is the analogue of economic currency in the natural world. The analogy to capital investment is the accumulation of exergy into a system over long periods of time resulting in [[embodied energy]].  The analogy of capital investment resulting in a factory with high exergy efficiency is an increase in natural organizational structures with high exergy efficiency.  (''See [[Maximum power theorem|Maximum power]]'').  Researchers in these fields describe biological [[evolution]] in terms of increases in organism complexity due to the requirement for increased exergy efficiency because of competition for limited sources of exergy.

Some biologists have a similar hypothesis.  A biological system (or a chemical plant) with a number of intermediate compartments and intermediate reactions is more efficient because the process is divided up into many small substeps, and this is closer to the [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible ideal]] of an infinite number of [[infinitesimal]] substeps.  Of course, an excessively large number of intermediate compartments comes at a capital cost that may be too high.

Testing this idea in living organisms or ecosystems is impossible for all practical purposes because of the large time scales and small exergy inputs involved for changes to take place. However, if this idea is correct, it would not be a new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their exergy efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.

===Philosophical and cosmological implications===
Some proponents of utilizing exergy concepts describe them as a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] or [[ecocentric]] alternative for terms like quality and [[Value theory|value]]. The "[[deep ecology]]" movement views [[economic]] usage of these terms as an [[anthropocentric]] [[philosophy]] which should be discarded.  A possible universal thermodynamic concept of value or utility appeals to those with an interest in [[monism]].

For some, the end result of this line of thinking about tracking exergy into the deep past is a restatement of the [[cosmological argument]] that the universe was once at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and an input of exergy from some [[First Cause]] created a universe full of available work.  Current science is unable to describe the first 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds of the universe (''See [[Timeline of the Big Bang]]'').  An external reference state is not able to be defined for such an event, and (regardless of its merits), such an argument may be better expressed in terms of [[entropy]].

==Quality of energy types==
The ratio of exergy to energy in a substance can be considered a measure of [[energy quality]].  Forms of energy such as macroscopic kinetic energy, electrical energy, and chemical [[Gibbs free energy]] are 100% recoverable as work, and therefore have an exergy equal to their energy.  However, forms of energy such as radiation and thermal energy can not be converted completely to work, and have exergy content less than their energy content.  The exact proportion of exergy in a substance depends on the amount of entropy relative to the surrounding environment as determined by the [[Thermodynamics|Second Law of Thermodynamics]].

Exergy is useful when measuring the efficiency of an energy conversion process.  The exergetic, or 2nd&amp;nbsp;Law, efficiency is a ratio of the exergy output divided by the exergy input.  This formulation takes into account the quality of the energy, often offering a more accurate and useful analysis than efficiency estimates only using the [[Thermodynamics|First Law of Thermodynamics]].

Work can be extracted also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When the flow of energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment of the notion of energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, [[Energy]] is a measure of the ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the [[entropy|second principle of energy flow transformations]] says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.

===Exergy of heat available at a temperature===
&lt;!--(some of this will be moved up to mathematics section)--&gt;
Maximal possible conversion of heat to work, or exergy content of heat, depends on the [[temperature]] at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is the temperature of the surrounding. The upper limit for conversion is known as [[Carnot efficiency]] and was discovered by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] in 1824. See also [[Carnot heat engine]].

Carnot efficiency is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} \qquad \mbox{(15)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; is the higher temperature and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; is the lower temperature, both as [[absolute temperature]]. From Equation 15 it is clear that in order to maximize efficiency one should maximize ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; and minimize ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Exergy exchanged is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\ B = Q(1 - \frac{T_o}{T_ {source}}) \qquad \mbox{(16)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''source''&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the heat source, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the surrounding.
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|350px|Higher exergy content tends to mean higher energy prices. Here the costs of heating (vertical axis) are compared with the exergy content of different energy carriers (horizontal axis) in Finland. Energy carriers included are district heating (D), ground-source heat pump (G), exhaust air heat pump (A), bioenergy meaning firewood (B), heating oil (O) and direct electric heating (E). Red dots and trend line indicates energy prices for consumers, blue dots and trend line indicates total price for consumers including capital expenditure for the heating system.&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt;]]

=== Connection with economic value ===

Exergy in a sense can be understood as a measure of value of energy. Since high-exergy energy carriers can be used in for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in prices of energy carriers, i.e. high-exergy energy carriers such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to substitution of more valuable high-exergy energy carriers with low-exergy energy carriers, when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.&lt;ref name="Muller"&gt;A. Müller, L. Kranzl, P. Tuominen, E. Boelman, M. Molinari, A.G.

concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported
and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology relates specifically to transport system and allows an effective coupling with [[life cycle assessment]].

==History==

===Carnot===
In 1824, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] studied the improvements developed for [[steam engines]] by [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] and others. Carnot utilized a purely theoretical perspective for these engines and developed new ideas. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam engines have an assignable limit—a limit by which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever... In order to consider in the most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat, it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent. It is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam-engines but to all imaginable heat-engines... The production of motion in steam-engines is always accompanied by a circumstance on which we should fix our attention.  This circumstance is the re-establishing of equilibrium… Imagine two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs...{{ref|carnot1824}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carnot next described what is now called the [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]], and proved by a [[thought experiment]] that any heat engine performing better than this engine would be a [[perpetual motion]] machine. Even in the 1820s, there was a long history of science forbidding such devices.  According to Carnot, "Such a creation is entirely contrary to ideas now accepted, to the [[Classical mechanics|laws of mechanics]] and of sound [[physics]]. It is inadmissible."{{ref label|carnot1824|4|a}}

This description of an upper bound to the work that may be done by an engine was the earliest modern formulation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Because it involves no mathematics, it still often serves as the entry point for a modern understanding of both the second law and [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on [[heat engine]]s, [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], and [[heat reservoir]]s is also the best entry point for understanding the closely related concept of exergy.

Carnot believed in the incorrect [[caloric theory]] of heat that was popular during his time, but his thought experiment nevertheless described a fundamental limit of nature. As [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] replaced caloric theory through the early and mid-19th century (''see [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]''), several scientists added mathematical precision to the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]] and developed the concept of [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on processes at the human scale (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]) led to the most universally applicable concepts in [[physics]].  Entropy and the second-law are applied today in fields ranging from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[physical cosmology]].

===Gibbs===
In the 1870s, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] unified a large quantity of 19th century [[thermochemistry]] into one compact theory.  Gibbs's theory incorporated the new concept of a [[chemical potential]] to cause change when distant from a [[chemical equilibrium]] into the older work begun by Carnot in describing thermal and [[mechanical equilibrium]] and their potentials for change.  Gibbs's unifying theory resulted in the [[thermodynamic potential]] [[state function]]s describing differences from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].

In 1873, Gibbs derived the mathematics of "available energy of the body and medium" into the form it has today.{{ref label|gibbs1873|3|a}} (See the equations [[Exergy#Important equations|above]]).  The physics describing exergy has changed little since that time.

'''FCC Environment (UK) Limited''' is a [[waste management]] company headquartered in [[Northampton]], United Kingdom and a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas]]. It was formed in May 2012 through the merger and rebranding of '''Focsa Services''' and '''Waste Recycling Group'''.

==History==
Waste Recycling Group acquired Hanson Waste Management from Hanson plc for £185 million in cash in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/general/waste-recycling-group-buys-hanson-waste-management-for-ps185m|title=Waste Recycling Group buys Hanson Waste Management for £185m|accessdate=16 October 2012|publisher=letsrecycle.com|date=22 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4476351/Hanson-sells-waste-arm-for-185m.html|title=Hanson sells waste arm for £185m|accessdate=16 October 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torpedo car refractory bricks.JPG|thumb|Refractory bricks in a [[torpedo wagon|torpedo car]] used for hauling molten iron]]
A '''fire brick''', '''firebrick''', or '''[[Refractory|refractory brick]]''' is a block of [[Refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] [[ceramic]] material used in lining [[furnace]]s, [[kiln]]s, [[firebox (steam engine)|fireboxes]], and [[fireplace]]s.  A refractory [[brick]] is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low [[thermal conductivity]] for greater [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as the inside of a wood-fired kiln or a furnace, which is subject to abrasion from [[wood]], fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures. In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or [[natural gas]] fired [[kiln]], more porous bricks, commonly known as "kiln bricks" are a better choice.&lt;ref name=tradoven&gt;{{citation
 |url= http://www.traditionaloven.com/articles/81/insulating-fire-bricks |title= Insulating fire bricks |accessdate= 2016-08-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are weaker, but they are much lighter, easier to form, and [[thermal insulation|insulate]] far better than dense bricks. In any case, firebricks should not [[spall]], and their strength should hold up well during rapid temperature changes.

==Manufacture==
In the making of firebrick, [[fireclay]] is fired in the kiln until it is partly [[Glass transition|vitrified]], and for special purposes may also be glazed. There are two standard sizes of fire-brick; one is 9×4½×3 inches (229×114×76 mm) and the other is 9×4½×2½ inches (229×114×64 mm).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Also available are firebrick “splits” which are half the thickness and are often used to line wood stoves and fireplace inserts.  The dimensions of a split are usually 9×4½×1¼ inches (229×114×32 mm).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Fire brick was first invented in 1822 by [[William Weston Young]] in the [[Neath Valley]] of [[Wales]].

==Composition==
{{Main|Fire Clay}}
Fire bricks have an [[aluminium oxide]] content that can be as high as 50–80% (with correspondingly less silica).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vitcas.com/refractory-bricks Refractory bricks&lt;/ref&gt;

==High temperature applications==
The [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] firebricks that line [[steel]]-making [[furnace]]s are used at temperatures up to 1648°C (3000°F), which would melt many other types of ceramic, and in fact part of the silica firebrick liquefies.{{citation-needed|date=July 2016}} [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#High-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI)|High-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI)]], a material with the same composition, was used in the insulating tiles of the [[space shuttle|Space Shuttle]].{{citation-needed|date=July 2016}}

Non-ferrous metallurgical processes use [[Refractory#Basic refractories|''basic'' refractory bricks]] because the slags used in these processes readily dissolve the “acidic” silica bricks.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Refractory Practice, Fifth Edition'' (Harbison–Walker Refractories: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1992), Page CR-2&lt;/ref&gt; The most common basic refractory bricks used in smelting non-ferrous metal concentrates are “chrome-magnesite” or “magnesite-chrome” bricks (depending on the relative ratios of [[magnesite]] and [[chromite]] ores used in their manufacture).&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Refractory Practice, Fifth Edition'' (Harbison–Walker Refractories: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1992), Page CR-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lower temperature applications==
A range of other materials find use as firebricks for lower [[temperature]] applications. [[Magnesium oxide]] is often used as a lining for [[furnace]]s.  Silica bricks are the most common type of bricks used for the inner lining of furnaces and [[incinerator]]s. As the inner lining is usually of sacrificial nature, fire bricks of higher alumina content may be employed to lengthen the duration between re-linings. Very often cracks can be seen in this sacrificial inner lining shortly after being put into operation. They revealed more expansion joints should have been put in the first place, but these now become expansion joints themselves and are of no concern as long as structural integrity is not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Die Deutsche Bibliothek|title=Refractory Engineering|year=2004|isbn=3-8027-3155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon carbide, with high abrasive strength, is a popular material for hearths of [[incinerator]]s and cremators. Common red clay brick are used for chimneys and wood-fired ovens.

== History ==
In 1910 [[Gustav Otto]] (son of the inventor of the gasoline engines) founded [[Otto-Flugzeugwerke]] (Gustav Otto Aircraft Machine Works) based in Munich, Germany. On March 7, 1916, this company was registered as the Bayrische Flugzeugwerke (Bavarian Aircraft Works), the precursor to Bayrische Motorenwerke ([[BMW|Bayerischen Motorenwerke]]“ or "BMW"). In 1918  Otto opened a new factory in Munich, and began in 1920 to produce motorized bicycles, which were given the brand name "Flottweg" as the German words "flott" means "quick" and "weg" means "away".  In 1932' Dr. Georg Bruckmayer acquired the Flottweg name and founded the engine factory "Flottweg-Motoren-Werke". In 1933, the company began manufacturing and distributing motorcycles and aircraft engines in Munich.

In 1943 World War II forced Flottweg to move to Vilsbiburg. In 1946, the company began to manufacture specialized equipment for the printing industry (until 1984).

In 1953 Flottweg expanded its into a business sector: the production of liquid-solid separation machines. The first product was the Flottweg Decanter, a solid bowl decanter centrifuge; the first model, DECANTER Z1, was sold to [[BASF]]. Further development lead to a higher speed and more efficient decanter in 1964. In 1966 an adjustable impeller for decanter was added, which allowed the operator to optimise the pond depth while the decanter was operating;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Process Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0FWAAAAYAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Morgan-Grampian (Publishers) Limited|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was useful in the [[Olive oil extraction|extraction of olive oil]]. After further development, Flottweg sold a 3-phase decanter for olive oil in Spain in 1971. In 1977 Flottweg began to manufacture [[belt filter]] presses.

By 1988 Krauss-Maffei, Munich, was the main shareholder, owning 90% of Flottweg. In 1989, under license agreement, the Krauss-Maffei product line of decanter centrifuges was procured by Flottweg. In the same year, Flottweg opened new sales and service offices in France and Russia, and in the next few years sales and service centers in [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Leipzig]], Germany were opened.

In 1998 Flottweg acquired Veronesi, an Italian manufacturer of disc stack centrifuges. In the same year, Flottweg began to develop and produce disc stack machines at Vilsbiburg.

In 2007, Flottweg Separation Technology, Inc. was founded in [[Independence, Kentucky]] . In 2012 , Flottweg was converted to Flottweg SE, legally registered in the [[European Company Regulation|Societas Europaea]] (also called "Europe AG") in the European Union.&lt;ref name="LV2010"&gt;Florian Langenscheidt, [[Bernd Venohr]] (Hrsg.): ''Lexikon der deutschen Weltmarktführer.

== Products ==
In 2015, Flottweg produces decanter centrifuges, which are used for continuous separation of solids from liquids, clarification of liquids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Australian &amp; New Zealand Grapegrower &amp; Winemaker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_xIAAAAYAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Ryan Publications|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classification of fine pigments.&lt;ref name="LV2012"&gt;Don W.

[[File:Gelatine.png|thumb|right|Sheet (or leaf) gelatin for cooking]]
'''Gelatin''' or '''gelatine''' (from {{lang-la|gelatus}} meaning "stiff" or "frozen") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food [[ingredient]] that is derived from [[collagen]] obtained from various animal body parts. It is also referred to as hydrolyzed collagen, collagen hydrolysate, gelatine hydrolysate, hydrolyzed gelatine, and collagen peptides. It is commonly used as a [[gelling agent]] in [[food]], [[medication]]s, drug and vitamin [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[photographic film]]s and [[photographic paper|papers]], and [[cosmetics]].

Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called "gelatinous". Gelatin is an irreversibly [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller [[peptide]]s, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. It is found in most [[gummy candy]], as well as other products such as [[marshmallow]]s, [[gelatin dessert]]s, and some [[ice cream]]s, [[dip (food)|dips]], and [[yogurt]]s.&lt;ref name="gelatin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kodjo Boady Djagnya |author2=Zhang Wang |author3= Shiying Xu |title=Gelatin: A Valuable Protein for Food and Pharmaceutical Industries: Review |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=481–492 |year=2010 |doi=10.1080/20014091091904 |pmid=11592686|publisher=Taylor and Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelatin for recipe use comes in the form of powder, granules, or sheets. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.

== Production of hydrolyzed collagen ==
Hydrolyzed collagen is produced from [[collagen]] found in the bones, skin, and connective tissue of animals. The process of [[hydrolysis]] involves breaking down the molecular bonds between individual collagen strands and peptides using combinations of physical, chemical or biological means.   Typically, with skin-sourced collagen (Type-I collagens), hides are put in a lime slurry pit for up to 3 months, loosening collagen bonds; the hides are then washed to remove lime, and the collagen extracted in boiling water.  The extracted collagen is evaporator concentrated, desiccated with drum driers, and pulverized.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Characteristics ==
Hydrolysis results in the reduction of collagen [[protein]] fibrils of about 300,000 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]] into smaller [[peptides]]. Depending upon the process of hydrolysis, peptides will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation.

=== Amino acid content ===
The [[amino acid]] content of hydrolyzed collagen is the same as collagen. Hydrolyzed collagen contains 19 amino acids, predominantly [[glycine]], [[proline]] and [[hydroxyproline]], which together represent around 50% of the total amino acid content.

=== Amino acid content ===
Hydrolyzed collagen contains 8 out of 9 [[Amino acid#In human nutrition|essential amino acids]],&lt;ref name="Bensaid"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00977-0|last=Bensaid|first=A. |author2=Tomé, D. |author3=L’Heureux-Bourdon, D. |author4=Even, P. |author5=Gietzen, D. |author6=Morens, C. |author7=Gaudichon, C. |author8=Larue-Achagiotis, C. |author9=Fromentin, G.|year=2003|title=A high-protein diet enhances satiety without conditioned taste aversion in the rat |journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=78|pages= 311–320|pmid=12576130|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[glycine]] and [[arginine]]&lt;ref name="Fricke"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1111/j.1475-097X.2008.00809.x|last= Fricke|first=O. |author2=Baecker, N. |author3=Heer, M. |author4=Tutlewski, B. |author5=Schoenau, E.|year=2008|title= The effect of L-arginine administration on muscle force and power in postmenopausal women|journal=Clinical Physiology and Functional Imaging |volume=28|pages= 307–311 | issue=5|pmid= 18510549}}&lt;/ref&gt;—two [[amino-acid]] [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] necessary for the [[biosynthesis]] of [[creatine]]. It contains no [[tryptophan]] and is deficient in [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]].

=== Digestibility === 
The [[bioavailability]] of hydrolyzed collagen in mice was demonstrated in a 1999 study; orally administered &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C hydrolyzed collagen was digested and more than 90% absorbed within 6 hours, with measurable accumulation in [[cartilage]] and [[skin]].&lt;ref name="Oesser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oesser|first=S. |author2=Adam, M. |author3=Babel, W. |author4=Seifert, J.|year=1999|title=Oral administration of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C labelled gelatine hydrolysate leads to an accumulation of radioactivity in cartilage of mice (C57/BL)  |journal= Journal of Nutrition|volume=129|pages= 1891–1895|pmid=10498764|issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2005 study in humans found hydrolyzed collagen absorbed as small [[peptides]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="Iwai"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf050206p|last=Iwai|first=K. |author2=Hasegawa, T. |author3=Taguchi, Y. |author4=Morimatsu, F. |author5=Sato, K. |author6=Nakamura, Y. |author7=Higashi, A. |author8=Kido, Y. |author9=Nakabo, Y. |author10=Ohtsuki, K.|year=2005|title= Identification of food-derived collagen peptides in human blood after oral ingestion of gelatine hydrolysates|journal= [[Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry]]|volume=53|issue=16|pages= 6531–6536|pmid=16076145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on skin ===
Ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen may affect the skin by increasing the density of collagen fibrils and [[fibroblasts]], thereby stimulating collagen production.&lt;ref name="Matsuda"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3177/jnsv.52.211 |last=Matsuda |first=N. |last2=Koyama |first2=Y. |last3=Hosaka |first3=Y. |last4=Ueda |first4=H. |last5=Watanabe |first5=T. |last6=Araya |first6=T. |last7=Irie |first7=S. |last8=Takehana |first8=K |year=2006 |title= Effects of ingestion of collagen peptide on collagen fibrils and glycosaminoglycans in the dermis |journal= Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=211–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested, based on mouse and [[in vitro]] studies, that hydrolyzed collagen [[peptides]] have chemotactic properties on fibroblasts&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.75.2.871|last=Postlethwaite |first=A.

=== Joint and bone effects ===
Some clinical studies report that the oral ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen decreases joint pain, those with the most severe symptoms showing the most benefit.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1053/sarh.2000.9622|last=Moskowitz|first=R.|year=2000|title=Role of collagen hydrolysate in bone and joint disease|journal= Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism|volume=30|pages= 87–99 | issue=2|pmid=11071580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruiz-Benito"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1080/09637480802498820|last=Ruiz-Benito|first=P. |author2=Camacho-Zambrano, M.M. |author3=Carrillo-Arcentales, J.N. |author4=Mestanza-Peralta, M.A. |author5=Vallejo-Flores, C.A. |author6=Vargas-Lopez, S.V. |author7=Villacis-Tamayo, R.A. |author8=Zurita-Gavilanes, L.A.|year=2009|title= A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of a food ingredient, collagen hydrolysate, for improving joint comfort |journal= International Journal of Food Science and Nutrition|volume=12|pages= 1–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficial action is likely due to hydrolyzed collagen accumulation in the [[cartilage]] &lt;ref name="Oesser"/&gt; and stimulated production of [[collagen]] by the [[chondrocytes]], the cells of [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name="Oesser2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oesser|first=S.|author2=Seifert, J.|year=2003|title=Stimulation of type II collagen biosynthesis and secretion in bovine chondrocytes cultured with degraded collagen |journal= Cell and Tissue Research|volume=311|pages= 393–399|pmid=12658447|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s00441-003-0702-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that a daily intake of hydrolyzed collagen increases bone mass density in rats.&lt;ref name="Nomura"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2005.03.007|last=Nomura|first=Y.|author2=Oohashi, K. |author3=Watanabe, M. and Kasugai |year=2005|title=Increase in bone mineral density through oral administration of shark gelatine to ovariectomized rats |journal=Nutrition|volume=21|issue=11-12|pages= 1120–1126|pmid=16308135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00774-004-0522-2|last=Wu|first=J. |author2=Fujioka, M. |author3=Sugimoto, K. |author4=Mu, G. |author5=Ishimi, Y|year=2004|title=Increase of effectiveness of oral administration of collagen peptide on bone metabolism in growing and mature rats |journal=Bone and Mineral Metabolism|volume=22|issue=6|pages= 547–553|pmid=15490264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that hydrolyzed collagen [[peptides]] stimulated differentiation and [[osteoblasts]] activity- the cells that build [[bone]]- over that of [[osteoclasts]] (cells that destroy bone).

However, other clinical trials have yielded mixed results. In 2011, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies concluded that "a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of collagen hydrolysate and maintenance of joints".&lt;ref&gt;[[European Food Safety Authority]] - EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies.

=== Safety concerns ===
Hydrolyzed collagen, like [[gelatin]], is made from animal [[by-products]] from the meat industry, including skin, bones, and connective tissue.

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), with support from the TSE ([[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]]) Advisory Committee, has since 1997 been monitoring the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE). The FDA study concluded:  "...steps such as heat, alkaline treatment, and filtration could be effective in reducing the level of contaminating TSE agents; however, scientific evidence is insufficient at this time to demonstrate that these treatments would effectively remove the BSE infectious agent if present in the source material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125182.htm|title=The Sourcing and Processing of Gelatin to Reduce the Potential Risk Posed by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in FDA-Regulated Products for Human Use|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmetics ==
In cosmetics, hydrolyzed collagen may be found in topical creams, acting as a product texture conditioner, and moisturizer.

==Composition and properties==
Gelatin is a mixture of [[peptide]]s and [[protein]]s produced by partial [[hydrolysis]] of collagen extracted from the skin, bones, and [[connective tissue]]s of animals such as domesticated [[cattle]], [[chicken]], [[pig]]s, and [[fish]]. During hydrolysis, the natural molecular bonds between individual collagen strands are broken down into a form that rearranges more easily. Its chemical composition is, in many aspects, closely similar to that of its parent collagen.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=A.G.|title=The Science and Technology of Gelatin|publisher= Academic Press|year=1977|location= New York|author2= Courts, A.|isbn=0-12-735050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographic and pharmaceutical grades of gelatin generally are sourced from cattle bones and pig skin. Gelatin has proline, hydroxyproline and glycine in its polypeptide chain. Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for gelation properties of gelatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gelatin Handbook|url=http://www.gelatin-gmia.com/images/GMIA_Gelatin_Manual_2012.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200308/http://www.gelatin-gmia.com/images/GMIA_Gelatin_Manual_2012.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}

Gelatin readily dissolves in hot water and sets to a [[gel]] on cooling. When added directly to cold water, it does not dissolve well, however. Gelatin also is soluble in most [[solvent|polar solvents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook of Gelatin|url=http://www.gelatin-gmia.com/images/GMIA_Gelatin_Manual_2012.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200308/http://www.gelatin-gmia.com/images/GMIA_Gelatin_Manual_2012.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelatin solutions show viscoelastic flow and streaming [[birefringence]]. Solubility is determined by the method of manufacture. Typically, gelatin can be dispersed in a relatively concentrated acid. Such dispersions are stable for 10–15 days with little or no chemical changes and are suitable for coating purposes or for extrusion into a precipitating bath.{{Citation needed|date= July 2014}}

The mechanical properties of gelatin gels are very sensitive to temperature variations, the previous thermal history of the gels, and the amount of time elapsing. These gels exist over only a small temperature range, the upper limit being the melting point of the gel, which depends on gelatin grade and concentration, but typically, is less than {{convert|35|C}} and the lower limit the freezing point at which ice crystallizes. The upper melting point is below [[human body temperature]], a factor that is important for [[mouthfeel]] of foods produced with gelatin.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; The [[viscosity]] of the gelatin-water mixture is greatest when the gelatin concentration is high and the mixture is kept cool at about {{convert|4|C}}. The gel strength is quantified using the [[Bloom (test)|Bloom]] test. Gelatin's strength (but not viscosity) declines if it is subjected to temperatures above {{convert|100|C}}, or if it is held at temperatures near 100 °C for an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/06/how-to-avoid-problems-with-gelatin-dessert-baking.html 6 Unexpected Factors That Can Ruin Your Gelatin Desserts | Serious Eats]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin The Science of Gelatin - FineCooking]&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide production amount of gelatin is about {{convert|375,000 - 400,000|tonne/year|e6lb/year|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2013-07-15/global-gelatin-market-projected-to-reach-279-billion-in-2018|title=Global Gelatin market|accessdate=11 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605124312/http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2013-07-15/global-gelatin-market-projected-to-reach-279-billion-in-2018|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a commercial scale, gelatin is made from [[by-product]]s of the [[meat]] and [[leather]] industries.
Most gelatin is derived from pork skins, pork and cattle bones, or split cattle hides.&lt;ref name=gc/&gt; Gelatin made from fish by-products avoids some of the religious objections to gelatin consumption.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; The raw materials are prepared by different curing, acid, and alkali processes that are employed to extract the dried collagen hydrolysate. These processes may take several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products.

Gelatin also can be prepared at home. Boiling certain cartilaginous cuts of meat or bones results in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting stock (when cooled) will form a jelly or gel naturally. This process is used for [[aspic]].

While many processes exist whereby collagen may be converted to gelatin, they all have several factors in common. The intermolecular and intramolecular bonds that stabilize insoluble collagen must be broken, and also, the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen [[helix]] must be broken.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt; The manufacturing processes of gelatin consists of three main stages:
#Pretreatments to make the raw materials ready for the main extraction step and to remove impurities that may have negative effects on physiochemical properties of the final gelatin product
#The main extraction step, which usually is done with hot water or dilute acid solutions as a multistage extraction to hydrolyze collagen into gelatin
#The refining and recovering treatments including filtration, clarification, evaporation, sterilization, drying, rutting, grinding, and sifting to remove the water from the gelatin solution, to blend the gelatin extracted, and to obtain dried, blended, ground final product

===Pretreatments===
If the raw material used in the production of the gelatin is derived from [[bone]]s, dilute [[acid]] solutions are used to remove [[calcium]] and other salts. Hot water or several solvents may be used to reduce the fat content, which should not exceed 1% before the main extraction step. If the raw material consists of [[hide (skin)|hides]] and [[skin]]; size reduction, washing, removal of hair from hides, and degreasing are necessary to prepare the hides and skins for the main extraction step.

Collagen hydrolysis is performed by one of three different methods: [[acid hydrolysis|acid]]-, [[base hydrolysis|alkali]]-, and [[enzymatic hydrolysis]]. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully [[cross-link]]ed materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in [[bovine]] hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the gelatin industry, the gelatin obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin and the gelatin obtained from alkali-treated raw material is referred to as type-B gelatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vyse.com/about_gelatin_process.html|title= Type A &amp; B Process Definition|date= 26 October 2009|accessdate= 16 July 2014|website= |publisher= Vyse Gelatin Company|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150301224019/http://www.vyse.com/about_gelatin_process.html#|archivedate= 1 March 2015|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances are occurring to optimize the yield of gelatin using enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen. The treatment time is shorter than that required for alkali treatment, however, and results in almost complete conversion to the pure product. The physical properties of the final gelatin product are considered better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent advances on the role of process variables affecting gelatin yield and characteristics with special reference to enzymatic extraction: A review|journal=Food Hyrocolloids|date=February 2017|volume=63|pages=85–96|doi=10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.08.007|last1=Ahmad|first1=Tanbir|last2=Ismail|first2=Amin|last3=Ahmad|first3=Siti Aqlima|last4=Khalil|first4=Khalilah A.|last5=Kumar|first5=Yogesh|last6=Adeyemi|first6=Kazeem D.|last7=Sazili|first7=Awis Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraction===
After preparation of the raw material, i.e., reducing cross-links between collagen components and removing some of the impurities such as fat and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin by extraction with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed up conversion, they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.

===Recovery===
This process includes several steps such as filtration, evaporation, drying, grinding, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also dependent on the particular gelatin used. Gelatin degradation should be avoided and minimized, so the lowest temperature possible is used for the recovery process. Most recoveries are rapid, with all of the processes being done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of the peptide structure. A deteriorated peptide structure would result in a low gel strength, which is not generally desired.

The first use of gelatin in foods is attributed to [[Britain in the Middle Ages|medieval Britain]] (1400s) when cattle hooves were boiled to produce a gel.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx |title=Gelatin |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917110428/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx |archivedate=17 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further commercial development occurred in 1754 when a British manufacturing patent was issued.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Food applications in France and the United States during 1800–1900 appear to have established the versatility of gelatin, including the origin of its popularity in the US as [[Jell-O]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0756788544|title=Jell-o: A Biography: the History And Mystery of America's Most Famous Dessert|author=Wyman, Carolyn|publisher=Diane Publishing Company|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over middle-late 1800s, Charles and [[Rose Knox]] of New York manufactured and marketed gelatin powder, diversifying the appeal and applications of gelatin.&lt;ref name="enc2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx#2 |title=Gelatin: background |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917110428/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/gelatin.aspx#2 |archivedate=17 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary uses===
[[File:Oeufs en gelée p1150406.jpg|thumb|[[Egg (food)|Eggs]] in [[aspic]]]]
Probably best known as a [[gelling agent]] in [[cooking]], different types and grades of gelatin are used in a wide range of food and nonfood products. Common examples of foods that contain gelatin are [[gelatin dessert]]s, [[trifle]]s, [[aspic]], [[marshmallow]]s, [[candy corn]], and confections such as [[Peeps]], [[gummy bear]]s, [[fruit snack]]s, and [[jelly baby|jelly babies]]. Gelatin may be used as a [[stabilizer (food)|stabilizer]], thickener, or texturizer in foods such as [[yogurt]], [[cream cheese]], and [[margarine]]; it is used, as well, in fat-reduced foods to simulate the [[mouthfeel]] of fat and to create volume. It also is used in the production of several types of Chinese soup dumplings, specifically Shanghainese soup dumplings, or ''[[xiaolongbao]]'', as well as ''[[Shengjian mantou]]'', a type of fried and steamed dumpling. The fillings of both are made by combining ground pork with gelatin cubes, and in the process of cooking, the gelatin melts, creating a soupy interior with a characteristic gelatinous stickiness.

Gelatin is used for the clarification of juices, such as apple juice, and of vinegar.

[[Isinglass]] is obtained from the swim bladders of fish. It is used as a fining agent for wine and beer.&lt;ref name="omri"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organic Standards Board Technical Advisory Panel Review: Gelatin processing |url=http://www.omri.org/Gelatin-TAP.pdf |format=PDF |work=omri.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014944/http://www.omri.org/Gelatin-TAP.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[hartshorn]] jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name "hartshorn"), isinglass was one of the oldest sources of gelatin.

It maintains the wrinkles in [[crêpe paper]].

==Dietary restrictions and gelatin substitutes==
The consumption of gelatin from particular animals may be forbidden by religious rules or cultural taboos. For example, [[Jew]]ish [[kosher]] and [[Islamic]] [[halal]] customs require gelatin from sources other than pigs, such as cattle (that have been slaughtered according to the religious regulations) or fish (that they are allowed to consume). [[Roma people]] are cautious of gelatin products that may have been made from horses, as their culture forbids the consumption of horses. Some companies specify the source of the gelatin used.

[[Veganism|Vegans]] and [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] do not eat foods containing gelatin made from animals. Likewise, [[Sikh]], [[Hindu]], and [[Jainism|Jain]] customs may require gelatin alternatives from sources other than animals, as many Hindus, most Jains and some Sikhs are vegetarian. Other people simply consider gelatin unpalatable due to the ingredients used in its production.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Partial alternatives to gelatins derived from animals include the [[seaweed]] extracts [[agar]] and [[carrageenan]], and the plant extracts [[pectin]] and [[konjac]]. Research into synthetic collagen is ongoing; as of 2011, partial success has been achieved in replicating collagen's structure using self-assembling peptides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New method to grow synthetic collagen unveiled: New material may find use in reconstructive surgery, cosmetics, tissue engineering|date=9 September 2011|publisher=Rice University|url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=16131&amp;SnID=1640719643|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206180824/http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW|archive-date=6 February 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein content==
[[File:Amino Acid Composition in Gelatin chart.png|thumb|right|[[Amino acid]] composition]]
Although gelatin is 98–99% protein by dry weight, it has little additional nutritional value, varying according to the source of the raw material and processing technique.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gelatin.co.za/gltn1.html|title=Encyclopedia of Food Science and Technology|date=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471192558|editor=Francis, Frederick J.|edition=2nd|pages=1183–1188|chapter=Gelatin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829055205/http://www.gelatin.co.za/gltn1.html|archivedate=29 August 2005|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Amino acids present in gelatin are variable, due to varying sources and batches, but are approximately:&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;
*[[Glycine]] 21%
*[[Proline]] 12%
*[[Hydroxyproline]] 12%
*[[Glutamic acid]] 10%
*[[Alanine]] 9%
*[[Arginine]] 8%
*[[Aspartic acid]] 6%
*Other 22%

==Safety concerns==
In 1997, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), with support from the TSE ([[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]]) Advisory Committee, began monitoring the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), commonly known as ''mad cow disease''. An FDA study from that year stated: "...steps such as heat, alkaline treatment, and filtration could be effective in reducing the level of contaminating TSE agents; however, scientific evidence is insufficient at this time to demonstrate that these treatments would effectively remove the BSE infectious agent if present in the source material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125182.htm|title=The Sourcing and Processing of Gelatin to Reduce the Potential Risk Posed by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in FDA-Regulated Products for Human Use|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121080011/http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125182.htm|archivedate=21 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, 2016 the FDA finalized three previously-issued interim final rules designed to further reduce the potential risk of BSE in human food.&lt;ref name="FDAFinalRule"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/18/2016-06123/use-of-materials-derived-from-cattle-in-human-food-and-cosmetics |title=Federal Register :: Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics |author=Food and Drug Administration |date=March 18, 2016 |website=Federal Register, The Daily Journal of the United States Government |access-date=May 24, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603230919/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/18/2016-06123/use-of-materials-derived-from-cattle-in-human-food-and-cosmetics |archivedate=3 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final rule clarified that "gelatin is not considered a prohibited cattle material if it is manufactured using the customary industry processes specified."&lt;ref name="FDAConstituentUpdate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/food/newsevents/constituentupdates/ucm490542.htm |title=FDA Announces Final Rule on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy |author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=March 17, 2016 |access-date=May 24, 2017 |quote=Finally, the rule provides a definition of gelatin and clarifies that gelatin is not considered a prohibited cattle material if it is manufactured using the customary industry processes specified.

The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union in 2003 stated that the risk associated with bovine bone gelatin is very low or zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/ssc/out321_en.pdf|title=Updated Opinion On The Safety With Regard To TSE Risks Of Gelatine Derived From Ruminant Bones or Hides|author=Scientific Steering Committee, European Union|date=6–7 March 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026005256/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/ssc/out321_en.pdf|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/AC/03/briefing/3969B1_1d.pdf|title=The Removal and Inactivation of Potential TSE Infectivity by the Different Gelatin Manufacturing Processes|author=Gelatine Manufacturers of Europe (GME)|date=June 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114180148/http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/AC/03/briefing/3969B1_1d.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] stated that the SSC opinion was confirmed, that the BSE risk of bone-derived gelatin was small, and that it recommended removal of the 2003 request to exclude the skull, brain, and [[vertebra]]e of bovine origin older than 12 months from the material used in gelatin manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.312 |author=Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) |title=Quantitative assessment of the human BSE risk posed by gelatine with respect to residual BSE risk |year=2006|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=312|pages=1-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
In 2011, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies concluded that "a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of collagen hydrolysate and maintenance of joints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=European Food Safety Authority, Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies|url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2291|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of a health claim related to collagen hydrolysate and maintenance of joints pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2011|volume=9|issue=7|page=2291|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2291|}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 review also found insufficient evidence to support its use for [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Vijven|first1=JP|last2=Luijsterburg|first2=PA|last3=Verhagen|first3=AP|last4=van Osch|first4=GJ|last5=Kloppenburg|first5=M|last6=Bierma-Zeinstra|first6=SM|title=Symptomatic and chondroprotective treatment with collagen derivatives in osteoarthritis: a systematic review.|journal=Osteoarthritis and cartilage / OARS, Osteoarthritis Research Society|date=August 2012|volume=20|issue=8|pages=809–21|pmid=22521757|doi=10.1016/j.joca.2012.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in 2013, [[Health Canada]] approved a label for "hydrolyzed collagen", specifying that the label may make a [[health claim]] that supplemental dietary amino acid intake from hydrolyzed collagen "helps to reduce joint pain associated with osteoarthritis".&lt;ref name="gc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq.do?atid=hydrolized.collagen|title=Natural Health Products Ingredients Database: Hydrolyzed Collagen|date=12 June 2013|publisher=Government of Canada, Health Canada, Health Products and Food Branch, Natural Health Products Directorate|accessdate=9 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512222007/http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq.do?atid=hydrolized.collagen|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{See also|Energy in Sweden}}
* 50% of electricity production comes from hydropower.&lt;ref name="IEA Hydropower" /&gt;
* Has over 1000 hydropower plants.&lt;ref name="IEA Hydropower" /&gt;
* The first state owned hydropower plant was developed in 1906.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;IAEA. (2002) Sweden, Vienna: IAEA, [pdf] [Online] [Accessed on 16/12/2011] http://www.sintef.no/upload/642BCd01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
{{Main|Electricity sector in Norway}}
* 95% of electricity production comes from hydropower and is the single largest producer of hydropower. Production capacity is around 31 GW in 2015.&lt;ref name=nvePot&gt;[https://www.nve.no/energiforsyning-og-konsesjon/vannkraft/vannkraftpotensialet/ Vannkraftpotensialet] ''[[Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate]]'', 10 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knudsen2009" /&gt;

* Produces more energy than it needs and looks to expand into Europe.&lt;ref name="Knudsen2009" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
* Has only three hydropower plants, powering 3000 homes, accounting for less than 0.1% of its total electricity production.
* Denmark is geographically small and relatively flat with no rivers suitable for hydropower.&lt;ref name="StateofGreen"&gt;State of Green. (2011) , [http://www.stateofgreen.com/Technologies/Hydropower?sector=Solar-and-Other-Renewables Hydropower]. Accessed on 16/12/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Imports most of its hydroelectricity from Sweden and Norway.&lt;ref name="StateofGreen" /&gt;
* Denmark has the lowest total [[energy intensity]] in EU.&lt;ref name="Knudsen2009" /&gt;

== Governance of Hydropower in Scandinavia ==
National governments in Scandinavia consult with all stakeholders affected by hydropower plants.  The interaction between stakeholders on hydropower projects in Norway can be classified as participatory governance. After the Scandinavian countries de-regulated their markets, they connected their individual markets into one common market, [[Nord Pool Spot]]. The energy that is not traded through the market is traded through contracts between suppliers, retailers and consumers.&lt;ref name="Nord Pool Spot"&gt;Nord Pool Spot. (2011) The power market - how does it work, Nord Pool Spot, Nord Pool Spot, [Online] [Accessed on 16/12/2011] http://www.nordpoolspot.com/How-does-it-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
The Swedish electricity market was deregulated in 1996, transforming the industry from a government hierarchical system to a governance steering structure.&lt;ref name="IAEA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palm"&gt;Palm, J. (2008) ‘Emergency management in the Swedish electricity market: the need to challenge the responsibility gap,’ Energy Policy, vol. 36, issue. 2, pp. 843-849&lt;/ref&gt; The law stated that ‘power trading and network operations may not be conducted by the same organisation but numerous organisations thus the production and trade of electricity became competitive. The industry would be regulated by public authorities, the Energy Market Inspectorate within the Swedish Energy Agency. Its responsibilities included monitoring network tariffs and ensuring that network operators do not subsidise other interests.&lt;ref name="Palm" /&gt;

=== Norway ===
{{see also|Just Gjessing}}
The different levels of governance in Norway concerning hydropower can be seen through the economic interests, and the social responses, to the installation and expansion of hydropower projects.

=== Denmark ===
Most of Denmark’s hydropower electricity comes from Norway and Sweden,&lt;ref name="StateofGreen" /&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2012}} supplied partly through Nord Pool Spot.&lt;ref name="Nord Pool Spot" /&gt; 
Denmark has increased its renewable energy sources (wind and biomass) from approximately 0% in 1970 to 20% in 2005, which leaves them on target for the RES directive.&lt;ref name="Knudsen2009" /&gt; Wind share was 39% in 2014.&lt;ref name=en2014&gt;Rasmussen, Jesper Nørskov.

==== Local level ====
At the local level hydropower can have an enormous effect on communities; creating employment, improving infrastructure, and building new or enhanced roads. However, some communities can be resistant to hydropower, especially when local incomes are dependent on tourism. For example, fishing is an important recreational sport in Norway; and hydropower may prevent local people from participating. Also the installation of hydropower upon historic sites, and areas of natural beauty, is other major concern. Local communities have been known to bring in NGO’s such as WWF Norway, or Friends of the Earth, in order to resist the installation of hydropower plants.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud"&gt;Knudsen, J. K., Ruud, A. (2011) Changing currents in Norwegian hydropower governance? The challenge of reconciling conflicting interests, Oslo: SINTIF, (TR A7111), pp. 1-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional ====
The municipality’s response to hydropower typically represents the response of local communities. Municipality must manage the concerns of the stakeholder’s communities, energy companies and NGO’s regarding the installation of hydropower plants.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

Various municipalities have shares and direct ownership of hydropower companies. Energy companies rely on municipalities to provide information on the local environment, and cooperate to create environmental impact assessments. This can involve numerous municipalities, as the watercourse may flow through several municipalities, and therefore are bound by regulations to work together on hydropower projects.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

Hydropower companies pay fees to the local municipalities in the form of taxes and license fees. Smaller hydropower plants are exempt from taxes in order to economically stimulate local development. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) determines the license fees paid to municipalities by hydropower companies. The NVE assess various factors such as degree of environmental disturbance and the profitability of the project.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

==== National level ====
Hydropower has long been "associated with a [[Nation-building|nation-building process]], representing the key infrastructure for economic growth and welfare, through electrification".&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

In 1991 Norway de-regulated its market and these institutions became the network for governing hydropower in Norway:

* The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MoPE): Energy policy of Norway, and thereby also the policies affecting hydropower.
* The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE): (Provides licences for hydropower plant projects) Managing Norway’s water resources; promoting an efficient energy market and cost-effective energy system; and promoting [[efficient energy use]].
* The Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management (DN) (Executive and advisory body for the MoPE): nature protection and management, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as outdoor recreation.
* The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency (KLIF): The regulation of pollutants related to energy production, or other factors affecting the chemical composition of watercourses.
* Directorate for Cultural Heritage (RA): the cultural landscape and provides for hearing comments on hydropower projects.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

==== International level ====
* The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) provide the license for the Nord Pool Spot to organise and operate a market place for trading power. The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MoPE) to facilitate the power market with foreign countries.
* Norway has been in negotiations with the EU commission to agree on a national target for the EU Renewable Energy Source (RES) directive. A draft has been produced giving Norway a target of 67.5% by 2020. This is higher than any other country in the EU.
* Norway’s commitment to this regulation was one of the principles required by Sweden for the joint certificate scheme.
*"''Norway and Sweden signed a protocol on the fundamental principles and the further follow-up of the common green certificate scheme. At the same time, a proposal for a Norwegian act on the system – reflecting the current Swedish legislation and the protocol, was forwarded to a public consultation. In April 2011, the Government put forward a proposal for a law based on the consultation. The law is expected to be adopted by the Parliament in near future in order to ensure an implementation from January 2012.''"&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

==== Participatory governance example ====
* For the implementation of large hydropower plants in Norway numerous stakeholders need to be consulted:
* NVE conducts the initial assessment, consider the need for impact assessments, and coordinate different inputs and viewpoints received through the public consultations.
* The NVE forwards a recommendation to the MoPE.
* MoPE then prepares the case for the Government.
* The Government presents the application to the King in Council. In Norway, the King must sign all the Government’s decisions before they can be implemented.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;

==== Criticisms of Governance ====
* Using horizontal structures can create a lack of responsibility, and this can lead to a lack of co-ordination.&lt;ref name="KnudsenRuud" /&gt;
* Governance can include too many stakeholders, which can prevent the network from functioning efficiently.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex, as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;
* There is no definitive concept, or precise usage, of 'governance'; consequently this makes it difficult to create a structure to the network, as there is no easily identifiable framework to follow.&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;Hurst, P. (1998) Democracy and Governance. In. Pierre, J. (2000) Debating governance Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 75-91&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''high-temperature test reactor''' ('''HTTR''') is a graphite-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] gas-cooled [[research reactor]] in [[Oarai, Ibaraki]], Japan operated by the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]]. It uses long hexagonal fuel assemblies, unlike the competing [[pebble bed reactor]] designs.

HTTR first reached its full design power of 30 MW (thermal) in 1999. Other tests have shown that the core can reach temperatures sufficient for [[hydrogen production]] via the [[sulfur-iodine cycle]].

==Technical details==
The primary coolant is helium gas at a pressure of about 4 MPa, the inlet temperature of 395&amp;nbsp;°C, and the outlet temperature of 850–950&amp;nbsp;°C. The fuel is uranium oxide (enriched to an average of about 6%).

The '''Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales''' (IPART) is an independent regulatory and pricing [[tribunal]] that oversees regulation in water, gas, electricity and transport industries in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]]. IPART was established in 1992 by [[Government of New South Wales]] with the primary purpose of regulating the maximum prices for [[monopoly]] services by [[Government-granted monopoly|government utilities]] and other monopoly businesses such as [[Transport in New South Wales|public transport]].

IPART’s organisational arm or Secretariat is managed by the Chief Executive Officer. IPART has approximately 140 staff members and an annual budget of {{AUD}}25&amp;nbsp;million. The current Chairman is Dr [[Peter Boxall]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}}. IPART is responsible to the [[Premier of New South Wales]], presently [[Gladys Berejiklian]] MP.

IPART's role is set out in various pieces of state legislation including the ''Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal Act 1992'', the ''Gas Supply Act 1996'', the ''Electricity Supply Act 1995'', the ''National Electricity (NSW) Law 1997'' and the ''Transport Administration Act 1996''.

==Functions==
IPART's core functions are conferred by legislation, rules and access regimes established by legislation. These functions are to:
* Set maximum prices for monopoly services provided by government agencies in NSW (including water and public transport).
* Administer licensing or authorisation of water, electricity and gas businesses, and monitor compliance with licence conditions.
* Advise the NSW Government or its agencies on issues such as pricing, efficiency, industry structure and competition.
* Regulate maximum electricity and gas prices that regulated energy retailers can charge to residential and small business customers.
* Regulate private sector access to water and waste water to encourage competition and re-use.
* Maintain a local government cost index, determine the maximum percentage increase in local government general revenue (rate peg), determine special rate variations and review Council development contributions plans.
* Review the regulatory burden in priority industries to reduce red tape.
* Administer the Energy Savings Scheme and associated Register of energy savings certificates.
* Register agreements for access to public infrastructure assets and arbitrate disputes about agreements for access to public infrastructure.
* Investigate complaints about competitive neutrality referred to us by the Government.

In addition to these functions,  IPART also undertakes reviews and investigations to advise the NSW government and its agencies on a range of economic and policy issues such as pricing, efficiency, industry structure and competition.

An '''insular energy system''' or '''isolated energy system''' is defined by a country’s inability, due to smallness and/or [[Remote and isolated community|remoteness]], to [[Interconnection|interconnect]] with other [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] and consumers through a wider [[Electric power transmission|transmission grid]] outside its national borders. As a result, the country cannot take advantage of the more efficient neighboring [[Electricity market|electricity markets]]. This type of [[energy system]] is typically detected in small islands or in mainland countries where the costs for constructing [[infrastructure]] for power transmission purposes are prohibitively high, or in cases where a country may be isolated due to political issues.&lt;ref name=gridparity&gt;{{cite journal|title=Towards grid parity in insular energy systems: The case of photovoltaics (PV) in Cyprus|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513010689|work=Paris A.

==Energy Mix==

The [[energy mix]] of insular energy systems is dominated by [[diesel fuel|diesel]] and heavy [[fuel oil]].&lt;ref name=gridparity/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The cost of integration of parabolic trough CSP plants in isolated Mediterranean power systems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032110000043|work=Andreas Poullikkas, Ioannis Hadjipaschalis, George Kourtis|publisher=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2010.01.003|volume=14|year=2010|pages=1469–1476 | last1 = Poullikkas | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Hadjipaschalis | first2 = Ioannis | last3 = Kourtis | first3 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast amounts of imported [[fossil fuel]] necessary to fulfil the energy needs of these systems create instability in the [[economy]] as well as the security of the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Energy Technologies in an Island Environment: Hawaii|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.eg.05.110180.001453|work=J W Shupe, J M Weingart|publisher=Annual Review of Energy|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the domination of fossil-fueled energy generation is strongly supported by several other factors, including the inefficiency of indigenous [[World energy resources|energy resources]], the limited infrastructure of energy delivery, the lack of [[Energy storage|storage]], and the flexibility of the power generators to meet seasonal needs.&lt;ref name=smartinsular/&gt; Insular energy systems typically have only a few [[Independent Power Producer|independent power producers]] and a limited range of power generation technologies.&lt;ref name=gridparity/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Furthermore, there is lack of attractive support schemes or incentives for the progression of the system from fossil fuels to [[Renewable energy|renewable]] and [[Low-carbon power|low-carbon]] energy sources. At the same time, their efforts to meet international or European obligations often fail and are normally also costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Near zero energy islands in the Mediterranean: Supporting policies and local obstacles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513011142|work=Eleonora Riva Sanseverino, Raffaella Riva Sanseverino, Salvatore Favuzza, Valentina Vaccaro|publisher=Energy Policy|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.007|volume=66|year=2014|pages=592–602 | last1 = Riva Sanseverino | first1 = Eleonora | last2 = Riva Sanseverino | first2 = Raffaella | last3 = Favuzza | first3 = Salvatore | last4 = Vaccaro | first4 = Valentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

A number of issues make the energy generation of insular systems extremely expensive and less secure. First, the great dependency of insular energy systems on imported energy sources for [[electricity generation]] and their associated high transportation and shipping costs are reflected in the [[electricity pricing]].&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Oxford, 1994"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development of Small Island Economies|work=Kakazu, H|publisher=Westview Press, Oxford, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reliability economies of scale for tropical island electric power|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988399000377|work=Peter C. Mayer|publisher=Energy Economics|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/S0140-9883(99)00037-7|volume=22|year=2000|pages=319–330 | last1 = Mayer | first1 = Peter C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the small sizes of these systems limit not only the production and [[Electric energy consumption|consumption]] capacities, but also the establishment and growth of significant internal markets.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Oxford, 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The vulnerability and resilience of small island developing states in the context of globalization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-8947.1999.tb00914.x/abstract|work=Pierre Encontre|publisher=Natural Resources Forum|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.1999.tb00914.x|volume=23|year=1999|pages=261–270 | last1 = Encontre | first1 = Pierre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the dominance of a sole public or private energy producer means that a single stakeholder is fully responsible for generating, transmitting and [[Electric power distribution|distributing electricity]] and in control of the associated investment decisions, programmes, and tariff setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Efficiency in Electricity Generation – The Impact of Smallness and Isolation of Island Economies|url=http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Domah_Technical_Efficiency_in.pdf|work=Preetum Domah|publisher= DAE Working Paper WP 0232|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[Greenhouse gas|GHG emissions]] is another great challenge for insular energy systems given that most of their electricity production is based on fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Renewable energy sources (RES) projects and their barriers on a regional scale: The case study of wind parks in the Dodecanese islands, Greece|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421509004613|work=Emmanouil K.

==Classification of Systems==

Insular energy systems can be divided into three categories according to their [[Nameplate capacity|installed power capacity]] and location:&lt;ref name=smartinsular/&gt;
* ''Category A: Islands of up to 100 MW of installed capacity''
The countries found in this category have limited energy demand and large distance from the mainland. Only a limited number of these countries utilize renewable energy sources, contributing up to 5% of the energy mix.

* ''Category B: Islands from 100 MW up to 15GW of installed capacity''
The majority of the islands in this category exploit, to a small or large extent, renewable energy sources due to their larger consumption demand and higher [[Gross domestic product|GDPs]].

* ''Category C: Mainland countries with no grid interconnection''
The GDP of the majority of countries found in this category is very low. The political situation in these countries limits the investment in electricity infrastructure, in view of the fact that health and military issues are typically more alarming and urgent to resolve. Conversely, this category also includes mainland nations that do not export or import electricity to their neighbours and are as also major petroleum exporting countries including Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia. It is evident that the abundance of fossil fuels found in these countries has not alarmed them to turn to renewable energy resources.

==Transition to Smart Energy Systems==

The transition to [[Smart system|smart systems]] can be achieved through a variety of measures and policies including:&lt;ref name=smartinsular/&gt;
* the promotion of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures;
* the establishment of [[Smart grid|smart grids]];
* the utilization of renewable energy technologies;
* the installation of large storage systems.

However, every action should preliminarily take into consideration the local conditions of the energy system, as well as the economic [[Feasibility study|feasibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigating the energy autonomy of very small non-interconnected islands: A case study: Agathonisi, Greece|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097308261200052X|work=J.K. Kaldellis, Ant. Gkikaki, El. Kaldelli, M. Kapsali|publisher=Energy for Sustainable Development|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.esd.2012.08.002|volume=16|year=2012|pages=476–485 | last1 = Kaldellis | first1 = J.K. | last2 = Ant | first2 =  | last3 = El | first3 =  | last4 = Kapsali | first4 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exploiting renewable energy sources can contribute significantly in reducing the level of energy imports of insular energy systems with positive impacts for the [[balance of trade]] and [[Energy security|security of supply]].&lt;ref name=smartinsular/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Energy: Lessons from the Pacific Islands Experience.|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469072&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3970311122736|work=Mathur Subodh, Wade Herbert, Liebenthal, Andres|publisher=World Bank technical paper ; no. WTP 244|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Renewable energy technologies in the Caribbean|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X96001284|work=Oliver Headley|publisher=Solar Energy|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(96)00128-4|bibcode=1997SoEn...59....1H|volume=59|year=1997|pages=1–9 | last1 = Headley | first1 = Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Energy policy and an action plan for renewable energy sources (RES) for the Hellenic islands of the North Aegean region|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544298000796|work=Balaras C.A., Santamouris M., Asimakopoulos D.N., Argiriou A.A., Paparsenos G., Gaglia A.G|publisher=Energy|accessdate=24 November 2014|doi=10.1016/S0360-5442(98)00079-6|volume=24|year=1999|pages=335–350 | last1 = Balaras | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Santamouris | first2 = M. | last3 = Asimakopoulos | first3 = D.N. | last4 = Argiriou | first4 = A.A. | last5 = Paparsenos | first5 = G. | last6 = Gaglia | first6 = A.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are obstacles that need to be overcome before renewable energy generation penetrates the insular energy systems. Renewable energy technologies are less reliable than conventional technologies due to the fact that the energy production is variable and weather dependent and thus additional technologies such as energy storage are required. [[Monopoly|Monopolistic]] power sectors also prevent the development of smaller scale renewable electricity generation that would be more efficient and [[Competition (companies)|cost-competitive]] and put conventional technologies in a preferential position due to the earlier profit resulting from the lower [[Capital cost|capital costs]].&lt;ref name=gridparity/&gt;

'''Jesmonite''' is a composite material used in fine arts, crafts, and construction.  It consists of a [[gypsum]]-based material in an acrylic [[resin]].

==Usage==
Jesmonite is a versatile material and is used in several ways.  It is typically used for creating sculptures and other three-dimensional works, but can be used with other materials as a ground for painting.  It can be used as a surface material in building and construction.  It is considered an attractive alternative to other resin-based materials, such as [[polyester]] and [[fiberglass]].  It can be used for [[casting]] and [[laminating]].  

Besides its popularity in sculpture, jesmonite is popular in other areas where [[casting]] and molding are common, such as architectural stone and plasterwork that has a requirement to be very lightweight, [[taxidermy]], [[archaeology]], and [[palaeontology]].

==Properties==
Jesmonite is considered durable, flame resistant, and resistant to impact.  It can be used to fabricate both small and large objects.  When mixed, it accepts colored [[pigments]] and metal powders.  Its surface can be finished to resemble plaster, stone, metal, and wood. 

Jesmonite is considered a low hazard material.  The finished composite emits no toxic fumes.  The mixing process requires no harmful solvents.  However, the mixing should be performed with rubber gloves, eye protection, and dust mask, and should take place in a well-ventilated area.  Cleanup is performed with water.

==2012 Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant==
In the 2012 [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant]], the ornate prow sculptures on the Royal barges ''[[Gloriana (barge)|Gloriana]]'' and [[MV Spirit of Chartwell|MV ''Spirit of Chartwell'']] were carved and moulded in Jesmonite and decorated with [[gold leaf]]. These included dolphins, relief plaques and ''[[Old Father Thames]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">The '''Lane hydrogen producer''' was an apparatus for [[hydrogen production]] based on the [[steam-iron process]] and [[water gas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200522.html | title = 1909 - The Lane hydrogen producer }}&lt;/ref&gt; invented in 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02543209 | title = Production of hydrogen by the steam-iron method | year = 1939 | last1 = Hurst | first1 = S. | journal = Oil &amp; Soap | volume = 16 | pages = 29 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; by British engineer, Howard Lane.

==History==
The first commercial Lane hydrogen producer was commissioned in 1904. By 1913, {{convert|850000000|ft3}} of hydrogen was manufactured annually by this process.&lt;ref name="Fan" /&gt;

In the early-part of the 20th century, the process found some use as a means of producing hydrogen lifting gas for [[airships]], as it could produce large volumes of gas cheaply. Lane producers were installed at some British airship stations so the gas could be manufactured on-site. To work efficiently however, the plant required skilled operators and to be running as a quasi-continuous process. A competing process, referred to as the ''Silicol Process'', reacted [[Ferrosilicon]] with a strong [[Sodium hydroxide]] solution and had the advantage of flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nevilshute.org/Engineering/AMBurgess/amb_hydrogen.php | title=Hydrogen for Airships | publisher=Nevil Shute Norway Foundation | accessdate=January 2, 2013 | author=Burgess, A.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the Lane process was superseded by cheaper methods of hydrogen production that used oil or natural gas as a feedstock.&lt;ref name="Fan"&gt;{{cite book | title=Chemical Looping Systems for Fossil Energy | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Fan, Liang-Shih | year=2011 | pages=36 | isbn=1118063139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process description==
Where hydrogen was commonly produced with the single [[retort]] like the Messerschmitt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter =  Hydrogen from Steam (Single retort)| isbn = 978-1-4097-2892-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XrJHuwL-wjoC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Single+retort+system,+steam-iron+process | page = 37 |title =Industrial Hydrogen | first = Hugh S. | last = Taylor | year =  2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bamag type, Lane introduced the multiple retort type. In the Lane generator [[water gas]] was used to heat the retorts up to 600-800 °C after which water gas-air was used in the retorts. In the steam-iron process the iron oxidizes and has to be replaced with fresh metal, in the Lane hydrogen producer the iron is [[Redox|reduced]] with water gas back to its metallic condition, after which the process restarts.

The chemical reactions are&lt;ref name="Fan" /&gt;

:3Fe+ 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+ 4CO → 3Fe + 4CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The net chemical reaction is:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Limonite''' ({{IPAc-en||ˈ|l|aɪ|m|ə|n|aɪ|t|}}) is an [[iron ore]] consisting of a mixture of hydrated [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]]s in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·{{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being [[hematite]] and [[magnetite]], and has been [[mining|mined]] for the production of [[iron]] since at least 2500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;MacEachern, Scott (1996) [http://www.panafprehistory.org/images/papers/IRON_AGE_BEGINNINGS_NORTH_OF_THE_MANDARA_MOUNTAINS_CAMEROON_AND_NIGERIA_Scott_MacEachern.pdf "Iron Age beginnings north of the Mandara Mountains, Cameroon and Nigeria"]  pp. 489&amp;ndash;496 ''In'' Pwiti, Gilbert and Soper, Robert (editors) (1996) ''Aspects of African Archaeology: Proceedings of the Tenth Pan-African Congress'' University of Zimbabwe Press, Harare, Zimbabwe, {{ISBN|978-0-908307-55-5}}; archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20120311184136/http://www.panafprehistory.org/images/papers/IRON_AGE_BEGINNINGS_NORTH_OF_THE_MANDARA_MOUNTAINS_CAMEROON_AND_NIGERIA_Scott_MacEachern.pdf here] by [[Internet Archive]] on 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diop-Maes, Louise Marie (1996) [http://www.ankhonline.com/revue/diop_lm_metallurgie_fer_afrique.htm "La question de l'Âge du fer en Afrique" ("The question of the Iron Age in Africa")] ''Ankh'' 4/5: pp. 278&amp;ndash;303, in French; archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20080125103929/http://www.ankhonline.com/revue/diop_lm_metallurgie_fer_afrique.htm here] by [[Internet Archive]] on 25 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Limonite is named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Wiktionary:λειμών|λειμών]] (/leː.mɔ̌ːn/), meaning "wet meadow", or [[Wiktionary:λίμνη|λίμνη]] (/lím.nɛː/), meaning “marshy lake” as an allusion to its occurrence as '''bog iron ore''' in [[meadow]]s and [[marsh]]es.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-2402.html&lt;/ref&gt; In its brown form it is sometimes called '''brown hematite''' or '''brown iron ore'''. In its bright yellow form it is sometimes called '''lemon rock''' or '''yellow iron ore'''.

==Characteristics==
Limonite is relatively [[density|dense]] with a [[specific gravity]] varying from 2.7 to 4.3.&lt;ref name="Northrop"&gt;Northrop, Stuart A. (1959) "Limonite" ''Minerals of New Mexico'' (revised edition) University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, pp. 329&amp;ndash;333, {{OCLC|2753195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It varies in colour from a bright lemony yellow to a drab greyish brown. The [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]] of limonite on an unglazed porcelain plate is always brownish, a character which distinguishes it from hematite with a red streak, or from magnetite with a black streak. The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] is variable, but generally in the 4 - 5.5 range.&lt;ref name="Northrop" /&gt;

Although originally defined as a single mineral, limonite is now recognized as a mixture of related [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]] minerals, among them [[goethite]], [[akaganeite]], [[lepidocrocite]], and [[jarosite]]. Individual minerals in limonite may form [[crystal]]s, but limonite does not, although specimens may show a fibrous or microcrystalline structure,&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, P. F. and Blanchard, Roland (1929) "Cellular structure in limonite" ''Economic Geology'' 24(8):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;791&amp;ndash;796&lt;/ref&gt; and limonite often occurs in concretionary forms or in compact and earthy masses; sometimes mammillary, [[botryoidal]], reniform or stalactitic.  Because of its amorphous nature, and occurrence in hydrated areas limonite often presents as a clay or mudstone. However, there are limonite [[pseudomorph]]s after other minerals such as [[pyrite]].&lt;ref name="Northrop" /&gt; This means that chemical weathering transforms the crystals of pyrite into limonite by hydrating the molecules, but the external shape of the pyrite crystal remains. Limonite pseudomorphs have also been formed from other iron oxides, hematite and magnetite; from the carbonate [[siderite]] and from iron rich silicates such as [[Almandine|almandine garnets]].

==Formation==
Limonite usually forms from the hydration of hematite and magnetite, from the oxidation and hydration of iron rich sulfide minerals, and chemical weathering of other iron rich minerals such as [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], and [[biotite]]. It is often the major iron component in [[Laterite|lateritic soils]]. It is often deposited in run-off streams from mining operations.

==Uses of limonite==

One of the first uses was as a [[pigment]].  The yellow form produced yellow [[ochre]] for which [[Cyprus]] was famous,&lt;ref&gt;Constantinou, G. and Govett, G. J. S. (1972) "Genesis of sulphide deposits, ochre and umber of Cyprus" ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy" 81:&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;46&lt;/ref&gt; while the darker forms produced more earthy tones. Roasting the limonite changed it partially to hematite, producing red ochres, burnt umbers and siennas.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, George B. (1910) "Iron Oxide Paints" ''Paint, oil and drug review'' 50(4):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;14&amp;ndash;21,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7P9YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 page 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bog iron|Bog iron ore]] and limonite mudstones are mined as a source of iron, although commercial mining of them has ceased in the United States.

''Iron caps'' or [[gossan]]s of siliceous iron oxide typically form as the result of intensive [[oxidation]] of [[sulfide]] ore deposits.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, G. Chester (1915) ''Mines and mineral resources of Shasta county, Siskiyou county, Trinity county'' California State Mining Bureau, California State Printing Office, Sacramento, California, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 pages 15&amp;ndash;16], {{OCLC|5458708}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gossans were used by prospectors as guides to buried ore. In addition the oxidation of those sulfide deposits which contained [[gold]], often resulted in the concentration of gold in the iron oxide and quartz of the gossans. Goldbearing limonite gossans were productively mined in the [[Shasta County, California]] mining district.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; Similar deposits were mined near [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]] and [[Mount Morgan, Queensland|Mount Morgan]] in [[Australia]]. In the [[Dahlonega]] gold belt in [[Lumpkin County, Georgia]] gold was mined from limonite-rich [[laterite|lateritic]] or [[saprolite]] soil. The gold of the primary veins was concentrated into the limonites of the deeply weathered rocks. In another example the deeply weathered iron formations of [[Brazil]] served to concentrate gold with the limonite of the resulting soils.

==History==
{{main|History of ferrous metallurgy}}
While the first iron ore was likely [[meteoric iron]], and hematite was far easier to [[Smelting|smelt]], in Africa, where the first evidence of iron metallurgy occurs, limonite is the most prevalent iron ore. Before smelting, as the ore was heated and the water driven off, more and more of the limonite   was converted to hematite. The ore was then pounded as it was heated above 1250&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;Iron oxide becomes metallic iron at roughly 1250°C, almost 300 degrees below iron's melting point of 1538°C.&lt;/ref&gt; at which temperature the metallic iron begins sticking together and non-metallic impurities are thrown off as sparks. Complex systems developed, notably in Tanzania, to process limonite.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Peter and Avery, Donald H. (22 September 1978) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/201/4361/1085 "Complex Iron Smelting and Prehistoric Culture in Tanzania"] ''Science''201(4361):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;1085&amp;ndash;1089&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, hematite and magnetite remained the ores of choice when smelting was by [[Bloomery|bloomeries]], and it was only with the development of [[blast furnace]]s in 1st century BCE in China&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Donald B. (1999) [http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/EARFE/EARFE.html "The earliest use of iron in China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718053841/http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/EARFE/EARFE.html |date=2006-07-18 }} pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;9 ''In'' Young, Suzanne M. M. ''et al.'' (editors) (1999) ''Metals in Antiquity'' Archaeopress, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|978-1-84171-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 1150 CE in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel, Albrecht ''et al.''

[[File:Western Bluebird leaving nest box.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Western bluebird]] leaving a nest box]]

A '''nest box''', also spelled '''nestbox''', is a man-made enclosure provided for animals to [[nest]] in.  Nest boxes are most frequently utilized for [[bird]]s, in which case they are also called '''birdhouses''' or a '''birdbox'''/'''bird box''', but some [[mammal|mammalian]] species may also use them. Placing nestboxes or roosting boxes may also be used to help maintain populations of  particular species in an area. The nest box was invented by the British conservationist [[Charles Waterton]] in the early 19th century to encourage more birdlife and [[wildfowl]] on the [[nature reserve]] he set up on his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://birdhouseplanet.com/|title=Charles Waterton (1782 - 1865)|last=|first=|date=|website=Birdhouse Planet|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nest boxes are getting more attention because industrialization, deforestation and other human activities since the mid-20th century have caused severe declines in birds' natural habitats, introducing hurdles to breeding. A nest box can help prevent bird extinction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://birdhouseplanet.com|title=Birdhouse Basics - Birdhouse Planet|website=Birdhouse Planet|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

===General construction===
Nest boxes are usually [[wood]]en, although the [[purple martin]] will nest in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before Buying a Birdhouse|url=http://blog.duncraft.com/2010/03/10/before-buying-a-birdhouse/|work=Duncraft's Wild Bird Blog|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some boxes are made from a mixture of wood and [[concrete]], called ''woodcrete''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browne|first=Stephen J.|date=2006-07-01|title=Effect of nestbox construction and colour on the occupancy and breeding success of nesting tits Parus spp.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063650609461432|journal=Bird Study|volume=53|issue=2|pages=187–192|doi=10.1080/00063650609461432|issn=0006-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic and plastic nestboxes too are not suitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/our-work/rspb-news/news/414752-keep-nest-boxes-simple-not-stylish-says-rspb Keep nest boxes simple, not stylish, says RSPB]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nest boxes should be made from untreated wood with an overhanging, sloped roof, a recessed floor, drainage and ventilation holes, a way to access the interior for monitoring and cleaning, and have no outside perches which could assist predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attracting Birds With Nest Boxes|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/page.aspx?pid=1139|work=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes may either have an entrance hole or be open-fronted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bto.org/about-birds/nnbw/putting-up-a-nest-box|title=Putting up a nest box  {{!}} BTO - British Trust for Ornithology|website=www.bto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nest boxes can be highly decorated and complex, sometimes mimicking human houses or other structures. They may also contain [[nest box camera]]s so that use of, and activity within, the box can be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tina|last2=Cooper|first2=Caren|title=Lights, Camera, Action! Nest Box Cam technology reveals rarely seen events|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Publications/Birdscope/Winter2006/nest_box_cams.html|work=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird nest box construction===

[[File:Gramercy Park birdhouse.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Birdhouses in [[Gramercy Park]], [[New York City]], note the use of different diameter entrance holes]]

The diameter of the opening in a nest-box has a very strong influence on the species of birds that will use the box. Many small birds select boxes with a hole only just large enough for an adult bird to pass through. This may be an adaptation to prevent other birds from raiding it. In European countries, an opening of 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter will attract ''[[Poecile palustris]]'', ''[[Poecile montanus]]''; an opening of 2.8&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter will attract ''[[Ficedula hypoleuca]]'', and an opening of 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter will attract ''[[Parus major]]'', ''[[Passer montanus]]'', an opening of 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter will attract ''[[Passer domesticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=HDRA encyclopedia of organic gardening |author=Pauline Pears |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2005 |isbn=978-1405308915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the nest box also affects the bird species likely to use the box. Very small boxes attract [[wren]]s and [[treecreeper]]s and very large ones may attract [[duck]]s and [[owl]]s. Seasonally removing old nest material and parasites is important if they are to be successfully re-used.

The material used in the construction may also be significant. [[Sparrow]]s have been shown to prefer woodcrete boxes rather than wooden ones. Birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period, and more reproductive success, perhaps because the synthetic nests were warmer than their wooden counterparts.&lt;ref name=garcia&gt;{{cite journal | last= García-Navas | first= Vicente | last2= Arroyo | first2= Luis | last3= Sanz | first3= Juan José | last4= Díaz | first4= Mario | year= 2008 | title= Effect of nestbox type on occupancy and breeding biology of tree sparrows ''Passer montanus'' in central Spain | journal= Ibis | volume= 150 | issue=  | pages= 356–364 | url= http://www.ccma.csic.es/index.php/es/def/pdf1330?modelo=publicacion | format= PDF | doi= 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00799.x | quote=  | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100930134423/http://www.ccma.csic.es/index.php/es/def/pdf1330?modelo=publicacion | archivedate= 2010-09-30 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

Placement of the nest box obviously is also significant. Some birds (including birds of prey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raptorresource.org/build.htm Falcon nest box position]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/nrs/publications/bto-nestbox-guide Various nest box designs (various species)]&lt;/ref&gt;) prefer their nest box to be at an optimum height. Some birds (such as [[duck]]s) prefer nest sites them to be very low or even at ground level. For many birds orientation relative to the sun  is of importance with many birds preferring an orientation away from direct sun and sheltered from the prevailing rain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspb.org.uk/advice/helpingbirds/nestboxes/smallbirds/siting.aspx Siting a nest-box - RSPB]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bat box construction===
{{commons category|Bat boxes}}
[[File:Bat box in Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge (41119).jpg|thumb|A typical bat box affixed to a post]]
Bat boxes differ from bird nest-boxes in typical design, with the larger opening on the underside of the box, and are more often referred to as bat boxes, although in regard to the rearing of young, they serve the same purpose. Some threatened bat species can be locally supported with the provision of appropriately placed bat-boxes, however species that roost in foliage or large cavities will not use bat boxes. Bat boxes are typically made out of wood, and there are several designs for boxes with single or multiple chambers. Directions for making the open bottom bat houses for small and large colonies,&lt;ref Name="BCI"&gt;{{cite web | title = Single chamber bat house (wall mounted)   | work = | publisher = Bat Conservation International | url = http://www.batcon.org/bhra/economyhouse.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031064253/http://www.batcon.org/bhra/economyhouse.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Carla | title = Why I Built A Bat House | work =  | publisher = National Wildlife Federation | url = http://www.nwf.org/backyard/bathouse.cfm | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124095713/http://www.nwf.org/backyard/bathouse.cfm | archivedate = 2007-11-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as locations to purchase them are available on the internet.&lt;ref Name="Boleky"&gt;{{cite web | last = Boleky | first = Vaughan | title = Why Are Bat Houses Important? | work = | publisher = Organization for Bat Conservation | date= 2005–2006 | url = http://www.batconservation.org/content/Bathouseimportance.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071110214116/http://www.batconservation.org/content/Bathouseimportance.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colour and placement is important to ensuring that bat boxes are used; bat boxes that are too shaded will not heat up enough to attract a [[Maternity colony (bats)|maternity colony]] of bats. Australian bat box projects have been running for over 12 years in particular at the [[Organ Pipes National Park]]. Currently there are 42 roost boxes using the "Stebbings Design" which have peaked at 280 bats roosting in them. The biggest problem with roosting boxes of any kind is the ongoing maintenance; problems include boxes falling down, wood deteriorating, and pests such as ants, the occasional rat, possums, and spiders.&lt;ref Name="BCI2"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Bat House Builder’s Handbook  | work = | publisher = Bat Conservation International | url = http://www.batcon.org/pdfs/BHBuildersHdbk13_Online.pdf  | doi = | accessdate = 2016-10-19 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160419232322/http://www.batcon.org/pdfs/BHBuildersHdbk13_Online.pdf |archivedate = 2016-10-19 |date=2013  | first = Merlin D. | last = Tuttle | first2 = Mark | last2 = Kiser | first3 = Selena | last3 = Kiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ngong Forest''' is one of the few natural forests in a capital city of Kenya. Located {{convert|6|km|mile}} from the central business district of [[Nairobi]], the Ngong Forest is in [[Ngong Hills]] along [[Ngong Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://softkenya.com/kenya/ngong-forest/|title=Ngong Forest|date=2011-08-24|work=Softkenya.com|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managed by the Ngong Road Forest Sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoriasafaris.com/kenya/excursions.html|title=Ngong Forest Walks, Ngong Forest Tours, Excursions in Ngong Forest, Nairobi  Tours, Nairobi Safdari Walk, Nairobi Orphanage, Nairobi Charity Tours, Kibera  Slum Tours, Kibera Charity Tours, Kibera Pro Poor Tours|website=www.victoriasafaris.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; this habitat of indigenous trees is home to many wild animals, including leopards, [[spotted hyena]]s, and [[Cape bushbuck]]s. Other animal residents include [[crowned eagle]]s, owls, snakes, and many other birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://runningwild.co.ke/running-wild-road-map/ngong-forest-sanctuary|title=Hidden Tranquility at the Ngong Forest Sanctuary - Running Wild|date=2015-11-29|work=Running Wild|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngong Forest, which extends to [[Rift Valley Province]], has undergone [[deforestation]] due to the settlement of [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]] and [[Ngong, Kenya|Ngong]], as well as to the development of the [[Lenana School]] and the [[Ngong Racecourse]]. These events have reduced Ngong Forest's original {{Convert|2926.6|ha}} to the current {{Convert|1224|ha}}.

'''Oriented strand board''' ('''OSB'''), also known as '''flakeboard''', '''sterling board''' and '''aspenite''' in [[British English]], is a type of [[engineered wood]] similar to [[particle board]], formed by adding [[adhesive]]s and then compressing layers of [[wood]] strands (flakes) in specific orientations. It was invented by Armin Elmendorf in California in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=US000003164511A |title=Dokument US000003164511A |format=PDF |website=DEPATISnet |publisher=Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt |access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSB may have a rough and [[variegation|variegated]] surface with the individual strips of around {{convert|2.5|×|15|cm|in|1|abbr=in}}, lying unevenly across each other and comes in a variety of types and thicknesses.

==Uses==
[[Image:LSFosb05.jpg|thumb|OSB is used in housing construction.]]

OSB is a material with favorable mechanical properties that make it particularly suitable for load-bearing applications in [[construction]].&lt;ref name="osb-info1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osb-info.org/technical.html |title=Technical Information |publisher=Osb-info.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now more popular than plywood, commanding 66% of the structural panel market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marotte|first1=Bertrand|title=Toronto’s Norbord riding the rising wave of OSB sales|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/forest-products-firm-norbord-riding-the-rising-wave-of-osb-sales/article30985989/|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common uses are as [[sheathing]] in walls, flooring, and roof decking. For exterior wall applications, panels are available with a [[Radiant barrier|radiant-barrier]] layer pre-laminated to one side; this eases installation and increases energy performance of the [[building envelope]]. OSB also sees some use in [[furniture]] production.

==Manufacturing==

Oriented strand board is manufactured in wide mats from cross-oriented layers of thin, rectangular wooden strips [[compression (physical)|compressed]] and bonded together with [[wax]] and synthetic [[resin]] [[adhesive]]s (95% wood, 5% wax and resin).{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} 

The adhesive resins types used include : [[Urea-formaldehyde]] (OSB type 1, non-structural, non-waterproof); [[isocyanate]] based glue (or PMDI poly-[[Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] based) in inner regions with [[Melamine]]-[[Urea-formaldehyde]] or [[Phenol formaldehyde resin]] glues at surface (OSB type 2, structural, water resistant on face); [[Phenol formaldehyde resin]] throughout (OSB types 3 and 4, structural, for use in damp and outside environments).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://sciencing.com/types-glue-used-osb-8615640.html |first = Tony| last = Oldhand | title = Types of Glue Used in OSB| date = 25 Apr 2017 | work = sciencing.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layers are created by shredding the wood into strips, which are sifted and then oriented on a belt or wire cauls. The mat is made in a forming line. Wood strips on the external layers are aligned to the panel's strength axis, while internal layers are perpendicular. The number of layers placed is determined partly by the thickness of the panel but is limited by the equipment installed at the manufacturing site. Individual layers can also vary in thickness to give different finished panel thicknesses (typically, a {{convert|15|mm|1|abbr=on}} layer will produce a {{convert|15|cm|2|abbr=on}} panel thickness{{cn|date=April 2016}}). The mat is placed in a thermal press to compress the flakes and bond them by heat activation and curing of the resin that has been coated on the flakes. Individual panels are then cut from the mats into finished sizes. Most of the world's OSB is made in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in large production facilities. The largest production facilities can make over {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=off}} of OSB per day.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Related products==
Materials other than wood have been used to produce products similar to oriented strand board. [[Oriented structural straw board]] is an engineered board that is made by splitting straw and formed by adding P-MDI adhesives and then hot compressing layers of straw in specific orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_07/BioRes_07_3_2986_Han_CME_Zn_Borate_OS_Straw_Bd_Termite_Trial_2741.pdf |journal=BioResources |title=Performance of zinc Borate Treated Oriented Structural Straw Board against Mold Fungi, Decay Fungi, and Termites - A preliminary trial |author=Han, Guangping, Cheng, Wanli, Manning, Mark, and Eloy, Pierre |date=2012 |volume=7 |number=3 |pages=2986–2995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strand board can also be made from [[bagasse]].

==Properties==
[[Image:OSB-Platte.jpg|thumb|OSB, closeup of corner]]

Adjustments to the manufacturing process can impact differences in thickness, panel size, [[Strength of materials|strength]], and [[Stiffness|rigidity]]. OSB panels have no internal gaps or voids, and can be water-resistant, although they do require additional [[Artificial membrane|membrane]]s to achieve impermeability to water and are not recommended for exterior use. The finished product has properties similar to [[plywood]], but is uniform and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/bmatwt/publications/articles/osb_vs_plywood.html |title=UMass Amherst: Building and Construction Technology » Choosing Between Oriented Strandboard and Plywood |publisher=Umass.edu |date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When tested to failure, OSB has a greater load-bearing capacity than milled wood panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chaya Kurtz |url=http://www.networx.com/article/experts-talk-about-engineered-wood |title=Experts Talk About Engineered Wood - Articles |publisher=Networx.com |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has replaced plywood in many environments, especially the [[North America]]n structural panel market. Unfortunately, its use as sheathing has contributed to the [[leaky condo crisis]], as it is less [[Leaky_condo_crisis#Building_materials|able to breathe]] and release moisture than plywood.

While OSB does not have a continuous [[wood grain|grain]] like a natural wood, it does have an axis along which its strength is greatest. This can be seen by observing the alignment of the surface wood chips.

All wood-based structural use panels can be cut and installed with the same ease and types of equipment used with solid wood.

=== Health and safety ===
The resins used to create OSB have raised questions regarding the potential for OSB to emit [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) such as [[formaldehyde]]. [[Urea-formaldehyde resin|Urea-formaldehyde]] is more toxic and should be avoided in home use. [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|Phenol-formaldehyde]] products are considered to be relatively hazard-free. Some newer types of OSB, so-called "New-generation" OSB panels, use [[Isocyanate resin|isocyanate resins]] that do not contain formaldehyde and are considered non-volatile when cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLeod|first1=Ian|title=I'm concerned about toxic offgassing from OSB subflooring and roofing|url=http://www.greenhomeguide.com/askapro/question/i-m-concerned-about-toxic-offgassing-from-osb-subflooring-and-roofing-are-safer-products-available|website=Green home guide|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry trade groups assert that formaldehyde emissions from North American OSB are "negligible or nonexistent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osbguide.tecotested.com/pdfs/en/el814.pdf |title=Oriented Strand Board Educational Bulletin, Frequently Asked Questions |format=PDF |website= OSBGuide |publisher=TECOTested.com |access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers treat the wood chips with various [[borate]] compounds which are toxic to [[termite]]s, wood boring [[beetle]]s, [[mold]]s, and [[Fungus|fungi]], but not [[mammal]]s in applied doses.

===Types===
Four grades of OSB are defined in EN 300 in terms of their mechanical performance and relative resistance to moisture:&lt;ref name="osb-info1"/&gt;
* OSB/0 – No added formaldehyde
* OSB/1 – General purpose boards and boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions
* OSB/2 – Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions
* OSB/3 – Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions
* OSB/4 – Heavy-duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16551">A '''paperless office''' (or '''paper-free office''') is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced. This is done by converting documents and other papers into digital form, a process known as [[digitization]]. Proponents claim that "going paperless" can save money, boost productivity, save space, make documentation and information sharing easier, keep personal information more secure, and [[Environmental impact of paper|help the environment]]. The concept can be extended to communications outside the office as well.

==Definition==
The paperless world was a [[publicist]]'s slogan, intended to describe the [[office of the future]]. It was facilitated by the popularization of video display computer terminals like the 1964 [[IBM 2260]]. An early prediction of the paperless office was made in a 1975 ''[[Business Week]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Office of the Future |journal=Business Week |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1975-06-30/the-office-of-the-futurebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |issue=2387 |date=30 June 1975 |pages=48–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that office automation would make paper redundant for routine tasks such as record-keeping and [[bookkeeping]], and it came to prominence with the introduction of the [[personal computer]]. While the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the "paperless office" was not. Improvements in [[computer printer|printer]]s and [[photocopier]]s have made it much easier to reproduce documents in bulk, causing the worldwide use of office paper to more than double from 1980 to 2000.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{Citation |title=Technological comebacks: Not dead, just resting|journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-09|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the increased ease of document production&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; and widespread use of electronic communication, which has resulted in users receiving large numbers of documents that are often printed out. However, since about 2000, at least in the US, the use of office paper has leveled off and is now decreasing, which has been attributed to a generation shift;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; younger people are believed to be less inclined to print out documents, and more inclined to read them on a full-color interactive display screen. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the average office worker generates approximately two pounds of paper and paperboard products each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/paper/setting/schoolwork.htm |title= Wastes - Resource Conservation - Common Wastes &amp; Materials - Paper Recycling |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "The Paperless Office" was first used in commerce by [[Micronet, Inc.]], an automated office equipment company, in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Paperless Office Trademark Registration |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4801:gp9aaa.2.7 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditional offices have [[paper]]-based filing systems, which may include [[filing cabinet]]s, folders, shelves, [[microfiche]] systems, and drawing cabinets, all of which require maintenance, equipment, considerable space, and are resource-intensive. In contrast, a paperless office could simply have a desk, chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dK-kontorstole.dk/| title=Office Chairs}} Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and computer (with a modest amount of local or network storage), and all of the information would be stored in digital form. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] could also be used to facilitate the storage of information digitally.

Once computer data is printed on paper, it becomes out-of-sync with [[computer database]] updates. Paper is difficult to search and arrange in multiple sort arrangements, and similar paper data stored in multiple locations is often difficult and costly to track and update. A paperless office would have a single-source collection point for [[distributed database]] updates, and a [[publish-subscribe]] system. Modern computer screens make reading less exhausting for the eyes; a laptop computer can be used on a couch or in bed. With [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, with many other low-cost value-added features like video animation, video clips, and full-length movies, many argue that paper is now obsolete to all but those who are resistant to technological change. [[eBook]]s are often free or low cost compared to hard-copy books.

Others argue that paper will always have a place because it affords different uses than screens [Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.]

==Environmental impact of paper==
{{Main|Environmental impact of paper}}
Paper product manufacturing contributes significantly to [[deforestation]] and man-made [[climate change]], and produces [[greenhouse gas]]es. According to the [[American Forest &amp; Paper Association]], paper manufacturing is the third largest user of fossil fuels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technewsworld.com/story/68834.html |title= Sustainability Software, Part 2: Cutting the Paper Chase |last1= Madden |first1= Ned |last2= |first2= |date= December 8, 2009 |work= |publisher= TechNewsWorld |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although measures such as [[recycling]] and using [[tree-free paper]] can help reduce the environmental impact of paper, most paper still ends up in landfills. Paper production also leads to air pollution, as paper manufacturing releases [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/air/do/asab/apoc/criteria_pollutants.htm |title= Air Pollutants of Concern |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are major contributors to [[acid rain]], whereas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] responsible for [[climate change]]. Waste water discharged from pulp and paper mills contains solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter that are classified as [[pollutant]]s. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause or exacerbate [[eutrophication]] of fresh water bodies.

Printing [[ink]]s and [[toner]]s are very expensive and use environment-damaging [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and non-renewable oils, although standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink have been set by some regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508062911/http://cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Which|date=May 2011}} [[Deinking]] recycled paper pulp results in a waste slurry, sometimes weighing 22% of the weight of the recycled wastepaper, which may go to [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html|title=Recycling Paper and Glass|date=September 2006|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliminating paper via automation and electronic forms automation==
The need for paper is eliminated by using online systems, such as replacing index cards and [[rolodex]]es with databases, typed letters and faxes with email, and reference books with the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to eliminate paper is to automate paper-based processes that rely on forms, applications and surveys to capture and share data. This method is referred to as "electronic forms" or e-forms and is typically accomplished by using existing print-perfect documents in electronic format to allow for pre-filling of existing data, capturing data manually entered online by end-users, providing secure methods to submit form data to processing systems, and digitally signing the electronic documents without printing.

The technologies that may be used with electronic forms automation include -
* Portable Document Format ([[PDF]]) - to create, display and interact with electronic documents and forms
* E-form (electronic form) management software - to create, integrate and route forms and form data with processing systems
* Databases - to capture data for prefilling and processing documents
* Workflow platforms - to route information, documents and direct process flow
* E-mail (electronics email) communication which allows sending and receiving information of all kinds and enable attachments
* [[Digital signature]] solutions - to digitally sign documents (used by end-users)
* Web servers - to host the process, receive submitted data, store documents and manage document rights

One of the main issues that has kept companies from adopting paperwork automation is difficulty capturing digital signatures in a cost-effective and compliant manner. The [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act|E-Sign Act of 2000]] in the United States provided that a document cannot be rejected on the basis of an electronic signature and required all companies to accept digital signatures on documents. Today there are sufficient cost-effective options available, including solutions that do not require end-users to purchase hardware or software.

One of the great benefits of this type of software is that you can use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to search the full text of any file. Additionally, tags can be added to each file to make it easier to locate certain files throughout the entire system.

Some paperless software offers a scanner, hardware and software and works seamlessly in separating and organizing important documents. Paperless software might also allow people to enable online signatures for important documents that can be used in any small business or office. Document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms. Typically, the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned and/or sent into the system. Many document management systems include the ability to read documents via [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and use that data within the document management system’s framework. While this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard D. Walker |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place.

==Digitizing paper-based documents==
Another key aspect of the paperless office philosophy is the conversion of paper documents, [[photo]]s, engineering plans, [[microfiche]] and all the other paper based systems to digital documents. Technologies that may be used for this include [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, digital mail solutions, book copiers, wide format scanners (for engineering drawings), [[microfiche]] scanners, fax to PDF conversion, [[online post offices]], [[multifunction printer]]s and [[document management system]]s. Each of these technologies uses [[software]] that converts the [[raster format]]s (bitmaps) into other forms depending on need. Generally, they involve some form of [[image compression]] technology that produces smaller [[raster image]]s or use [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) to convert a document into text. A combination of OCR and raster is used to enable search ability while maintaining the original form of the document. An important step is the labeling related to paper-to-digital conversion and the cataloging of scanned documents. Some technologies have been developed to do this, but they generally involve either human cataloging or automated indexing on the OCR document. However, scanners and software continue to improve with the development of small, portable scanners that are able to scan doubled-sided A4 documents at around 30-35ppm to a raster format (typically [[TIFF]] fax 4 or [[PDF]]).

An issue faced by those wishing to take the paperless philosophy to the limit has been [[copyright]] laws. These laws may restrict the transfer of documents protected by copyright from one medium to another, such as converting books to electronic format.

==Securing and tracing documents==

As awareness of identity theft and data breaches became more widespread, new laws and regulations were enacted, requiring companies that manage or store [[personally identifiable information]] to take proper care of those documents. Paperless office systems are easier to secure than traditional filing cabinets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11678601/E-Office_An_Eco-friendly_Advent_of_Cloud_Computing_Technology|title=E-Office: An Eco-friendly Advent of Cloud Computing Technology|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and can track individual accesses to each document.

==Difficulties in adopting the paperless office==
A major difficulty in "going paperless" is that much of a business's communication is with other businesses and individuals, as opposed to just being internal. Electronic communication requires both the sender and the recipient to have easy access to appropriate software and hardware.  Costs and temporary productivity losses when converting to a paperless office are also a factor, as are government regulations, industry standards, legal requirements, and business policies which may also slow down the change. Businesses may encounter technological difficulties such as file format compatibility, longevity of digital documents, system stability, and employees and clients not having appropriate technological skills.

For these reasons, while there may be a reduction of paper, some uses of paper will likely remain indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 2015 questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nearly Half of Businesses are or could go Paperless in 2015|url=http://www.margolis.co.uk/half-businesses-could-go-paperless-2015|publisher=www.margolis.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that nearly half of small/medium-sized businesses believed they were or could go paperless by the end of that year.

'''Power Wheels''' is a [[brand]] of battery-powered ride-on [[toy#Toy vehicles|toy cars]] for kids ages 12 months to seven years old. Power Wheels ride-ons are built with kid-sized, realistic features – in some cases, real working features like [[FM broadcasting|FM radios]], opening/closing doors and hoods, power lock brakes, and both forward and reverse motion.

== History ==

The Power Wheels brand name dates back to 1984, when San Francisco-based toy company [[Kransco]] acquired [[Pines of America]], makers of battery-powered vehicles for children. Two years later, Kransco renamed the line "Power Wheels". By 1990 sales of the battery-powered vehicles reached over 1,000,000 per year.

In 1994, Power Wheels was purchased by [[Mattel]]. Following Mattel's acquisition of Kransco, the Power Wheels line immediately became part of [[Fisher-Price]] toys out of [[East Aurora, New York]]. With the addition of new vehicle licenses the new Power Wheels by [[Fisher-Price]] and [[Mattel]] lines did well.

In 1999, [[Fisher-Price]] announced the [[Harley-Davidson]] Motorcycle Ride-On – which contributed to a year of record sales for the entire product line.

== Power Wheels Vehicles ==

Power Wheels ride-on cars, trucks and motorcycles have been sold with more than 100 model names.

The latest line of Power Wheels features small scale versions of popular real world vehicles, including the [[Jeep Wrangler]], [[Jeep Hurricane]], [[Ford F-150]], [[Ford Mustang]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki KFX quad]], [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle, [[Cadillac Escalade EXT]] as well as [[Lightning McQueen]] from [[Pixar]]’s movie, ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''.

== Safety Recalls ==

Power Wheels vehicles have been the subject of Safety Recalls.

The first recall in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml92/92008.html |title=Power Wheels Porsche Battery-Powered Riding Automobile For Children Recalled |publisher=CPSC.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108135332/https://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml92/92008.html |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; involved the 18 Volt [[Porsche 911]], in which the contacts in the foot pedal switch could weld together in use.  If this were to happen, the motor would remain running and the vehicle would continue moving forward, unable to stop. A new accelerator pedal was fitted that eliminated the possibility of welded contacts.

In 1998, [[Fisher-Price]] undertook a monumental recall of up to 10 million Power Wheels 12 volt and Super 6 volt vehicles manufactured since 1986. The recall and repair program was conducted to replace battery fuses and strengthen battery connectors in order to prevent the units from overheating. The main difference of a post recall Power Wheel is that the original "H" (or on very early Power Wheels, "S") connectors are removed and replaced with the larger, black "A" connectors. If a Power Wheels ride-on was built in or before 1998 and has the Black "A" connectors, then the recall work has probably been performed.

The third recall in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2000/CPSC-Fisher-Price-Announce-Recall-of-Childrens-Riding-Vehicles/ |title=CPSC, Fisher-Price Announce Recall of Children's Riding Vehicles |publisher=CPSC.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved the Harley-Davidson motor cycle ride-ons, In cooperation with the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), Fisher-Price is recalling about 218,000 battery-powered Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle ride-ons for repair. The foot pedals, which activate the ride-ons, can stick in the "on" position. Children can be injured when the motorcycle ride-ons fail to stop and strike other objects. The recalled Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle ride-ons have model numbers 74290, 74293 (with a red body) and 74298 (with a black body). A "Power Wheels by Fisher-Price" logo is located on the left side of the seat on the product, and the model number is located on a label in the battery compartment. Only model numbers 74290, 74293 and 74298 are being recalled. These vehicles are intended for children 3 and older, and the vehicles' speed is 2.5 or 5 mph. Toy, mass merchandise and discount stores, and Harley-Davidson dealerships sold the motorcycle ride-ons nationwide from September 1999 through August 2000 for about $190 for the red vehicle and $700 for the black vehicle.

[[File:ZyXEL ZyAIR G-1000 and D-Link DWL-P50 20060829 2.jpg|thumb|300px|In this configuration, an Ethernet connection includes power over Ethernet (gray cable looping below), and a PoE splitter provides a separate data cable (gray, looping above) and power cable (black, also looping above) for a [[wireless access point]].  The splitter is the silver and black box in the middle between the wiring junction box (left) and the access point (right).  The PoE connection eliminates the need for a nearby [[power outlet]].  In another common configuration, the access point or other connected device includes internal PoE splitting and the external splitter is not used.]]

'''Power over Ethernet''' or '''PoE''' describes any of several [[Technical standard|standard]] or [[ad-hoc]] systems which pass [[electric power]] along with data on [[Ethernet over twisted pair|twisted pair Ethernet]] cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both data connection and electric power to devices such as [[wireless access point]]s, [[IP camera]]s, and [[VoIP phone]]s.

There are several common techniques for transmitting power over Ethernet cabling. Two of them have been standardized by [[IEEE 802.3]] since 2003.  These standards are known as ''Alternative A'' and ''Alternative B''. For 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, only two of the four [[Balanced line|signal pairs]] in typical [[Cat 5|Cat&amp;nbsp;5]] cable are used.  ''Alternative B'' separates the data and the power conductors, making troubleshooting easier.  It also makes full use of all four twisted pairs in a typical Cat&amp;nbsp;5 cable. The positive voltage runs along pins 4 and 5, and the negative along pins 7 and 8.

''Alternative A'' transports power on the same wires as data for 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Ethernet variants.  This is similar to the [[phantom power]] technique commonly used for powering condenser microphones. Power is transmitted on the data conductors by applying a common voltage to each pair. Because twisted-pair Ethernet uses [[differential signaling]], this does not interfere with data transmission. The common-mode voltage is easily extracted using the [[center tap]] of the standard Ethernet [[pulse transformer]]. For [[Gigabit Ethernet]] and faster, all four pairs are used for data transmission, so both Alternatives A and B transport power on wire pairs also used for data.

In addition to standardizing existing practice for spare-pair (''Alternative B'') and common-mode data pair power (''Alternative A'') transmission, the IEEE PoE standards provide for signaling between the '''power sourcing equipment''' (PSE) and '''powered device''' (PD). This signaling allows the presence of a conformant device to be detected by the power source, and allows the device and source to negotiate the amount of power required or available.

==Standards development==
The original '''IEEE 802.3af-2003'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=802.3af-2003 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; PoE standard provides up to {{nowrap|15.4 W}} of [[Direct Current|DC]] power (minimum {{Nowrap|44 V DC}} and {{Nowrap|350 mA}}&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3-2005, section 2, table 33-5, item 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3-2005, section 2, table 33-5, item 4&lt;/ref&gt;) on each port.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3-2005, section 2, table 33-5, item 14&lt;/ref&gt; Only {{Nowrap|12.95 W}} is assured to be available at the powered device as some power dissipates in the cable.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3-2005, section 2, clause 33.3.5.2&lt;/ref&gt; The updated '''IEEE 802.3at-2009'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=802.3at Amendment 3: Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) Power via the Media Dependent Interface (MDI) Enhancements |date=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; PoE standard also known as '''PoE+''' or '''PoE plus''', provides up to {{Nowrap|25.5 W}} of power for "Type 2" devices.&lt;ref name="standards.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/stdbd_approves_ieee802.3at.html |title=Amendment to IEEE 802.3 Standard Enhances Power Management and Increases Available Power |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 standard prohibits a powered device from using all four pairs for power.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 33.3.1 stating, "PDs that simultaneously require power from both Mode A and Mode B are specifically not allowed by this standard."&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these standards have since been incorporated into the [[IEEE 802.3|IEEE 802.3-2012]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=IEEE 802.3-2012 Standard for Ethernet |date=December 28, 2012 |publisher=[[IEEE Standards Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''IEEE 802.3bu-2016'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bu/index.html |title=IEEE P802.3bu 1-Pair Power over Data Lines (PoDL) Task Force |date=2017-03-17 |accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; amendment introduced ''single-pair'' '''Power over Data Lines (PoDL)''' for the single-pair Ethernet standards [[Fast Ethernet#100BASE-T1|100BASE-T1]] and [[Gigabit Ethernet#1000BASE-T1|1000BASE-T1]] intended for automotive and industrial applications. On the two-pair or four-pair standards power is transmitted only ''between pairs'', so that within each pair there is no voltage present other than that representing the transmitted data. With single-pair Ethernet, power is transmitted in parallel to the data. PoDL defines 10 power classes, ranging from .5 to 50&amp;nbsp;W (at PD).

Looking at ways of increasing the amount of power transmitted, [[IEEE]] has defined '''IEEE 802.3bt''' in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bt/index.html |title=IEEE P802.3bt DTE Power via MDI over 4-Pair Task Force |date=2016-03-29 |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard introduces two additional power types: up to 55&amp;nbsp;W (Type 3) and up to 90-100&amp;nbsp;W (Type 4). Each pair of twisted pairs needs to handle a current of up to 600&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] (Type 3) or 960&amp;nbsp;mA (Type 4).&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3bt ''145.1.3 System parameters''&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, support for [[2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T|2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T]] and [[10GBASE-T]] is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bt/public/jan16/hstewart_02_0116_baseline.pdf |title=IEEE P802.3bt/D1.5 Draft Standard for Ethernet – Amendment: Physical Layer and Management Parameters for DTE Power via MDI over 4-Pair |date=30 November 2015 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development opens the door to new applications and expands the use of applications such as high-performance [[wireless access point]]s and surveillance cameras.

==Terminology==

===Power sourcing equipment===
Power sourcing equipment (PSE) refers to devices such as a network switch that provides (''sources'') power on the Ethernet cable. When the device is a switch, it is commonly called an ''endspan'' (although IEEE 802.3af refers to it as endpoint). Otherwise, if it's an intermediary device between a non PoE capable switch and a PoE device, it's called a ''midspan''. An external PoE ''injector'' is a ''midspan'' device.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Aironet technotes on [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/technology/poe/technical/reference/Power.html#wp40055 1000BASE-T mid-span devices], visited 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powered device===
Powered device (PD) refers to devices powered by a PSE and thus consuming energy. Examples include [[wireless access point]]s, [[VoIP phone]]s, and [[IP camera]]s.

Many powered devices have an auxiliary power connector for an optional, external, power supply. Depending on the PD design, some, none, or all power can be supplied from the auxiliary port,&lt;ref name="802.3-2008, 33.3.5 PD Power"&gt;IEEE 802.3-2008, section 2, clause 33.3.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="802.3at-2009, 33.3.7 PD Power"&gt;IEEE 802.3at-2009, clause 33.3.7&lt;/ref&gt; with the auxiliary port sometimes acting as backup power in case PoE-supplied power fails.

==Power management features and integration==
[[File:5520-24-POE.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Avaya ERS 5500]] switch with 48 Power over Ethernet ports]]
Advocates of PoE expect PoE to become a global long term DC power cabling standard and replace a multiplicity of individual [[AC adapter]]s, which cannot be easily centrally managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Banish Those "Wall Warts" With Power Over Ethernet |author=Dave Dwelley |work=Electronic Design |url=http://www.electronicdesign.com/displays/banish-those-wall-warts-power-over-ethernet |date=Oct 26, 2003 |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this approach argue that PoE is inherently less efficient than AC power due to the lower voltage, and this is made worse by the thin conductors of Ethernet. Advocates of PoE, like the [[Ethernet Alliance]], point out that quoted losses are for worst case scenarios in terms of cable quality, length and power consumption by powered devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.cablinginstall.com/articles/2017/110/power-over-ethernet-cable-losses-ethernet-alliance.html |author1=David Tremblay |author2=Lennart Yseboodt |title=Clarifying misperceptions about Power over Ethernet and cable losses |date=November 10, 2017 |access-date=2018-07-21 |work=Cabling Installation and Maintenance}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, where the central PoE supply replaces several dedicated AC circuits, transformers and inverters, the power loss in cabling can be justifiable.

===Integrating EEE and PoE===
After integration of PoE with the IEEE 802.3az [[Energy-Efficient Ethernet]] (EEE) standard potentially produces additional energy savings. Pre-standard integrations of EEE and PoE (such as [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]]'s '''EEPoE''' outlined in a May 2011 white paper) claim to achieve a savings upwards of 3&amp;nbsp;W per link. This saving is especially significant as higher power devices come online. Marvell claims that:

:"With the evolution of PoE from a fairly low power source (up to 12.95&amp;nbsp;W per port) to one with devices of up to 25.5&amp;nbsp;W, the direct current (DC) power losses over Ethernet cables increased exponentially. Approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;W/port of power is wasted on a CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6 or CAT6A cable...after 100 m... EEE typically saves no more than 1&amp;nbsp;W per link, so addressing the 4.5&amp;nbsp;W per link loss from PoE transmission inefficiency would provide much more incremental savings.  New energy-efficient PoE (EEPoE) technology can increase efficiency to 94% while transmitting over the same 25 ohm cable, powering IEEE 802.3at-compliant devices in synchronous 4-pairs. When utilizing synchronous 4-pairs, powered devices are fed using all the available wires. For example, on a 24-port IEEE 802.3at-2009 Type 2 system (delivering 25.5&amp;nbsp;W per port), more than 50&amp;nbsp;W are saved."&lt;ref name="marvell1"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.marvell.com/switching/assets/Marvell-PoE-An-Energy-Efficient-Alternative.pdf |title=Power over Ethernet (PoE): An Energy-Efficient Alternative |date=May 2011 |author1=Roman Kleinerman |author2=Daniel Feldman |publisher=Marvell |access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Standard implementation==
The IEEE standards for PoE require [[category 5 cable]] or better for high power levels but allow using [[category 3 cable]] if less power is required.&lt;ref name="33.1.1c"&gt;IEEE 802.3at-2009, clause 33.1.1c&lt;/ref&gt;

Power is supplied in [[Common-mode signal|common mode]] over two or more of the [[Twisted pair|differential pairs]] of wires found in the [[Ethernet]] cables and comes from a power supply within a PoE-enabled networking device such as an [[Ethernet switch]] or can be ''injected'' into a cable run with a ''midspan'' power supply.  A midspan power supply, also known as a ''PoE power injector'', is an additional PoE power source that can be used in combination with a non-PoE switch.

Standards-based Power over Ethernet is implemented following the specifications in IEEE 802.3af-2003 (which was later incorporated as clause 33 into [[IEEE 802.3-2005]]) or the 2009 update, IEEE 802.3at. A [[phantom power]] technique is used to allow the powered pairs to also carry data.  This permits its use not only with [[10BASE-T]] and [[100BASE-TX]], which use only two of the four pairs in the cable, but also with [[1000BASE-T]] (gigabit Ethernet), which uses all four pairs for data transmission.  This is possible because all versions of Ethernet over twisted pair cable specify [[differential signaling|differential data transmission]] over each pair with [[network isolator|transformer coupling]]; the DC supply and load connections can be made to the transformer center-taps at each end. Each pair thus operates in [[Common-mode signal|common mode]] as one side of the DC supply, so two pairs are required to complete the circuit. The polarity of the DC supply may be inverted by [[Ethernet crossover cable|crossover cables]]; the powered device must operate with either pair: spare pairs 4–5 and 7–8 or data pairs 1–2 and 3–6. Polarity is required on data pairs,&lt;!-- Although polarity is specified, circuits I've seen use diode bridges on inputs without exception. --&gt; and ambiguously implemented for spare pairs, with the use of a [[diode bridge]].

===Powering devices===
Three modes, A, B, and 4-pair are available. Mode A delivers power on the data pairs of 100BASE-TX or 10BASE-T. Mode B delivers power on the spare pairs. 4-pair delivers power on all four pairs. PoE can also be used on 1000BASE-T Ethernet, in which case there are no spare pairs and all power is delivered using the phantom technique.

Mode A has two alternate configurations (MDI and MDI-X), using the same pairs but with different polarities. In mode A, pins 1 and 2 (pair #2 in [[T568B]] wiring) form one side of the 48&amp;nbsp;V DC, and pins 3 and 6 (pair #3 in T568B) form the other side. These are the same two pairs used for data transmission in 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, allowing the provision of both power and data over only two pairs in such networks. The free polarity allows PoE to accommodate for crossover cables, patch cables and [[Auto MDI-X]].

In mode B, pins 4–5 (pair #1 in both [[T568A]] and T568B) form one side of the DC supply and pins 7–8 (pair #4 in both T568A and T568B) provide the return; these are the "spare" pairs in 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. Mode B, therefore, requires a 4-pair cable.

The PSE ([[#Power sourcing equipment|power sourcing equipment]]), not the PD ([[#Powered device|powered device]]), decides whether power mode A or B shall be used. PDs that implement only Mode A or Mode B are disallowed by the standard.

The PSE can implement mode A or B or both. A PD indicates that it is standards-compliant by placing a 25&amp;nbsp;kΩ&lt;!-- Ω --&gt; resistor between the powered pairs. If the PSE detects a resistance that is too high or too low (including a short circuit), no power is applied. This protects devices that do not support PoE. An optional "power class" feature allows the PD to indicate its power requirements by changing the sense resistance at higher voltages. To stay powered, the PD must continuously use 5–10&amp;nbsp;mA for at least 60&amp;nbsp;ms with no more than 400&amp;nbsp;ms since last use or else it will be unpowered by the PSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Jacob |last1=Herbold |first2=Dave |last2=Dwelley |date=27 October 2003 |journal=Electronic Design |volume=51 |issue=24 |page=61 |url=http://elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=5945&amp;pg=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320054651/http://elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=5945&amp;pg=3 |archivedate=2005-03-20 |title=Banish Those "Wall Warts" With Power Over Ethernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of PSEs: endspans and midspans. Endspans (commonly called PoE switches) are Ethernet switches that include the power over Ethernet transmission circuitry. Midspans are power injectors that stand between a regular Ethernet switch and the powered device, injecting power without affecting the data.

Endspans are normally used on new installations or when the switch has to be replaced for other reasons (such as moving from [[10/100]]&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s to 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s or adding security protocols), which makes it convenient to add the PoE capability. Midspans are used when there is no desire to replace and configure a new Ethernet switch, and only PoE needs to be added to the network.

The setup phases are as follows:
* PSE (provider) tests PD (consumer) physically using 802.3af phase class 3.
** PSE powers up PD.
* PD sends to PSE: I'm a PD, max power = X, max power requested = X.
* PSE sends to PD: I'm a PSE, max power allowed = X.
** PD may now use the amount of power as specified by the PSE.

The rules for this power negotiation are:
* PD shall never request more power than physical 802.3af class
* PD shall never draw more than max power advertised by PSE
* PSE may deny any PD drawing more power than max allowed by PSE
* PSE shall not reduce power allocated to PD that is in use
* PSE may ''request'' reduced power, via conservation mode&lt;ref name="ieee802-lldp-med-prop2006" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Non-standard implementations==

===Cisco===
Some Cisco manufactured WLAN access points and [[VoIP phone|IP phones]] supporting a proprietary form of PoE many years before there was an IEEE standard for delivering PoE. Cisco's original PoE implementation is not software upgradeable to the IEEE 802.3af standard. Cisco's original PoE equipment is capable of delivering up to {{nowrap|10 W}} per port.  The amount of power to be delivered is negotiated between the endpoint and the Cisco switch based on a power value that was added to the Cisco proprietary [[Cisco Discovery Protocol]] (CDP).  CDP is also responsible for dynamically communicating the Voice VLAN value from the Cisco switch to the Cisco IP Phone.

Under Cisco's pre-standard scheme, the PSE (switch) will send a [[Autonegotiation#Electrical signals|Fast Link Pulse]] (FLP) on the transmit pair. The PD (device) connects the transmit line to the receive line via a [[Low-pass filter|low pass filter]]&lt;!--some docs says relay instead, contradiction--&gt;. And thus the PSE gets the FLP in return. And a common mode current between pair 1 and 2 will be provided resulting in {{nowrap|48 V DC}}&lt;ref name="ciscopress_ciscophone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning for Cisco IP Telephony &gt; Network Infrastructure Analysis|url=http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=385336&amp;seqNum=2&amp;rll=1}} 2010-01-12 ciscopress.com&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|6.3 W}}&lt;ref name="conticomp_CAT6500POE_ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Power over Ethernet on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch|url=http://www.conticomp.com/PDF/CAT6500POE_ds.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u2FxkQis?url=http://www.conticomp.com/PDF/CAT6500POE_ds.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-06|df=}} 2010-01-12 conticomp.com&lt;/ref&gt; default of allocated power. The PD has then to provide Ethernet link within {{nowrap|5 seconds}} to the auto-negotiation mode switch port. A later CDP message with a [[type-length-value]] tells the PSE its final power requirement. A discontinued link pulses shuts down power.&lt;ref name="cisco_technote00"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cisco IP Phone 10/100 Ethernet In-Line Power Detection Algorithm - Cisco Systems|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/phones/ps379/products_tech_note09186a00801189b5.shtml}} 2010-01-12 cisco.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In-line Power Patch Panel (IPPP) send 347 kHz if return in 50 ms, 16 transitions 50/50 ms, then poll 50 ms every 600 ms device still present --&gt;

In 2014, Cisco created another non-standard PoE implementation called '''Universal Power over Ethernet''' ('''UPOE'''). UPOE can use all 4 pairs, after negotiation, to supply up to 60&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cisco Universal Power Over Ethernet - Unleash the Power of your Network White Paper |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-4500-series-switches/white_paper_c11-670993.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128140727/http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-4500-series-switches/white_paper_c11-670993.html |archive-date=2017-11-28 |date=2014-07-11 |publisher=Cisco Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear Technology===
A proprietary high-power development called LTPoE++ using a single CAT-5e Ethernet cable is capable of supplying varying levels at 38.7&amp;nbsp;W, 52.7&amp;nbsp;W, 70&amp;nbsp;W, and 90&amp;nbsp;W in addition to being backwards compatible with IEEE 802.at.&lt;ref name="www.linear.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linear.com/products/power-over-ethernet_(poe)_interface_controllers | title=Power over Ethernet Interface Controllers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsemi===
[[PowerDsine]], acquired by [[Microsemi]] in 2007, has been selling midspan power injectors since 1999 with its proprietary ''Power over LAN'' solution. Several companies such as [[Polycom]], [[3Com]], [[Lucent]] and [[Nortel]] utilize PowerDsine's Power over LAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.poweroverethernet.com/sponsors.php?sponsor_id=12 |title=PowerDsine Limited |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728191203/http://www.poweroverethernet.com/sponsors.php?sponsor_id=12 |archive-date=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passive===
The common 100 Mbit/s passive applications use the pinout of 802.3af mode B - with DC plus on pins 4 and 5 and DC minus on 7 and 8 (see chart below) and data on 1-2 and 3-6. Gigabit passive injectors use a transformer on the data pins to allow power and data to share the cable and is typically compatible with 802.3af Mode A.  In the common "passive" PoE system, the injector does not communicate with the powered device to negotiate its voltage or wattage requirements, but merely supplies power at all times. Passive midspan injectors up to 12 ports simplify installations.  

Devices needing 5&amp;nbsp;Volts cannot typically use PoE at 5&amp;nbsp;V on Ethernet cable beyond short distances (about {{convert|15|ft|m}}) as the voltage drop of the cable becomes too significant, so a 24&amp;nbsp;V or 48&amp;nbsp;V to 5&amp;nbsp;V DC-DC converter is required at the remote end.&lt;ref name="Active 5v Splitter manufacturer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Passive Power over Ethernet equipment, AC-DC and DC-DC|url=http://wifiqos.com/foscam.php}} 2013-06-28 wifiqos.com&lt;/ref&gt;  

Passive PoE power sources are commonly used with a variety of indoor and outdoor wireless radio equipment, most commonly from Motorola (now Cambium), Ubiquiti, Mikrotik and others. Earlier versions of passive PoE 24VDC power sources shipped with 802.11a, 802.11g and 802.11n based radios are commonly 100 Mbit/s only. Specifications vary by manufacturer and model, but some of the common specifications include:{{cn|date=July 2018}}

* 24VDC 0.5A 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s
* 24VDC 1.0A 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s
* 48VDC 1.0A 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s
* 56VDC 1.0A and 2.0A 1 Gbit/s (used for 45W+ load point to point microwave and millimeter band radios)

Passive DC-to-DC injectors also exist which convert a 9&amp;nbsp;V to 36&amp;nbsp;V DC, or 36 V to 72 V DC power source to a stabilized 24&amp;nbsp;V 1&amp;nbsp;A, 48&amp;nbsp;V 0.5&amp;nbsp;A, or up to 48V 2.0A PoE feed with '+' on pins 4 &amp; 5 and '&amp;minus;' on pins 7 &amp; 8. These DC-to-DC PoE injectors are used in various telecom applications.&lt;ref name="Passive PoE injector manufacturer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Passive Power over Ethernet equipment, AC-DC and DC-DC|url=http://tyconpower.com/products/POE.htm}} 2010-02-18 tyconpower.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power capacity limits==

The [[ISO/IEC JTC 1|ISO/IEC]] TR 29125 and [[Cenelec]] EN 50174-99-1 draft standards outline the cable bundle temperature rise that can be expected from the use of 4PPoE. A distinction is made between two scenarios: 1.) bundles heating up from the inside to the outside, and 2.) bundles heating up from the outside to match the ambient temperature. The second scenario largely depends on the way that the cable bundle has been installed, whereas the first is solely influenced by the physical make-up of the cable. In a standard [[Twisted pair|U/UTP]] cable, the PoE-related temperature rise increases by a factor of 5. In a shielded cable, this value drops to between 2.5 and 3, depending on the design. Put another way, the temperature increases by twice as much in a [[Twisted pair|U/UTP]] cable bundle than in a comparable bundle of [[Twisted pair|S/FTP]] cables.

==History==
In prehistoric times the Chocó rainforest served as a major barrier isolating the Mesoamerican and Andean civilisations, and the extremely humid climate also failed to attract the Spanish colonists. The region was eventually granted by the [[Emberá people|Emberá Indians]] to the [[Franciscan]] order in 1648, but subsequent attacks by hostile tribes meant attempts at settlement were abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivatravelguides.com/south-america/colombia/the-pacific-coast/the-choco/quibdo/quibdo-overview/history-of-quibdo/ Colombia History - History of Quibdó]&lt;/ref&gt; only to be established again six years later.

It was not until the nineteenth century when there was interest in finding a shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to avoid traveling via the [[Straits of Magellan]] that the Chocó region again became of significant interest to European colonial powers, as the Atrato River Valley was thought the best possibility for this purpose by the explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]];&lt;ref name ="practicality"&gt;Kelley, Frederick M.; Kennish, William and Serrell, Edward Wellman; ''The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with a History of the Enterprise''; published 1855 By George F. Nisbett&lt;/ref&gt; however it was eventually shelved in favour of the [[Panama Canal]]. At the same time research on using the Chocó to connect the Pacific and Atlantic was being carried out, [[gold]] and [[platinum]] were discovered in the Atrato Valley&lt;ref name ="practicality"/&gt; and this ensured Quibdó’s growth and status as the chief town in the region.

Another crucial development at this time was the movement of freed black slaves into the Chocó, primarily engaging in shifting cultivation to cope with the extreme [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] from the super-humid climate, though fishing and the collection of forest products also helped these groups maintain their livelihood;&lt;ref&gt;Asher, Kiran; ''Black and Green: Afro-Colombians, development and Nature in the Pacific Lowlands''; p. 36. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-4483-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1853 watercolors by [[Manuel María Paz]] document two [[mestizo]] or European men with an Afro-Colombian street vendor, and depict the dress of Afro-Colombian and European women in the town square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These black communities established trade with highland cities such as [[Medellín]] via rough mule trails that lasted until the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Zarsky, Lyuba; ''Human Rights and the Environment: Conflicts and Norms in a Globalizing World''; pp. 177-178. {{ISBN|1-85383-815-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which a combination of population growth and declining values for the region’s natural resources gradually led to an economic downturn for the region and especially Quibdó.

==Climate==
Quibdó has an extremely wet and cloudy [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af'') without noticeable [[season]]s and by a large margin the heaviest rainfall in South America and of any city of its size or greater—the wettest city of larger size, [[Monrovia]] in [[Liberia]], receives {{convert|3050|mm|in|-1}} less than Quibdó. The extreme rainfall cause is because the [[Andes]] to the east of the city block the westerly winds driven by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] which throughout the year, owing to the [[Humboldt Current]] off the west coast of South America, remains centred in the north of the continent at Quibdó’s longitudes. The result is that the extremely unstable ascending air from the Intertropical Convergence Zone is consistently forced to rise over the Chocó plain and as it cools it gives up enormous quantities of moisture. What is more, due to the exuberant nature and biodiversity in the region, a [[biotic pump]] phenomena causes the Choco low-level-jet as another important factor in driving atmospheric moisture from the Pacific into the Colombian Andes &lt;ref&gt;https://usclivar.org/sites/default/files/meetings/2015/presentations/Sierra-J-IASCLIP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rain precipitates almost every day from clouds in intense thunderstorms with an eternal [[wet season]] year round; that means 309 days (84%) of days are rainy, and sunny periods seldom last more than a few hours after sunrise. Quibdó only has 1,276 hours of sunshine annually, making one of the cloudiest cities on the world, with the sunniest month is July, with 135 hours of sunshine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10096">'''Reverse logistics''' is for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is "the process of moving [[good (economics)|goods]] from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. [[Remanufacturing]] and [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbishing]] activities also may be included in the definition of reverse logistics."&lt;ref&gt;Hawks, Karen. [http://www.rlmagazine.com/edition01p12.php "What is Reverse Logistics?"], ''Reverse Logistics Magazine'', Winter/Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing green concerns and advancement of green supply chain management concepts and practices make it all the more relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, Samir K. "Network Design for Reverse Logistics", ''Omega'', '''2008''', 36(4), 535-548.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of publications on the topic of reverse logistics have increased significantly over the past two decades.  The first use of the term "reverse logistics" in a publication was by James R. Stock in a White Paper titled "Reverse Logistics," published by the Council of Logistics Management in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stock, Reverse Logistics (Oak Brook, IL:  Council of Logistics Management, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further refined in subsequent publications by Stock (1998) in another Council of Logistics Management book, titled Development and Implementation of Reverse Logistics Programs,&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stock, Development and Implementation of Reverse Logistics Programs (Oak Brook, IL:  Council of Logistics Management, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Rogers and Tibben-Lembke (1999) in a book published by the Reverse Logistics Association titled Going Backwards:  Reverse Logistics Trends and Practices.&lt;ref&gt;Dale S. Rogers and Ronald S. Tibben-Lembke, Going Backwards:  Reverse Logistics Trends and Practices (Reno, NV:  Reverse Logistics Executive Council, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surplus as well as returned equipment and machines from the hardware leasing business. Normally, [[logistics]] deal with events that bring the product towards the customer. In the case of reverse logistics, the resource goes at least one step back in the [[supply chain]]. For instance, goods move from the customer to the distributor or to the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Rengel, P. &amp; Seydl, C. (May 2002). [http://www.seydl.eu/en/papers/Rengel_Seydl_Reverse_Logistics_2002_23_05_en.pdf Completing the Supply Chain Model] at seydl.edu. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a manufacturer's product normally moves through the [[supply chain network]], it is to reach the distributor or customer. Any process or management after the delivery of the product involves reverse logistics. If the product is defective, the customer would return the product. The manufacturing firm would then have to organise shipping of the defective product, testing the product, dismantling, repairing, recycling or disposing the product. The product would travel in reverse through the supply chain network in order to retain any use from the defective product. The logistics for such matters is reverse logistics.

==Business implications==
In today's marketplace, many retailers treat merchandise returns as individual, disjointed transactions. "The challenge for retailers and vendors is to process returns at a proficiency level that allows quick, efficient and cost-effective collection and return of merchandise. Customer requirements facilitate demand for a high standard of service that includes accuracy and timeliness. It’s the logistic company's responsibility to shorten the link from return origination to the time of resell."&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Ryan. [http://www.rlmagazine.com/edition01p14.php "Reverse Logistics: Customer Satisfaction, Environment Key to Success in the 21st Century"], ''Reverse Logistics Magazine''. Winter/Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By following returns management best practices, retailers can achieve a returns process that addresses both the operational and customer retention issues associated with merchandise returns.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because of the connection between reverse logistics and customer retention, it has become a key component within Service Lifecycle Management (SLM), a [[business strategy]] aimed at retaining customers by bundling even more coordination of a company's services data together to achieve greater efficiency in its operations.

Reverse logistics is more than just returns management, it is "activities related to returns avoidance, gatekeeping, disposal and all other [[Aftermarket (automotive)|after-market]] supply chain issues".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Returns management—increasingly being recognized as affecting competitive positioning—provides an important link between marketing and logistics. The broad nature of its cross-functional impact suggests that firms would benefit by improving internal integration efforts. In particular, a firm's ability to react to and plan for the influence of external factors on the returns management process is improved by such internal integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.dea.univr.it/jsp/visualizzaAllegato.jsp?id=26331&amp;mime=application%2Fpdf&amp;filename=Russo+Supply+chain+strategy+IJPDLM.pdf&amp;localname=allegatooa_26331.pdf|title=The returns management process in supply chain strategy | last1= Mollenkopf |first1= D.| last2= Russo |first2= I. |first3= R. |last3= Frankel |journal=International Journal Physical Distribution Logistics Management |volume= 37 |issue= 7 |year= 2007 |pages= 568–92 |accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a firm's planning for returns, a primary factor is the remaining value of the material returning and how to recover that value.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, Samir K. "Value Recovery Network Design for Product Returns", ''International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management'', '''2008''', 38(4), 311-331.&lt;/ref&gt; "Returned goods, or elements of the product, could even be returned to suppliers and supply chain partners for them to re-manufacture".&lt;ref&gt;Madaan, J. &amp; Wadhwa, S. (2007) ''Flexible Process Planning Approaches for Sustainable Decisions in Reverse Logistics System'', Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management. Vol. 8, No. 4. p. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Third-party logistics]] providers see that up to 7% of an enterprise's gross sales are captured by return costs. Almost all reverse logistics contracts are customized to fit the size and type of company contracting. The [[Third-party_logistics|3PL]]'s themselves realize 12% to 15% profits on this business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/11/02/returns-reverse-logistics-market-cx_rm_1103returns.html | first= Robert | last= Malone |title= Reverse side of logistics: The business of returns |work=Forbes |date=3 November 2005 | accessdate= 2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Studies have shown that an average of 4% to 6% of all retail purchases are returned, costing the industry about $40 billion per year." &lt;ref&gt;Van Riper, Tom. [https://archive.is/20130102150110/http://www.forbes.com/2005/12/06/retailing-wal-mart-cx_tvr_1207reselling.html "Reseller Sees Many Happy Returns"], ''Forbes'', December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse logistics research has also found that 84.6 percent of companies in the United States use secondary market and 70 percent see the secondary market as a "competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reverse Logistics Sustainability Council |url=http://www.reverselogistics.com/ "Secondary Market Research" |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of unsold goods==
In certain industries, goods are distributed to downstream members in the supply chain with the understanding that the goods may be returned for credit if they are not sold e.g., newspapers and magazines. This acts as an incentive for downstream members to carry more stock, because the risk of obsolescence is borne by the upstream supply chain members. However, there is also a distinct risk attached to this logistics concept. The downstream member in the supply chain might exploit the situation by ordering more stock than is required and returning large volumes. In this way, the downstream partner is able to offer high level of service without carrying the risks associated with large inventories. The supplier effectively finances the inventory for the downstream member. It is therefore important to analyze customers’ accounts for hidden costs.

==Reusable packaging==
[[File:Woda.mineralna.w.skrzynkach.jpg|thumb|upright|Reusable [[mineral water]] bottles in crates]]
[[Reusable packaging]] systems require a [[Circular economy|closed-loop]] logistics system.  Examples include reusable [[pallet]]s, [[Bulk_box|bulk boxes]] such as [[Euro container]]s, [[reuse of bottles|Reusable bottles]] for milk, soda, and  beer, compressed gas cylinders, beer kegs, etc.

==Refusal of the products in the cash on delivery (COD)==
In case of [[e-commerce]] business, many websites offer the flexibility of [[cash on delivery]] (COD) to their customers. Sometimes customers refuse the product at the time of delivery, as there is no commitment to take the product. Then the logistics service provider follows the process of reverse logistics on the refused cargo. It is also known as Return to Origin (RTO). In this process, the e-commerce company adds the refused cargo to its inventory stock again, after proper quality checks as per the company's rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Business Logistics &amp; Management - Theory and Practice |first1= J J |last1= Vogt| first2=W J |last2= Pienaar |first3=P W C |last3= de Wit | publisher= OXFORD |year= 2002 |page= 236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse Logistics for Demonstrations==
In case of the Demonstration of Products to the client as part of Pre-Sales process, The Demonstration equipment is sent to the Customer and has to be returned to maintain Revolving Inventory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74117">Many nations have installed significant [[solar power]] capacity into their electrical grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources. 
Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

Worldwide [[growth of photovoltaics]] is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. 
By the end of 2016, cumulative photovoltaic capacity increased by more than 75 [[gigawatt]] (GW) and reached at least 303&amp;nbsp;GW, sufficient to supply approximately 1.8 percent of the world's total [[electricity consumption]]. 
The top installers of 2016 were [[#China|China]], the [[#United States|United States]], and [[#India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/iea-global-installed-pv-capacity-leaps-to-303-gw IEA: Global Installed PV Capacity Leaps to 303 Gigawatts], greentechmedia, Eric Wesoff, April 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are more than 24 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt. 
[[#Austria|Austria]], [[#Chile|Chile]], and [[#South Africa|South Africa]], all crossed the one gigawatt-mark in 2016. 
The available solar PV capacity in Honduras is now sufficient to supply 12.5% of the nation's electrical power while [[#Italy|Italy]], Germany and [[#Greece|Greece]] can produce between 7% and 8% of their respective domestic electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="IEA-PVPS-2016"&gt;[http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf 2016 Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets], International Energy Agency, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epia-2015&gt;{{cite web |title = Global Market Outlook for Solar Power 2015-2019 |url = http://www.solarpowereurope.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Publications/Global_Market_Outlook_2015_-2019_lr_v23.pdf |website = www.solarpowereurope.org |publisher = Solar Power Europe (SPE), formerly known as EPIA – European Photovoltaic Industry Association |accessdate = 9 June 2015 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6ZA1o2aLo?url=http://www.solarpowereurope.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Publications/Global_Market_Outlook_2015_-2019_lr_v23.pdf |archivedate = 9 June 2015 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/technical/PVPS_report_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2014.pdf|title=Snapshot of Global PV 1992-2014|date=30 March 2015|website=www.iea-pvps.org|publisher=International Energy Agency — Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XPpb1fai?url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=2430|archivedate=30 March 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an almost two decade long hiatus, [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|deployment of CSP]] resumed in 2007. 
However, the design for several new projects is being changed to cheaper photovoltaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/02/27/csp-fallen-wayside-may-come-back-big-2020/ |title=CSP Has Fallen By The Wayside – But May Come Back Big By 2020 |website=CleanTechnica |date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most [[List of solar thermal power stations|operational CSP stations]] are located in [[#Spain|Spain]] and the United States, while [[List of photovoltaic power stations|large solar farms]] using photovoltaics are being constructed in an expanding list of geographic regions.
As of January 2017, the largest solar power plants in the world are the 850&amp;nbsp;MW [[Longyangxia Dam Solar Park]] in China for PV and the 377&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] in the United States for CSP.

{{Main|Solar power in Africa}}

Many African countries receive on average a very high amount of days per year with bright sunlight, especially the dry areas, which include the deserts (such as the [[Sahara]]) and the steppes (such as the [[Sahel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~ciotola/solar/asn_94nuclear.html Solar Power in Africa], National Solar Power Research Institute, Yansane A. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This gives solar power the potential to bring energy to virtually any location in Africa without the need for expensive large scale grid level infrastructural developments.
The distribution of solar resources across Africa is fairly uniform, with more than 85% of the continent's landscape receiving at least 2,000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf Report on Solar Power Potential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023047/http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, German Aerospace Center&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Solar power in Morocco}}
Solar power in Morocco is enabled by the country having one of the highest rates of solar [[insolation]] among other countries— about 3,000 hours per year of sunshine but up to 3,600 hours in the desert. [[Morocco]] has launched one of the world’s largest solar energy projects costing an estimated $9&amp;nbsp;billion. The aim of the project is to create 2,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-16983-afdb-helps-fund-144bn-moroccan-solar-project/ AfDB helps fund $1.44bn Moroccan solar project]&lt;/ref&gt; Five solar power stations are to be constructed, including both [[photovoltaic]] and [[concentrated solar power]] technology. The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), a public-private venture, has been established to lead the project. The first plant will be commissioned in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecogeek.org/component/content/article/3770 Morocco Building 500 MW Solar Power Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062425/http://ecogeek.org/component/content/article/3770 |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entire project in 2020. Once completed, the solar project will provide 38% of Morocco’s annual electricity generation.

South Africa had 1329 MW of PV installations and 100 MW of concentrating solar thermal at the end of 2016. It is expected to reach an installed capacity 8,400 MW by 2030, along with 8,400 MW of [[wind power]].&lt;ref name=reve&gt;[http://www.evwind.es/noticias.php?id_not=17693 Solar energy in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; The country's insolation greatly exceeds the average values in Europe, Russia, and most of North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarstreetscapes.com/gallery79052.cfm?startrow=9 Insolation maps, retrieved April 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China Photovoltaics Installed Capacity 2016.png|thumb|China's installed solar PV]]
China is leading the world in solar PV generation, with the total installed capacity exceeding 100 GW. China is the world's largest market for both [[photovoltaics]] and [[solar thermal energy]]. and in the last few years, more than half of the total PV additions came from the country. Solar power in the People's Republic of China is one of the biggest industries and the subsidies by the government have helped in bringing down the cost of solar power, not only in China, but the whole world. Three of the top four [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic power stations]] in operation are located in China, including the world's largest Tengger Desert Solar Park. China also leads the world in [[solar water heating]] with 290 [[GWth]] in operation at the end of 2014, accounting for about 70% of the total world capacity. China's goal is to reach 1,300 GW of Solar Capacity by 2050.

Solar power features prominently in Modi government’s USD $2.5 billion SAUBHAGYA scheme launched in July 2015 to electrify every Indian household by 2019 — a huge task considering around 300 million people were without electricity. The use of local mini-grids run on solar power is “a big part of the push, with 60 percent of new connections expected to be to renewable power", according to a report by the International Energy Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-solarpower-women/solar-power-push-lights-up-options-for-indias-rural-women-idUSKBN1FW0LI|title=Solar power push lights up options for India’s rural women|date=2018-02-12|work=Reuters|accessdate=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government provides subsidy of up to 90% of the upfront capital cost to install solar-powered water pumping systems for irrigation and drinking water.&lt;sup&gt;[32]&lt;/sup&gt; As of 30 November 2017, more than 142,000 solar pumps have been installed to irrigate the agricultural fields.&lt;sup&gt;[33]&lt;/sup&gt; This scheme weans farmers away from diesel-powered pumps and generates extra income for them by allowing to sell surplus power to the grid. It is one of the innovative ways that the government is empowering the rural population with the help of solar energy by addressing specific issues such as water availability. The solar panels are being built over the irrigation canals to preserve water from evaporation in drought-prone sunny areas. The world's first canal-top solar project was set up on Narmada in Gujarat in 2012. For the last mile connectivity in remote and inaccessible areas, the government provides solar power packs of 200 to 300 watt-peak (Wp), along with battery bank, that includes five LED lights, one DC fan and one DC power plug.&lt;sup&gt;[34]&lt;/sup&gt; Other schemes includes Solar Street Light Scheme, providing solar direct current lighting systems, solar lanterns, solar cookers, etc.

Germany has seen an outstanding period of photovoltaic installations from 2010 until 2012. During this boom, about 22 GW, or a third of the worldwide PV installations of that period was deployed in Germany alone. However, the boom period ended in 2012, and Germany's national PV market has since declined significantly, due to the amendments in the [[German Renewable Energy Act]] (EEG) that reduced [[feed-in tariff]]s and set constraints on utility-scaled installations, limiting their size to no more than 10 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes for solar in Germany|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/changes-for-solar-in-germany/150/452/77990/|publisher=renewablesinternational.net|accessdate=12 May 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PWAqoX0R?url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/changes-for-solar-in-germany/150/452/77990/|archivedate=12 May 2014|date=3 April 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of the [[German Renewable Energy Act|EEG]] only guarantees financial assistance as long as the overall PV capacity has not yet reached 52 GW. It also foresees to regulate annual PV growth within a range of 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW by adjusting the guaranteed fees accordingly. The legislative reforms stipulates a 40 to 45 percent share from renewable energy sources by 2025 and a 55 to 60 percent share by 2035.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Erneuerbare-Energien/eeg-reform.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Solar power in Spain}}

[[Spain]] was an early adopter in the development of solar energy, since it is one of the countries of Europe with more hours of sunshine. The Spanish government committed to achieving a target of 12&amp;nbsp;percent of primary energy from renewable energy by 2010 with an installed solar generating capacity of 3000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatts]] (MW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.enn.com/energy/article/38265 |title= Spain expects 3,000 MW in solar plants by 2010 |date= September 25, 2008 |work= |publisher= Environmental News Network |accessdate= 2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain is the top tenth in the installed PV solar capacity and used to export 80&amp;nbsp;percent of solar power output to [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="sunny"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2006/2006-06-30-02.asp | title= Sunny Spain to Host Europe's First Large Solar Thermal Plant |date= June 30, 2006 |publisher= Environment News Service | accessdate= 2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total solar power in [[Spain]] reached nearly 7&amp;nbsp;GW by the end of 2016 including both installed PV and CSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol/series-estadisticas/series-estadisticas-nacionales|title=Red Eléctrica de España {{!}} Series estadísticas nacionales|website=www.ree.es|language=es|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 8 TWh of electricity was generated from photovoltaics, and 5 TWh from CSP plants in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ree.es/en/statistical-data-of-spanish-electrical-system/statistical-series/national-statistical-series|title=National statistical series {{!}} Red Eléctrica de España|website=www.ree.es|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar PV accounted for nearly 3% of total electricity generation in 2016 along with an additional of 1.9% from solar thermal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=6|title=iea-pvps.org - Annual Reports|website=www.iea-pvps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a ministerial ruling in March 2004, the Spanish government removed economic barriers to the connection of renewable energy technologies to the electricity grid. The Royal Decree 436/2004 equalized conditions for large-scale [[solar thermal]] and [[photovoltaic]] plants and guaranteed [[Feed-in Tariff|feed-in tariffs]], which led to a boost in solar power adoption in Spain.&lt;ref name="spain"&gt;[http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf Spain pioneers grid-connected solar-tower thermal power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184114/http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[2008–2009 Spanish financial crisis|2008 financial crisis]], the Spanish government drastically cut its subsidies for solar power and capped future increases in capacity at 500&amp;nbsp;MW per year leading to a stagnation in the new installations.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news

[[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] near [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]], was in September 2010 the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]] with an [[installed capacity]] of 80&amp;nbsp;[[Watt-peak|MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/10/04/sarnia-enbridge-solar-farm.html Enbridge completes Sarnia solar farm] Retrieved 5 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; until surpassed by a plant in China. The Sarnia plant covers {{convert|950|acre}} and contains about 966,000 square metres (96.6&amp;nbsp;ha), which is about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million thin film panels. The expected annual energy yield is about 120,000&amp;nbsp;MW·h, which if produced in a coal-fired plant would require emission of 39,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.

Canada has many regions that are sparsely populated and difficult to access, but also does not have optimal access to sunlight given the high latitudes of much of the country. Photovoltaic cells are increasingly used as standalone units, mostly as off-grid distributed electricity generation to power remote homes, telecommunications equipment, oil and pipeline monitoring stations and navigational devices. The Canadian PV market has grown quickly and Canadian companies make solar modules, controls, specialized water pumps, high efficiency refrigerators and solar lighting systems.&lt;ref name=sol&gt;{{cite web |title=Another Sunny Year for Solar Power |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725035832/http://worldwatch.org/node/5449 |archivedate=25 July 2011|url=http://worldwatch.org/node/5449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario has subsidized solar power energy to promote its growth.

One of the most important uses for PV cells is in northern communities, many of which depend on high-cost [[diesel fuel]] to generate electricity. Since the 1970s, the federal government and industry has encouraged the development of solar technologies for these communities. Some of these efforts have focused on the use of hybrid systems that provide power 24 hours a day, using solar power when sunlight is available, in combination with another energy source.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

==Oceania==
A number of Pacific island states have committed to high percentages of renewable energy use, both to serve as an example to other countries and to cut the high costs of imported fuels. A number of solar installations have been financed and assisted by Japan, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Solar farms have gone online in [[Renewable energy in Tuvalu|Tuvalu]], [[Fiji]] and [[Kiribati]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/masdar-and-new-zealand-to-develop-solar-plant-in-solomon-islands Masdar and New Zealand to develop solar plant in Solomon Islands], ''The National'' (Abu Dhabi), October 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund solar projects completed by [[Masdar]] in 2016 included: 1MW in the [[Solomon Islands]], 500&amp;nbsp;kW in [[Nauru]], 600&amp;nbsp;kW in the [[Marshall Islands]], 600&amp;nbsp;kW in [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]] and a 450&amp;nbsp;kW solar-diesel hybrid plant in [[Palau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/masdar-completes-five-solar-and-wind-projects-in-the-pacific Masdar completes five solar and wind projects in the Pacific], ''The National'', Abu Dhabi Media, LeAnne Graves, May 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395295579132.html UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund accomplishes 11 clean energy projects delivered by Masdar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517105738/http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395295579132.html |date=2016-05-17 }}, Emirates News Agency, 17 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; American Samoa has 2 MW of solar installed at Pago Pago Airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/279857/american-samoa-embracing-more-solar-power American Samoa embracing more solar power], Radio New Zealand, 28 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Solar power in Australia}}

Australia had over 10,131 megawatts (MW) of installed photovoltaic (PV) solar power by September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses|title=Australian PV market since April 2001|work=apvi.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar power station in [[Australia]] is the 220 MW [[Bungala Solar Power Project|Bungala]] solar plant. Other significant solar arrays include the 150 MW Coleambally Solar Farm, 148 MW Ross River Solar Farm, 124 MW [[Sun Metals Solar Farm]] and the 110 MW [[Darling Downs Solar Farm]].

A 9 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (megawatts, electrical) solar thermal `coal saver' system was constructed at Liddell power station. The system used `compact linear Fresnel reflector' technology developed in Australia. It provided solar-powered steam to the 600&amp;nbsp;MW black coal power station's boiler [[feedwater heater]]. By 2016, it was "effectively" closed and an effort to build a similar 40 MW solar boost at Kogan Creek coal power station was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/cs-energy-pulls-plug-on-worlds-largest-solar-booster-project-16737 CS Energy pulls plug on world's largest "solar booster" project], Renew Economy, Giles Parkinson, 21 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{main|Solar power in New Zealand}}

Solar power in New Zealand currently only generates 0.1 percent of New Zealand's electricity since more emphasis has been placed on hydroelectric, geothermal, and wind power in New Zealand's push for renewable energy. Solar power systems were installed in 42 schools in New Zealand in the Schoolgen program, a program developed by [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] to educate students in solar power. Each participating school has a 2&amp;nbsp;kW solar panel. Between February 2007 and 29 December 29, 2012, 395.714 MWh were produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolgen.co.nz/ Schoolgen]&lt;/ref&gt;

TCR designs and operates voluntary and compliance greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting programs globally, and assists organizations in measuring, reporting and verifying the carbon in their operations in order to manage and reduce it. TCR also consults with governments nationally and internationally on all aspects of GHG measurement, reporting, and verification.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theclimateregistry.org/who-we-are/about-us/|title=About Us {{!}} The Climate Registry|website=www.theclimateregistry.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Established in 2007, The Climate Registry was formed to continue the work of the California Climate Action Registry (CCAR). Created by the State of California in 2001, CCAR promoted and protected businesses’ early actions to manage and reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through the state mandate, CCAR established protocols to guide emissions inventories and manage an online reporting tool, the Climate Action Registry Reporting Tool (CARROT), to serve as a central database for emissions reports.  Members of CCAR served as true leaders in environmental responsibility and were among the first in the world to measure their emissions according to comprehensive and rigorous standards and make their emissions publicly accessible online. Together, CCAR and its members influenced California climate change policy, including Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), and worked to ensure proper recognition from the state for early actions to reduce emissions.  Recognizing climate change is a global issue and that success in emissions reporting must be based on consistent data in an integrated system that stretched beyond California’s borders, CCAR was instrumental in establishing TCR with the mission of expanding CCAR’s emissions reporting work to include all of North America.  CCAR accepted its last emissions inventory reports for 2009 in December 2010 and officially transitioned its members to The Climate Registry.  CCAR is now a program of The Climate Registry’s sister organization, the Climate Action Reserve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''tornado family''' is a series of [[tornado]]es spawned by the same [[supercell]] thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=spotterglossary4#t A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather Terms for Storm Spotters]&lt;/ref&gt; These families form a line of successive or parallel tornado paths and can cover a short span or a vast distance. Tornado families are sometimes mistaken as a single continuous tornado, especially prior to the 1970s. Sometimes the tornado tracks can overlap and expert analysis is necessary to determine whether or not damage was created by a family or a single tornado.&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Doswell |first = Charles A., III |author2=D. W. Burgess  |title = On Some Issues of United States Tornado Climatology |journal = Mon. Wea.

Davies |author2=C. A. Doswell |author3=D. W. Burgess |author4=J. F. Weaver  |title = Some Noteworthy Aspects of the Hesston, Kansas, Tornado Family of 13 March 1990 |journal = Bull. Amer. Meteor.

Some tornado damage remains a mystery even today due to a lack of evidence. The [[Tri-State Tornado]] of March 1925 was one such tornado. It could either have been the longest single tornado recorded or a family of tornadoes. A thorough re-analyses project found that it was probably one continuous tornado for most of its path, likely bounded by separate tornadoes at the beginning and end of the very long track (VLT) tornado, and likely another significant tornado spawned many miles later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Johns |first = Robert H. |authorlink = Robert H. Johns |author2=D. W. Burgess |author3=C. A. Doswell III |author4=M. S. Gilmore |author5=J. A. Hart |author6=S. F. Piltz |title = The 1925 Tri-State Tornado Damage Path and Associated Storm System |journal = E-Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology |volume = 8 |issue = 2 |pages = |year = 2013 |url = http://www.ejssm.org/ojs/index.php/ejssm/issue/view/44 |doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other exceptionally VLT events were later found to be tornado families with much shorter tornado path segments than originally thought, notably the [[1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes|Woodward, Oklahoma tornado family]] of April 1947 and the [[May–June 1917 tornado outbreak sequence|Charleston-Mattoon, Illinois tornado family]] of May 1917.&lt;ref name="issues"/&gt;

Tornado families can be a result of [[satellite tornado]]es, [[cyclic tornadogenesis]], or some combination thereof. Intense [[downburst]]s may also cause damage paths to appear continuous, although this was more an issue for historic tornadoes as such damage usually is now distinguishable as from [[straight-line wind]]s. Especially when newly forming, tornadoes may sometimes exhibit brief breaks in the damage path even as the parent circulation is continuous. Such events may be considered as "[[Skipping tornado|skipping]]", a term that originally referred to what now is typically a tornado family. Successive tornadoes may be considered by some as separate tornadoes (and thus constituting a tornado family) only when spawned by a new [[tornadocyclone]] or low-level [[mesocyclone]] (and [[wall cloud]]).{{cn|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Margaryn 022.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Margarine]], a common product that can contain trans fatty acids]]
{{Fats}}
'''Trans fat''', also called '''unsaturated fatty acids''' or '''trans fatty acids''', are a type of [[unsaturated fat]] that occur in small amounts in nature,&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; but became widely produced industrially from vegetable fats starting in the 1950s for use in [[margarine]], snack food, packaged baked goods, and for frying fast food.&lt;ref name=CSPI1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="GRAS?"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/08/2013-26854/tentative-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-request-for-comments-and-for |title=Tentative Determination Regarding Partially Hydrogenated Oils |publisher=[[Federal Register]] |date=8 November 2013 |access-date=8 November 2013 |id=2013-26854, Vol. 78, No. 217 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406185048/https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/08/2013-26854/tentative-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-request-for-comments-and-for |archive-date=6 April 2014 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trans fat has been shown to be associated consistently, in an intake-dependent way, with increased risk of [[coronary artery disease]], a leading cause of death in Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2013-N-1317-0198|title=Mar 8 2014 FDA filing by Harvard School of Public Health – on the Tentative Determination Regarding Partially Hydrogenated Oils; Request for Comments and for Scientific Data and Information |publisher=regulations.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fats contain long [[hydrocarbon]] chains, which can be either unsaturated, i.e., have [[double bond]]s, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have [[Cis–trans isomerism|''cis'' as opposed to ''trans'']] configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0001-37652007000200015 |last1=Martin |first1=C. A. |last2=Milinsk |first2=M. C. |last3=Visentainer |first3=J. V. |last4=Matsushita |first4=M. |last5=De-Souza |first5=N. E. |title=Trans fatty acid-forming processes in foods: A review |journal=Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=343–350 |year=2007 |pmid=17625687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40&amp;nbsp;°C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an [[isomerization reaction]] with the [[catalyst]] used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.&lt;ref name=CSPI1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/trans_q_a.pdf |title=About Trans Fat and Partially Hydrogenated Oils |publisher=[[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRAS?" /&gt;

Although trans fats are edible, consuming trans fats has been shown to increase the risk of [[coronary artery disease]] in part by raising levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL, often termed "bad cholesterol"), lowering levels of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL, often termed "good cholesterol"), increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation.&lt;ref name=p423&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary reference intakes for energy, carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids (macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=423|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309085373/html/423.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans fat: Avoid this cholesterol double whammy|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/trans-fat/CL00032|access-date=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans fats also occur naturally, e.g., [[vaccenic acid]] and some [[isomers]] of [[conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA). These trans fats occur naturally in meat and dairy products from [[ruminant]]s. Butter, for example, contains about 3% trans fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/1?fgcd=&amp;manu=&amp;lfacet=&amp;format=&amp;count=&amp;max=50&amp;offset=50&amp;sort=default&amp;order=asc&amp;qlookup=butter&amp;ds=&amp;qt=&amp;qp=&amp;qa=&amp;qn=&amp;q=&amp;ing= |title=National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 28 |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Canadian studies have shown that vaccenic acid could be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total LDL and triglyceride levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/2608879/trans-fats-from-ruminant-animals-may-be-beneficial Trans Fats From Ruminant Animals May Be Beneficial – Health News]. redOrbit (8 September 2011).

In many countries, there are legal limits to trans fat content. Trans fats levels can be reduced or eliminated using saturated fats such as [[lard]], [[palm oil]], or fully hydrogenated fats, or by using [[interesterified fat]]. Other alternative formulations can also allow unsaturated fats to be used to replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats. Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for trans fat: complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated fats.

[[File:Crisco Cookbook 1912.jpg|thumb|Cover of original Crisco cookbook, 1912]]

[[Nobel prize|Nobel]] [[laureate]] [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] worked in the late 1890s to develop the chemistry of hydrogenation, which enabled the [[margarine]], oil hydrogenation, and synthetic [[methanol]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nobel Lectures, Chemistry, 1901–1921|year=1966|publisher=Elsevier}} Reprinted online: {{cite web|title=Paul Sabatier, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1912|publisher=Nobel Foundation|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1912/sabatier-bio.html|access-date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Sabatier considered hydrogenation of only vapors, the German [[chemist]] [[Wilhelm Normann]] showed in 1901 that liquid oils could be hydrogenated, and patented the process in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|de|141029|Process for converting unsaturated fatty acids or their glycerides into saturated compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|gb|190301515|Process for converting unsaturated fatty acids or their glycerides into saturated compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson |first=HBW |title=Hydrogenation |journal=Sci Lecture Papers Series |year=1998 |url=http://www.soci.org/SCI/publications/2001/pdf/pb97.pdf |access-date=7 January 2007 |format=PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926141346/http://www.soci.org/SCI/publications/2001/pdf/pb97.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1905–1910, Normann built a fat-hardening facility in the [[Herford]] company. At the same time, the invention was extended to a large-scale plant in [[Warrington]], England, at [[Joseph Crosfield|Joseph Crosfield &amp; Sons, Limited]]. It took only two years until the hardened fat could be successfully produced in the plant in Warrington, commencing production in the autumn of 1909. The initial year's production totalled nearly 3,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgfett.de/history/normann/nr_fiedler.htm|title=Wilhelm Normann und die Geschichte der Fetthärtung von Martin Fiedler, 2001|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1909, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] acquired the United States rights to the Normann patent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Shurtleff|first1=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|title=History of Soybeans and Soyfoods: 1100 B.C. to the 1980s|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018105337/http://www.thesoydailyclub.com/SFC/MSPproducts501.asp|url=http://www.thesoydailyclub.com/SFC/MSPproducts501.asp|archive-date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1911, they began marketing the first hydrogenated [[shortening]], [[Crisco]] (composed largely of partially hydrogenated [[cottonseed oil]]). Further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for Crisco.

Normann's hydrogenation process made it possible to stabilize affordable [[whale oil]] or [[fish oil]] for human consumption, a practice kept secret to avoid consumer distaste.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Before 1910, dietary fats in industrialized nations consisted mostly of [[butterfat]], beef [[tallow]], and [[lard]]. During Napoleon's reign in France in the early 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk. It was not accepted in the United States. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the United States as a source of protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the ''need'' (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of a refrigerator and immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat. Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and [[Spry Vegetable Shortening|Spry]], sold in England, began to replace butter and lard in baking bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred A. Kummerow|title=Cholesterol Won't Kill You – But Trans Fat Could|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4251-3808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of hydrogenated fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries. At first, the argument was a financial one due to lower costs; advocates also said that the unsaturated trans fats of margarine were healthier than the [[saturated fat]]s of butter.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC |title=Trans fatty acids and coronary heart disease|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/reviews/transfats.html|access-date=14 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903061226/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/reviews/transfats.html|archive-date=3 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1956, there were suggestions in the scientific literature that ''trans'' fats could be a cause of the large increase in [[coronary artery disease]] but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Booyens"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Booyens J, Louwrens CC, Katzeff IE |title=The role of unnatural dietary trans and cis unsaturated fatty acids in the epidemiology of coronary artery disease|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=1988|volume=25|issue=3|pages=175–182|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(88)90055-2|pmid=3367809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, by the 1980s, fats of animal origin had become one of the greatest concerns of dieticians. Activists, such as [[Phil Sokolof]], who took out full page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of [[beef tallow]] in McDonald's french fries and urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils. The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to trans fats.

Studies in the early 1990s, however, brought renewed scrutiny and confirmation of the negative health impact of trans fats. In 1994, it was estimated that trans fats caused 20,000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease.&lt;ref name="pmid8179036"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Willett WC, Ascherio A |title=Trans fatty acids: are the effects only marginal?|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1995|volume=84|issue=5|pages=722–4|pmid=8179036|pmc=1615057|doi=10.2105/AJPH.84.5.722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory food labeling for ''trans'' fats was introduced in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Approaches to removing trans fats from the food supply in industrialized and developing countries|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=63|pages=S50–7|year=2009|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.14|issue=Suppl 1|pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;|last1=l'Abbé|first1=M R|last2=Stender|first2=S|last3=Skeaff|first3=C M|last4=Ghafoorunissa|last5=Tavella|first5=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/14/oreo.suit/|title=Lawsuit dropped as Oreo looks to drop the fat|publisher=CNN|date=14 May 2003|access-date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, faced with the prospect of an outright ban on the sale of their product, Crisco was reformulated to meet the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) definition of "zero grams trans fats per serving" (that is less than one gram per tablespoon, or up to 7% by weight; or less than 0.5 grams per serving size)&lt;ref name="21CFR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newswise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shock" /&gt; by boosting the saturation and then diluting the resulting solid fat with unsaturated vegetable oils.

==Chemistry==
In chemical terms, ''trans fat'' is a fat (lipid) molecule that contains one or more double bonds in ''trans'' geometric configuration.

A double bond may exhibit one of two possible configurations: ''trans'' or ''cis''. In ''trans'' configuration, the carbon chain extends from opposite sides of the double bond, whereas, in ''cis'' configuration, the carbon chain extends from the same side of the double bond. The ''trans'' molecule is a straighter molecule. The ''cis'' molecule is bent.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Erasmus; ''Fats that heal, Fats that Kill'', Alive books, 1993 edition, Pages 13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fatty acid is characterized as either ''saturated'' or ''unsaturated'' based on the presence of double bonds in its structure. If the molecule contains no double bonds, it is said to be saturated; otherwise, it is unsaturated to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food lipids: chemistry, nutrition, and biotechnology|pages=1–2|isbn=978-0-8247-0749-1|editors=Casimir C. Akoh, David B. Min.|year=2002|publisher=M. Dekker|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02330.html|chapter="fatty acid"|title=IUPAC Gold book|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only unsaturated fats can be ''trans'' ''or'' ''cis'' fat, since only a double bond can be locked to these orientations. Saturated fatty acids are never called ''trans fats'' because they have no double bonds. Thus, all their bonds are freely rotatable. Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a [[triple bond]], are rare and of no nutritional significance.{{citation needed|date=September 2015|reason=How do we know triple bonds are rare and don't matter?}}

Carbon atoms are [[tetravalent]], forming four [[covalent bond]]s with other atoms, whereas hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom. In saturated fatty acids, each carbon atom (besides the last) is connected to its two neighbour carbon atoms and to two hydrogen atoms. In unsaturated fatty acids, the carbon atoms that are missing a hydrogen atom are joined by double bonds rather than single bonds so that each carbon atom participates in four bonds.

[[File:Wilhelm Normann.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Normann]] patented the hydrogenation of liquid oils in 1902]]

[[Hydrogenation]] of an unsaturated fatty acid refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms to the acid, causing double bonds to become single ones, as carbon atoms acquire new hydrogen partners (to maintain four bonds per carbon atom). Full hydrogenation results in a molecule containing the maximum amount of hydrogen (in other words, the conversion of an unsaturated fatty acid into a saturated one). Partial hydrogenation results in the addition of hydrogen atoms at some of the empty positions, with a corresponding reduction in the number of double bonds. Typical commercial hydrogenation is partial to obtain a [[malleable]] mixture of fats that is solid at [[room temperature]], but melts during baking, or consumption.

In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain (''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' configuration – from the Latin, meaning "on the same side"). However, partial hydrogenation reconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated, twisting them so that the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain. This type of configuration is called ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'', from the Latin, meaning "across".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=John W. |last2=Kolb|first2=Doris K|lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0136054498|title=Chemistry for changing times|publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trans configuration is the lower energy form, and is favored when catalytically equilibrated as a side reaction in hydrogenation.

The same molecule, containing the same number of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a ''trans'' or a ''cis'' fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, [[oleic acid]] and [[elaidic acid]] are both unsaturated fatty acids with the [[chemical formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart. The configuration has implications for the [[physical chemistry|physical-chemical]] properties of the molecule. The ''trans'' configuration is straighter, while the ''cis'' configuration is noticeably kinked as can be seen from the three-dimensional representation shown above.

The ''trans'' fatty acid elaidic acid has different chemical and physical properties, owing to the slightly different bond configuration. It has a much higher melting point, 45&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]], than oleic acid, 13.4&amp;nbsp;°C, due to the ability of the trans molecules to pack more tightly, forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of chemistry and physics|url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com|access-date=19 November 2007|edition=88th|series=2007–2008|year=2007|publisher=Taylor and Francis|chapter=Section 7: Biochemistry|chapterurl=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/articles/07_05_86.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures.

In food production, the goal is not to simply change the configuration of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon. Instead, the goal is to decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid. This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to [[rancidity]] (in which free [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] attack double bonds). Production of trans fatty acids is thus an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.

Catalytic partial hydrogenation necessarily produces ''trans''-fats, because of the [[Hydrogenation#Heterogeneous catalysis|reaction mechanism]]. In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid. The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either ''cis'' or ''trans'', of which ''trans'' is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced ''trans'' fats to give saturated fats.

Researchers at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] have investigated whether hydrogenation can be achieved without the side effect of trans fat production. They varied the [[pressure]] under which the chemical reaction was conducted – applying 1400&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (200&amp;nbsp;[[pound-force per square inch|psi]]) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140&amp;nbsp;°C and 170&amp;nbsp;°C. The standard 140&amp;nbsp;kPa (20&amp;nbsp;psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eller FJ|title=Preparation of spread oils meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling requirements for trans fatty acids via pressure-controlled hydrogenation|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|year=2005|volume=53|issue=15|pages=5982–5984|pmid=16028984|doi=10.1021/jf047849|last2=List|first2=GR|last3=Teel|first3=JA|last4=Steidley|first4=KR|last5=Adlof|first5=RO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation.

Trans fat levels may be measured. Measurement techniques include [[chromatography]] (by [[silver ion chromatography]] on [[thin layer chromatography]] plates, or small [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] columns of [[silica gel]] with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions). The role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds. [[Gas chromatography]] and mid-[[infrared spectroscopy]] are other methods in use.

A type of trans fat occurs naturally in the milk and body fat of [[ruminant]]s (such as cattle and sheep) at a level of 2–5% of total fat.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force|title=TRANSforming the Food Supply|date=June 2006|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_rep-rap_e.html|access-date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural ''trans'' fats, which include [[conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA) and [[vaccenic acid]], originate in the [[rumen]] of these animals. CLA has two double bonds, one in the ''cis'' configuration and one in ''trans'', which makes it simultaneously a ''cis''- and a ''trans''-fatty acid.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Animal-based fats were once the only ''trans'' fats consumed, but by far the largest amount of ''trans'' fat consumed today is created by the processed food industry as a side effect of partially hydrogenating unsaturated plant fats (generally vegetable oils). These partially hydrogenated fats have displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas, the most notable ones being in the fast food, [[snack food]], fried food, and baked goods industries.&lt;ref name=Ashok&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ashok |first1=Chauhan |last2=Ajit |first2=Varma |date=2009 |page=181 |chapter=Chapter 4: Fatty acids |title=A Textbook of Molecular Biotechnology |isbn=978-93-80026-37-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partially hydrogenated oils have been used in food for many reasons. Hydrogenation increases product [[shelf life]] and decreases refrigeration requirements. Many baked foods require semi-solid fats to suspend solids at room temperature; partially hydrogenated oils have the right consistency to replace animal fats such as butter and [[lard]] at lower cost. They are also an inexpensive alternative to other semi-solid oils such as [[palm oil]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

These partially hydrogenated fats have displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas, the most notable ones being in the fast food, [[snack food]], fried food, and baked goods industries.]]

Up to 45% of the total fat in those foods containing artificial ''trans'' fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may be ''trans'' fat.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; Baking shortenings, unless reformulated, contain around 30% ''trans'' fats compared to their total fats. High-fat dairy products such as butter contain about 4%. Margarines not reformulated to reduce ''trans'' fats may contain up to 15% ''trans'' fat by weight,&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=JE|year=2005|title=Dietary levels of trans fatty acids" basis for health concerns and industry efforts to limit use|journal=Nutrition Research|volume=25|pages=499–513|doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2005.04.002|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some reformulated ones are less than 1% trans fat.

It has been established that ''trans'' fats in human [[breast milk]] fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat, and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk. In 1999, reported percentages of trans fats (compared to total fats) in human milk ranged from 1% in Spain, 2% in France, 4% in Germany, and 7% in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Innis|first1=Sheila M|last2=King|first2=D Janette|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Trans fatty acids in human milk are inversely associated with concentrations of essential all-cis n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and determine trans, but not n-6 and n-3, fatty acids in plasma lipids of breast-fed infants|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=1 September 1999|volume=70|issue=3|pages=383–390|pmid=10479201|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/383.abstract|doi=10.1093/ajcn/70.3.383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans fats are used in shortenings for deep-frying in restaurants, as they can be used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NYC Board of Health |title=Board of Health Approves Regulation to Phase Out Artificial Trans Fat: FAQ |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cardio/cardio-transfat-healthcode-faq.shtml#7 |access-date=7 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006022908/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cardio/cardio-transfat-healthcode-faq.shtml |archive-date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of [[McDonald's]] French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in [[Hungary]], and 28 times as much as in [[Denmark]], where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's in that french fry?

==Nutritional guidelines==

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) advises the United States and Canadian governments on nutritional science for use in public policy and product labeling programs. Their 2002 ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|pages=i|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/R1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918061042/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/R1.html|archive-date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains their findings and recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat ([http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309085373/html/423.html summary]).

Their recommendations are based on two key facts. First, "trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health",&lt;ref name=p423/&gt; whether of animal or plant origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=447|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/447.html}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, while both saturated and trans fats increase levels of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]], trans fats also lower levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]];&lt;ref name=p504&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary reference intakes for energy, carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids (macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=504|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/504.html}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing the risk of coronary artery disease. The NAS is concerned "that dietary trans fatty acids are more deleterious with respect to coronary artery disease than saturated fatty acids".&lt;ref name=p504/&gt; This analysis is supported by a 2006 [[New England Journal of Medicine]] (NEJM) scientific review that states "from a nutritional standpoint, the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit."&lt;ref name=nejmreview&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC |title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|year=2006|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|pmid=16611951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;ref name=p504/&gt;

Despite this concern, the NAS dietary recommendations have not included eliminating trans fat from the diet. This is because trans fat is naturally present in many animal foods in trace quantities, and thus its removal from ordinary diets might introduce undesirable side effects and nutritional imbalances if proper nutritional planning is not undertaken. The NAS has, thus, "recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=424|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/424.html}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the NAS, the [[World Health Organization]] has tried to balance public health goals with a practical level of trans fat consumption, recommending in 2003 that trans fats be limited to less than 1% of overall energy intake.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;

The US National Dairy Council has asserted that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils, and do not appear to exhibit the same negative effects.&lt;ref name=dairy&gt;{{cite journal| author=National Dairy Council|title=comments on 'Docket No. 2003N-0076 Food Labeling: Trans Fatty Acids in Nutrition Labeling'|date=18 June 2004|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/04/June04/062304/03N-0076-emc00228-01.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion (stating that "the sum of the current evidence suggests that the Public health implications of consuming trans fats from ruminant products are relatively limited"), it cautions that this may be due to the low consumption of trans fats from animal sources compared to artificial ones.&lt;ref name=nejmreview/&gt;

More recent inquiry (independent of the dairy industry) has found in a 2008 Dutch meta-analysis that all trans fats, regardless of natural or artificial origin equally raise LDL and lower HDL levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brouwer |first1=I.

Although CLA is known for its anticancer properties, researchers have also found that the cis-9, trans-11 form of CLA can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease and help fight inflammation.&lt;ref name="Tricon S, Burdge GC, Kew S, et al. 2004 614–20"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tricon S |title=Opposing effects of cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid on blood lipids in most healthy humans |journal=Am.

==Health risks==
Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils have been an increasingly significant part of the human diet for about 100 years (in particular, since the later half of the 20th century and where more processed foods are consumed),&lt;ref name="Alfonso Valenzuel, Nora Morgado 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10983247|title=Trans fatty acid isomers in human health and in the food industry|journal=Biological Research|volume=32 |issue=4 |year=1999|doi=10.4067/s0716-97601999000400007|pages=273–87 |last1=Valenzuela |first1=A |last2=Morgado |first2=N}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some deleterious effects of trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted, forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above.

The exact [[biochemistry|biochemical]] process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research. One theory is that the human lipase enzyme works only on the cis configuration and cannot metabolize a trans fat although this theory has been overturned by the recognition that trans fat is metabolized but competitively inhibits the metabolism of other fatty acids.&lt;ref name="Booyens"/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body's ability to metabolize [[essential fatty acid]]s (EFAs, including [[Omega-3 fatty acid|Omega-3]]) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta, the main artery of the heart, thereby raising risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kummerow FA1, Zhou Q, Mahfouz MM, Smiricky MR, Grieshop CM, Schaeffer DJ|title=Trans fatty acids in hydrogenated fat inhibited the synthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipid of arterial cells|journal=Life Sci. |volume=74 |issue=22 |pages=2707–23|year=2004|pmid=15043986|doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2003.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the mechanisms through which trans fatty acids contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood, the mechanism for their effects on diabetes is still under investigation. They may impair the metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC |title=Influence of trans fatty acids on infant and fetus development|journal=Acta Microbiologica Polonica|volume=52|pages=67–74|year=2003|pmid=15058815}}&lt;/ref&gt; but maternal pregnancy trans fatty acid intake has been inversely associated with LCPUFAs levels in infants at birth thought to underlie the positive association between breastfeeding and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koletzko B, Decsi T |title=Metabolic aspects of trans fatty acids|journal=Clin Nutr|volume=16|pages=229–37|year=1997|pmid=16844601|issue=5|doi=10.1016/s0261-5614(97)80034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High intake of trans fatty acids can lead to many health problems throughout one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Menaa F, Menaa A, Menaa B, Tréton J |title=Trans-fatty acids, dangerous bonds for health?|journal=Eur J Nutr. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=1289–302|year=2013|pmid=23269652|doi=10.1007/s00394-012-0484-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are abundant in fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name="Alfonso Valenzuel, Nora Morgado 1999"/&gt; They are consumed in greater quantities by people who lack access to a diet consisting of fewer hydrogenated fats, or who often consume fast food. A diet high in trans fats can contribute to obesity, high blood pressure, and higher risk for heart disease{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Trans fat has also been implicated in the development of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ulf Riserus|title=Trans fatty acids, insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Food and Nutrition|volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=161–165|year=2006|doi=10.1080/17482970601133114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coronary artery disease===
The primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of [[coronary artery disease]] (CHD).&lt;ref name=TRANSformingApx9&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force |title=TRANSforming the Food Supply (Appendix 9iii) |date=June 2006 |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html |access-date=9 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225021532/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html |archive-date=25 February 2007}} (Consultation on the health implications of alternatives to trans fatty acids: Summary of Responses from Experts)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 study estimated that over 30,000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States are attributable to the consumption of trans fats.&lt;ref name="pmid8179036" /&gt; By 2006 upper estimates of 100,000 deaths were suggested.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zaloga GP, Harvey KA, Stillwell W, Siddiqui R |title=Trans Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume=21|pages=505–512|year=2006|doi=10.1177/0115426506021005505|pmid=16998148|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review of studies of trans fats published in 2006 in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] reports a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and CHD, concluding that "On a per-calorie basis, trans fats appear to increase the risk of CHD more than any other macronutrient, conferring a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption (1 to 3% of total energy intake)".&lt;ref name=nejmreview/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16611951"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC |title=Trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease|journal=N.

The major evidence for the effect of trans fat on CHD comes from the [[Nurses' Health Study]] – a [[cohort study]] that has been following 120,000 female nurses since its inception in 1976. In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's [[statistical population|population]] during 14 years of followup. He determined that a nurse's CHD risk roughly doubled ([[relative risk]] of 1.93, [[confidence interval|CI]]: 1.43 to 2.61) for each 2% increase in trans fat calories consumed (instead of carbohydrate calories). By contrast, for each 5% increase in saturated fat calories (instead of carbohydrate calories) there was a 17% increase in risk ([[relative risk]] of 1.17, [[confidence interval|CI]]: 0.97 to 1.41). "The replacement of saturated fat or trans unsaturated fat by cis (unhydrogenated) unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates."&lt;ref name=nhs97&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=FB|year=1997|title=Dietary fat intake and the risk of coronary heart disease in women|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=21|pages=1491–1499|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711203372102|format=PDF|pmid=9366580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption. Replacing 2% of [[food energy]] from trans fat with non-trans [[unsaturated fat]]s more than halves the risk of CHD (53%). By comparison, replacing a larger 5% of food energy from saturated fat with non-trans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of CHD by 43%.&lt;ref name=nhs97/&gt;

Another study considered deaths due to CHD, with consumption of trans fats being linked to an increase in mortality, and consumption of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s being linked to a decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name=TRANSformingApx9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oh|first1=K.|last2=Hu|first2=F.B.|last3=Manson|first3=J.E.|last4=Stampfer|first4=M.J.|last5=Willett|first5=W.C.|year=2005|title=Dietary fat intake and risk of coronary heart disease in women: 20 years of follow-up of the nurses' health study|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=161|issue=7|pages=672–679|doi=10.1093/aje/kwi085|pmid=15781956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two accepted tests that measure an individual's risk for coronary artery disease, both [[blood test]]s. The first considers [[ratio]]s of two types of [[cholesterol]], the other the amount of a cell-signalling [[cytokine]] called [[C-reactive protein]]. The ratio test is more accepted, while the cytokine test may be more powerful but is still being studied.&lt;ref name=TRANSformingApx9/&gt; The effect of trans fat consumption has been documented on each as follows:
* Cholesterol ratio: This ratio compares the levels of [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] to [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]]. Trans fat behaves like [[saturated fat]] by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trans fatty acids and coronary heart disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1999|volume=340|issue=25|pages=1994–1998|doi=10.1056/NEJM199906243402511|pmid=10379026 |last1=Ascherio |first1=A |last2=Katan |first2=MB |last3=Zock |first3=PL |last4=Stampfer |first4=MJ |last5=Willett |first5=WC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mensink |first1=RPM |last2=Katan |first2=MB |year=1990 |title=Effect of dietary ''trans'' fatty acids on high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in healthy subjects |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=323 |issue=7 |pages=439–45 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199008163230703|pmid=2374566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mensink |display-authors=etal |year=2003 |title=Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials |url= |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=1146–55 |pmid=12716665|doi=10.1093/ajcn/77.5.1146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Higher ratios are worse.) One randomized [[crossover study]] published in 2003 comparing the effect [[postprandial|of eating a meal]] on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans fat rich meals showed that [[cholesteryl ester]] transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in [[apolipoprotein]](a) after the trans meals.&lt;ref name="gatto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gatto|first1=Lissa M|last2=Sullivan|first2=David R.|last3=Samman|first3=Samir|title=Postprandial effects of dietary trans fatty acids on apolipoprotein(a) and cholesteryl ester transfer|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=2003|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1119–1124|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/77/5/1119.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=12716661|doi=10.1093/ajcn/77.5.1119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other health risks===
There are suggestions that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk. In general, there is much less scientific consensus asserting that eating trans fat specifically increases the risk of other chronic health problems:
* [[Alzheimer's Disease]]: A study published in [[Archives of Neurology]] in February 2003 suggested that the intake of both trans fats and saturated fats promote the development of Alzheimer disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Arch Neurol|year=2003|volume=60|issue=2|pages=194–200|title=Dietary fats and the risk of incident Alzheimer disease|vauthors=Morris MC, Evans DA, Bienias JL, Tangney CC, Bennett DA, Aggarwal N, Schneider J, Wilson RS |pmid=12580703|doi=10.1001/archneur.60.2.194}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not confirmed in an animal model.&lt;ref name=phivilay /&gt; It has been found that trans fats impaired memory and learning in middle-age rats. The trans-fat eating rats' brains had fewer proteins critical to healthy neurological function. Inflammation in and around the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning and memory. These are the exact types of changes normally seen at the onset of Alzheimer's, but seen after six weeks, even though the rats were still young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Granholm |first1=A.

TFAs enhanced intra-abdominal deposition of fat, even in the absence of caloric excess, and were associated with insulin resistance, with evidence that there is impaired post-insulin receptor binding signal transduction."&lt;ref name="Obesity 2007"/&gt;
* [[Liver function|Liver dysfunction]]: Trans fats are metabolized differently by the [[liver]] than other fats and interfere with delta 6 [[desaturase]]. Delta 6 desaturase is an [[enzyme]] involved in converting essential fatty acids to [[arachidonic acid]] and [[prostaglandin]]s, both of which are important to the functioning of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mahfouz M|title=Effect of dietary trans fatty acids on the delta 5, delta 6 and delta 9 desaturases of rat liver microsomes in vivo|journal=Acta Biologica et Medica Germanica|year=1981|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1699–1705|pmid=7345825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response and regulation==

===International===
The international trade in food is standardized in the [[Codex Alimentarius]]. Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/74/CXS_019e.pdf|title=Codex Stan 19-1999|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-dairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 256-2007.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Stan 256–2007 [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10742/CXS_256e.pdf "Standard for Fat Spreads and Blended Spreads"] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Codex Alimentarius, trans fat to be labelled as such is defined as the geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated [interrupted by at least one methylene group (−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−)] carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration. This definition excludes specifically the trans fats ([[vaccenic acid]] and [[conjugated linoleic acid]]) that are present especially in human milk, dairy products, and beef.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

in 2018 the [[World Health Organization]] launched a plan to eliminate trans fat from the global food supply. They estimate that trans fat leads to more than 500,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WHO plan to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fatty acids from global food supply |url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-05-2018-who-plan-to-eliminate-industrially-produced-trans-fatty-acids-from-global-food-supply |access-date=15 August 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since August 2006, food products should be labelled with the amount of trans fat in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anmat.gov.ar/alimentos/codigoa/Capitulo_V.pdf|title=Joint resolution SPRyRS 149/2005 and SAGPyA 683/2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, vegetable oils and fats sold to consumers directly must contain only 2% of trans fat over total fat, and other food must contain less than 5% of their total fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-159047-2010-12-21.html|title=Un corte al colesterol|publisher=Página/12|date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on 10 December 2014, Argentina has on effect a total ban on food with trans fat, a move that could save the government more than US$100 million a year on healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1748702-se-acerca-el-fin-de-las-grasas-trans-para-los-alimentos-argentinos|title=Se acerca el fin de las grasas trans para los alimentos argentinos|publisher=[[La Nación|La Nacion]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian federal government has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy to reduce trans fats from fast foods. The former federal assistant health minister, [[Christopher Pyne]], asked fast food outlets to reduce their trans fat use. A draft plan was proposed, with a September 2007 timetable, to reduce reliance on trans fats and saturated fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast food outlets asked to cut down trans fat usage |date=12 March 2007 |publisher=ABC |url=http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1869810.htm |access-date=12 March 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308124535/http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1869810.htm |archive-date=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, Australia's food labeling laws do not require trans fats to be shown separately from the total fat content. However, margarine in Australia has been mostly free of trans fat since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trans fatty acids in adipose tissue and the food supply are associated with myocardial infarction|last1=Clifton|first1=Peter M.|last2=Keogh|first2=Jennifer B.|last3=Noakes|first3=Manny|last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Nutrition|pages=874–879|volume=134|issn=0022-3166|pmid=15051840|issue=4|year=2004|doi=10.1093/jn/134.4.874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Conseil Supérieur de la Santé published in 2012 a science-policy advisory report on industrially produced trans fatty acids that focuses on the general population. Its recommendation to the legislature was to prohibit more than 2 g of trans fatty acids per 100 g of fat in food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| format=PDF| url=http://www.health.belgium.be/internet2Prd/groups/public/@public/@shc/documents/ie2divers/19080447_fr.pdf|title= acides gras trans d'origine industrielle|website=Avis du Conseil Supérieur de la Santé N° 8666|date=July 2012 |editor=Conseil Supérieur de la Santé|access-date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Resolution 360 of 23 December 2003 by the Brazilian ministry of health required for the first time in the country that the amount of trans fat to be specified in labels of food products. On 31 July 2006, such labelling of trans fat contents became mandatory. In 2007 the ministry established a target to reduce the total amount of trans fat in any industrialized food sold in Brazil to a maximum of 2% by the end of 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Canada===
In November 2004, an [[opposition day]] motion seeking a ban similar to Denmark's was introduced by [[Jack Layton]] of the [[New Democratic Party]], and passed through the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] by an overwhelming 193–73 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The motion and the vote in the Canadian House of Commons on November 23, 2004|url=http://www.bantransfats.com/canadamotion.htm|access-date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all Commons motions, it served as an expression of the views of the House but was not binding on the government and has no force under the law.

Since December 2005, [[Health Canada]] has required that food labels list the amount of trans fat in the nutrition facts section for most foods. Products with less than 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of trans fat per serving may be labeled as free of trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2003/2003-01-01/pdf/g2-13701.pdf|title=Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 137, No. 1, Page 164|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523004040/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2003/2003-01-01/pdf/g2-13701.pdf|archive-date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing.

In June 2006, a task force co-chaired by Health Canada and the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada]] recommended a limit of 5% trans fat (of total fat) in all products sold to consumers in Canada (2% for tub margarines and spreads).&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; The amount was selected such that "most of the industrially produced trans fats would be removed from the Canadian diet, and about half of the remaining trans fat intake would be of naturally occurring trans fats".

Ten months after submitting their report the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada]] and Toronto [[Public Health]] issued a plea to the government of Canada: "to act immediately on the task force's recommendations and to eliminate harmful trans fat from Canada's food supply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CBC News|title=In Depth – Trans fats|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/fats/transfats.html|access-date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public perception====
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that they looked at the ingredients, and neglected to pay attention to the amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, "Yes." However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn't change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health. "The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/h11-045| pmid = 21854161| title = Consumer perceptions of trans fats in 2009 show awareness of negative effects but limited concern regarding use in snack foods| journal = Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 526–532| year = 2011| last1 = Nasser| first1 = Roseann| last2 = Cook| first2 = Stephanie| last3 = Bashutski| first3 = Megan| last4 = Hill| first4 = Karen| last5 = Norton| first5 = Darci| last6 = Coleman| first6 = Jean| last7 = Walker| first7 = Sharon| last8 = Charlebois| first8 = Sylvain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Denmark]] became the first country to introduce laws strictly regulating the sale of many foods containing trans fats&lt;ref name=News-Medical.Net&gt;{{cite news|title=Trans Fat Regulation|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Trans-Fat-Regulation.aspx|access-date=21 June 2013|newspaper=News-Medical.Net|date=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2003, a move that effectively [[Ban (law)|bans]] partially hydrogenated oils. The limit is 2% of fats and oils destined for human consumption. This restriction is on the ''ingredients'' rather than the final products.

In October 2005, the [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA) asked for better labelling in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Richard|last=Gray|title=Forced to own up to the killer fat in our food|date=5 February 2006|work=The Scotsman |url=http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=183932006|access-date=18 January 2007|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the edition of 29 July 2006 of the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', an editorial also called for better labelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Call to label hidden fats in food|publisher=BBC|date=20 July 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5218240.stm|access-date=18 January 2007}} reporting on {{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Robert|last2=Lewington|first2=Sarah |title=Trans fatty acids and coronary heart disease: Food labels should list these as well as cholesterol and saturated fat|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=333|issue=7561|page=214|year=2006|doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7561.214|pmid=16873835|pmc=1523500}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the British Retail Consortium announced that major UK retailers, including [[Asda]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Co-op]], [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]], [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[Tesco]] and [[Waitrose]] intended to cease adding trans fatty acids to their own products by the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retailers to stop trans-fat use|date=31 January 2007|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6314753.stm|access-date=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sainsbury's]] became the first UK major retailer to ban all trans fat from all their own [[store brand]] foods.

On 13 December 2007, the [[Food Standards Agency]] issued news releases stating that voluntary measures to reduce trans fats in food had already resulted in safe levels of consumer intake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Food Standards Agency]] (13 December 2007). [http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2007/dec/trans Board recommends voluntary approach for trans fats].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Food Standards Agency]] (13 December 2007).[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2007/dec/boardtransfatadvice FSA Board to advise the Department of Health to maintain successful voluntary approach for trans fats in food].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2010, a ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' editorial called for trans fats to be "virtually eliminated in the United Kingdom by next year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mozaffarian|first1=Dariush|last2=Stampfer|first2=Meir J |doi=10.1136/bmj.c1826|pmid=20395265|title=Removing industrial ''trans'' fat from foods: A simple policy that will save lives|journal=BMJ|year=2010|volume=340|page=c1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The June 2010 [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) report ''Prevention of cardiovascular disease'' declared that 40,000 cardiovascular disease deaths in 2006 were "mostly preventable".&lt;ref name="NICE_2010"&gt;{{citation|page=31 |title=NICE public health guidance 25: Prevention of cardiovascular disease |url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-ph25 |chapter-url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-ph25/recommendations |chapter=Recommendations |last=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |location=Manchester, UK |date=June 2010 |access-date=17 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211061700/http://publications.nice.org.uk/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-ph25 |archive-date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, NICE offered 24 recommendations including product labelling, public education, protecting under–16s from marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting exercise and physically active travel, and even reforming the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] to reduce production of unhealthy foods. Fast-food outlets were mentioned as a risk factor, with (in 2007) 170 g of [[McDonald's]] fries and 160 g nuggets containing 6 to 8 g of trans fats, conferring a substantially increased risk of coronary artery disease death.&lt;ref name="NICE_2010_EP9"&gt;{{citation |pages=2, 7 |title=NICE CVD guidance expert testimony paper 9 |author=Lincoln, Paul |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph25/resources/ph25-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-expert-papers-9-trans-fats2 |access-date=17 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617144538/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph25/resources/ph25-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-expert-papers-9-trans-fats2 |archive-date=17 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE made three specific recommendation for diet: (1) reduction of dietary salt to 3 g per day by 2025; (2) halving consumption of saturated fats; and (3) eliminating the use of industrially produced trans fatty acids in food. However, the recommendations were greeted unhappily by the food industry, which stated that it was already voluntarily dropping the trans fat levels to below the WHO recommendations of a maximum of 2%.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Rejecting an outright ban, the Health Secretary [[Andrew Lansley]] launched on 15 March 2012 a voluntary pledge to remove artificial trans fats by the end of the year. Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=for pledge and list of businesses}} Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan formerly worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maeve|first=McClenaghan|title=Analysis: Unhealthy friendships with Department of Health|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/11/25/analysis-unhealthy-friendships-with-department-of-health/|publisher=Bureau of Investigative Journalism|access-date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal.

===United States===
[[File:Nyc-trans-poster.gif|thumb|Poster from New York City's board of health encouraging consumers to limit trans fat consumption]]

Before 2006, consumers in the United States could not directly determine the presence, or quantity, of trans fats in food products. This information could only be inferred from the ingredient list, notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients. In 2010, according to the FDA, the average American consumed 5.8&amp;nbsp;grams of trans fat per day (2.6% of energy intake).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100311162752/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/food/reveal-fats/reveal-fats.htm "Revealing 'trans' fats".] US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v05je44.htm "World Health Organization", Toxicological Evaluation of Some Food Additives Including Anticaking Agents, Antimicrobials, Antioxidants, Emulsifiers and Thickening Agents" Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee, 25 June – 4 July 1975]. Inchem.org. Retrieved 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2003, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a regulation requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements.&lt;ref name="21CFR"&gt;Regulation: [[21 CFR]] 101.9 (c)(2)(ii). {{cite web|last=Food and Drug Administration|title=21 CFR Part 101.

Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Food and Drug Administration|title=FDA food labeling: trans fatty acids in nutrition labeling; consumer research to consider nutrient content and health claims and possible footnote or disclosure statements|page=41059|date=11 July 2003|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr03711b.html|access-date=18 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219020542/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr03711b.html|archive-date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.&lt;ref name="policysearch1"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Public Health Association|title=Restricting trans fatty acids in the food supply|url=http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm?id=1366|access-date=28 February 2008|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506041440/http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm?id=1366|archive-date=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Avoiding Trans Fat (18520422550).jpg|thumb|An example of trans fat provided by the FDA.]]

Critics of the plan, including FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, have expressed concern that the 0.5&amp;nbsp;gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat. This is because a person eating many servings of a product, or eating multiple products over the course of the day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat.&lt;ref name="Shock"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shockman |first=Luke |title=Trans fat: 'Zero' foods add up |publisher=Toledo Blade |date=5 December 2005 |url=http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051205/NEWS32/512030320 |access-date=18 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621150507/http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051205%2FNEWS32%2F512030320 |archive-date=21 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary artery disease, and 250 to 500 deaths, yearly. This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats, and manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products.

The [[American Medical Association]] supports any state and federal efforts to ban the use of artificial trans fats in U.S. restaurants and bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/11/us-ama-trans-fat-idUSTRE4AA6C720081111|title=AMA supports trans-fat bans|agency=Reuters|date=11 November 2008|access-date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Public Health Association]] adopted a new policy statement regarding trans fats in 2007. These new guidelines, entitled ''Restricting Trans Fatty Acids in the Food Supply'', recommend that the government require nutrition facts labeling of trans fats on all commercial food products. They also urge federal, state, and local governments to ban and monitor use of trans fats in restaurants. Furthermore, the APHA recommends barring the sales and availability of foods containing significant amounts of trans fat in public facilities including universities, prisons, and day care facilities etc.&lt;ref name="policysearch1"/&gt;

On 7 November 2013, the FDA issued a preliminary determination that trans fats are not "[[generally recognized as safe]]", which was widely seen as a precursor to reclassifying trans fats as a "food additive," meaning they could not be used in foods without specific regulatory authorization.

====State and local regulation====
Even before the federal ban, the state of California and several U.S. cities took action to reduce consumption of trans fats.

In 2005, [[Tiburon, California]], became the first American city where all restaurants voluntarily cook with trans fat-free oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=BanTransFats.com |title=Project Tiburon: America's first trans fat-free city!!! |url=http://www.bantransfats.com/projecttiburon.html |access-date=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], approved a ban on partially hydrogenated oils, becoming the first county in the nation to restrict trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery bans trans fats in restaurants, markets |work=The Washington Post |date=16 May 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501387.html|access-date=28 June 2007 |first=Miranda S. |last=Spivack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City embarked on a campaign in 2005 to reduce consumption of trans fats, noting that heart disease is the primary cause of resident deaths. This has included a Public education campaign and a request to restaurant owners to eliminate trans fat from their offerings voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Health department asks restaurateurs and food suppliers to voluntarily make an oil change and eliminate artificial trans fat |publisher=City of New York |date=10 August 2005 |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr/pr083-05.shtml |access-date=18 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116091745/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr/pr083-05.shtml |archive-date=16 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding that the voluntary program was not successful, New York City's Board of Health in 2006 solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Health department proposes two changes to city's health code for public comment |publisher=City of New York |date=26 September 2006 |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr2006/pr093-06.shtml |access-date=18 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114034717/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr2006/pr093-06.shtml |archive-date=14 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on 5 December 2006. New York was the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants.

Nassau County, a suburban county on Long Island, New York, banned trans fats in restaurants effective 1 April 2008. Bakeries were granted an extension until 1 April 2011.

[[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] of New York passed a ban on trans fats. The ban was adopted after a unanimous vote by the county legislature on 14 May 2007. The decision was made after New York City's decision, but no plan has been put into place. Legislators received a letter from Rick J. Sampson, president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association, calling on them to "delay any action on this issue until the full impact of the New York City ban is known."

San Francisco officially asked its restaurants to stop using trans fat in January 2008. The voluntary program will grant a city decal to restaurants that comply and apply for the decal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco restaurants asked to ban trans fats|work=The Union Tribune|date=2 February 2008|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20080130-0805-ca-transfatban.html|access-date=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators say the next step will be a mandatory ban.

==Food industry response==

===Manufacturer response===
[[Palm oil]], a natural oil extracted from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), can potentially serve as a substitute for partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications, although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially hydrogenated fats with palm oil confers any health benefits. A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vega-López, Sonia|date=July 2006|title=Palm and partially hydrogenated soybean oils adversely alter lipoprotein profiles compared with soybean and canola oils in moderately hyperlipidemic subjects|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=84|issue=1|pages=54–62|pmid=16825681|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1093/ajcn/84.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090502084827.htm |title=Palm oil not a healthy substitute for trans fats, study finds|date=11 May 2009 |work=ScienceDaily |access-date=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 28 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[McDonald's]], Burger King, and [[Wendy's]] have greatly reduced partially hydrogenated oils (containing artificial trans fats) in their food; most of the remaining trans fat is naturally occurring, in the form of about a gram per 1/4 lb. burger patty, and smaller amounts in fatty dairy products such as cheese, butter, and cream. Naturally occurring trans fat causes the [[Baconator]], for example, to have 2.5 grams.

'''Tropical vegetation''' is any [[vegetation]] in [[tropical]] [[latitude]]s. Plant life that occurs in climates that are warm year-round is in general more biologically diverse that in other latitudes. Some tropical areas may receive abundant rain the whole year round, but others have long [[dry season]]s which last several months and may vary in length and intensity with geographic location. These seasonal [[drought]]s have great impact on the vegetation, such as in the [[Madagascar spiny forests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060112035906.htm 2006-01-13, Sciencedaily: Deep-rooted Plants Have Much Greater Impact On Climate Than Experts Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant species native to the tropics found in tropical [[ecosystem]]s are known as tropical plants. Some examples of tropical ecosystem are the [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]], the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and the broadleaf forests of the [[Thai highlands]] and the [[El Yunque National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]].

==Variants==
{{see also|Tropical ecology|Tropical climate}}
The term 'Tropical vegetation' is frequently used in the sense of lush and luxuriant, but not all the vegetation of the areas of the Earth under a [[tropical climate]] could be adequately defined as such. Despite their lush appearance, often the soils of [[tropical forests]] are low in [[nutrient]] content making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation|work=UN Secretary-General’s Report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tropical vegetation may include the following habitat types:

===Tropical rainforest===
[[Tropical rainforest]] ecosystems include significant areas of [[biodiversity]], often coupled with high species [[endemism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/rainforests/explore/facts.html Facts about the world's tropical rainforests] from [[The Nature Conservancy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforests are home to half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet and roughly two-thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests.&lt;ref name="MI"&gt;The Regents of the [[University of Michigan]]. [http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/rainforest/rainforest.html The Tropical Rain Forest.] Retrieved on 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman, Arnold 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Arnold|title=Tropical Rainforest: Our Most Valuable and Endangered Habitat With a Blueprint for Its Survival Into the Third Millennium|year=2002|publisher=Checkmark|isbn=0816039739|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative are the [[Borneo]] rainforest, one of the oldest rainforests in the world, the [[Brazil]]ian and [[Venezuela]]n [[Amazon Rainforest]], as well as the eastern [[Costa Paulo]]n rainforests.

===Tropical seasonal forest===
[[Seasonal tropical forest]]s generally receive high total rainfall, averaging more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm per year, but with a distinct [[dry season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0103.htm Types of rainforests]&lt;/ref&gt; They include: the [[Congolian forests]], a broad belt of highland [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] which extends across the basin of the [[Congo River]]; Central American tropical forests in [[Geography of Panama#Fauna and flora|Panama]] and [[Nicaragua]]; the seasonal forests that predominate across much the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Indochina]] and in northern Australia: [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|Queensland]].

===Tropical dry broadleaf forest===
[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical dry broadleaf forests]] are territories with a forest cover that is not very dense and has often an unkempt, irregular appearance, especially in the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/selecting_terrestrial_ecoregions/habitat02.cfm |title=WWF - Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest Ecoregions |publisher=Wwf.panda.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425205410/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/selecting_terrestrial_ecoregions/habitat02.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of forests often include [[bamboo]] and [[teak]] as the dominant large tree species, such as in the [[Phi Pan Nam Range]], part of the [[Central Indochina dry forests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=THA+02 UNESCO - MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory - Huai Tak Teak Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt; They are affected by often very long and intense seasonal dry periods and, though less biologically diverse than rainforests, tropical dry forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife.

===Tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands===
[[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|Tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]&lt;ref name="grass"&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/habitats/grasslands/ WWF - Grasslands]&lt;/ref&gt; are spread over a large area of the tropics with a vegetation made up mainly of low [[shrub]]s and [[grass]]es, often including [[sclerophyll]] species.&lt;ref name="grass"/&gt; Some of the most representative are the [[Western Zambezian grasslands]] in [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]], as well as the [[Einasleigh upland savanna]] in [[Australia]]. Tree species such as [[Acacia]] and [[baobab]] may be present in these ecosystems depending on the region.

The '''Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plant''' is a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Vandellòs i l'Hospitalet de l'Infant|Vandellòs]] located close to the [[Coll de Balaguer]] pass ([[Baix Camp]] comarca) in [[Catalonia]], Spain.

Unit one was a 508 MWe [[carbon dioxide]] [[gas cooled reactor]] modeled on the [[UNGG reactor]] at the [[Saint Laurent Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.  It was shut down on July 31, 1990, following an [[Vandellòs I Nuclear Accident|accident]] that damaged one of its two [[turbogenerator]]s on 19 October 1989. Important nuclear safety functions in the plant were impaired by the fire, and the event was later classified as a level 3 event in the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |editor= Redacció |date= 19 October 2014|title= Fa 25 anys del greu accident a la central nuclear Vandellòs 1 |trans-title= 25 years since the serious accident at Vandellòs I Nuclear Power Plant |url= http://www.ccma.cat/324/Fa-25-anys-del-greu-accident-a-la-central-nuclear-Vandellos-1/noticia/2506894/ |language= Catalan |work= [[Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals]] |location= Vandellòs |access-date= 20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit two is a 1087 MWe [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]. The station's owners are: 72% [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and 28% [[Iberdrola]].

'''Wodginite''' is a [[manganese]], [[tin]], [[tantalum]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(Sn,Ta)Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. It may include significant [[niobium]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;

==Background==
Wodginite was first described in 1963 for an occurrence in the Wodgina [[pegmatite]], [[Wodgina]], [[Pilbara]] Region, [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Typical occurrence is in zoned pegmatites in [[amphibolite]]. It is associated with [[tantalite]], [[albite]], [[quartz]], [[muscovite]], [[tapiolite]],
[[microlite]] and [[microcline]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

It occurs in pegmatites in a wide variety of locations. The most studied is the [[Tanco mine|Tanco pegmatite]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]; also in [[Red Lake, Ontario]]. It is reported from  the Strickland quarry, Portland, [[Middlesex County, Connecticut]]; the Herbb #2 pegmatite, [[Powhatan County, Virginia]]; the McAllister mine, Rockford, [[Coosa County, Alabama]]; the Peerless mine, [[Pennington County, South Dakota]]. Also from [[Paraíba]] and [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]]; [[Krasonice]], [[Czech Republic]];  Orivesi, [[Finland]]; Kalba, eastern [[Kazakhstan]]; [[Ankole]], [[Uganda]]; Miami district, [[Zimbabwe]] and 
[[Karibib]] and [[Kohero]], [[Namibia]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16524">'''Zirconium alloys''' are [[solid solution]]s of [[zirconium]] or other [[metal]]s, a common subgroup having the trade mark '''Zircaloy'''. Zirconium has very low absorption [[Nuclear cross section|cross-section]] of [[thermal neutron]]s, high hardness, [[ductility]] and [[corrosion resistance]]. One of the main uses of zirconium alloys is in [[nuclear technology]], as [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] of [[fuel rod]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s, especially [[light water reactor|water reactors]]. A typical composition of nuclear-grade zirconium alloys is more than 95 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|weight percent]]&lt;ref&gt;Alloys' constituents are usually measured by mass.&lt;/ref&gt; zirconium and less than 2% of [[tin]], [[niobium]], [[iron]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]] and other metals, which are added to improve mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Eagleson|title=Concise encyclopedia chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC&amp;pg=PA1199|accessdate=18 March 2011|year=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-011451-5|pages=1199–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water cooling of reactor zirconium alloys elevates requirement for their resistance to oxidation-related [[nodular corrosion]]. Furthermore, oxidative reaction of zirconium with water releases [[hydrogen]] gas, which partly diffuses into the alloy and forms [[zirconium hydride]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=G.J.C.|last2=Watters|first2=J.F.|title=An in-situ study of the dissolution of γ-zirconium hydride in zirconium|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022311578905597|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=73|issue=2|pages=190–197|doi=10.1016/0022-3115(78)90559-7|bibcode=1978JNuM...73..190C}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The hydrides are less dense and are weaker mechanically than the alloy; their formation results in blistering and cracking of the cladding – a phenomenon known as [[hydrogen embrittlement]].&lt;ref name="ia"&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1410_web.pdf Delayed hydride cracking in zirconium alloys in pressure tube nuclear reactors], Final report of a coordinated research project 1998–2002, IAEA, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://world-nuclear.org/info/default.aspx?id=28749&amp;terms=zircaloy Nuclear Fuel Fabrication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726121309/http://world-nuclear.org/info/default.aspx?id=28749&amp;terms=zircaloy |date=July 26, 2011 }}, [http://world-nuclear.org/how/default.aspx?id=60&amp;terms=zircaloy Fuel Fabrication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726121416/http://world-nuclear.org/how/default.aspx?id=60&amp;terms=zircaloy |date=July 26, 2011 }} World Nuclear Association, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and properties==
Commercial non-nuclear grade zirconium typically contains 1–5% of [[hafnium]], whose neutron absorption cross-section is 600x that of zirconium. Hafnium must therefore be almost entirely removed (reduced to &lt; 0.02% of the alloy) for reactor applications.&lt;ref name="b1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="b2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George S. Brady|author2=Henry R. Clauser|author3=John A. Vaccari|title=Materials Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIhvSQLhhMEC&amp;pg=PA1063|edition=15th|accessdate=18 March 2011|date=24 July 2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0|pages=1063–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear-grade zirconium alloys contain more than 95% Zr, and therefore most of their properties are similar to those of pure [[zirconium]]. The absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is 0.18 [[barn (unit)|barn]] for zirconium, which is much lower than that for such common metals as iron (2.4 barn) and nickel (4.5 barn).&lt;ref name="b2" /&gt; The composition and the main applications of common reactor-grade alloys are summarized below. These alloys contain less than 0.3% of iron and chromium and 0.1–0.14% oxygen.&lt;ref name="prop1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Welding of Zirconium Alloys|author1=Peter Rudling|author2=Alfred Strasser|author3=Friedrich Garzarolli|publisher=Advanced Nuclear Technology International|place=Sweden|year=2007|url=http://www.antinternational.com/fileadmin/Products_and_handbooks/IZNA/First_chapter_IZNA_7_STR_Weld.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microstructure ==
[[File:Zircaloy-4 microstructure.tif|thumb|Scanning electron micrograph showing the microstructure of Zircaloy-4.|507x507px]]
At temperatures below 1100 K, zirconium alloys belong to the [[hexagonal crystal family]] (HCP). Its microstructure, revealed by chemical attack, shows needle-like grains typical of a [[Widmanstätten pattern]]. Upon annealing below the phase transition temperature (αZr to βZr) the grains are equiaxed with sizes varying from 3 to 5 μm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunes|first=M. A.|last2=Harrison|first2=R.

== Development ==
Zircaloy 1 was developed as a replacement for existing tube bundles in submarine reactors in the 1950s, owing to a combination of strength, low neutron cross section and corrosion resistance&lt;ref name="LWRTPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwrs.inl.gov/Advanced%20Light%20Water%20Reactor%20Nuclear%20Fuels/AdvLWRNucFuelCladdingSys_TPP_December2012.pdf| title=Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program Advanced LWR Nuclear Fuel Cladding System Development: Technical Program Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Zircaloy-2 was inadvertently developed, by melting Zircaloy-1 in a crucible previously used for stainless steel&lt;ref name="LWRTPP" /&gt;. Newer alloys are Ni-free, including Zircaloy-4, ZIRLO and M5.

==Oxidation of zirconium alloy==
Zirconium alloys readily react with [[oxygen]], forming a nanometer-thin [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/22/56/61/PDF/ajp-jphyscol198647C228.pdf|title=Atom-Probe analysis of Zircaloy }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The corrosion resistance of the alloys may degrade significantly when some impurities (e.g. more than 40 ppm of [[carbon]] or more than 300 ppm of [[nitrogen]]) are present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0322/ML032200454.pdf Corrosion of Zircaloy Spent Fuel Cladding in a Repository] National Research Council, July 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys is enhanced by intentional development of thicker passivation layer of black lustrous [[zirconium oxide]]. [[Nitride]] coatings might also be used.

Whereas there is no consensus on whether zirconium and zirconium alloy have the same oxidation rate, Zircaloys 2 and 4 do behave very similarly in this respect. Oxidation occurs at the same rate in air or in water and proceeds in ambient condition or in high vacuum. A sub-micrometer thin layer of zirconium dioxide is rapidly formed in the surface and stops the further diffusion of oxygen to the bulk and the subsequent oxidation. The dependence of oxidation rate R on temperature and pressure can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;Rion A. Causey, Don F. Cowgill, and Bob H. Nilson (2005) [http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2005/056006.pdf Review of the Oxidation Rate of Zirconium Alloys], Engineered Materials Department and Nanoscale Science and Technology Department Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt;

:R = 13.9·P&lt;sup&gt;1/6&lt;/sup&gt;·exp(−1.47/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T)

The oxidation rate R is here expressed in gram/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·second); P is the pressure in [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], that is the factor P&lt;sup&gt;1/6&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 at ambient pressure; the [[activation energy]] is 1.47 [[Electronvolt|eV]]; k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (8.617{{e|-5}} eV/K) and T is the [[absolute temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s.

Thus the oxidation rate R is 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; g per 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area per second at 0 °C, 6{{e|-8}} g m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 °C, 5.4&amp;nbsp;mg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 700 °C and 300&amp;nbsp;mg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1000 °C. Whereas there is no clear threshold of oxidation, it becomes noticeable at macroscopic scales at temperatures of several hundred °C.

==Oxidation of zirconium by steam==
One disadvantage of metallic zirconium is that in the case of a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] in a nuclear reactor, zirconium cladding rapidly reacts with water [[steam]] at high temperature. Oxidation of zirconium by water is accompanied by release of [[hydrogen]] gas. This oxidation is accelerated at high temperatures, e.g. inside a reactor core if the [[Nuclear fuel|fuel assemblies]] are no longer completely covered by liquid water and insufficiently cooled.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Gillon (1979). Le nucléaire en question, Gembloux Duculot, French edition, 240 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Metallic zirconium is then oxidized by the [[proton]]s of [[water]] to form [[hydrogen]] gas according to the following redox reaction:

: Zr +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Zirconium cladding in the presence of D2O [[deuterium oxide]] frequently used as the moderator and coolant in next gen [[pressurized heavy water reactors]] that [[CANDU]] designed nuclear reactors use would express the same oxidation on exposure to deuterium oxide steam as follows:

: Zr + 2 D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This exothermic reaction, although only occurring at high temperature, is similar to that of alkali metals (such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]]) with water. It also closely resembles the anaerobic oxidation of [[iron]] by water (reaction used at high temperature by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to produce hydrogen for his experiments).

This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion accident first observed inside the reactor building of [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] in 1979 that did not damage the containment building. This same reaction occurred in [[boiling water reactor]]s 1, 2 and 3 of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] (Japan) after reactor cooling was interrupted by related [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] events during the disaster of March 11, 2011, leading to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. Hydrogen gas was vented into the reactor maintenance halls and the resulting explosive mixture of hydrogen with air [[oxygen]] detonated.  The explosions severely damaged external buildings and at least one containment building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-japan-quake-reactor-qa-20110314,0,5470584.story Japanese engineers work to contain nuclear reactor damage], Los Angeles Times, March 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction also occurred during the [[Chernobyl Accident]], when the steam from the reactor began to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of-Plants/Appendices/Chernobyl-Accident---Appendix-1--Sequence-of-Events/ Chernobyl Accident Appendix 1: Sequence of Events], World Nuclear Association, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many water cooled reactor containment buildings have [[catalyst]]-based recombinator units installed to rapidly convert hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the explosive limit is reached.

==Formation of hydrides and hydrogen embrittlement==
[[File:Zirconium Hydride in the microstructure of Zircaloy-4.png|alt=Credits: M.A. Tunes|thumb| Bright-Field Transmission Electron Microscopy (BFTEM) micrograph of a Zirconium Hydride in the microstructure of Zircaloy-4|300x300px]]
Also, 5–20% of hydrogen diffuses into the zirconium alloy cladding forming [[zirconium hydride]]s.&lt;ref name=doe1&gt;[http://www.hss.energy.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1017/h1017v2.pdf DOE-HDBK-1017/2-93, January 1993], DOE Fundamentals Handbook, Material Science, Volume 2 of 2, U.S. Department of Energy, January 2003, pp. 12, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrogen production process also mechanically weakens the rods cladding because the hydrides have lower ductility and density than zirconium or its alloys, and thus [[blister]]s and [[Fracture|cracks]] form upon hydrogen accumulation.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; This process is also known as [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. It has been reported that the concentration of hydrogen within hydrides is also dependent on the nucleation site of the precipitates &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunes|first=Matheus A.|last2=Silva|first2=Chinthaka M.|last3=Edmondson|first3=Philip D.|date=January 2019|title=Site specific dependencies of hydrogen concentrations in zirconium hydrides|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scriptamat.2018.08.044|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=158|pages=136–140|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2018.08.044|issn=1359-6462|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In case of Loss-of-Coolant Accident ([[Loss-of-coolant accident|LOCA]]) in a damaged nuclear reactor, hydrogen embrittlement accelerates the degradation of the zirconium alloy cladding of the fuel rods exposed to high temperature steam.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Fuel Behaviour in Loss-of-coolant Accident (LOCA) Conditions. State-of-the-art Report. OECD 2009, NEA No. 6846. https://www.oecd-nea.org/nsd/reports/2009/nea6846_LOCA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Zirkonium-Becher.jpeg|thumb|This Russian jar is made of zirconium alloy.|213x213px]]
Zirconium alloys are corrosion resistant and [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]], and therefore can be used for body [[implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref name=b2/&gt; In one particular application, a Zr-2.5Nb alloy is formed into a knee or hip implant and then oxidized to produce a hard ceramic surface for use in bearing against a polyethylene component.  This [[Oxinium|oxidized zirconium]] alloy material provides the beneficial surface properties of a ceramic (reduced friction and increased abrasion resistance), while retaining the beneficial bulk properties of the underlying metal (manufacturability, fracture toughness, and ductility), providing a good solution for these medical implant applications.

Reduction of zirconium demand in Russia due to nuclear demilitarization after the end of the [[cold war]] resulted in the exotic production of household zirconium items such as the vodka shot glass shown in the picture.
