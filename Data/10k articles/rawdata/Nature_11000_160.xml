'''{{mp|2014 UR|116}}''', also known as '''2008 XB''', is an eccentric sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], categorized as a [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] with a diameter of approximately {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="JPL-statement" /&gt; It was first observed on 1 December 2008, by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] in Arizona, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-2014UR116" /&gt;

== Orbit ==

{{mp|2014 UR|116}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years (1,088 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.73 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 7[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.0290 |AU |km |abbr=on |sigfig=3}} which translates into 11.3 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 21 October 2014, it passed {{convert |0.0854 |AU |km mi |abbr=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt; On 10 April 2047, the asteroid will safely pass {{convert |0.0296 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt;

Although some inaccurate press reports have suggested that it may pose an impact risk to Earth, the NASA/JPL Near Earth Object Program Office reported that it poses no risk of impact to any planet for at least 150 years.&lt;ref name="JPL-statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-says-asteroid-2014-ur116-nothing-be-afraid-n264281|title=NASA Says Asteroid 2014 UR116 Is Nothing to Be Afraid Of |date=9 December 2014|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1904 and 2174, the closest approach it makes to any planet was on 9 June 2008 when it passed {{convert |0.0144 |AU|km mi |abbr=on}} from Mars. The asteroid has never been listed on the [[Sentry Risk Table]] and has a well determined orbit with an [[observation arc]] of 6 years.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt;

== Discovery ==

The asteroid was first detected on 1 December 2008 by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] and received the [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] {{mp|2008 XB}}.&lt;ref name="MPC-2014UR116" /&gt; However, at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 20 and an assumed [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.3, the object had a very short observation arc of less than 2 hours and the body became a [[lost minor planet]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2008-X16" /&gt; It was only recovered as {{mp|2014 UR|116}} on 27 October 2014, by observers at the MASTER-II Observatory ({{small|[[IAU code#C41|C41]]}}) at [[Pulkovo Observatory]] in Kislovodsk, Russia.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt;

'''ALINDIEN''' is a [[French Navy|French naval]] acronym designing the admiral in charge of the maritime zone of the [[Indian Ocean]], and of the French forces there. The office has been held by [[Contre-amiral]] Didier Piaton since 8 September 2016.

== Organisation ==

=== Zone of authority ===
[[Image:Océan Indien.png|thumb|Indian Ocean]]
ALINDIEN's jurisdiction extends over the  maritime zone of the [[Indian Ocean]], dubbed "ZMOI" (''zone maritime de l'océan Indien''): it comprises the area bounded on its Western part by the Red Sea and Africa, and on its Eastern part by Philippines and Viet Nam. The zone notably comprises such strategic areas as the Persian Gulf, Southern Africa, India, Australia and Singapore.

The zones of [[La Réunion]] and of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] operate under a different hierarchy.

=== Missions ===
In his role as a maritime zone commander, ALINDIEN operates directly under the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]. As a fleet commander, he operates under [[ALFAN]], the Admiral in charge of the ''[[Force d'action navale]]'' for matters of management, training and preparation of the units permanently stationed in the Indian Ocean. The units are mostly stationed in [[La Réunion]] and [[Djibouti]].

ALINDIEN is tasked with the operational control of the naval forces deployed in his area, unless they are detached with their own general staff. This command is exercised from a [[Durance-class tanker|''Durance'' class]] command and replenishment oiler (BCR) carrying the entire general staff. Which exact ship is deployed depends on unit turnover, as the ships are relieved every four years; the [[French ship Marne (A630)|''Marne'' (A630)]] has served in this capacity from the summer of 2002.&lt;ref name="alindien"&gt;[http://www.netmarine.net/bat/pr/marne/alindien.htm L'amiral commandant la Zone Maritime Océan Indien], netmarine.net&lt;/ref&gt; ALINDIEN was the only naval command of the French Navy that is permanently stationed at sea. In autumn 2010, the commanding staff moved ashore to the [[Abu Dhabi base]] and the permanently sea-stationed status of the command ended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=113659, 09/07/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

ALINDIEN also has duties in defence diplomacy with all neighbouring countries.

He supervises the French bases in [[Djibouti]],  [[La Réunion]], and the [[Abu Dhabi base]] (since 2009).

=== Deployment ===
The following units are permanently under ALINDIEN command:
* [[French frigate Nivôse (F732)|''Nivôse'' (F732)]], [[Floréal class frigate|''Floréal'' class frigate]] based in [[La Réunion]]
* [[French frigate Floréal (F730)|''Floréal'' (F730)]], [[Floréal class frigate|''Floréal'' class frigate]] based in [[La Réunion]]
* Commando ''Arta'', a 60-man commando based in [[Djibouti]]
* One [[Atlantique 2]] naval patrol plane, based in Djibouti

Reinforcements can be deployed under ALINDIEN's authority for punctual operations.

== History ==
During the [[Iran-Iraq war]], ALINDIEN's office managed the ''Opération Promethée'', that aimed at preventing any action from either Iraq or Iran against oil shipping. Minesweepers were deployed in several occasions to secure shipping lines.

In January 1986, Vice-amiral Gilbert Le Meledo carried out evacuation of the foreign citizens from [[Aden]]. The ''[[French ship Jules Verne (A620)|Jules Verne]]'' was particularly involved in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netmarine.net/bat/bsm/jverne/histoire02.htm L'histoire du BAP ''Jules Verne''], netmarine&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gulf War]], Contre-amiral Pierre Bonnot commanded a number of war actions, and was later involved in enforcing the [[Iraq sanctions]], as well as minesweeping in Koweiti waters.

In 1992, Contre-amiral Gérard Gazzano and Hubert Foillard supported the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I]]. From March 1993 until March 1995, Admirals Hubert Foillard and Jean-Luc Delaunay supported [[UNOSOM II]]. From 8 to 14 April 1994, Delaunay also supervised a second evacuation of foreign citizens from [[Aden]], with ''Jules Verne'' playing a prominent role again.

In 1996, Contre-amiral Alain Béreau supervised [[Operation Condor (1996)|Operation Condor]], a UN mission to monitor [[Hanish Islands]] in the context of a mediation between Yemen and Erythrea.

In 1998, Contre-amiral Jean-Louis Battet supervised [[Operation Khor Angar]], securing the shores of Djibouti during the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]].

From 2001, [[Opération Héracles]] has been in force,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} in the context of the "[[War on Terror]]".

In January 2005, Vice-amiral  Xavier Rolin supervised [[Opération Beryx]], a humanitarian mission to relieve populations victim of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The ''[[French frigate Dupleix (D641)|Dupleix]]'', ''[[French frigate Georges Leygues (D640)|Georges Leygues]]'' and ''[[French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97)|Jeanne d'Arc]]'' were notably involved.

'''Anigre''' is an African [[hardwood]] commonly used for [[plywood]], interior furniture, cabinetry, and high-end [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] applications. It is frequently sliced and sold as [[Wood veneer|veneer]], although it is available in board form as well. In board form it is used for boat building, general carpentry, and other light construction uses.

==Characteristics==
It is considered a tropical hardwood with a clear, cylindrical bole to {{convert|80|ft}}. It can grow to heights of {{convert|180|ft}} with typical trunk diameters ranging from {{convert|36|to|48|in}}. Anigre has a medium texture with closed pores similar to maple. Growth rings aren’t always well-defined, and the wood can be rather plain-looking; though certain figure is occasionally present, such as curly or mottled grain. The [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] and the [[heartwood]] are not usually distinguishable.  The heartwood is a light yellowish-brown, sometimes with a pinkish hue. Color tends to darken with age. The quarter figured veneer has become a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and decorative architectural applications. It is said to have a faint odor similar to Cedar. In its untreated form Anigre is susceptible to termite and fungi attacks and generally has low durability. Anigre is usually considered easy to work with hand and power tools, although depending on the origin of the wood it can have a high [[silica]] content which can dull wood working tools quickly.[[File:Anigre.jpg|thumb|Quarter Figured Anigre]]

==Origins==
Anigre is often found in tropical East and West Africa, primarily in [[Cameroon]] but also in Angola, Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Wood River Veneer http://wood-veneer.com/product.php?veneer=Anigre%20Veneer&lt;/ref&gt; Exportation from Cameroon is actually prohibited by local laws.

==Common Names==
Anigre, Anegre, Aniegre, Aningré, [[Aningeria]], Aninguerie, Mugangu, Muna, Osan, Anegre Blanc, Longhi, Mukaly, Tanganyika Nuss. Common pronunciations vary from Ah-Nee-Grey, Ah-Nee-Gra, Anna-Gra, Anna-Grey, Uh-Nee-Grey.

{{about|a continent}}
[[File:Baltica outline.png|thumb|Outline of Baltica]]
'''Baltica''' is a [[paleocontinent]] that formed in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] and now constitutes northwestern [[Eurasia]], or Europe north of the [[Trans-European Suture Zone]] and west of the [[Ural Mountains]].
The thick core of Baltica, the [[East European Craton]], is more than three billion years old and formed part of the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent at {{Circa}} 1&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ga|Billion years ago}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2005|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic history==
[[File:Baltica 1100 Ma.png|thumb|1.1&amp;nbsp;Ga Baltica was located in what is now the South Pacific. (Current location of Australia added for reference.)]]
[[Image:Positions_of_ancient_continents,_550_million_years_ago.jpg|thumb|550 million years ago Baltica (green) was an isolated continent located near the South Pole.]]
Baltica formed at {{Circa}} 2.0–1.7&amp;nbsp;Ga by the collision of three [[Archean|Archaean]]-[[Proterozoic]] continental blocks: [[Fennoscandia]] (including the exposed [[Baltic Shield]]), [[Sarmatian Craton|Sarmatia]] ([[Ukrainian Shield]] and [[Voronezh Massif]]), and [[Volgo-Uralia]] (covered by younger deposits).  Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia formed a proto-[[craton]] (sometimes called "Proto-Baltica")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2005|loc=Norway’s earliest times, pp. 74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; at c. 2.0&amp;nbsp;Ga which collided with Fennoscandia c. 1.8–1.7&amp;nbsp;Ga.  The [[Suture (geology)|suture]]s between these three blocks were reactivated during the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bogdanova|Bingen|Gorbatschev|Kheraskova|2008|loc=The crustal segments of the East European Craton, pp. 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

750–600&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Baltica and [[Laurentia]] rotated clockwise together and drifted away from the Equator towards the South Pole where they were affected by the [[Cryogenian]] [[Varanger glaciation]]s.  Initial rifting between the two continents is marked by the c. 650&amp;nbsp;Ma [[Egersund dike swarm]] in southern Norway and from 600&amp;nbsp;Ma they began to rotate up to 180° relative to each other, thus opening the [[Iapetus Ocean]] between them.  Laurentia quickly moved northward but Baltica remained an isolated continent in the Southern Hemisphere closer to [[Gondwana]] on which endemic [[trilobite]]s evolved in the Early Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Tors-1996-Abst"&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Meert|Van der Voo|1996|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ordovician, Baltica moved northward approaching Laurentia again allowing trilobites and brachiopods to cross the Iapetus Ocean. In the Silurian, c. 425&amp;nbsp;Ma, the final collision between Scotland-Greenland and Norway resulted in the [[Caledonian orogeny#Scandian/Grampian phase|Scandian Orogeny]].&lt;ref name="Tors-1996-Abst" /&gt;

==Margins==
Baltica is a very old continent and its core is a very well-preserved and thick craton.  Its current margins, however, are the [[Suture (geology)|sutures]] that are the result of mergers with other, much younger continental blocks.  These often deformed sutures do not represent the original, Precambrian–early Palaeozoic extent of Baltica; for example, the curved margin north of the Urals running parallel to Novaya Zemlya was probably deformed during the eruption of the End-Permian [[Siberian Traps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2005|loc=The margins of Baltica, p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltica's western margin is the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonide orogen]] which stretches northward from the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] across [[Barents Sea]] to [[Svalbard]].  Its eastern margin is the [[Timanide Orogen|Timanide orogen]] which stretches north to the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gee|Bogolepova|Lorenz|2006|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The extent of the Proterozoic continent are defined by the [[Iapetus Suture]] to the west; the [[Trollfjorden-Komagelva Fault Zone]] in the north; the [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan-Hercynian]] suture to the south; the [[Tornquist Zone]] to the southwest; and the [[Ural Mountains]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Van der Voo|Trench|1992|loc=Introduction, pp. 133–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern margin===
At c. 555&amp;nbsp;Ma during the [[Timanide Orogen|Timanian Orogeny]] the northern margin became an active margin and Baltica expanded northward with the accretion of a series of continental blocks: the [[Timan-Pechora Basin]], the northern-most Ural Mountains, and the [[Novaya Zemlya]] islands.  This expansion coincided with the [[Varanger glaciation]]s, also known as [[Snowball Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walderhaug|Torsvik|Halvorsen|2007|loc=Baltica and Varangian Glaciations, pp. 946–947; Fig. 12, p. 946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terrane]]s of the [[North American Cordillera]], including [[Arctic Alaska-Chukotka terrane|Alaska-Chukotka]], [[Alexander terrane|Alexander]], [[Northern Sierra terrane|Northern Sierra]], and [[eastern Klamath terrane|Eastern Klamath]], share a rift history with Baltica and most likely were part of Baltica from the Caledonian orogeny to the formation of the Ural Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|Kuznetsov|Soboleva|Udoratina|2011|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These terranes can be linked to either northeastern Laurentia, Baltica, or Siberia because of a similar sequence of fossils; [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] zircon from 2-1&amp;nbsp;Ga-old sources and evidence of Grenvillian magmatism; and magmatism and [[island arc]]s from the Late Neoproterozoic and Ordovician-Silurian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Colpron|Nelson|2009|loc=Terranes of Siberian, Baltican and Caledonian affinities, pp. 280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern margin===
From at least 1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga to at least 0.8&amp;nbsp;Ga the southwestern margin of Baltica was connected to [[Amazonian Craton|Amazonia]] while the southeast margin was connected to the [[West African Craton]].
Baltica, Amazonia, and West Africa rotated 75° clockwise relative to Laurentia until Baltica and Amazonia collided with Laurentia in the 1.1-0.9&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Grenville orogeny|Grenville]]-[[Sveconorwegian orogeny|Sveconorwegian]]-[[Sunsás orogeny|Sunsás]] orogenies to form the supercontinent [[Rodinia]].  When the break-up of Rodinia was complete c. 0.6&amp;nbsp;Ga Baltica became an isolated continent&amp;nbsp;— a 200 million year period when Baltica was truly a separate continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johansson|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Laurentia and Baltica formed a single continent until 1.265&amp;nbsp;Ga which broke up some time before 0.99&amp;nbsp;Ga.  After the subsequent closure of the [[Mirovia|Mirovoi Ocean]] Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia remained merged until the opening of the Iapetus Ocean in the Neoproterozoic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|Pisarevsky|2017|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Margin===
The [[Western Gneiss Region]] in northern Norway is composed of 1650-950&amp;nbsp;Ma-old gneisses overlain by [[Continental crust|continental]] and [[Oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[allochton]]s that were transferred from Laurentia to Baltica during the Scandian orogeny.  The allochtons were accreted to Baltica during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean c. 430-410&amp;nbsp;Ma; Baltica's [[Basement (geology)|basement]] and the allochtons were then subducted to [[Ultra-high-pressure metamorphism|UHP]] depth c. 425-400&amp;nbsp;Ma; and they were finnaly exhumed to their present location c. 400-385&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hacker|Andersen|Johnston|Kylander-Clark|2010|loc=Western Gneiss Region, pp. 150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of micro-diamonds in two islands in northern Norway, [[Otrøya]] and [[Flemsøya]], indicate that this margin of Baltica was buried c. {{Convert|120|km|abbr=on}} for at least 25 million years around 429&amp;nbsp;Ma shortly after the Baltica-Laurentia collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spengler|Brueckner|van Roermund|Drury|2009|loc=Abstract; Conclusion and implications, pp. 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baltica-Laurentia-Avalonia triple junction in the North Sea is the southwest corner of Baltica.  The Baltica-Laurentia suture stretching northeast from the triple junction was deformed in the Late Cambrian and early Palaeozoic in the Scandinavian Caledonides as well as the Scandian Orogeny in the Silurian.  Some Norwegian terranes have faunas distinct from those of either Baltica or Laurentia and were island arcs that originated in the Iapetus Ocean and were accreted to Baltica.  The Baltica craton most likely underlies these terranes and the [[continent-ocean boundary]] passes several kilometres off Norway, but, since the North Atlantic opened c. 54&amp;nbsp;Ma were the Iapetus Ocean closed, it is unlikely the craton also reached into Laurentia.  The margin stretches north to [[Novaya Zemlya]] where early Palaeozoic Baltica faunas have been found, but the sparsity of data makes it difficult to locate the margin in the Arctic.  Ordovician faunas indicate that most of [[Svalbard]], including [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bjørnøya]], was part of Laurentia, but [[Franz Josef Land]] and [[Kvitøya]] (an eastern island of the Svalbard archipelago) most likely became part of Baltica in the Timanide Orogeny.  The [[Taymyr Peninsula]], in contrast, never was part of Baltica: southern Taymyr was part of Siberia whilst northern Taymyr and the [[Severnaya Zemlya]] archipelago were part of the independent Kara Terrane in the early Palaeozoic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2005|loc=The margins of Baltica, p. 42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern margin===
The eastern margin, the Uralide orogen, extends {{Convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} from the Arctic [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago to the [[Aral Sea]].  The orogen contains the record of at least two collisions between Baltica and intra-oceanic island arcs before the final collision between Baltica and [[Kazakhstania]]-[[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] during the formation of [[Pangaea]].  The Silurian-Devonian island arcs were accreted to Baltica along the [[Main Uralian Fault]], east of which are metamorphosed fragments of volcanic arc mixed with small amounts of Precambrian and Paleozoic continental rocks.  No Rocks, however, unambiguously originating from either Kazakhstania or Siberia have been found in the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Spadea|Puchkov|Alvarez-Marron|2006|loc=Geological framework of the Uralides, p. 262}}; For a model of the arc-continent collsion see {{Harvnb|Puchkov|2009|loc=Fig. 12, p. 178; Fig. 14, p. 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The basement of the eastern margin is composed of an Archaean craton, metamorphosed rocks at least 1.6&amp;nbsp;Ga-old, which is surrounded by the fold belt of the Timanide orogeny and overlain by Mesoproterozoic sediments.  The margin became a [[passive margin]] facing an Ural Ocean in the Cambrian-Ordovician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Spadea|Puchkov|Alvarez-Marron|2006|loc=The Paleozoic continental margin of Baltica in the Southern Urals, pp. 262–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern margin stretches south through the Ural Mountains from the northern end of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.  The margin follows the bent shape of Novaya Zemlya which was caused in the Late Permian by the [[Siberian Traps]].  It is clear from Baltic endemic fossils in Novaya Zemlya that the islands have been part of Baltica since Early Palaeozoic, whereas the Taymyr Peninsula farther east was part of the passive margin of Siberia in the Early Palaeozoic.  Northern Taymyr, together with Severnaya Zemlya and parts of the crust of the Arctic Ocean formed the [[Kara Terrane]].&lt;ref name="CoTo-2005-p44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2005|loc=The margins of Baltica, p. 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urals Mountains formed in the mid and late Palaeozoic when [[Laurussia]] collided with [[Kazakhstania]], a series of terranes.  The eastern margin, however, originally extended farther east to an active margin bordered by [[island arc]]s, but those parts have been compressed, fractured, and distorted especially in the eastern Urals.  The early Palaeozoic eastern margin is better preserved south of the polar region (65°N) where shallow-water sediments can be found in the western Urals whilst the eastern Urals are characterised by deep-water deposits.  The oldest known [[mid-ocean ridge|mid-ocean]] [[hydrothermal vent]] in the south-central part of the Urals clearly delimits the eastern extent.  The straightness of the mountain chain is the result of continuous strike-slip movements during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian (300-290&amp;nbsp;Ma).&lt;ref name="CoTo-2005-p44" /&gt;

Baltic endemic faunas from the Early Ordovician have been found in Kazakhstan near the southern end of the eastern margin, or the triple junction between Baltica, the [[Mangyshlak Peninsula|Mangyshlak Terrane]], and the accretionary [[Central Asian Orogenic Belt|Altaids]].  Here the early Palaeozoic rocks are buried under the [[Caspian Depression]].&lt;ref name="CoTo-2005-p44" /&gt;

'''Bangham Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located in the state’s [[Limestone Coast]] in the gazetted locality of [[Bangham, South Australia| Bangham]] about {{convert|45|km}} north-east of the town centre in [[Naracoorte, South Australia| Naracoorte]].&lt;ref name="PLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The conservation park occupies land in section 4 and Allotment 1 of Deposited Plan 78796 in the [[Lands administrative divisions of South Australia|cadastral unit]] of the [[Hundred of Geegeela]] which is bounded by the Bordertown-Frances Road on its western side, a road on its southern side and the Bordertown – Naracoorte railway line on its eastern side.  As of 1992, access tracks had been constructed along the northern and eastern boundaries of section 4 while an easement for an electricity transmission line passed through the western side of the conservation park.&lt;ref name=auslii&gt;{{cite journal|title= National Parks and Wildlife (Bangham Conservation Park) Proclamation 2010 [Published in the Gazette on 18 February 2010 at page 822] |work=South Australian Proclamations and Notices  |date=18 February 2010 |page= |url= http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/proc/npawcpp2010575/ |accessdate=24 February 2017 |publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PLB/&gt;

The land originally gained protected area status in 1973, when section 4 was gazetted as the Bangham Conservation Park.&lt;ref name=sagg/&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;  In 2010, additional land consisting of Allotment 1 of Deposited Plan 78796 was added to the north side of the conservation park.&lt;ref name=auslii/&gt;  

The land was offered in 1971 to the [[government of South Australia]] for [[conservation (ethic)|conservation purposes]].  At the time, it consisted of {{convert|6.76|km2}} of “native scrub” and {{convert|1.25|km2}} of “cleared land” with the majority of the latter occupying its south-east corner.  A subsequent study revealed that the land was used by [[red-tailed black cockatoo]]s which at the time had “limited distribution” in South Australia and which made the land “particularly suitable for conservation purposes.”&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

In 1992, the conservation park was described as follows:&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(It) is characterised by an undulating plain of [[Tertiary]] sand with local [[Rust (color)|ferruginous]] cappings overlain by easterly trending dunes and sheets of [[Aeolian processes|aeolian sand]].  Occasional [[sinkhole]]s and small depressions are caused by solution of the underlying [[limestone]].  Soils … are generally bleached, deep acid sands with a yellow-grey B horizon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 1982, vegetation within the conservation park consisted of the following three major plant associations - a “open forest - woodland“ of [[Eucalyptus leucoxylon|South Australian blue gum]], [[river red gum]] in “areas subject to inundation” and a “open forest - low open forest” of [[Eucalyptus baxteri|brown stringybark]].&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

As of 1992, visitation to the conservation park was described as “low level of mainly local use with occasional visits from further afield by field naturalists and bird observers” and that no facilities had been provided for visitors.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name="CAPAD2014SASum"/&gt;

==Overview==

The '''Belle Ayr''' mine is a [[coal mine]] located 18 miles southeast of [[Gillette, Wyoming|Gillette]], [[Wyoming]] in the United States in the coal-rich [[Powder River Basin]]. The mine is an [[open-pit mining|open pit]], "truck and shovel", mine producing a low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Wyodak-Anderson seam that is used for domestic energy generation. Coal produced by the mine is shipped to its customers via [[railroad]]. The mine is currently owned and operated by [[Blackjewel LLC]] after being acquired in a merger with [[Contura energy]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="ANR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphanr.com/poweringthefuture/locations/Pages/default.aspx|title=Alpha Natural Resources: Locations|work=Alpha Natural Resources website|publisher=Alpha Natural Resources|accessdate=2010-06-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719024849/http://www.alphanr.com/poweringthefuture/locations/Pages/default.aspx| archivedate= 19 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, Belle Ayr had reserves of 406&amp;nbsp;mm tons of sub-bituminous coal and a maximum permitted production capacity of 45mm tons per year. Typical annual production has been in 26-28mm ton range for the last several years though. The average quality of the coal shipped from Belle Ayr is 8,550 BTU/lb, 0.33% Sulfur, 4.50% Ash, and 1.90% Sodium (of the ash). Train loading operations at the mine are done with a batch weigh bin system that is coupled to a "weigh-in-motion" track scale system. Silo capacity at the mine's rail loop, which can accommodate up to 5 [[unit trains]], is 46,000 tons.&lt;ref name="BNSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsf.com/customers/pdf/mineguide.pdf#page=6|title=Mine Guide|work=BNSF website|publisher=BNSF|accessdate=2010-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121025048/http://bnsf.com/customers/pdf/mineguide.pdf#page=6|archive-date=2010-11-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the mine produced just over 28.7 million [[short ton]]s of coal, making it the 7th-most productive coal mine in the United States.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table9.html|title=Major U.S. Coal Mines, 2008|date=September 2009|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]|accessdate=2010-06-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611163617/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table9.html| archivedate= 11 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Belle Ayr Mine began operations in 1972 and is the oldest, non-captive mine in the [[Powder River Basin]]. Since mining operations began, the mine has shipped over 574 million tons of coal to its customers.&lt;ref name="UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uprr.com/customers/energy/coal/sprb/belleayr.shtml|title=UP: Belle Ayr Mine|work=Union Pacific website|publisher=Union Pacific|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belle Ayr mine has changed hands many times through mergers and sales. Previous owners include AMAX, Cyprus AMAX, RAG, and Foundation Coal.

In 2007, Belle Ayr was awarded a Director's Award from the [[Office of Surface Mining]] for its [[stream restoration|restoration]] work on [[Caballo Creek]], which winds its way through the Belle Ayr Mine property.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Belle+Ayr+Mine+Receives+Reclamation+Award.-a0168820056|title=Belle Ayr Mine Receives Reclamation Award|date=September 19, 2007|work=Business Wire|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bio-battery''' is an energy storing device that is powered by [[organic compounds]], usually being [[glucose]], such as the glucose in human blood.  When [[enzymes]] in human bodies break down glucose, several electrons and protons are released.  Therefore, by using enzymes to break down glucose, bio-batteries directly receive energy from glucose.  These batteries then store this energy for later use.  This concept is almost identical to how both plants and many animals obtain energy.  Although the batteries are still being tested before being commercially sold, several research teams and engineers are working to further advance the development of these batteries.

== Workings ==

Like any battery, bio-batteries consist of an [[anode]], [[cathode]], [[separator (electricity)|separator]] and [[electrolyte]] with each component layered on top of another. Anodes and cathodes are the positive and negative areas on a battery that allow electrons to flow in and out.  The anode is located at the top of the battery and the cathode is located at the bottom of the battery.  Anodes allow current to flow in from outside the battery, whereas cathodes allow current to flow out from the battery.

Between the anode and the cathode lies the electrolyte which contains a separator.  The main function of the separator is to keep the cathode and anode separated, to avoid electrical short circuits.  This system as a whole, allows for a flow of protons (H+) and electrons (e-) which ultimately generates electricity.&lt;ref name="northeastern"/&gt;


In the anode the sugar is broken down, producing both electrons and protons.

Glucose → [[Gluconolactone]] + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

These electrons and protons produced now play an important role in creating energy.  They travel through the electrolyte, where the separator redirects electrons to go through the mediator to get to the cathode.{{cn|date=April 2018}} On the other hand, protons are redirected to go through the separator to get to the cathode side of the battery.&lt;ref name="northeastern"/&gt;

The cathode then consists of an oxidation reduction reaction.  This reaction uses the protons and electrons, with the addition of oxygen gas, to produce water.

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O


==Advantages==

A significant advantage that bio-batteries have in comparison to other batteries is their ability to allow an instant recharge.&lt;ref name="CFDRC"/&gt;  In other words, through a constant supply of sugar, or glucose, bio batteries are able to continuously keep themselves charged without an external power supply.  Bio batteries are also a source of non-flammable, and non-toxic fuel. This provides a clean alternative renewable power source.&lt;ref name=CFDRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio-Battery: Clean, Renewable Power Source|url=http://www.cfdrc.com/bio/bio-battery|publisher=CFD Research Corporation|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102180433/http://www.cfdrc.com/bio/bio-battery|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

Compared to conventional batteries, such as lithium batteries, bio-batteries are less likely to retain most of their energy.&lt;ref name=advantages&gt;{{cite web|title=CELLULOSE-BASED BATTERIES|url=http://advantage-environment.com/uncategorized/cellulose-based-batteries/|publisher=Confederation of Swedish Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This causes a problem when it comes to long term usage and storage of energy for these batteries.  However, researchers are continuing to develop the battery in order to make it a more practical replacement for current batteries and sources of energy.&lt;ref name="advantages"/&gt;

==Application==

Although biobatteries are not ready for commercial sale, several research teams and engineers are working to further advance the development of these batteries.&lt;ref name="CFDRC"/&gt;  [[Sony]] has created a bio battery that gives an output power of 50&amp;nbsp;mW (milliwatts).  This output is enough to power approximately one MP3 player.&lt;ref name=northeastern&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kannan, Renugopalakrishnan |author2=Filipek, Audette |author3=Li, Munukutla |title=Bio-Batteries and Bio-Fuel Cells: Leveraging on Electronic Charge Transfer Proteins |url=http://www.northeastern.edu/bionano/bio-pdfs/J%20N%20N%20%20%20%20Bio%20Fuel%20Cells%20and%20Bio%20Batteries.pdf |publisher=American Scientific Publishers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304203347/http://www.northeastern.edu/bionano/bio-pdfs/J%20N%20N%20%20%20%20Bio%20Fuel%20Cells%20and%20Bio%20Batteries.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the coming years, Sony plans to take bio batteries to market, starting with toys and devices that require a small amount of energy.&lt;ref name="advantages"/&gt;  Several other research facilities, such as Stanford and Northeastern, are also in the process of researching and experimenting with bio batteries as an alternative source of energy.  Since there is glucose in human blood, some research facilities are also looking towards the medical benefits of bio-batteries and their possible functions in human bodies.  Although this has yet to be further tested, research continues on the subject surrounding both the material/device and medical usage of bio-batteries.

==Bacteria==
There has been a recent interest in using bacteria to generate and store electricity. In 2013, researchers found that [[E. coli]] is a good candidate for a living biobattery because its metabolism may sufficiently convert glucose into energy thus produce electricity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130717051733.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Through the combination of differing genes it is possible to optimise efficient electrical production of the organism. Bacterial bio-batteries have great potential in that they can generate electricity rather than just storing it and also that they may contain less toxic or corrosive substances than [[hydrochloric acid]], and [[sulphuric acid]].

Another bacteria of interest is a newly discovered bacterium, [[Shewanella oneidensis]], dubbed "Electric Bacteria" which can reduce toxic manganese ions and turn them into food.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/microbes-breathe-and-eat-electricity-make-us-re-think-what-life-180953883/?no-ist&lt;/ref&gt; In the process it also generates electrical current, and this current is carried along tiny wires made of bacterial appendages called bacterial nano-wires. This network of bacteria and interconected wires creates a vast bacterial biocircuit unlike anything previously known to science. Besides generating electricity it also has the ability to store electric charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21981730 | doi=10.1021/es2025214 | volume=45 | title=Transient storage of electrical charge in biofilms of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 growing in a microbial fuel cell | year=2011 | journal=Environ.

Scientists showed that bacteria could load electrons onto and discharge electrons from microscopic particles of magnetite. Researchers had new experiments with purple bacteria, [[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]], by controlling the amount of light the bacteria was exposed to. This bacteria was able to pull electrons from its surrounding environment. The team changed the light conditions. During the day-time, phototrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria were able to remove electrons from the magnetite discharging it. During the night-time, the bacteria were able to put electrons back onto the magnetite recharging it.&lt;ref name=EAG1 /&gt; During this process, researchers found out that this magnetite could be used to clean up toxic metals. Magnetite can reduce the toxic form of [[chromium]], chromium VI, to the less toxic chromium (III).&lt;ref name="EAG1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eag.eu.com/about/media/bacteria-can-use-magnetic-particles/ |title=New study shows Bacteria can use magnetic particles to create a ‘natural battery’ |date=27 March 2015}} Press release&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Birkeland current''' is a set of currents that flow along [[geomagnetic]] field lines connecting the Earth’s [[magnetosphere]] to the Earth's high latitude [[ionosphere]]. In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the [[solar wind]] and [[interplanetary magnetic field]] and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during [[substorm]]s).  Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Auroras]] Borealis and Australis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral [[electrojet]], which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere.  The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets.  One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector.  The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector.  The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone is referred to as the Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.

The currents were predicted in 1908 by Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]], who undertook expeditions north of the [[Arctic Circle]] to study the aurora. He rediscovered, using simple magnetic field measurement instruments, that when the aurora appeared the needles of magnetometers changed direction, confirming the findings of [[Anders Celsius]] and assistant [[Olof Hjorter]] more than a century before. This could only imply that currents were flowing in the atmosphere above. He theorized that somehow the Sun emitted a cathode ray,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkeland|first=Kristian|title=Sur les rayons cathodiques sous l'action de forces magnetiques intenses|journal=Archives des Sciences Physiques|year=1896|volume=4|pages=497–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Birkeland|first=Kristian|title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902-1903|year=1908|publisher=H.

This view was scorned by other researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=Arthur|title=(article title N/A)|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|date=March 1912|volume=85|issue=575|pages=44–50|doi=10.1098/rspa.1911.0019|bibcode=1911RSPSA..85...44S}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1967 a satellite, launched into the auroral region, showed that the currents posited by Birkeland existed. In honour of him and his theory these currents are named Birkeland currents. A good description of the discoveries by Birkeland is given in the book by Jago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jago|first=Lucy|title=The Northern Lights: How One Man Sacrificed Love, Happiness and Sanity to Unlock the Secrets of Space|year=2001|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-375-40980-6|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Emeritus of the Alfvén Laboratory in Sweden, [[Carl-Gunne Fälthammar]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fälthammar|first=Carl-Gunne|title=Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Interactions. Near Earth Manifestations of the Plasma Universe|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|date=Dec 1986|volume=PS-14|issue=6|pages=616–628|doi=10.1109/TPS.1986.4316613|bibcode = 1986ITPS...14..616F }}&lt;/ref&gt; "A reason why Birkeland currents are particularly interesting is that, in the plasma forced to carry them, they cause a number of plasma physical processes to occur ([[Waves in plasmas|waves]], [[Instability|instabilities]], fine structure formation). These in turn lead to consequences such as [[Plasma acceleration|acceleration of charged particles]], both positive and negative, and element separation (such as preferential ejection of oxygen ions). Both of these classes of phenomena should have a general astrophysical interest far beyond that of understanding the space environment of our own Earth."

==Characteristics==
Auroral Birkeland currents carry about 100,000 [[ampere]]s during quiet times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Akira|author2=Naoshi Fukushima|title=Space current around the earth obtained with Ampère's law applied to the MAGSAT orbit and data|journal=Earth Planets Space|year=1998|volume=50|issue=1|pages=43–56|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/5001/50010043.pdf|bibcode = 1998EP&amp;S...50...43S|doi=10.1186/bf03352085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and more than 1 million amperes during geomagnetically disturbed times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=B. J.|author2=J. b. Gary|author3=T. A. Potemra|author4=R. A. Frahm|author5=J. R. Sharber|author6=J. D. Winningham|title=UARS observations of Birkeland currents and Joule heating rates for the November 4, 1993, storm|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|year=1998|volume=103|issue=A11|pages=26323–35|doi=10.1029/98JA01236|bibcode=1998JGR...10326323A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birkeland had estimated currents "at heights of several hundred kilometres, and strengths of up to a million amperes" in 1908.&lt;ref name=NAPE /&gt; The ionospheric currents that connect the field-aligned currents heat up the upper atmosphere due to the finite conductivity of the ionosphere. The heat (also known as [[Joule heating|Joule heat]]) is transferred from the ionospheric plasma to the gas of the upper atmosphere, which consequently rises and increases drag on low-altitude satellites.

Birkeland currents can also be created in the laboratory with multi-[[terawatt]] [[pulsed power]] generators. The resulting cross-section pattern indicates a hollow beam of electrons in the form of a circle of [[vortices]], a formation called the [[diocotron instability]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldebaran.cz/astrofyzika/plazma/phenomena_en.html#instab Plasma phenomena - instabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528020309/http://www.aldebaran.cz/astrofyzika/plazma/phenomena_en.html |date=2014-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to the [[Kelvin-Helmholtz instability]]), that subsequently leads to filamentation. Such vortices can be seen in aurora as "auroral curls".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.ucalgary.ca/~trondsen/pai/Curls.html Pseudo-color, white-light images of curl formations in auroral arcs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503065835/http://www.phys.ucalgary.ca/~trondsen/pai/Curls.html |date=May 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkeland currents are also one of a class of plasma phenomena called a [[z-pinch]], so named because the azimuthal magnetic fields produced by the current pinches the current into a filamentary cable. This can also twist, producing a helical pinch that spirals like a twisted or braided rope, and this most closely corresponds to a Birkeland current. Pairs of parallel Birkeland currents will also interact due to [[Ampère's force law]]: parallel Birkeland currents moving in the same direction will attract each other with an electromagnetic force inversely proportional to their distance apart whilst parallel Birkeland currents moving in opposite directions will repel each other. There is also a short-range circular component to the force between two Birkeland currents that is opposite to the longer-range parallel forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/EM_forces.html Electromagnetic Forces&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003211220/http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/EM_forces.html |date=October 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrons moving along a Birkeland current may be accelerated by a plasma [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]. If the resulting electrons approach the speed of light, they may subsequently produce a [[Bennett pinch]], which in a magnetic field causes the electrons to spiral and emit [[synchrotron radiation]] that may include [[radio]], [[visible light]], [[x-rays]], and [[gamma rays]].

==History==
[[File:Birkeland-currents.gif|thumb|300px|Kristian Birkeland predicted the auroral electrojets in 1908. He wrote p. 95&lt;ref name="NAPE" /&gt; "the currents there are imagined as having come into existence mainly as a secondary effect of the electric corpuscles from the sun drawn in out of space, and thus far come under the second of the possibilities mentioned above". And p. 105, "Fig. 50a represents those in which the current-directions at the storm-centre are directed westwards, and 50b those in which the currents move eastwards".]]

After Kristian Birkeland first suggested in 1908 that "currents there [in the aurora] are imagined as having come into existence mainly as a secondary effect of the electric corpuscles from the sun drawn in out of space,"&lt;ref name="NAPE" /&gt; the story appears to have become mired in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Stephen G.| last=Brush| title=Alfvén's Programme in Solar System Physics| journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science| volume=20| issue=6|date=December 1992| doi=10.1109/27.199495| pages=577–589|bibcode = 1992ITPS...20..577B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birkeland's ideas were generally ignored in favor of an alternative theory from British mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Chapman and J. Bartels, ‘’Geomagnetism,’’ Vol. 1 and 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Swedish Engineer and plasma physicist [[Hannes Alfvén]] promoted Birkeland's ideas in a paper&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, Hannes (1939), "Theory of Magnetic Storms and of the Aurorae", K. Sven. ''Vetenskapsakad. Handl''., ser. 3, vol. 18, no. 3, p. 1, 1939. Reprinted in part, with comments by A. J. Dessler and J. Wilcox, in ''Eos, Trans. Am. Geophys. Un''., vol. 51, p. 180, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  published on the generation of the current from the Solar Wind. In 1964 one of Alfvén's colleagues, Rolf Boström, also used field-aligned currents in a new model of [[Electrojet#Auroral Electrojet|auroral electrojets]].&lt;ref name=Bostrom1964&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boström R.|title=A Model of the Auroral Electrojets|journal=J.

Proof of Birkeland's theory of the aurora only came after a probe was sent into space. The crucial results were obtained from U.S. Navy satellite 1963-38C, launched in 1963 and carrying a [[magnetometer]] above the [[ionosphere]]. In 1966 Alfred Zmuda, J.H. Martin, and F.T.Heuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zmuda|first=Alfred|author2=J.H. Martin|author3=F.T.Heuring|last-author-amp=yes|title=Transverse Magnetic Disturbances at 1100 Kilometers in the Auroral Region|journal=J. Geophys.

In 1967 [[Alexander J. Dessler|Alex Dessler]] and graduate student David Cummings wrote an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cummings|first=W. D.|author2=A. J. Dessler|title=Field‐Aligned Currents in the Magnetosphere|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|year=1967|volume=72|issue=3|pages=1007–1013|doi=10.1029/JZ072i003p01007|bibcode=1967JGR....72.1007C}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Zmuda et al. had detected field-aligned currents. Alfvén subsequently acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfvén|first=Hannes|title=Double layers and circuits in astrophysics|journal=IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci.|year=1986|volume=14|issue=6|pages=779–793|doi=10.1109/TPS.1986.4316626|bibcode=1986ITPS...14..779A }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Dessler had "discovered the currents that Birkeland had predicted" and they should be called Birkeland-Dessler currents. 1967 is therefore taken as the date when Birkeland's theory was finally acknowledged to have been vindicated. In 1969 Milo Schield, Alex Dessler and John Freeman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schields |first=M. |author2=J. Freeman|author3=A. Dessler |title=A Source for Field‐Aligned Currents at Auroral Latitudes|journal=J. Geophys.

In 1970 Zmuda, Armstrong and Heuring wrote another paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zmuda |first=A. |author2=J. Armstrong|author3=F. Heuring |title=Characteristics of Transverse Magnetic Disturbances Observed at 1100 Kilometers in the Auroral Oval |journal=J. Geophys.

[[File:Vertisol.jpg|thumb|upright|Bujeo soil profile]]
'''Bujeo''' is a type of [[soil]] found on the countryside of [[Andalusia]] , mainly the area of the [[Guadalquivir]] valley.&lt;ref name="Naylon1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Naylon|title=Andalusia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTEuAAAAMAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color ranges from yellowish brown to olive brown gray and dark gray to almost black, depending on their composition. One of its main features is its columnar structure strong and deep cracks in the dry state when dealing with materials rich in clays expansive. The texture is silty clay to clay. Their pH ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and organic matter content is generally low.

Because of the way these loamy clay soils "swell in winter and crack deeply in summer", they are called "tierras de bujeo", which literally means "land that moves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/6067049Riparia_Enviroments_in_Hispania_Ulterior_Baetica_The_Case_of_the_Lagoon_of_La_Janda_and_the_Estuary_of_the_Barbate_River |title=Riparia Environments in Hispania Ulterior |work=academia.edu |accessdate=4 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colter's Hell''' is an area of [[fumarole]]s and hot springs on the [[Shoshone River]] near [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wyoming]].  The thermal area covers about a square mile at the mouth of the Shoshone's canyon. Its thermal activity has declined ever since its description by [[mountain man]] [[John Colter]], who parted from the [[Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition]] prior to its conclusion and passed through the region in the winter of 1807-1808. Colter's account of the features on what was then called the Stinkingwater River has subsequently been confused with the much more extensive and powerful geysers in [[Yellowstone National Park]], which Colter may not have actually visited.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=73001937}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Colter's Hell|last=Frost|first=Ned|date=December 19, 1969|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early descriptions of Colter's Hell date back to the trapper [[Joseph Meek]] in the year of 1830 as well as to [[Plenty Coups]], a chief of the [[Absarokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], who camped with his tribe at the thermal area in 1840. Meek had seen geyser basin in Yellowstone and described Colter's Hell in similar terms, implying that there were active geysers at his visit.  Today the area consists of hot springs and steam vents.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt; Several extinct geyser or hot spring cones stand up to {{convert|30|ft|m}} high on the riverbank. Other hot springs were located near the confluence of the north and south forks of the Shoshone, now drowned under the reservoir created by [[Buffalo Bill Dam]].&lt;ref name="chjh1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte1/chap4.htm |title=Chapter IV: "Colter's Hell": A Case of Mistaken Identity |last=Mattes |first=Merrill J. |year=1962 |work=Colter's Hell and Jackson's Hole |publisher=Yellowstone Association &amp; Grand Teton Natural History Association |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231133006/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte1/chap4.htm |archivedate=2009-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that Colter's Hell referred to one of the geyser basins of Yellowstone first appeared in [[Hiram M. Chittenden]]'s 1895 book ''Yellowstone National Park.''  However, Chittenden went on to describe a "tar spring" on the Stinkingwater as well under the same name. Chittenden's speculation contradicts the earliest published description of the site in [[Washington Irving]]'s account of Captain [[Benjamin Bonneville|Benjamin L.E. Bonneville]]'s journals of Bonneville's scouts' visit to the location in 1833, the same year that another of Bonneville's survey parties discovered  the geyser basins of Yellowstone along the [[Firehole River]].&lt;ref name="chjh1"/&gt;

Colter's Hell is just to the north of [[US 14]]-[[US 16|16]]-[[US 20|20]] on the west side of Cody.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

The '''''Complete English Gardener''''' is a practical guide to [[gardening]] first published in 1670 by English author Leonard Meager. The original title is '''''The English Gardener, or, A Sure Guide to Young Planters and Gardeners: in Three Parts'''''.

''The Complete English Gardener'' was among many gardening books released after [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]]'s ''Paradisi in Sole'' in 1629.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bushnell|first1=Rebecca W.|title=Green Desire: Imagining Early Modern English Gardens|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801441439|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&amp;pg=PA74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was very popular and went through many editions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fussell|first1=G.

It contains a variety of gardening advice, including how to grow [[grape]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castle|first=Steven|date=5 November 1887|title=Jottings on old garden literature|journal=The Horticultural Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nt5IAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA300|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's influence extended to the American [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colony of Massachusetts]]. The book was described by author Ann Leighton as "the epitome of all the handy books on gardening which were becoming plentiful in a time when books of instruction from those purporting to be experts were greatly in vogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leighton|first1=Ann|title=Early American Gardens: For Meate Or Medicine|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0870235303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtqsKBE2VVQC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=18 September 2016|language=en|year= 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Tasman Plateau''' is a submerged [[microcontinent]] south east of [[Tasmania]].  Its area is {{convert|50000|km2}}, and it is mostly from {{convert|2500|to|3000|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/37788/Rec2001_040.pdf|title=Geological framework of  the South Tasman Rise and  East Tasman Plateau|last=Hill|first=P.

==Tectonics==
Prior to tectonic rifting, the East Tasman Plateau microcontinent was attached to the southeast of Tasmania and the north east of the South Tasman Rise.&lt;ref name=microcon/&gt; To the northeast, east and south east of the plateau was the Lord Howe Rise.&lt;ref name="Gaina1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaina|first=Carmen|author2=Dietmar R.

In the [[Cretaceous]] period, the continental breakup of [[Gondwana]] started near [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]].  About {{Ma|83}} a rift entered the east coast of Tasmania from the south and split off the [[Lord Howe Rise]]&lt;ref name=microcon/&gt; from the [[South Tasman Rise]] to the west.&lt;ref name="Exon1997"/&gt;  [[Sea floor spreading]] continued to move this continental sliver away to the east from Tasmania and Australia, and the rift jumped into the Lord Howe Rise and separated off the East Tasman Plateau.&lt;ref name=microcon/&gt; The detachment of the East Tasman Plateau from the Lord Howe Rise has left a large gulf on the west side of the Lord Howe Rise around 38°S 162°E where it used to be.&lt;ref name="Gaina1998"/&gt;

In the late Cretaceous the East Tasman Plateau was at 65°S and it moved north to 60°S in early Oligocene.&lt;ref name=exon03&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238585409_Late_Cretaceous_to_Oligocene_Geological_History_of_the_East_Tasman_Plateau_a_Key_Piece_of_the_Tasmanian_Gateway_Story|title=Late Cretaceous to Oligocene Geological History of the East Tasman Plateau, a Key Piece of the Tasmanian Gateway Story - ResearchGate|last=Exon|first=N. F.|date=December 2003|work=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The geology of the East Tasman Plateau includes early hard continental type rocks, volcanic rocks which are part of sea mounts, and marine sediments deposited since it was below sea level.

The earliest continental East Tasman Plateau rocks that have been brought to the surface of the sea are of [[Neoproterozoic]] age, and include [[gneiss]], [[rhyolite]], [[quartzite]], sandstone, [[ferricrete]], and metamorphosed sediments.&lt;ref name="Exon1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exon|first=N. F.|author2=R. F. Berry |author3=A. J. Crawford |author4=P. J. Hill |year=1997|title=Geological evolution of the East Tasman Plateau, a continental fragment southeast of Tasmania|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=44|issue=5|pages=597–608|issn=0812-0099|doi=10.1080/08120099708728339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern edge of the plateau facing the Tasman Basin is steep, dropping more than {{convert|1000|m}} and composed of granite.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

Sediments on the East Tasman Plateau start with silty clay from [[Maastrichtian]] to Eocene. These were deposited in shallow sea water.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; The [[microfossil]]s found in these layers include spores, pollen from coniferous forests, and [[dinocyst]]s.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; The pollen showed that the climate was humid, with cool winters.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; From early to mid Eocene, 55 to 37 Ma, the climate on nearby land was uniform, wet and cool and supported angiosperm forests.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; During the mid Eocene microfossils include [[diatom]]s.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; Above this in the stratigraphic record is [[glauconite]] containing siltstone deposited at the end of the Eocene.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; This material was due to condensed sedimentation due to the added water from the current.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; During this period around 36 million years ago the plateau started sinking to a depth of {{convert|300|m}}.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;  After this there was a gap in the deposition, due to the opening of the Southern Ocean between the Australian Continent and Antarctica.  A seaway carrying the strong [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] developed.  The current eroded part of the surface, and stopped the sediments from the land masses from reaching it. During Oligocene to mid Miocene there were oceanic deposits of clay and calcareous ooze.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Microfossils from this time include [[foraminifer]]s.&lt;ref name=exon03/&gt; After this the circumpolar current strengthened and only ooze deposited.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; The current rate of buildup of ooze on the seabed on the plateau is about {{convert|0.01|mm}} per year which is quite slow.&lt;ref name="Nees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.rses.anu.edu.au/dedeckker_p/pubs/111.pdf|title=A stable—isotope record for the Late Quaternary from the East Tasman Plateau|last=Nees|first=Stephan |author2=I Martinez |author3=P De Decker |author4=M Ayress|year=1994|work=Evolution of the Tasman Sea Basin|publisher=Balkema|pages=197–202|accessdate=5 July 2014|location=Rotterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinking has been at the rate of {{convert|1|km}} in 10 million years (0.1&amp;nbsp;mm/year), so the buildup of sediments is not keeping pace with submergence.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

After the deposition of sediments, the sediment has been modified by [[phosphatisation]] and the formation of [[ferromanganese crust]]s.&lt;ref name="Quilty1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quilty|first=P. G.|year=1997|title=Eocene and younger biostratigraphy and lithofacies of the Cascade Seamount, East Tasman Plateau, southwest Pacific Ocean|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=44|issue=5|pages=655–665|issn=0812-0099|doi=10.1080/08120099708728343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleoclimate===
Carbonate-clumped isotope thermometry uses the carbon-13 and oxygen-18 isotope levels in carbonates to determine the sea temperature.  This is in addition to the microfossils, which give a temperature clue as different organisms live in different water temperatures. The sediment cores from the East Tasman Plateau give a history of the temperature of the [[Southern Ocean]] and are valuable in seeing the limits of climate change in the future. Water temperature on the Plateau has been as high as {{convert|22|°C}}.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/ancient-antarctica-was-as-warm-as-todays-florida-and-ca-1566063244|title=Ancient Antarctica Was As Warm As Today's Florida And California|last=Dvorsky|first=George|date=22 April 2014|work=[[Io9]]|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=P.

==Cascade Seamount==
The '''Cascade Seamount''' is an [[seamount|undersea mountain]] which has a height from its base higher than those on Tasmania.  The peak of Cascade Seamount is currently {{convert|598|m}} deep.&lt;ref name="Quilty2001"/&gt; The top of the seamount is fairly flat and domed, but once down to {{convert|900|m|abbr=on}} deep the sides slope off very steeply.&lt;ref name="Quilty2001"/&gt; The Cascade Seamount is a volcano formed during the [[Late Eocene]] period as a result of the [[Balleny mantle plume]].&lt;ref name="Exon1997"/&gt; This volcano has produced [[volcanic breccia]], [[hyaloclastite]] and [[alkali olivine basalt]].&lt;ref name="Exon1997"/&gt; The extra weight of the seamount isostatically depressed the adjacent plateau to form a basin.  The basin filled with up to {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} of sediment during Late Eocene, and [[early Oligocene]], and another {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} of [[calcareous ooze]] and chalk during [[late Oligocene]].&lt;ref name="Exon1997"/&gt; Originally the volcano was more than {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.  The age is confirmed by [[foraminifera]] microfossils [[Chiloguembelina cubensis]], [[Globigerapsis index]], [[Globigerapsis rubriformis]], [[Subbotina angiporoides]] and [[Subbotina linaperta]] found in the sediment on the volcano.  This sediment settled in shallow water.&lt;ref name="Quilty2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quilty|first=P. G.|year=2001|title=Late Eocene foraminifers and palaeoenvironment, Cascade Seamount, southwest Pacific Ocean: implications for seamount subsidence and Australia-Antarctica Eocene correlation|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=48|issue=5|pages=633–641|issn=0812-0099|doi=10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.485886.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cascade Seamount is part of a chain of volcanic seamounts that extend south to the [[Balleny Islands]] near Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Lanyon1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanyon|first=Ruth|author2=Rick Varne |author3=Anthony J. Crawford |year=1993|title=Tasmanian Tertiary basalts, the Balleny plume, and opening of the Tasman Sea (southwest Pacific Ocean)|journal=Geology|volume=21|issue=6|page=555|issn=0091-7613|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021&lt;0555:TTBTBP&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High frequency [[echogram]]s show that the top of the seamount is covered in sediment, but that the steep slopes are rocky.  There is possibly a debris flow on the east flank.&lt;ref name="Melissa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geohab.org/conferences/2002-moss-landing/2002-moss-landing-agenda-abstracts/|title=Acoustic Sea floor Mapping of Southeast Australia|last=Melissa|first=E.|author2=Daniell, James J. |author3=Harris, Peter T. |author4=Heap, Andrew D. |work=2002 Moss Landing – Agenda &amp; Abstracts  GEOHAB|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name for Cascade Seamount has also been called '''Cascade Guyot'''.  The feature was discovered in 1944, and appeared on chart BA214 in 1954. It was named after the [[Cascade Brewery]].&lt;ref name="scufn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gebco.net/about_us/meetings_and_minutes/documents/gebco_scufn_14_report.pdf|title=Fourteenth Meeting of the GEBCO Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN)|date=20 April 2001|page=25|accessdate=13 July 2014|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==

[[Total primary energy supply]] (TPES) in [[Slovenia]] was 6.67 [[tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]] in 2014. In the same year, electricity consumption was 13.87 TWh.&lt;ref name=iea2014 /&gt;

Electricity generation is mainly from nuclear power, hydroelectricity (each at 36.5%) and coal (21.6%). Other minor sources include solar PV, biofuels and natural gas. Slovenia has a significant import and export of electricity, with about 16% of the generation as net exports in 2014.&lt;ref name=iea2014&gt;{{cite web|title=IEA - Report|url=https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?year=2014&amp;country=Slovenia&amp;product=ElectricityandHeat|website=www.iea.org|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenia is a net energy importer, importing all its oil products (mainly for the transport sector) and natural gas.

== Overview ==
Slovenia imported 49% of its energy use in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] IEA Key stats 2010 page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia's forecast{{cn|date=September 2015}}, renewables satisfy about 40% of the country’s electricity consumption in 2020{{cn|date=September 2015}}. Slovenia is the EU country with the smallest forecast penetration of [[wind power]] in 2020: 1.3% of electricity consumption, while the Irish action plan shows wind meeting over 36% of the country’s electricity demand. Slovenia has intention to cover its EU [[renewable energy]] obligations 6.1TWh  (2020) mainly with [[hydro power]] 5.1 TWh and [[biomass]] 0.7 TWh. According to [[EWEA]]’s calculations by 2020 wind could cover 6% - 9% of electricity demand. The newly adopted feed-in tariff limiting support to projects of 5 MW and under may be hindering perspectives for wind power development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/EWEA_EU_Energy_Policy_to_2050.pdf EU Energy Policy to 2050] EWEA March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evolution''''' is a collection of short stories that work together to form an episodic [[science fiction]] novel by author [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]].  It follows 565 million years of human evolution, from [[shrewlike]] mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity (and its descendants, both biological and non-biological) 500 million years in the future.

==Plot summary==
The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving [[Purgatorius]] into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) [[New World]] on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on [[Antarctica]].

The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become [[Sapience|sapient]], and go on to develop technology, including an evolving [[universal assembler|universal constructor]] machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of [[global ecophagy]]  consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. [[Human extinction]] (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet.  (The [[extinction-level event]] that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the [[Rabaul caldera]], coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in ''Evolution'' are ponderous Romans, sapient [[dinosaur]]s, the last of the wild [[Neanderthal]]s, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, [[symbiotic]] primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. The final chapter witnesses the final fate of the last primate and the descendants of the replicator machines sent to [[Mars]] that are implied to have reached sentience and colonized the galaxy.
In the epilogue, Joan Useb (a paleontologist introduced in the prologue and in the intermission sections) discusses the philosophy of evolution with her daughter Lucy as they weather the aftermath of Rabaul on the [[Galapagos]], where [[Charles Darwin]] made his observations leading to his landmark theory.

==Reception==
[[Peter Cannon]] reviewing for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "here is a rigorously constructed hard SF novel where the question is not whether humanity will reach the stars but how it will survive its own worst tendencies."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=January 20, 2003|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 3|pages=61|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called this novel "glum, dyspeptic, and depressing."&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 15, 2002|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume= 70|issue= 22,|pages=1662|issn=0042-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Cassada said in her review for ''[[Library Journal]]'' that "spanning more than 165 million years and encompassing the entire planet, Baxter's ambitious saga provides both an exercise in painless paleontology and superb storytelling."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie |date=February 15, 2003|title=Evolution (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 3|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evolution'' has been compared to [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Last and First Men]]'' and Baxter has acknowledged Stapledon's influence.&lt;ref name="AberrantDreams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd-image.com/interviews/myles_cabot_07.htm|title=An Interview with Stephen Baxter|work=Aberrant Dreams|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alpine flora.png|thumb|right|220px|Flora typical of the [[Alpine Region of the Alps]]]]
The [[Alps]] are one of the great mountain range systems of Europe stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750&amp;nbsp;mi) across eight Alpine countries from Austria and Slovenia in the east, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, France to the west and Italy and Monaco to the south.
The '''flora of the Alps''' are diverse. In the [[mountain]]s, the [[vegetation]] gradually changes with [[altitude]], sun exposure, and location on the mountain. There are five successive [[life zone]]s, each with distinct [[landscape]]s and vegetation characteristics: [[premontane]], [[montane]], [[subalpine]], [[alpine climate|alpine]], and [[alvar]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The '''GNC hypothesis''' or '''GNC-SNS primeval genetic code hypothesis''' refers to a hypothesis about the origin of genes.  It suggests the universal genetic code originated not from a three-amino acid system, but from a four-amino acid system. It is this GNC code encoding [GADV]-proteins which is the most primitive genetic code. This hypothesis was first proposed by [[Kenji Ikehara]] at Nara Women's University.

==Details==
While almost all of the [[organism]]s on Earth share the universal [[genetic code]], in the GNC hypothesis it is argued that two primeval genetic codes preceded the present genetic code as follows:

* First, there emerged [[Guanine|G]]N[[Cytosine|C]] primeval genetic codes involving 4 [[Genetic code|codons]] (GGC, GCC, G[[Adenine|A]]C and G[[Uracil|U]]C), which code 4 GADV-[[amino acid]]s ([[glycine]], [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]] and [[valine]]).
* Second, GNC code evolved to SNS primeval genetic codes involving 16 codons (GGC, GGG, GCC, GCG, GAC, GAG, GUC, GUG, CUC, GUG, CCC, CCG, CAC, CAG, CGC and CGG), which code 10 amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, valine, [[glutamic acid]], [[leucine]], [[proline]], [[histidine]], [[glutamine]], [[arginine]]).

The GNC hypothesis is based on the following facts:

* [[Protein]]s composed of GADV-amino acids coded by GNC primeval genetic code can form four fundamental structures found in proteins in present organisms, namely, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] structures, [[Alpha helix|α-helices]], [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]], and [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]s (or coils).
* Proteins composed of ten amino acids coded by SNS primeval genetic code can form six fundamental structures, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures, α-helices, β-sheets, turns, [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] fragments.

The '''Great Rift Valley''' of [[Ethiopia]], (or Main Ethiopian Rift or Ethiopian Rift Valley) is a branch of the [[East African Rift]] that runs through [[Ethiopia]] in a southwest direction from the [[Afar Triple Junction]]. In the past, it was seen as part of a "[[Great Rift Valley, geographical concept|Great Rift Valley]]" that ran from [[Mozambique]] to [[Syria]].

==Description==

The Great Rift Valley lies between the Ethiopian Plateau to the north and the Somalia Plateau to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref={{harvid|CNR}} |url=http://ethiopianrift.igg.cnr.it/rift%20valley%20geography.htm
 |title=The Ethiopian rift valley: geography and morphology
 |publisher=CNR-IGG 
 |author=G. Corti
 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rift]] developed as the [[Nubian Plate|Nubian]] and [[Somali plate|Somali]] plates began to separate during the [[Miocene]] Period along the East African rift system. Rift initiation was asynchronous along the Ethiopian rift valley: deformation began around 18 million years ago at the south end, around 11 million years ago close to the Afar depression and probably around 6-8 million years ago in the central sector.&lt;ref&gt;Bonini M., Corti G., Innocenti F., Manetti P., Mazzarini F., Abebe T., Pecskay Z; ''The evolution of the Main Ethiopian Rift in the frame of Afar and Kenya rifts propagation,'' Tectonics, 24, TC1007, doi:10.1029/2004TC001680&lt;/ref&gt; The rift is extending in an ESE-WNW direction at about {{convert|5|-|7|mm|in|abbr=off}} annually.&lt;ref&gt;Corti, G.; ''Continental rift evolution: from rift initiation to incipient breakup in the Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa,'' Earth-Science Reviews, v. 96, p. 1–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian rift valley is about {{convert|80|km|mi}} wide and bordered on both margins by large, discontinuous [[normal fault]]s that give rise to major tectonic escarpments separating the rift floor from the surrounding plateaus. These faults are now thought to be inactive at the northern rift valley termination, whereas to the south they are still tectonically and seismically active.&lt;ref&gt;Keir, D., Ebinger, C.J., Stuart, G.W., Daly, E. and Ayele, A. ''Strain accommodation by magmatism and faulting as rifting proceeds to breakup: seismicity of the northern Ethiopian rift,'' Journal of Geophysical Research, 111(B5), B05314, doi: 10.1029/2005JB003748&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agostini A., Bonini M., Corti G., Sani F., Manetti P.; ''Distribution of Quaternary deformation in the central Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa,'' Tectonics, 30, TC4010, doi:10.1029/2010TC002833&lt;/ref&gt;  The rift floor is cut by a series of smaller en echelon, right-stepping, rift basins of [[Quaternary]] to recent age. These basins are about {{convert|20|km|mi}} wide and  {{convert|60|km|mi}} long. In the northern part of the rift, extension within the valley is now thought to be mainly along these faulted and [[magma]]tically active segments. These segments are considered to be developing [[mid ocean ridge]] spreading centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|School of Earth and Environment}} |url=http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/afar/websitepages/structurepages/mer.htm

== Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes ==
[[File:Ethiopia central lakes.jpg|right|thumb]]

The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes are the northernmost of the African Rift Valley Lakes. The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the rift valley between the two highlands. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an outlet, and most are [[Alkalinity|alkaline]]. Although the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes are of great importance to Ethiopia's economy, as well as being essential to the survival of the local people, there were no intensive and extensive [[limnological]] studies undertaken of these lakes until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.euronet.nl/users/backhuys/tuet.htm

'''João Mangabeira'''  (26  June  1880 –  27 April  1964) was a [[Brazil]]ian jurist, politician and writer.

==Biography==
Brother of the medical doctor and poet [[Francisco Mangabeira]], and also of the politician [[Otávio Mangabeira]]. He was admitted to law school at 13 years old. Despite belonging to a large family without large financial resources, he managed to complete his course at the age of 17. Then goes to advocate in [[Ilhéus]], [[Bahia]]. According to [[Paulo Brossard]], "when the annual session of the jury starts, went on trial a poor defendant without a lawyer. As defense lawyer the Judge designated João Mangabeira. He knew nothing about the process. Listening to the Judge's report, paid attention to everything: names, pages, details.

As soon as the Prosecutor concluded the indictment, the young defense lawyer, appointed minutes before, shatters the charge, pointing out contradictions, correcting names, indicating process pages that he do not handle at all.

The defendant was acquitted ... and, thereafter, the city begun to trust the lawyer who was no more than a child, and his office start to have clients."

Shortly after he became a congressman as State Deputy and then as Federal Deputy. Some circumstances made him close to [[Rui Barbosa]], who would always follow.
In 1923, when Rui died, he gave the speech in honor of the master. On the centenary of birth of Rui Barbosa (1949), João was the speaker of the House of Representatives.

In a short time he became one of the most prominent figures in the House of Representatives. Renowned as congressman and as a lawyer, he came to be among the highest expressions of the country's intelligence.

His political activity was marked defending the [[socialism]]. Deputy for the [[Constitutional Assembly]] of 1934, and the combat against the Estado Novo dictatorship ([[Vargas Era]]) put him 15 months in prison. "I'd rather get in jail by this dictatorship, than be free, agreeing with it," he said in 1936.

'''Kitsat-2''' ([[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] ''"Uribyol 2", "Kitsat-OSCAR 25", "KO 25" and "KitSAT B"'') was a [[South Korea]]n experimental [[Earth observation satellite|earth observation]] [[Miniaturized satellite#Microsatellites|microsatellite]]. Kitsat-2 was South Korea's second satellite and was the first to be developed and manufactured domestically by the [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science]]. The satellite was launched into [[orbit]] on 26 September 1993, on the 59th flight of the [[Ariane 4|Ariane-40 H10]] [[expendable launch vehicle]]. The launch took place in the [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou Space Centre]], [[French Guiana]]. The satellite's mission was to improve and enhance the [[Kitsat-1]] systems, use domestically manufactured components, demonstrate experimental modules and to promote domestic space industry.&lt;ref name="KITSAT series - KITSAT-2"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT series - KITSAT-2|publisher=[[KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center]]|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://satrec.kaist.ac.kr/e_02_01_01.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KITSAT-OSCAR 25"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT-OSCAR 25|publisher=om3ktr.sk|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://www.om3ktr.sk/druzice/ko25.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KITSAT 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT 2|publisher=n2yo.com|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=22828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KITSAT 2 COSPAR ID: 1993-061F"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT 2 COSPAR ID: 1993-061F|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1993-061F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitsat 1, 2 (Uribyol 1, 2 / Kitsat-OSCAR 23, 25 / KO 23, 25)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kitsat 1, 2 (Uribyol 1, 2 / Kitsat-OSCAR 23, 25 / KO 23, 25)|publisher=Gunter's space page|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/kitsat-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake breakout''' is a [[geological]] term that refers to the collapse of a (usually high-altitude) lake. High-altitude lakes tend to form in [[volcanic crater]]s &amp;ndash; where they are called [[crater lake]]s &amp;ndash; or in valleys dammed as the result of [[earthquake]]s or [[glacier|glacial]] or volcanic deposition. Lake breakouts are most common a few weeks or months after a [[volcanic eruption]] as a river becomes blocked by volcanic debris. 
==Process==
The walls of such lakes can be unstable and may be breached after fresh earthquakes or because of [[erosion]]. As water rushes outwards, the initial channel is cut wider and deeper, further increasing the flow. This may cause the lake's rim to collapse abruptly. The usual result is for huge amounts of water to be displaced, incorporating a great deal of [[sediment]] which increases it in volume by as much as two or four times, or even more. This produces violent floods and [[lahar]]s with devastating effects for any settlements in their path.
==Historical events==
The larger a temporary lake is, the more extreme the likely breakout will be. One of the largest known to have occurred in recent geological history was the collapse, around 15,000 years ago, of the ancient [[Lake Bonneville]] which was filled with meltwater from the last [[ice age]] and covered large areas of [[Utah]], [[Idaho]] and [[Nevada]]. Erosion broke through the lake shore's lowest point, the [[Red Rock Pass]] in Idaho, releasing as much as 1,000 mile³ (4,000&amp;nbsp;km³) of water within a period estimated to have lasted only two weeks. The energies released by the outburst were capable not just of stripping surface features, but gouging out bedrock to a depth of many feet. It drastically reshaped the landscape downstream, carving out many of the features of the [[Snake River]] and its surrounding area. 
[[Glacial Lake Missoula]] also had lake breakouts, due to breaking of ice dams, see [[Missoula Floods]]. These lake breakouts caused extensive erosion throughout eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]].
It has been suggested that gigantic breakouts from underground lakes may have been responsible for carving some of the [[canyon]]s of [[Mars]].

==Mitigation==
Although there is little that can be done about many lake breakouts, some have been prevented (or at least delayed) by human intervention. The [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] blocked nearby Castle Creek, forming a lake which geologists feared would produce a sudden lahar. The [[United States]] [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] excavated an outlet channel which prevented the lake from overtopping its new [[debris dam]].

A '''[[botanical garden]]''' is a place where [[plant]]s, especially [[fern]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[flowering]] plants, are grown and displayed for the purposes of [[research]] and [[education]]. This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with beautiful flowers, are grown for public amenity  [[Botanical garden]]s that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as [[arboretum|arboreta]].  They are occasionally associated with [[zoo]]s. The botanical garden in Nashik is the first of its kind in the country and only one in South East Asia with a unique laser show.

[[File:Oil and gas industry reserves by nation.png|thumb|Countries by natural gas and oil proven reserves (2015) |alt=oil and gas Industry Reserves by Nation]]
[[File:Oil Reserves Updated.png|thumb|A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, January 2014]]
[[File: Oil Reserves Top 5 Countries.png|thumb|Trends in proven oil reserves in top five countries, 1980–2013 (data from US Energy Information Administration)]]

This is a '''list of countries by [[oil reserves|proven oil reserves]]'''. Proven reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated, with a high degree of confidence, to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions.

Some statistics on this page are disputed and controversial. Different sources ([[OPEC]], [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], [[list of oil exploration and production companies|oil companies]]) give different figures. Some of the differences reflect different types of oil included. Different estimates may or may not include [[oil shale]], mined [[oil sands]] or [[Natural-gas processing#Contaminants in raw natural gas|natural gas liquids]].
[[File:Map-of-countries-by-proven-oil-reserves-(in-millions-of-barrels)---2017---US-EIA---Jo-Di-graphics.jpg|thumb|Map of countries with proven oil reserves - according to U.S. EIA (start of 2017)]]
Because proven reserves include oil recoverable under current economic conditions, nations may see large increases in proven reserves when known, but previously uneconomic deposits become economic to develop. In this way, Canada's proven reserves increased suddenly in 2003 when the oil sands of [[Alberta]] were seen to be economically viable. Similarly, Venezuela's proven reserves jumped in the late 2000s when the heavy oil of the [[Orinoco]] was judged economic.

&lt;!-- BEFORE YOU CHANGE THE TABLE, PLEASE NOTE:
This is a table only for PROVEN RESERVES, which is a restricted classification not always understood by popular news reports. Other reserve classifications or descriptions often used, including ESTIMATED, PROBABLE, POSSIBLE, or LIKELY reserves, DO NOT BELONG IN THIS TABLE. --&gt;

Reserves amounts are listed in millions of [[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (MMbbl). The column "Years until exhaustion" uses the daily production figures as of 2016 &lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/data/browser/#/?pa=00000000000000000000000000000000002&amp;c=ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvvvuvo&amp;ct=0&amp;tl_id=5-A&amp;vs=INTL.57-1-AFG-TBPD.A&amp;vo=0&amp;v=H&amp;start=2014&amp;end=2016 |title=Production of Crude Oil including Lease Condensate 2016 |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |format=CVS download

==Different sources==
Sources sometimes differ on the volume of proven oil reserves. The differences sometimes result from different classes of oil included, and sometimes result from different definitions of proven.

Statistics for earthquakes with M ≥ 7.0 in Chile are detailed on the list below.

The region, which is adjacent to the fast-moving [[Nazca Plate]], has high tectonic activity. To keep the list manageable, only earthquakes with magnitude ≥ 7.0 will be included, or if it is has other notable features like the [[2010 Pichilemu earthquake]]. The records for earlier centuries are apparently incomplete. 

Of the [[Lists of earthquakes#Largest earthquakes by magnitude|world's known earthquakes with M ≥ 8.5]] since the year 1500, one-third occurred in Chile and are shown in the map to the side. Some virtually have the same epicenters like the 1604 and [[1868 Arica earthquake|1868]] (in Arica), the [[1730 Valparaíso earthquake|1730]] and 1822 (in Valparaíso), and the [[1751 Concepción earthquake|1751]] and [[1835 Concepción earthquake|1835]] (in Concepción).

The strongest known recorded in modern times was also in Chile, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]].

This is a '''list of the most massive [[star]]s''' so far discovered, in [[solar mass]]es  ({{Solar mass|link=y}}).

==Uncertainties and caveats==
Most of the masses listed below are contested and, being the subject of current research, remain under review and subject to revision. Indeed, many of the masses listed in the table below are inferred from theory, using difficult measurements of the stars’ temperatures and absolute brightnesses. All the masses listed below are uncertain: both the theory and the measurements are pushing the limits of current knowledge and technology. Either measurement or theory, or both, could be incorrect. For example, [[VV Cephei]] could be between {{Solar mass|25–40|link=y}}, or {{Solar mass|100}}, depending on which property of the star is examined.

[[File:Dust disk around massive star.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist's impression of disc of obscuring material around a massive star.]]
Massive stars are rare; [[astronomer]]s must look very far from the [[Earth]] to find one. All the listed stars are many thousands of light years away and that alone makes measurements difficult.

In addition to being far away, many stars of such extreme mass are surrounded by clouds of outflowing gas created by powerful [[stellar wind]]s; the surrounding gas interferes with the already difficult-to-obtain measurements of stellar temperatures and brightnesses and greatly complicates the issue of estimating internal chemical compositions.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For some methods, different determinations of chemical composition lead to different estimates of mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the obscuring clouds and the great distances make it difficult to judge whether the star is just a single supermassive object or, instead, a [[multiple star]] system. A number of the "stars" listed below may actually be two or more companions orbiting too closely to distinguish, each star being massive in itself but not necessarily “supermassive”. Other combinations are possible &amp;ndash; for example a supermassive star with one or more smaller companions or more than one giant star &amp;ndash; but without being able to see inside the surrounding cloud, it is difficult to know the truth of the matter. More globally, statistics on stellar populations seem to indicate that the upper mass limit is in the 100&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;solar mass range.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Rare reliable estimates===
Eclipsing binary stars are the only stars whose masses are estimated with some confidence. However note that almost all of the masses listed in the table below were inferred by indirect methods; only a few of the masses in the table were determined using eclipsing systems.

Amongst the most reliable listed masses are those for the eclipsing binaries [[NGC 3603-A1]], [[WR21a]], and [[Westerlund 2|WR20a]]. Masses for all three were obtained from orbital measurements.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For a binary star, it is possible to measure the individual masses of the two stars by studying their orbital motions, using [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].&lt;/ref&gt; This involves measuring their [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] and also their light curves. The radial velocities only yield minimum values for the masses, depending on inclination, but light curves of eclipsing binaries provide the missing information: inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.

===Relevance of stellar evolution===
Some stars may once have been heavier than they are today. It is likely that many have suffered significant mass loss, perhaps as much as several tens of solar masses, expelled by the process of [[superwind]], where high velocity winds are expelled from the hot  [[photosphere]] into interstellar space. This process is similar to superwinds generated by [[Asymptotic Giant Branch]] (AGB) stars in form [[red giant]]s or [[planetary nebula]]e. The process forms an enlarged extended envelope around the star that interacts with the nearby interstellar medium and infusing the region with elements heavier than Hydrogen or Helium.

There are also – or rather ''were'' – stars that might have appeared on the list but no longer exist as stars, or are [[supernova impostor]]s; today we see only the debris.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For examples of stellar debris see [[hypernovae]] and [[supernova remnant]].&lt;/ref&gt; The masses of the precursor stars that fueled these cataclysms can be estimated from the type of explosion and the energy released, but those masses are not listed here (see the section [[#Black holes]] below).

===Mass limits===
There are two related theoretical limits on how massive a star can possibly be. One is related to star formation: After about 120&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass|link=y}} have accreted in a [[protostar]], the combined mass should have become hot enough for its heat to drive away any further incoming matter. In effect, the protostar reaches a point where it evaporates material away as fast as it collects new material.   
The other limit is based on light pressure from the core of an already-formed star: As mass increases past ~150&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}, the intensity of light radiated from a [[Population I]] star's core will become sufficient for the light-pressure pushing outward to exceed the gravitational force pulling inward, and the surface material of the star will be free to float away into space.

;Eddington mass limit
{{Main|Eddington luminosity}}
A limit on stellar mass arises because of light-pressure: For a sufficiently massive star the outward [[pressure]] of radiant [[energy]] generated by [[nuclear fusion]] in the star’s core exceeds the inward pull of its own [[gravity]]. This effect is called the [[Eddington limit]].

Stars of greater mass have a higher rate of core energy generation, and heavier stars' luminosities increase far out of proportion to the increase in their masses. The [[Eddington limit]] is the point, beyond which a star ought to push itself apart, or at least shed enough mass to reduce its internal energy generation to a lower, maintainable rate. The actual limit-point mass depends on how opaque the gas in the star is, and metal-rich [[Population I]] stars have lower mass limits than metal-poor [[Population II]] stars, with the hypothetical metal-free [[Population III]] stars having the highest allowed mass, somewhere around 300&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}.

In theory, a more massive star could not hold itself together because of the mass loss resulting from the outflow of stellar material. In practice the theoretical Eddington Limit must be modified for high luminosity stars and the empirical [[Humphreys-Davidson limit]] is used instead.&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ulmer |first1=A. |last2=Fitzpatrick |first2=E. L. |doi=10.1086/306048 |title=Revisiting the modified Eddington limit for massive stars |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=504 |pages=200–206 |year=1998 |arxiv=astro-ph/9708264 |bibcode=1998ApJ...504..200U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Accretion limits
Astronomers have long hypothesized that as a [[protostar]] grows to a size beyond 120&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass|link=y}}, something drastic must happen. Although the limit can be stretched for very early [[Population III]] stars, and although the exact value is uncertain, if any stars still exist above 150–200&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}} they would challenge current theories of [[stellar evolution]].

Studying the [[Arches cluster]], which is currently the densest known cluster of stars in [[Milky Way Galaxy|our galaxy]], astronomers have confirmed that stars in that cluster do not occur any larger than about 150&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}.

Rare ultramassive stars that exceed this limit &amp;ndash; for example in the [[R136]] star cluster &amp;ndash; might be explained by the following proposal: Some of the pairs of massive [[binary star|stars in close orbit]] in young, unstable [[Star system#Trapezia|multiple-star systems]] must occasionally collide and merge where certain unusual circumstances hold that make a collision possible.&lt;ref name=bannerjee&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21672.x |title=The emergence of super-canonical stars in R136-type starburst clusters |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=426 |issue=2 |pages=1416–1426 |year=2012 |last1=Banerjee |first1=S. |last2=Kroupa |first2=P. |last3=Oh |first3=S. |bibcode=2012MNRAS.426.1416B |arxiv=1208.0826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of the most massive stars==
The following is a list of a few stars with an estimated mass of 25&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass|link=y}} or greater, including the stars of [[Arches cluster|Arches]] cluster, [[Cygnus OB2]]&amp;nbsp;cluster, [[Pismis 24]]&amp;nbsp;cluster, and [[R136]]&amp;nbsp;cluster. Note that ''all'' [[O-type star]]s have masses greater than 15&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}} and catalogs of such stars (GOSS, Reed) list hundreds of cases.

The majority of stars thought to be more than 100&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}} are shown, but this list is far from complete &amp;ndash; especially below 80&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}. The method used to determine the mass is included in the list to give an idea of uncertainty: direct methods (binary stars) being more secure than indirect ones (conversion from luminosity, extrapolation from stellar atmosphere models,&amp;nbsp;...).

The masses listed below are the stars’ ''current'' (evolved) mass, not their initial (formation) mass.

==Black holes==
{{Main|Black hole|List of black holes|List of most massive black holes}}
[[Black hole]]s are the end point evolution of massive stars. Technically they are not stars, as they no longer generate heat and light via nuclear fusion in their cores.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Note that some [[black hole]]s may have cosmological origins, and would then never have been stars. This is thought to be especially likely in the cases of the [[Supermassive black hole|most massive black holes]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stellar black hole]]s are objects with approximately 4–15&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass|link=y}}.
* [[Intermediate-mass black hole]]s range from 100–10 000&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}.
* [[Supermassive black hole]]s are in the range of millions or billions&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}.

In 2005 the [[government of Sweden]] appointed a commission to draw up a comprehensive programme to reduce [[Sweden]]'s dependence on [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and other ‘[[fossil fuel|fossil raw materials]]’ by 2020. In June 2006 (less than three months before the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]]) the commission issued its report, entitled '''''Making Sweden an Oil-Free Society''''' ({{lang-sv|På väg mot ett oljefritt Sverige}}). The report cited four reasons to reduce oil dependence:&lt;ref name='swegov2031'&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/2031/a/67096

|accessdate=2007-02-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The impact of [[Price of oil|oil prices]] on [[Economy of Sweden|Swedish economic]] growth and employment
*The link between oil, peace and security throughout the world
*The great potential to use Sweden's own clean [[renewable energy]] resources in place of [[oil]]
*The threat of [[global warming|climate change]] resulting from the extensive burning of [[fossil fuel]]s

As of 2005, oil supplies provided about 32% of the country's energy supply, with [[nuclear power]] and [[hydroelectricity]] providing much of the remainder. Although the report did not propose to end the use of oil entirely, the 2020 date was suggested as a marker on a continuing process of the "oil phase-out in Sweden".

Following defeat of the incumbent government coalition in the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]], the proposals were not included in the energy policy or in any law. “Sweden’s energy policy, in both the short and the long term, is to safeguard the supply of electricity and other forms of energy on terms that are competitive with the rest of the world. It is intended to create the right conditions for efficient use of energy and a cost efficient Swedish supply of energy, with minimum adverse effect on health, the environment or climate, and assisting the move towards an ecologically [[sustainable]] society.”&lt;ref name='EnerSwed2008'&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission on Oil Independence==
[[Image:gråbetongiangekullen.jpg|thumb|200px|Housing in [[Angered]].]]
To make recommendations on how dependency on oil should be broken, the government created a Commission on Oil Independence (''Kommissionen för att bryta oljeberoendet i Sverige till år 2020''), headed by the then Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]], which reported in June 2006.

In their report, the Commission proposed the following targets for 2020:

*consumption of oil in [[road transport]] to be reduced by 40-50 per cent;
*consumption of oil in [[industry]] to be cut by 25-40 per cent;
*[[Central heating|heating buildings]] with oil, a practice already cut by 70% since the [[1973 oil crisis]], should be phased out;
*overall, energy should be used 20% more efficiently.

[[Image:Heleneholmsverket, Malmö.jpg|thumb|200px|Power plant in [[Malmö]], 2006.]]
Replacing oil with [[renewable energy]] sources and [[energy conservation]] measures to cut total energy use was envisioned. This is also expected to result in cuts in [[carbon emissions]] and to strengthen the country's role in [[sustainable development]] technologies as well as increasing its international economic competitiveness.

===Energy sources===
Technical solutions under consideration include the further development of domestically grown [[biofuel]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[fuel cell]]s, [[wind farms]], [[wave energy]], a major increase in [[district heating]] schemes and greater use of [[geothermal heat pump]]s. It is expected that research, development and commercialization of such technologies should be supported by government.

The Commission also recommended that the government should not sanction the creation of a national [[natural gas]] infrastructure, on the belief that this would inhibit the development of [[biofuel]]s and encourage the use of gas in place of oil.

===Energy use===
[[Image:GothenburgTram1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gothenburg tram|Gothenburg tram system]], 1999.]]
To cut energy use, the commission anticipated that by 2020 at least 75% of all new housing would use [[low-energy house|low-energy building]] techniques similar to the German [[Passive house]] standard, and that it will also be necessary to modernize the existing housing stock, including replacing direct [[electric heating]] systems (with systems heated by district heating, [[biofuel]]s or heat pumps).

They also expect there to be a greater use of [[Telecommuting|teleworking]], [[Videoconferencing|video conferencing]] and [[webconferencing|web conferencing]], [[public transport]], [[ship transport|sea transport]], [[hybrid vehicle]]s, and smaller, lighter, [[biodiesel]] cars.

As part of reducing industrial consumption, it is proposed that carbon allowances issued in Sweden under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] should be cut to 75% of their initial levels by 2020.

The taxation system is also likely to be used to influence energy choices, together with education and public awareness initiatives.

==Progress==
On their release, the Commission's proposals were supported by the national automotive industry association, BIL Sweden. It was, however, opposed by the timber industry, who fear that land producing profitable exports may become used for low-income domestic [[biofuel]] production.&lt;ref name='worldchange0048'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, 43% of the Swedish primary energy supply comes from renewable sources, which is the largest share in any European Union country.&lt;ref name='SwedenRenewableShare'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2015, the Swedish government announced its plan to drastically cut its reliance on fossil fuels by 2020.  This plan also includes the goal of having the capital, Stockholm, 100% powered by renewable resources by 2050.  Though the goal is to have the entire country run on renewable resources, there is no temporal goal yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regeringen investerar för klimatet|url = http://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2015/09/regeringen-investerar-for-klimatet/|website = Regeringskansliet|date = 2015-09-16|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = sv|first = Regeringen och|last = Regeringskansliet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sweden Boosts Renewables to Become First Fossil-Fuel-Free Nation|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/sweden-boosts-renewables-to-become-first-fossil-fuel-free-nation|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07|first = Anna Hirtenstein|last = ahirtens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Budget Bill for 2016 – Investing in Sweden’s future|url = http://www.government.se/press-releases/2015/09/the-budget-bill-for-2016--investing-in-swedens-future/|website = Regeringskansliet|date = 2015-09-21|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = sv-se|first = Regeringen och|last = Regeringskansliet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
There are 23 '''[[national park]]s in [[Poland]]'''. These were formerly run by the Polish Board of National Parks (''Krajowy Zarząd Parków Narodowych''), but in 2004 responsibility for them was transferred to the Ministry of the Environment. Most national parks are divided into strictly and partially protected zones. Additionally, they are usually surrounded by a protective buffer zone called ''otulina''.

In Poland, as amended by the ''Nature Conservation Act'' 2004 &lt;ref name="uoop2004"&gt;Tekst ustawy z dnia 16 kwietnia 2004 r. ''o ochronie przyrody''  (Dz. U. z 2009 r. Nr 151, poz. 1220) &lt;/ref&gt; ''"covers an area of outstanding value for the environmental, scientific, social, cultural and educational, with an area of not less than 1000 ha , which is the protection of the whole nature and qualities of landscape . The national park created to preserve biodiversity, resources, objects and elements of inanimate nature and landscape values, restoring proper state of natural resources and components and reconstruct distorted nature habitats, plants , habitats of animals and habitats of fungi."''

The area of national parks is divided into different areas using separate methods of conservation.  There are strict protection zone, active and landscape.

In areas bordering the park designated as [[buffer zone]] of the national park.  The buffer zone can be formed protective zone of game animals and are non-inclusion of hunting .  National parks is available to visit, but tourism can be here only in designated areas, trails, roads, paths.

National Parks are funded from the central budget .  Are managed by the directors, as an advisory body to the Council of the park.  The April 30, 2004 parks were supervised by the National Board of National Parks .  From 1 May 2004, the duties were taken over by the Ministry of the Environment - Department of Forestry, Nature Conservation and Landscape since January 19, 2007 Independent Department for [[Natura 2000]] areas and National Parks.  After the establishment of GDOŚ and RDOŚ October 15, 2008, the task under the supervision of the Minister of the Environment of the National Parks Conservation Department completed the Ministry of Environment.

The Polish national parks are carried out numerous research programs.  Parks play an important role in education, ecological society.  The national parks you can visit, and tourism, and they provide a well-developed infrastructure of tourism.  Many of them have specially prepared trails and centers of educational and natural history museums.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)''' is a deep [[water mass]] formed in the North [[Atlantic Ocean]].  [[Thermohaline circulation]] (properly described as meridional overturning circulation) of the world's oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the North Atlantic.  Water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses, leading to increased salinity.  When this water reaches the North Atlantic it cools and sinks through convection, due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density.  NADW is the outflow of this thick deep layer, which can be detected by its high salinity, high oxygen content, nutrient minima, high &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C,&lt;ref name="Broeker1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broeker|first1=Wallace|title=The great ocean conveyor|journal=Oceanography|date=1991|volume=4|issue=2|page=79-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs).&lt;ref name="Talley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.ucsd.edu/sio210/lect_5/lecture_5.html|title=North Atlantic circulation and thermohaline forcing|publisher=Sam.ucsd.edu|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

CFCs are anthropogenic substances that enter the surface of the ocean from gas exchange with the atmosphere.  This distinct composition allows its path to be traced as it mixes with [[Circumpolar Deep Water]] (CDW), which in turn fills the deep [[Indian Ocean]] and part of the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]].  NADW and its formation is essential to the [[Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation]] (AMOC), which is responsible for transporting large amounts of water, heat, salt, carbon, nutrients and other substances from the Tropical Atlantic to the Mid and High Latitude Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schmitner, Andreas|url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/pdf/S/schmittner07agu_intro.pdf|format=PDF|title=Introduction: The Ocean's Meridional Overturning Circulation|date=2007|publisher=People.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=9 January 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the conveyor belt model of [[thermohaline circulation]] of the world's oceans, the sinking of NADW pulls the waters of the [[North Atlantic drift]] northward. However, this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual relationship between NADW formation and the strength of the [[Gulf Stream]]/North Atlantic drift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seis.natsci.csulb.edu/rbehl/NADW.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925112354/http://seis.natsci.csulb.edu/rbehl/NADW.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NADW has a temperature of 2-4&amp;nbsp;°C with a salinity of 34.9-35.0 psu found at a depth between 1500 and 4000m.

==Formation and sources==
The NADW is a complex of several water masses formed by deep convection and also by overflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.&lt;ref name = "Smethie"&gt;Smethie, William M, et al. "Tracing the flow of North Atlantic Deep Water using chlorofluorocarbons." Journal of Geophysical Research 105.C6 (2000):14297-14323.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North Atlantic Circulation.gif|thumb|400px|The circulation patterns in the North Atlantic Ocean.  Cold, dense water is shown in blue, flowing south from upper latitudes, while warm, less dense water, shown in red flows north from low latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/legrande_01/|title=NASA GISS: Science Briefs: Modeling an Abrupt Climate Change|publisher=Giss.nasa.gov|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The upper layers are formed by deep open ocean convection during winter.  [[Labrador Sea Water]] (LSW), formed in the [[Labrador Sea]] can reach depths of 2000 m as dense water sinks downward.  Classical Labrador Sea Water (CLSW) production is dependent on preconditioning of water in the Labrador Sea from the previous year, and the strength of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]].&lt;ref name ="Smethie"/&gt;

During a positive NAO phase, conditions exist for strong winter storms to develop.  These storms freshen the surface water, and their winds increase cyclonic flow, which allows denser waters to sink.  As a result, the temperature, salinity, and density vary yearly.  In some years these conditions do not exist and CLSW is not formed.  CLSW has characteristic potential temperature of 3&amp;nbsp;°C, salinity of 34.88 psu, and density of 34.66.&lt;ref name ="Smethie"/&gt;  

Another component of LSW is the Upper Labrador Sea Water (ULSW).  ULSW forms at a density lower than CLSW and has a CFC maximum between 1200 and 1500 m in the subtropical North Atlantic.  Eddies of cold less saline ULSW have similar densities of warmer saltier water and flow along the DWBC, but maintain their high CFCs.  The ULSW eddies erode rapidly as they mix laterally with this warmer saltier water.&lt;ref name="Smethie"/&gt;

The lower waters mass of NADW form from overflow of the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.  They are Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW).  The overflows are a combination of dense Arctic Ocean water (18%), modified Atlantic water (32%), and intermediate water from the Nordic seas (20%), that entrain and mix with other water masses (contributing 30%) as they flow over the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Tanhua, Toste, K A AOlsson, and Emil Jeansson. "Formation of Denmark Strait overflow water and its hydro-chemical composition." Journal of marine systems 57.3-4 (2005):264-288.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formation of both of these waters involves the conversion of warm salty northward flowing surface waters to cold dense deep waters behind the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.  Water flow from the North Atlantic current enters the Arctic Ocean through the [[Norwegian Current]] which splits into the [[Fram Strait]] and [[Barents Sea]] Branch.&lt;ref&gt;Schauer, Ursula, et al. "Impact of eastern Arctic shelf waters on the Nansen Basin intermediate layers." Journal of Geophysical Research 102.C2 (1997):3371-3382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Water from the Fram Strait recirculates, reaching a density of DSOW, sinks, and flows towards the Denmark Strait.  Water flowing into the Barent Sea feeds ISOW.

ISOW enters the eastern North Atlantic over the Iceland-Scotland Ridge through the Faeroe Bank Channel at a depth of 850 m, with some water flowing over the shallower Iceland-Faeroe Rise.  ISOW has a low CFC concentrations and it has been estimated from these concentrations that ISOW resides behind the ridge for 45 years.&lt;ref name ="Smethie"/&gt;  As the water flows southward at the bottom of the channel, it entrains surrounding water of the eastern North Atlantic, and flows to the western North Atlantic through the [[Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone]], entraining with LSW.  This water is less dense than (DSOW) and lays above it as it flows cyclonically in the Irminger Basin.

DSOW is the coldest, densest, and freshest water mass of NADW.  DSOW formed behind the ridge flows over the [[Denmark Strait]] at a depth of 600m.  The most significant water mass contributing to DSOW is Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW).&lt;ref&gt;Swift, James H, KnutAagaard, and Svend-AageMalmberg. "The contribution of the Denmark strait overflow to the deep North Atlantic." Deep-Sea Research Part I 27.1 (1980):29-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Winter cooling and convection allow AIW to sink and pool behind the Denmark Strait.  Upper AIW has a high amount of anthropogenic tracers due its exposure to the atmosphere.  AIW's tritium and CFC signature is observed in DSOW at the base of the Greenland continental slope.  This also showed that the DSOW flowing 450&amp;nbsp;km to the south was no older than 2 years.&lt;ref name ="Smethie"/&gt;   Both the DSOW and ISOW flow around the Irminger Basin and Labrador Sea in a deep boundary current.  Leaving the Greenland Sea with 2.5 [[Sverdrup|Sv]] its flow increases to 10 Sv south of Greenland.  It is cold and relatively fresh, flowing below 3500 m in the DWBC and spreading inward the deep Atlantic basins.

==Spreading pathways==
[[File:Antarctic bottom water.svg|thumb|400px|The NADW flows southward through the Atlantic, approaching the [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] past the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].]]
The southward spread of NADW along the Deep Western [[Boundary current]] (DWBC) can be traced by its high oxygen content, high CFCs, and density.&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;Talley, et al. Physical Oceanography: An Introduction.  Academic Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

ULSW is the major source of upper NADW.  ULSW advects southward from the Labrador Sea in small eddies that mix into the DWBC.  A CFC maxima associated with ULSW has been observed along 24°N in the DWBC at 1500 m.&lt;ref name="Text"/&gt;  Some of the upper ULSW recirculates into the Gulf Stream, while some remains in the DWBC.  High CFCs in the subtropics indicate recirculation  in the subtropics.&lt;ref name="Smethie"/&gt;

ULSW that remains in the DWBC dilutes as it moves equatorward.  Deep convection in the Labrador Sea during the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in CLSW with a lower CFC concentration due to downward mixing.  Convection allowed the CFCs to penetrate further downward to 2000m.  These minimum could be tracked, and were first observed in the subtropics in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Smethie"/&gt;

ISOW and DSOW flow around the Irminger Basin and DSOW entering the DWBC.  These are the two lower portions of the NADW.  Another CFC maximum is seen at 3500 m in the subtropics from the DSOW contribution to NADW.&lt;ref name="Text"/&gt;  Some of the NADW recirculates with the northern gyre.  To the south of the gyre NADW flows under the Gulf Stream where it continues along the DWBC until it reaches another gyre in the subtropics.

Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW), originating in the [[Greenland Sea|Greenland]] and [[Norwegian Sea]]s, brings high salinity, oxygen, and freon concentrations towards to the [[Romanche Trench]], an equatorial fracture zone in the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR).  Found at depths around {{Convert|3600|-|4000|m|abbr=on}}, LNADW flow east through the trench over AABW, the trench being the only opening in the MAR where inter-basin exchange is possible for these two water masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ferron|first1=B.|last2=Mercier|first2=H.|last3=Speer|first3=K.|last4=Gargett|first4=A.|last5=Polzin|first5=K.|year=1998|title=Mixing in the Romanche Fracture Zone|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0485%281998%29028%3C1929%3AMITRFZ%3E2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1929–1945|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1998)028&lt;1929:MITRFZ&gt;2.0.CO;2|accessdate=7 June 2015|ref=harv}}&lt;!-- {{Harvnb|Ferron|Mercier|Speer|Gargett|1998|loc=Introduction, pp. 1929-1931}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variability==
It is believed that North Atlantic Deep Water formation has been dramatically reduced at times during the past (such as during the [[Younger Dryas]] or during [[Heinrich event]]s), and that this might correlate with a decrease in the strength of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic drift, in turn cooling the climate of [[northwestern Europe]]. 

There is concern that [[global warming]] might cause this to happen again. It is also hypothesized that during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM), NADW was replaced with an analogous watermass that occupied a shallower depth known as Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">The '''Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability''' (OE) is a program office within the [[United States Department of Energy]]. The mission of OE is "to lead national efforts to modernize the electric grid; enhance security and reliability of the energy infrastructure; and facilitate recovery from disruptions to energy supply."

==Responsibilities==
The Office is responsible for leading efforts to modernize the electric grid. This is done through the development and implementation of national policy pertaining to electric grid reliability, and through the management of research, development, and demonstration activities for "next generation" electric grid infrastructure technologies. The Office analyzes electricity congestion, the designation of draft National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, the coordination of energy corridors across federal lands, and workforce issues related to the electricity utility industry.

The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability works with the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and other agencies to enhance the security of the nation's critical energy infrastructure.

==Organization==
The Office is under the general supervision of the [[Under Secretary of Energy for Energy and Environment]]. The Office is administered by the [[Assistant Secretary of Energy for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability]] (ASE-OE), who is appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. The current ASE-OE is Patricia A. Hoffman, who was appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] in June 2010. The Assistant Secretary is assisted in running the Office by three Deputy Assistant Secretaries, who are all career employees. Each of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries oversee a different branch of the Office's work.

A '''phreatophyte''' is a deep-[[root]]ed [[plant]] that obtains a significant portion of the water that it needs from the [[phreatic zone]] (zone of saturation) or the [[capillary fringe]] above the phreatic zone. 
Phreatophytes are plants that are supplied with surface water and often have their roots constantly in touch with moisture. A phreatophyte is one that absorbs its water from a constant source on the ground. They can usually be found along streams where there is a steady flow of surface or groundwater in areas where the water table is near the surface.

Phreatophytes live in areas with standing or running water, in arid areas and along the riverbeds and areas, apparently dry, where the [[water table]] is very shallow and near the surface. These plants have very deep roots that are able to reach the water table. Phreatophytes are not only characteristic of arid or desert zones, but also of wetlands, [[flood plain|floodplain]]s, depressions that hold water and [[estuarie]]s. In the wetlands, ecological classification does not provide a special classification, since in this case, most of the plants in the regions of high rainfall can deepen their roots to the top of the capillary fringe immediately above the water table, and function well as a phreatophyte. In this case they receive the label of [[mesophytic]]. Phreatophytic artificial extensions, manmade, are used as a method to purify [[greywater]].

==Biological value==

They are plants of great ecological value, fast growing pioneers and highly resistant to disease. They make excellent fodder for livestock and provide nesting areas and shelter for fauna. They are used as fuel, cheap construction material, and basketry. Many of the plants grow in degraded waters, salty or saline, that are useless for agriculture. Phreatophyte plants help to purify these waters and their roots fix heavy metals with a bacterial filter. For example, it is estimated that the total annual groundwater phreatophytes consumed in the western U.S. alone is about 30,000 [[cubic hectometre|hm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Phreatophytes are indicators of potable groundwater. Phreatophytes can be differentiated into plant communities by the length of their root, as they extend more or less deeply into the aquifer. Meinzer Studies. O.E. (1927) and Robinson, T.W. (1958) on vascular plants in the arid western U.S., set up certain general types of indicator species, according to level of minimum depth of the water table at which water was at the maximum suction [[Reverse osmosis|RO]].

Some phreatophytes have a low tolerance for [[salt]], indicating freshwater. This can be a valuable guide to the location of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semiarid areas. Examples of phreatophytes include welwitschia and mesquite: [[Prosopis glandulosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.S. |last=David |author2=M.O. Henriques |author3=C. Kurz-Besson |author4=J.

Trees like the [[Fraxinus|Ash]], the [[Alder]], the [[Willow]] and the [[Populus|Poplar]] are also useful in this regard. These trees generally grow in [[freshwater]] [[aquifer]]s where the water table depth is not more than ten meters.

These species are found in [[Riparian zone|riparian ecosystems]] and areas characterized by shallow [[groundwater]], such as [[bottomlands]]. They are also present in [[water limited environment]]s; for example, [[Oak]]s in the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions.

[[File:76-Fisiologo di Berna - Pantera.jpg|thumb|250px|''Panther'', [[Bern Physiologus]], 9th century]]
The '''''Physiologus''''' is a [[didactic]] [[Christianity|Christian]] text written or compiled in Greek by an unknown author, in [[Alexandria]]; its composition has been traditionally dated to the 2nd century AD by readers who saw parallels with writings of [[Clement of Alexandria]], who is asserted to have known the text, though Alan Scott&lt;ref&gt;Alan Scott, "The Date of the Physiologus" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''52'''.4 (November 1998:430-441).&lt;/ref&gt; has made a case for a date at the end of the 3rd or in the 4th century.  The ''Physiologus'' consists of descriptions of animals, birds, and fantastic creatures, sometimes stones and plants, provided with moral content. Each animal is described, and an anecdote follows, from which the moral and symbolic qualities of the animal are derived.  Manuscripts are often, but not always, given illustrations, often lavish.

The book was translated into Armenian in 5th century&lt;ref&gt;Gohar Muradyan, [https://books.google.am/books?id=tKuNJ0QAPggC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Physiologus: The Greek and Armenian Versions with a Study of Translation Technique], [[Peeters Publishers]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;, Latin in about 700,&lt;ref&gt;T. H. White: The Bestiary: The Book of Beasts (London and New York, 1954, 4/1960)&lt;/ref&gt; and into [[Ethiopic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], then into many European and Middle-Eastern languages, and many [[illuminated manuscript]] copies such as the [[Bern Physiologus]] survive.  It retained its influence over ideas of the "meaning" of animals in Europe for over a thousand years.  It was a predecessor of [[bestiary|bestiaries]] (books of beasts). Medieval poetical literature is full of allusions that can be traced to the ''Physiologus'' tradition; the text also exerted great influence on the symbolism of medieval ecclesiastical art: symbols like those of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising from its ashes and the [[pelican]] feeding her young with her own blood are still well-known.

==Allegorical stories==
The story is told of the lion whose cubs are born dead and receive life when the old lion breathes upon them, and of the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] which burns itself to death and rises on the third day from the ashes; both are taken as types of [[Christ]]. The [[unicorn]] also which only permits itself to be captured in the lap of a pure virgin is a type of the [[Incarnation]]; the [[pelican]] that sheds its own blood in order to sprinkle its dead young, so that they may live again, is a type of the salvation of mankind by the death of [[Crucifixion|Christ on the Cross]].

Some allegories set forth the deceptive enticements of the [[Devil]] and his defeat by Christ; others present qualities as examples to be imitated or avoided.

==Attributions==
The conventional title ''Physiologus''  was  because the author introduces his stories from [[natural history]] with the phrase: "the physiologus says", that is, "the naturalist says", "the natural philosophers, the authorities for natural history say".

In later centuries it was ascribed to various celebrated [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]], especially [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], [[Basil of Caesarea]], and St. [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]]. &lt;!--this is not followed by any writer of the last decades:[[Origen]], however, had cited it under the title ''Physiologus'', while [[Clement of Alexandria]] and perhaps even [[Justin Martyr]] seem to have known it.--&gt;

The assertion that the method of the ''Physiologus'' presupposes the allegorical [[exegesis]] developed by Origen is not correct; the so-called ''[[Letter of Barnabas]]'' offers, before Origen, a sufficient model, not only for the general character of the ''Physiologus'' but also for many of its details. It can hardly be asserted that the later recensions, in which the Greek text has been preserved, present even in the best and oldest [[manuscript]]s a perfectly reliable transcription of the original, especially as this was an anonymous and popular treatise.

==Early history==
About the year 400 the ''Physiologus'' was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]]; in the 5th century into [[Ethiopic]] [edited by [[Fritz Hommel]] with a German translation (Leipzig, 1877), revised German translation in ''Romanische Forschungen'', V, 13-36]; into [[Armenian language|Armenian]] [edited by Pitra in ''Spicilegium Solesmense'', III, 374-90; French translation by Cahier in ''Nouveaux Mélanges d'archéologie, d'histoire et de littérature'' (Paris, 1874)] (see also the recent edition: Gohar Muradyan, Physiologus. The Greek And Armenian Versions With a Study of Translation Technique, Leuven–Dudley MA: Peeters, 2005 [Hebrew University Armenian Studies 6]); into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [edited by Tychsen, ''Physiologus Syrus'' (Rostock, 1795), a later Syriac and an [[Arabic]] version edited by Land in ''Anecdota Syriaca'', IV (Leyden, 1875)]. An Old Slavic (Old Bulgarian) translation was made in the 10th century [edited by Karneyev, ''Materialy i zametki po literaturnoj istorii Fiziologa'', Sankt Peterburg, 1890].

[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] used ''Physiologus'' in his ''Panarion'' and from his time numerous further quotations and references to the ''Physiologus'' in the Greek and the Latin [[Church fathers]] show that it was one of the most generally known works of Christian [[Late Antiquity]]. Various translations and revisions were current in the [[Middle Ages]]. The earliest translation into Latin was followed by various recensions, among them the ''Sayings of [[St. John Chrysostom]] on the natures of beasts'',&lt;ref&gt;"Dicta Iohanni Crisostomi de natura bestiarum", edited by G. Heider in ''Archiv für Kunde österreichischer Geschichtsquellen'' (5, 552–82, 1850).&lt;!--what is the modern edition?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A metrical Latin ''Physiologus'' was written in the 11th century by a certain [[Theobaldus]], and printed by Morris in ''An Old English Miscellany'' (1872), 201 sqq.; it also appears among the works of [[Hildebertus Cenomanensis]] in ''Pat.Lat.'', CLXXI, 1217-24. To these should be added the literature of the [[bestiaries]], in which the material of the ''Physiologus'' was used; the ''Tractatus de bestiis et alius rebus'', often misattributed to [[Hugo of St. Victor]], and the ''Speculum naturale'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]].

==Translations==
Translations and adaptations from the Latin introduced the "Physiologus" into almost all the languages of Western Europe. An [[Old High German]] ([[Alemannic language|Alemannic]]) translation was written in [[Hirsau]] in ca. 1070 (ed.  Müllenhoff and Scherer in ''Denkmäler deutscher Poesie und Prosa''  No. LXXXI); a later translation (12th century) has been edited by Lauchert in ''Geschichte des Physiologus'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;280–99); and a rhymed version appears in Karajan, ''Deutsche Sprachdenkmale des XII. Jahrhunderts'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;73–106), both based on the Latin text known as ''Dicta Chrysostomi.'' 
Fragments of a 9th-century metrical [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Physiologus'' are extant (ed.  Thorpe in ''[[Exeter Book|Codex Exoniensis]]''  pp.&amp;nbsp;335–67,  Grein in ''Bibliothek der angelsächsischen Poesie'' I, 223-8).

About the middle of the 13th century there appeared a Middle English metrical ''Bestiary'', an adaptation of the Latin ''Physiologus Theobaldi''; this has been edited by Wright and Halliwell in ''Reliquiæ antiquæ'' (I, 208-27), also by Morris in ''An Old English Miscellany'' (1-25). [[Icelandic literature]] includes a ''Physiologus'' belonging to the early part of the 13th century, edited by Dahlerup (Copenhagen, 1889).&lt;ref&gt;Verner Dahlerup: ''Physiologus i to islandske Bearbejdelser''. In: Aarbøger for nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie (ANOH) 1889, pp. 199-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th and 13th centuries there appeared the ''Bestiaires'' of [[Philippe de Thaun]], a metrical [[Old French]] version, edited by [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]] in ''Popular Treatises on Science Written during the Middle Ages'' (74-131), and by Walberg (Lund and Paris, 1900); that by [[Guillaume, clerk of Normandy]], called ''Bestiare divin'', and edited by Cahier in his ''Mélanges d'archéologie'' (II-IV), also edited by Hippeau (Caen, 1852), and by Reinsch (Leipzig, 1890); the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bestiare de Gervaise|fr}}'', edited by [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]] in ''Romania'' (I, 420-42); the ''Bestiare'' in prose of [[Pierre le Picard]], edited by Cahier in ''Mélanges'' (II-IV).

An adaptation is found in the old [[Waldensian]] literature, and has been edited by [[Alfons Mayer]] in ''Romanische Forschungen'' (V, 392 sqq.). As to the Italian bestiaries, a Tuscan-Venetian ''Bestiarius'' has been edited (Goldstaub and Wendriner, ''Ein tosco-venezianischer Bestiarius'', Halle, 1892). Extracts from the ''Physiologus'' in [[Franco-Provençal language|Provençal]] have been edited by Bartsch, ''Provenzalisches Lesebuch'' (162-66). The ''Physiologus'' survived in the literatures of [[Eastern Europe]] in books on animals written in [[Middle Greek]], among the [[Slavs]] to whom it came from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] (translations of the so-called Byzantinian redaction were made in Middle Bulgarian in the 13th-14th century; they were edited in 2011 by Ana Stoykova in an electronic edition, see reference), and in a [[Romanian language|Romanian]] translation from a Slavic original (edited by [[Moses Gaster]] with an Italian translation in ''Archivio glottologico italiano'', X, 273-304).

==The manuscript tradition==
Modern study of ''Physiologus'' can be said to have begun with Francesco Sbordone's edition, 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Sbordone, ''''Physiologus'' (Rome: Dante Albrighi) 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; which established three traditions in the surviving manuscripts of the text, a "primitive" tradition, a Byzantine one and a pseudo-Basil tradition. Ben Perry showed&lt;ref&gt;Perry, "Physiologus" entry in ''Paulys Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. Herausgegeben v. G. Wissowa'', vol. 20, pp. 1074-1129. Stuttgart, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; that a manuscript Sbordone had missed, at the [[Morgan Library]],&lt;ref&gt;Morgan codex 397.&lt;/ref&gt; was the oldest extant Greek version, a late 10th-century manuscript from [[Grottaferrata]].

{{disputed|date=November 2018}}
{{More footnotes|date=February 2011}}

'''Plume tectonics''' is a geophysical theory that finds its roots in the mantle doming concept (which did not accept major plate movements and continental drifting) which was especially popular during the 1930s, and survived throughout the seventies up till today in various forms and presentations. It has slowly evolved into a concept that recognises and accepts large scale plate motions such as envisaged by [[plate tectonics]], but placing them in a framework where large [[mantle plume]]s are the major driving force of the system.

The theory focuses on the movements of mantle plumes under [[tectonic plate]]s, viewing them as the major driving force of movements of (parts of) the Earth's crust. It tries to reconcile in one single geodynamic model the horizontalistic concept of Plate tectonics, and the verticalistic concepts of mantle plumes and [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spots]], together with the existence of various [[supercontinent]]s in Earth history.

In [[meteorology]], '''precipitation''' is any product of the [[condensation]] of [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[water vapor]] that falls under [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Glossary of Meteorology | year = 2009 | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=precipitation1 | title = Precipitation | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | accessdate = 2009-01-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009142439/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=precipitation1 | archivedate = 2008-10-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main forms of precipitation include  [[drizzle]], [[rain]], [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], [[snow]], [[graupel]] and [[hail]].  Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapour, so that the water condenses and "precipitates".  Thus, [[fog]] and [[mist]] are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a [[cloud]].  Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called "showers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What's the difference between 'rain' and 'showers'? |date=December 26, 2015 |author=Scott Sistek
|publisher=[[KOMO-TV]]
|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/whats-the-difference-between-rain-and-showers |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain. This process is typically active when freezing rain occurs. A [[stationary front]] is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the foci for forcing and rising air. Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely [[Stratus cloud | stratus]] and [[cumulonimbus]]. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects.  Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, [[lake-effect snow]]fall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold [[cyclone|cyclonic]] flow around the backside of [[extratropical cyclone]]s.  Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.  [[Thundersnow]] is possible within a cyclone's [[Extratropical cyclone#Surface pressure and wind distribution|comma head]] and within lake effect precipitation bands.  In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the terrain at elevation.  On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating.  Most precipitation occurs within the tropics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Robert F. et al|title=The Version-2 Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Monthly Precipitation Analysis (1979–Present)|journal=Journal of Hydrometeorology|date=December 2003|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1147–1167|doi=10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004&lt;1147:TVGPCP&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode=2003JHyMe...4.1147A|citeseerx=10.1.1.1018.6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is caused by [[convection]].  The movement of the [[monsoon trough]], or [[intertropical convergence zone]], brings [[wet season|rainy seasons]] to [[savannah]] [[clime]]s.

Precipitation is a major component of the [[water cycle]], and is responsible for depositing the [[fresh water]] on the [[planet]]. Approximately {{convert|505000|km3|mi3}} of water falls as precipitation each year; {{convert|398000|km3|mi3}} of it over the [[ocean]]s and {{convert|107000|km3|mi3}} over land.&lt;ref name="chow"&gt;{{cite web|author= Chowdhury's Guide to Planet Earth|year=2005|url=http://www.planetguide.net/book/chapter_2/water_cycle.html|title=The Water Cycle|publisher=WestEd|accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the [[Earth]]'s surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is {{convert|990|mm|in}}, but over land it is only {{convert|715|mm|in}}. [[Climate]] classification systems such as the [[Köppen climate classification]] system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.

Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g. when it gets cold, [[Mars]] has precipitation which most likely takes the form of [[frost]], rather than rain or snow.&lt;ref name="mars"&gt;{{cite web|author= Jim Lochner|year=1998|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980403c.html|title=Ask an Astrophysicist|publisher=[[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]|accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the air becomes saturated==

===Cooling air to its dew point===
[[File:Regnbyge.jpg|thumb|Late-summer [[rainstorm]] in [[Denmark]]]]
[[File:Lenticular Cloud in Wyoming 0034b.jpg|thumb|Lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over Wyoming]]
The [[dew point]] is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|title=Dewpoint|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2011-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110705162052/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|archivedate=2011-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water vapor normally begins to condense on [[Cloud condensation nuclei|condensation nuclei]] such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.  An elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift, which form clouds decks such as [[altostratus]] or [[cirrostratus]].  [[Stratus cloud|Stratus]] is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.  It can also form due to the lifting of [[Fog#Types|advection fog]] during breezy conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FMI|year=2007|url=http://www.zamg.ac.at/docu/Manual/SatManu/main.htm?/docu/Manual/SatManu/CMs/FgStr/backgr.htm|title=Fog And Stratus - Meteorological Physical Background|publisher=Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, [[Radiative cooling|radiational cooling]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, and evaporative cooling. [[Adiabatic lapse rate#Dry adiabatic lapse rate|Adiabatic cooling]] occurs when air rises and expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=adiabatic-process1|title=Adiabatic Process|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017213229/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=adiabatic-process1|archivedate=2007-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air can rise due to [[convection]], large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain ([[orographic lift]]). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TE Technology, Inc|year=2009|url=http://www.tetech.com/Cold-Plate-Coolers.html|title=Peltier Cold Plate|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land.  Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of [[Thermal radiation|infrared radiation]], either by the air or by the surface underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search|title=Radiational cooling|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512161339/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2011-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its [[wet-bulb temperature]], or until it reaches saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Fovell|year=2004|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf|title=Approaches to saturation|publisher=[[UCLA|University of California in Los Angeles]]|accessdate=2009-02-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074155/http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
{{Main|Water cycle}}
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|Condensation and coalescence are important parts of the [[water cycle]].]]

===Raindrops===
[[Coalescence (meteorology)|Coalescence]] occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the [[Bergeron process]]. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops.  When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Sirvatka|year=2003|url=http://weather.cod.edu/sirvatka/bergeron.html|title=Cloud Physics: Collision/Coalescence; The Bergeron Process|publisher=[[College of DuPage]]|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raindrops have sizes ranging from {{convert|0.1|mm|in}} to {{convert|9|mm|in}} mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2009|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html|title=Are raindrops tear shaped?|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-12-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69g1WWkiS?url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html|archivedate=2012-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;{{cite web|author=J.

===Ice pellets===
{{Main|Ice pellets}}
[[File:Sleet on the ground.jpg|thumb|An accumulation of ice pellets]]
[[Ice pellets]] or sleet are a form of precipitation consisting of small, [[translucent]] balls of ice. Ice pellets are usually (but not always) smaller than [[hail]]stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=hail|title= Hail (glossary entry)|publisher= [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Weather Service]]|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with [[freezing rain]].  The [[METAR]] code for ice pellets is '''PL'''.&lt;ref name="METAR"/&gt;

Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below.  This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer.  As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets.  However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and [[freezing rain]] will be the result at the surface.  A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a [[warm front]] during the cold season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weatherquestions.com|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_ice_pellets.htm|title=What causes ice pellets (sleet)?|accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can occasionally be found behind a passing [[cold front]].

===Hail===
{{Main|Hail}}
[[File:Granizo.jpg|right|thumb|A large hailstone, about {{convert|6|cm|1}} in diameter]]

Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm [[cloud]]s when [[supercooled]] [[water]] droplets freeze on contact with [[condensation nuclei]], such as [[dust]] or [[dirt]].  The storm's [[updraft]] blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud.  The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted again.  Hail has a diameter of {{convert|5|mm|in}} or more.&lt;ref name="gloss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|title=Hail|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-15|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725142407/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least {{convert|6.4|mm|in}}.

===Snowflakes===
{{Main|Snowflake}}
[[File:Snowflake - Microphotograph by artgeek.jpg|thumb|upright|Snowflake viewed in an optical microscope]]
Snow crystals form when tiny [[supercool]]ed cloud droplets (about 10 [[μm]] in diameter) [[freezing|freeze]]. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s in size at the expense of the water droplets.  This process is known as the [[Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process]].  The corresponding depletion of water vapour causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense.  These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates.  These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.&lt;ref name="natgeojan07"&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Klesius| title=The Mystery of Snowflakes| journal=National Geographic| volume=211| issue=1| year=2007| issn=0027-9358|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guinness World Records list the world's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 38&amp;nbsp;cm (15&amp;nbsp;inches) wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/science/20snow.html |title=Giant Snowflakes as Big as Frisbees?

Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to [[diffuse reflection]] of the whole [[spectrum]] of [[light]] by the small ice particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4T-aXFsMhAgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39|title=Hands-on Science: Light, Physical Science (matter) - Chapter 5: The Colors of Light|page=39|author=Jennifer E.

===Diamond dust===
{{Main|Diamond dust}}
Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching {{convert|-40|C}} due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.&lt;ref name="glossdia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|title=Diamond Dust|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2010-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403084329/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2009-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/Libbrecht%20Feature.pdf|page=12|year=2001|author=Kenneth G.

==Causes==

===Frontal activity===
{{Main|Weather fronts}}
Stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of air in [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic systems]] (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface [[cold front]]s, and over and ahead of [[warm front]]s.  Similar ascent is seen around [[tropical cyclone]]s outside of the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]], and in comma-head precipitation patterns around [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s.&lt;ref name="Geerts"&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Geerts|year=2002|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/con_str.html|title=Convective and stratiform rainfall in the tropics|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.  Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=2006|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than Earth.  When it gets cold, [[Mars]] has precipitation that most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.&lt;ref name="mars"/&gt;

===Convection===
[[File:Konvektionsregen.jpg|thumb|Convective precipitation]]
[[Convection rain|Convective rain]], or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., [[cumulonimbus]] or [[cumulus congestus]]. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the [[tropics]] appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.&lt;ref name="houze"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geerts" /&gt; [[Graupel]] and [[hail]] indicate convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=graupel&amp;submit=Search|title=Graupel|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308123814/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=graupel&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as [[cold front]]s, [[squall line]]s, and warm fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toby N. Carlson|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2lIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=where+convection+occurs+in+the+mid-latitudes|title=Mid-latitude Weather Systems|publisher=Routledge|page=216|isbn=978-0-04-551115-0|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orographic effects===
{{See also|Orographic lift|Precipitation types}}
[[File:Steigungsregen.jpg|thumb|Orographic precipitation]]
Orographic precipitation occurs on the [[windward]] side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling and condensation.  In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the [[trade wind]]s), a more moist [[climate]] usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;

In [[Hawaii]], [[Mount Waiʻaleʻale]], on the island of Kauai, is notable for its extreme rainfall, as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, with {{convert|460|in|mm|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diana Leone|year=2002|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/05/27/news/story3.html|title=Rain supreme|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between October and March.  Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (''Ko{{okina}}olau'') and leeward (''Kona'') regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains.  Windward sides face the east to northeast [[trade winds]] and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Western Regional Climate Center|year=2002|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/HAWAII.htm|title=Climate of Hawaii|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, the [[Andes]] mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul E.

===Snow===
{{main|Snow}}
[[File:Snow Clouds in Korea.jpg|thumb|Lake-effect snow bands near the [[Korean Peninsula]] in early-December 2008.]]
[[Extratropical cyclone]]s can bring cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain and snow with winds exceeding 119&amp;nbsp;km/h (74&amp;nbsp;mph),&lt;ref name="MarinersWeatherLog"&gt;{{cite journal  | journal = Mariners Weather Log| volume=49 |author1=Joan Von Ahn |author2=Joe Sienkiewicz |author3=Greggory McFadden | title=Hurricane Force Extratropical Cyclones Observed Using QuikSCAT Near Real Time Winds|publisher = Voluntary Observing Ship Program  | date = April 2005 | url = http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/april_05/cyclones.shtml | accessdate = 2009-07-07| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes referred to as [[European windstorm|windstorms]] in Europe). The band of precipitation that is associated with their [[warm front]] is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which [[condensation|condenses]] as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|version=PhD thesis|author=Owen Hertzman|year=1988|bibcode=1988PhDT.......110H|title=Three-Dimensional Kinematics of Rainbands in Midlatitude Cyclones Abstract|publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is wide and [[Precipitation types (meteorology)#Stratiform|stratiform]], meaning falling out of [[nimbostratus]] clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuh-Lang Lin |year =2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4KXtnQ3bDeEC&amp;pg=PA405| page=405| title= Mesoscale Dynamics|publisher =Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80875-0|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When moist air tries to dislodge an arctic air mass, overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the elongated [[rainband|precipitation band]].  In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], poleward is towards the [[North Pole]], or north.  Within the [[Southern Hemisphere]], poleward is towards the [[South Pole]], or south.

Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow [[lake-effect snow]] bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13&amp;nbsp;°C or 23&amp;nbsp;°F) between the water surface and the air above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=B. Geerts |year=1998|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html |title=Lake Effect Snow.| accessdate= 2008-12-24|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld010.htm |publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] |title=Lake Effect Snow |date=1998-06-03 |accessdate=2009-07-12 |author=Greg Byrd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617013142/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld010.htm |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes, which in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow.  Because of the ruggedness of terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.avalanche.org/~nac/NAC/techPages/articles/96_MRD.pdf |title=Atmospheric Circulation Patterns Associated With Heavy Snowfall Events, Bridger Bowl, Montana, USA |author1=Karl W.

==Measurement==
{{See also|Rain gauge|Disdrometer|Snow gauge}}
[[File:250mm Rain Gauge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Standard rain gauge]]
The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100&amp;nbsp;mm (4&amp;nbsp;in) plastic and 200&amp;nbsp;mm (8&amp;nbsp;in) metal varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Office, Northern Indiana|year=2009|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/coop/8inch.php|title=8 Inch Non-Recording Standard Rain Gauge|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner cylinder is filled by 25&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;in) of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm (0.01&amp;nbsp;in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm (0.01&amp;nbsp;in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. These gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder.  Some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Lehmann|year=2009|url=http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/CAL/2000_reminders-4thQ.htm|title=10/00|publisher=Central Analytical Laboratory|accessdate=2009-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615115408/http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/cal/2000_reminders-4thQ.htm|archivedate=2010-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the snowfall/ice is finished accumulating, or as 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12&amp;nbsp;in) is approached, one can either bring it inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice/snow is melted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Office [[Binghamton, New York]]|year=2009|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/bgm/spotters_skywarn/precip4.shtml|title=Rainguage Information|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|year=2009|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|title=Glossary:  W|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow. Attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing. Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Discovery School |year=2009 |url=http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/activities/weatherstation/itsrainingitspouring.html |title=Build Your Own Weather Station |publisher=Discovery Education |accessdate=2009-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828214157/http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/activities/weatherstation/itsrainingitspouring.html |archivedate=2008-08-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as [[Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow network|CoCoRAHS]] or GLOBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocorahs.org |title=Community Collaborative Rain, Hail &amp; Snow Network Main Page|publisher=Colorado Climate Center|year=2009|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program|url=http://www.globe.gov/fsl/welcome/welcomeobject.pl|author=The Globe Program|year=2009|accessdate=2009-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819010615/http://www.globe.gov/fsl/welcome/welcomeobject.pl|archivedate=2006-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|year=2009|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov|title=NOAA's National Weather Service Main Page|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrometeor definition===
A concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor. Any particulates of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors.  Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, [[haze]], fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors.  All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground.  Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors, as are hail and snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrometeor|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Hydrometeor|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite estimates===
Although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2012|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/news/overview.html#.Ut3LEnn0CqQ|title=NASA and JAXA's GPM Mission Takes Rain Measurements Global|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitation—recording various parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast to active sensors ([[radar]], [[lidar]]) that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed.

Satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal infrared ([[Infrared|IR]]) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Global Precipitation Measurement|author1=C. Kidd |author2=G.J. Huffman |journal=[[Meteorological Applications]]|volume=18|issue=3 |year=2011|pages=334–353|doi=10.1002/met.284|bibcode = 2011MeApp..18..334K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category of sensor channels is in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz  to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37&amp;nbsp;GHz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds, with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy. Channels above 37&amp;nbsp;GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave radiant energy. Satellites such as the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]] (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.

Additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global Precipitation Measurement Methods, Datasets and Applications.|author=F.J. Tapiador, et al|journal=Atmospheric Research|volume=104-105|year=2012|pages=70–97|doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2011.10.012|bibcode = 2013AtmRe.119..131W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite data sets===
The IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in [[geosynchronous]] Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection—such as the tropics—and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location.

Since the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites' sensors, seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The goal is to provide "best" estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the [[Climate Data Record]] standard.

In other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the "true" precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.

The work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[International Precipitation Working Group]]|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/data/datasets.html|title=Global Precipitation Datasets|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use.

==Return period==
{{see also|100-year flood}}
The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the [[return period]] or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|title=Return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020151220/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|archivedate=2006-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=return+period&amp;submit=Search|title=Rainfall intensity return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085617/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=return+period&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''1 in 10&amp;nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10&amp;nbsp;years, so it has a 10&amp;nbsp;percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year.  The term ''1 in 100&amp;nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1&amp;nbsp;percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event.  As with all probability events, it is possible though unlikely to have two "1 in 100&amp;nbsp;Year Storms" in a single year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boulder Area Sustainability Information Network|year=2005|url=http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/watershed/flood.html|title=What is a 100 year flood?|publisher=Boulder Community Network|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation.  The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rain forest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], [[polar ice cap]], and [[desert]].

==Effect on agriculture==
[[File:Heavy Rains in Southern Japan.gif|thumb|Rainfall estimates for southern Japan and the surrounding region from {{Nowrap|July 20}} to 27, 2009.]]
Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on [[agriculture]].  All [[plant]]s need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to [[agriculture]].  While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy [[plant]]s, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to [[crops]].  [[Drought]] can kill crops and increase erosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml |title=Living With Drought |author=[[Bureau of Meteorology]] |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218192510/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while overly wet weather can cause harmful [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agnewsarchive.tamu.edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/Jun0607a.htm |title=Texas Crop and Weather |date=2007-06-06 |author=Robert Burns |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |accessdate=2010-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620134950/http://agnewsarchive.tamu.edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/Jun0607a.htm |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plant]]s need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain [[cactus|cacti]] require small amounts of water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/researchoncacti/|title=Mauseth Research: Cacti|author=James D. Mauseth|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.

In areas with wet and dry seasons, [[soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.&lt;ref name="JS"/&gt;  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Roberto Frisancho]] (1993).

==Changes due to global warming==
{{See also|Global warming}}
Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s.  Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.  Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter.  The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier.  There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics.  Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both).  Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentpsc.html|title=Precipitation and Storm Changes|author=Climate Change Division|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes due to urban heat island==
{{See also|Urban heat island}}
[[File:Atlanta thermal.jpg|thumb|Image of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], showing temperature distribution, with hot areas appearing white]]
The urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6&amp;nbsp;°C (1.1 to 10.1&amp;nbsp;°F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas.  This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity.  Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%.  Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between {{convert|20|to|40|mi|km|order=flip}} downwind of cities, compared with upwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spain goes hi-tech to beat drought | author=Dale Fuchs | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=2005-06-28 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/weather/Story/0,2763,1516375,00.html | accessdate=2007-08-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020613urbanrain.html |title=NASA Satellite Confirms Urban Heat Islands Increase Rainfall Around Cities |author=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=2002-06-18 |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316084837/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020613urbanrain.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is incorporated into almost everything that transmits or receives a [[radio wave]], which includes, but is not limited to, [[mobile phone]]s, [[radio]]s, [[Wi-Fi]], and two-way radios.
RF engineering is a highly specialized field that typically includes the following areas of expertise:
# Design of antenna systems to provide radiative coverage of a specified geographical area by an electromagnetic field or to provide specified sensitivity to an electromagnetic field impinging on the antenna.
# Design of coupling and transmission line structures to transport RF energy without radiation.
# Application of circuit elements and transmission line structures in the design of oscillators, amplifiers, mixers, detectors, combiners, filters, impedance transforming networks and other devices.
# Verification and measurement of performance of radio frequency devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How to Measure Requirement for RF Equipments| url = http://ranatec.com/how-to-measure-requirement-for-rf-equipments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To produce quality results, the RF engineer needs an in-depth knowledge of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and general [[electronics]] theory as well as specialized training in areas such as wave propagation, impedance transformations, filters and microstrip printed circuit board design to name a few.

==Radio electronics==
''Radio electronics'' is concerned with [[electronics|electronic]] [[electrical network|circuits]] which receive or transmit [[radio]] signals.

Typically, such circuits must operate at [[radio frequency]] and power levels, which imposes special constraints on their design. These constraints increase in their importance with higher frequencies. At [[microwave]] frequencies, the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] of [[signal trace]]s becomes a crucial part of the physical layout of the circuit.

List of radio electronics topics:
* [[radio frequency|RF]] [[oscillator]]s: [[PLL]], [[Voltage-controlled oscillator]]
* [[Transmitter]]s, [[transmission line]]s, [[RF connector]]s

* [[Electronic filter|RF filter]]s
* [[RF shielding]], [[Ground plane]]
* [[PCB layout guidelines]]
* [[DSSS]], [[noise power]]
* [[Digital radio]]

==Duties==

Radio-frequency engineers are specialists in their respective field and can take on many different roles, such as design, installation, and maintenance.  Radio-frequency engineers require many years of extensive experience in the area of study.  This type of engineer has experience with transmission systems, device design, and placement of antennas for optimum performance. 
The RF engineer job description at a [[broadcast]] facility can include maintenance of the station's high-power broadcast transmitters and associated systems. This includes transmitter site emergency power, remote control, main transmission line and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] adjustments, [[microwave radio relay]] [[Studio/transmitter link|STL]]/[[Transmitter/studio link|TSL]] links, and more.

In addition, a radio-frequency design engineer must be able to understand electronic hardware design, circuit board material, antenna radiation, and the effect of interfering frequencies that prevent optimum performance within the piece of equipment being developed.

A '''rogue planet''' (also termed an '''interstellar planet''', '''nomad planet''', '''free-floating planet''', '''unbound planet''', '''orphan planet''', '''wandering planet''', '''starless planet''', or '''sunless planet''') is a [[planetary-mass object]] that orbits a [[Central massive object|galactic center]] directly. Such objects have been ejected from the [[planetary system]] in which they formed or have never been gravitationally bound to any [[star]] or [[brown dwarf]].&lt;ref name="shostak"&gt;Shostak, Seth (24 February 2005).

Some planetary-mass objects may have formed in a similar way to stars, and the [[International Astronomical Union]] has proposed that those objects be called [[sub-brown dwarf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html Working Group on Extrasolar Planets – Definition of a "Planet"] Position Statement on the Definition of a "Planet" (IAU) {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916161707/http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html | date=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible example is [[Cha 110913-773444]], which might have been ejected and become a rogue planet, or otherwise formed on its own to become a sub-brown dwarf.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/10/06/space.planets.reut/index.html Rogue planet find makes astronomers ponder theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have used the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] and the [[Very Large Telescope]] to observe a very young free-floating planetary-mass object, [[OTS 44]], and demonstrate that the processes characterizing the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. Herschel far-infrared observations have shown that OTS 44 is surrounded by a disk of at least 10 Earth masses and thus could eventually form a mini planetary system.&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Joergens | first1=V. | last2=Bonnefoy | first2=M. | last3=Liu | first3=Y. | last4=Bayo | first4=A. | last5=Wolf | first5=S. | last6=Chauvin | first6=G. | last7=Rojo | first7=P. | title=OTS 44: Disk and accretion at the planetary border | journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume=558 | number=7 | date=2013 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322432 | arxiv=1310.1936 | bibcode=2013A&amp;A...558L...7J | page=L7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectroscopic observations of OTS 44 with the SINFONI spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope have revealed that the disk is actively accreting matter, in a similar way to young stars.&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558/&gt; In December 2013, a candidate [[exomoon]] of a rogue planet was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Sub-Earth-Mass Moon Orbiting a Gas Giant Primary or a High Velocity Planetary System in the Galactic Bulge | arxiv=1312.3951 | first1=D.P. |last1=Bennett |first2=V. | last2=Batista | display-authors=etal | date=13 December 2013 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/785/2/155 | volume=785 | issue=2 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | bibcode=2014ApJ...785..155B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation==
[[File:Alone in Space - Astronomers Find New Kind of Planet.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist's conception of a [[Jupiter]]-size rogue planet.]]

Astrophysicist Takahiro Sumi of Osaka University in Japan and colleagues, who form the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment collaborations, published their study of [[microlensing]] in 2011. They observed 50 million stars in the Milky Way using the 1.8-meter MOA-II telescope at New Zealand's [[Mount John Observatory]] and the 1.3-meter [[University of Warsaw]] telescope at Chile's [[Las Campanas Observatory]]. They found 474 incidents of microlensing, ten of which were brief enough to be planets of around Jupiter's size with no associated star in the immediate vicinity. The researchers estimated from their observations that there are nearly two Jupiter-mass rogue planets for every star in the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/05/homeless-planets-may-be-common.html?ref=hp Homeless' Planets May Be Common in Our Galaxy] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008190445/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/05/homeless-planets-may-be-common.html?ref=hp | date=8 October 2012}} by Jon Cartwright, Science Now, 18 May 2011, Accessed 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-class-planets.html Planets that have no stars: New class of planets discovered], Physorg.com, 18 May 2011.

==Retention of heat in interstellar space==
Interstellar planets generate little heat and are not heated by a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://aeon.co/essays/could-we-make-our-home-on-a-rogue-planet-without-a-sun | title=Life in the dark | publisher=Aeon | language=English | author=Sean Raymond | date=9 April 2005 | accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[David J. Stevenson]] theorized that some planet-sized objects adrift in interstellar space might sustain a thick atmosphere that would not freeze out. He proposed that these atmospheres would be preserved by the pressure-induced far-[[infrared]] radiation opacity of a thick [[hydrogen]]-containing atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6739/full/400032a0.html | journal=Nature | date=1999 | title=Life-sustaining planets in interstellar space? | first=David J. | last=Stevenson | doi=10.1038/21811 | volume=400 | page=32 | last2=Stevens | first2=C.

During planetary-system formation, several small protoplanetary bodies may be ejected from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lissauer | first= J. J. | title=Timescales for Planetary Accretion and the Structure of the Protoplanetary disk | journal=Icarus | volume=69 | issue=2 | pages=249–265| date=1987| doi=10.1016/0019-1035(87)90104-7 | bibcode=1987Icar...69..249L}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ejected body would receive less of the stellar-generated [[ultraviolet]] light that can strip away the lighter elements of its atmosphere. Even an Earth-sized body would have enough gravity to prevent the escape of the hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1999"/&gt; In an Earth-sized object that has a [[Bar (unit)|kilobar]] atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and a convective gas [[Adiabatic process|adiabat]], the [[geothermal energy]] from residual core radioisotope decay could maintain a surface temperature above the [[melting point]] of water,&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1999"/&gt; allowing liquid-water oceans to exist. These planets are likely to remain geologically active for long periods. If they have geodynamo-created protective [[magnetosphere]]s and sea floor volcanism, [[hydrothermal vent]]s could provide energy for life.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1999"/&gt; Thus, humans could live on such a star-less planet, although food sources would be limited. These bodies would be difficult to detect because of their weak thermal microwave radiation emissions, although reflected solar radiation and [[Far-infrared astronomy|far-infrared]] thermal emissions may be detectable from an object that is less than 1000 [[astronomical unit]]s from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Steppenwolf: A proposal for a habitable planet in interstellar space | arxiv=1102.1108 | author=Dorian S.

A large satellite would be a source of significant geological [[tidal force]] heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Survival Rate of Ejected Terrestrial Planets with Moons | first=John H. | last=Debes | author2=Steinn Sigurðsson | date=20 October 2007 | journal=The [[Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume=668 | issue=2 | pages=L167–L170 | doi=10.1086/523103 | bibcode=2007ApJ...668L.167D | arxiv=0709.0945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline''' is a [[natural gas pipeline|pipeline for natural gas]] in Russia, transporting [[Sakhalin]]'s gas to the most populated and industrialized regions of the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Primorsky Krai]]). It is also projected to become a part of an international export route, carrying Russian gas to East Asian countries, such as the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan.  The pipeline is owned and operated by [[Gazprom]]. It was opened on 8 September 2011.

== History ==
The project was announced in September 2007, when the [[Russian Federation]]'s [[Ministry of Energy (Russia)|Industry and Energy Ministry]] approved the gas Development Program for Eastern Siberia and the Far East.&lt;ref name="gazprom2"&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gazprom.com/press/news/2009/july/article66851/ | title = Gazprom launches construction of Sakhalin – Khabarovsk – Vladivostok gas transmission system | publisher=[[Gazprom]] | date = 31 July 2009 | accessdate =4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was aimed at reducing utility prices in the Russian Far East by replacing more expensive coal and petroleum at the regional power and heating plants with cheaper natural gas.&lt;ref name=monstersandcritics/&gt;

The pipeline project was approved by Gazprom's board of directors on 23 July 2008. At the same meeting, Gazprom's board of directors agreed to purchase the Komsomolsk–Khabarovsk pipeline, commissioned in November 2006 by Daltransgaz, a former subsidiary of [[Rosneft]].&lt;ref name="gazprom1"&gt;{{Cite press release| url=http://www.gazprom.Ru/eng/news/2008/07/29928.shtml| title=Board of Directors approves the purchase of Sakhalin – Komsomolsk – Khabarovsk.

Construction began on 31 July 2009 in Khabarovsk with a ceremony, which was attended by the [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="gazprom2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters31"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSLV7139820090731?sp=true| title = Russia launches Far East pipeline, eyes Exxon gas| first=Robin| last=Paxton|agency=Reuters  | date = 31 July 2009| accessdate =4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pipeline was opened on 8 September 2011.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first gas consumer in the Primorsky Krai was Vladivostok Combined Heat and Power Plant 2 (CHPP-2), tasked with converting from coal to natural gas. In early 2012, CHPP-1 and the heating plant in Severnaya will be converted to natural gas.&lt;ref name=gazprom080911/&gt;&lt;ref name=lng/&gt;

==Route==
The {{convert|1822|km|mi|adj=on}} Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok gas transport system consists of three sections.&lt;ref name=gazprom2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ogj120709/&gt;  The Khabarovsk–Vladivostok section together with the first phase of the Sakhalin–Komsomolsk section, which supplies gas from the Gazprom's Far East northern part's gas fields, will create a {{convert|1350|km|mi|adj=on}} pipeline system.&lt;ref name=gazprom2/&gt;  The third section - the {{convert|472|km|mi|adj=on}} Komsomolsk–Habarovsk pipeline, commissioned in 2006-&lt;ref name=gazprom080911&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gazprom.com/press/news/2011/september/article118764/ | title = Gazprom commissions first startup complex of Sakhalin – Khabarovsk – Vladivostok GTS | publisher=[[Gazprom]] | date = 8 September 2011 | accessdate =10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; would then be connected to the proposed [[Yakutia–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline]].&lt;ref name=gazprom2/&gt;

The pipeline will supply gas to China and Japan and there is a planned link to South Korea. From Vladvivostok, a Chinese pipeline under construction since 2015 by [[China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau]] will extend across China, reaching Shanghai.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gas pipeline to Russia has biggest pipes in China|url=http://www.cctv-america.com/2015/06/30/gas-pipeline-to-russia-have-biggest-pipes-in-china|agency=CCTV America|date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline also will feed a planned [[LNG plant]] inPrimorsky Krai, producing [[liquefied natural gas]] for export to Japan, and a proposed petrochemical complex.&lt;ref name=platts&gt;{{cite news | url = https://online.platts.com/PPS/P=m&amp;e=1214432995732.3805867267113022414/LNG_20080624.xml?artnum=200c80Ve6z2MT41852J2M1_1 | title =  Russia's Gazprom mulls new liquefaction plant in country's Far East | publisher=[[Platts]] (requires subscription) | date = 24 June 2008 | accessdate =4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vladivostok&gt;{{cite news | url = http://vladivostoktimes.com/show/?id=26289&amp;p=2 | title = Gas Will Be Delivered to Japan through Vladivostok | publisher=[[Vladivostok Times]] | date = 24 June 2008 | accessdate =4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also plans to supply gas from Vladivostok to Japan and South Korea by subsea pipelines.&lt;ref name=ogj120709&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative route to South Korea would be via an overland pipeline through [[North Korea]].  According to Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]], this proposed pipeline would help strengthen security in East Asia by meeting North Korea's energy needs and providing it with transit revenue.  The project was also discussed during the visit of [[Kim Jong Il]] to Russia in August 2011.&lt;ref name=rusin2&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8775">[[File:Koppen World Map Aw.png|thumb|right|400px|Worldwide zones of Tropical savanna climate (Aw/As).]]
'''Tropical savanna climate''' or '''tropical wet and dry climate''' is a type of [[climate]] that corresponds to the [[Köppen climate classification]] categories "Aw" and "As".
Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperatures above {{convert|18|°C|0}} in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm (2.36 inches) of precipitation  and also less than 100 – [total annual precipitation {mm}/25] of precipitation. &lt;ref name=McKnight&gt;{{cite book | last1=McKnight |first1=Tom L |last2=Hess |first2=Darrel | year=2000 | chapter=Climate Zones and Types |  title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=0-13-020263-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|200–1}} 

This latter fact is in direct contrast to a [[tropical monsoon climate]], whose driest month sees less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm of precipitation but has ''more'' than 100 – [total annual precipitation {mm}/25] of precipitation. In essence, a tropical savanna climate tends to either see less rainfall than a tropical monsoon climate or have more pronounced dry season(s). 

In tropical savanna climates, the dry season can become severe, and often drought conditions prevail during the course of the year. Tropical savanna climates often feature tree-studded grasslands, rather than thick jungle. It is this widespread occurrence of tall , course grass (called savanna) which has lead to Aw climates often being referred to as tropical savanna. However, there is some doubt whether tropical grasslands are climatically induced. Additionally, pure savannas, with out trees, are the exception rather than the rule.  

==Versions==
There are generally four types of tropical savanna climates:

* Distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s of relatively equal duration. Most of the region's annual rainfall is experienced during the wet season and very little precipitation falls during the dry season.
* A lengthy dry season and a relatively short wet season. This version features seven or more dry season months and five or fewer wet season months. There are variations within this version: 
**On one extreme, the region receives just enough precipitation during the short wet season to preclude it from a [[semi-arid climate]] classification. This drier variation of the tropical savanna climate is typically found adjacent to regions with semi-arid climates. 
**On the other extreme, the climate features a lengthy dry season followed by a short but extremely rainy wet season. However, regions with this variation of the climate do not experience enough rainfall during the wet season to qualify as a tropical monsoon climate.
* A lengthy wet season and a relatively short dry season. This version features seven or more wet season months and five or fewer dry season months. This version's precipitation pattern is similar to precipitation patterns observed in some tropical monsoon climates, but does not experience enough rainfall during the wet season to be classified as such.
* A dry season with a noticeable amount of rainfall followed by a rainy wet season. In essence, this version mimics the precipitation patterns more commonly found in a tropical monsoon climate, but do not receive enough precipitation during either the dry season or the year to be classified as such.

== Distribution ==
Tropical savanna climates are most commonly found in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and northern [[South America]]. The climate is also prevalent in sections of [[Central America]], northern [[Australia]], the Pacific Islands and southern [[North America]], specifically in sections of [[Mexico]] and the state of [[Florida]] in the [[United States]], and some islands in the [[Caribbean]]. Most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the [[tropics|tropical zone]], but occasionally an inner-tropical location (e.g., [[San Marcos, Antioquia|San Marcos]], [[Antioquia department|Antioquia]], [[Colombia]]) also qualifies. Similarly, the Caribbean coast, eastward from the [[Gulf of Urabá]] on the [[Colombia]] – [[Panama|Panamá]] border to the [[Orinoco]] [[river delta]], on the Atlantic Ocean (ca. 4,000&amp;nbsp;km), have long dry periods (the extreme is the BSh climate (see below), characterised by very low, unreliable precipitation, present, for instance, in extensive areas in the [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira]], and Coro, western Venezuela, the northernmost peninsulas in South America, which receive &lt;300&amp;nbsp;mm total annual precipitation, practically all in two or three months). This condition extends to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Greater Antilles]] forming the Circumcaribbean dry belt. The length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward); at the latitude of the Amazon river—which flows eastward, just south of the equatorial line—the climate is Af. East from the Andes, between the arid Caribbean and the ever-wet Amazon are the Orinoco river [[Los Llanos (South America)|llanos]] or [[savanna]]s, from where this climate takes its name.

Sometimes ''As'' is used in place of ''Aw'' if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days often due to a rain shadow effect that cuts off summer precipitation in a tropical area. This is the case in parts of [[Hawaii]], East Africa (Mombasa, Kenya, Somalia), Sri Lanka ([[Trincomalee]]) and coastal regions of Northeastern Brazil (from [[Fortaleza]] through [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] to [[Maceió]]), for instance. The difference between 'summer' and 'winter' in such locations is usually so slight that a distinction between an ''As'' and ''Aw'' climate is a quibble. In most places that have tropical wet and dry climates, however, the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of reduction of or lack of [[convection]], which in turn is due to the meridional shifts of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] during the course of the year.

The '''Tube Challenge''' is the competition for the fastest time to travel to all [[London Underground]] stations, tracked as a [[Guinness World Record]] since 1960. The goal is to visit all the stations on the system, not necessarily all the lines; participants may connect between stations on foot, or by using other forms of public transport.

{{As of|2016}}, the record for fastest completion was held by Andi James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK), who completed the challenge in 15 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds on 21 May 2015.&lt;ref name=alwakeel-20160106&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alwakeel|first1=Ramzy|title=Tube challenger reclaims world record for trip around all 270 stations|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/tube-challenger-claws-back-world-record-for-fastest-journey-around-all-270-stations-a3149961.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=Evening Standard|date=6 January 2016|quote=270 Tube stops in 15 hours and 45 minutes … Mr Wilson … and Mr James’s new record has taken eight months for Guinness World Records to ratify – the pair actually completed their run in May last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations|title=Fastest time to travel to all London Underground stations|quote=15 hr 45 min 38 sec, and was achieved by Andy James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK) in London, UK, on 21 May 2015.|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=11 March 2016|archivedate=4 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083335/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded challenge took place in 1959. Although many people have attempted the challenge and held the record since, they have not always been credited in the record books. In the earlier days of the challenge, participants were permitted to use private forms of transport (such as a car or bike) to move between stations. This led to times of less than 16 hours in some earlier records, and Guinness later changed the rules{{when|date=July 2011}} to ban private transport.

The following is a list of record holders that have appeared in the printed edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. The record did not appear in the book until its eighth edition.

Between the 1960s and 1990s the record regularly appeared in the ''Guinness Book of Records'', initially listed under "Underground Railways – circuit of", but later just under "Railways" and then "Trains".  Since the change of publishing style of the book from the 2001 edition onwards, the record – although frequently broken – has only once appeared in printed form, in the 2008 edition. More recent records have tended to be published online instead. Since the record has not regularly been published in the book, there have been two broad configurations on the system – one for 275 stations, and one for 270 once the East London Line was no longer part of the network.

===275 stations===
On 3 April 2002 Jack Welsby set a new record time for 275 stations by traversing the system in 19 hours, 18 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|title=New record set on the tube|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=24 July 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141751/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|archivedate=5 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsby made just one attempt, starting his route at Heathrow and finishing at Amersham.

This time was beaten on 4 May 2004 by [[Geoff Marshall]] and Neil Blake who achieved a new record time of 18 hours 35 minutes and 43 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/every-tube-station-in-18-hours-7235423.html|title=Every Tube station in 18 hours|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempt began on the first train out of [[Amersham station|Amersham]] on the Metropolitan Line and ended at [[Upminster station|Upminster]], and it took Guinness World Records four months to ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3700658.stm|title=Tube station visit record broken|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2004 | date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous attempt had been broadcast on TV as part of ''[[The Tube (2003 TV series)|The Tube]]'' TV series and another attempt had been televised as part of an ITV1 programme ''Metroland: Race Around the Underground'' on 16 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|title=Going down the tubes|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=17 October 2003|accessdate=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429143148/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|archivedate=29 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this time stood for two years before being beaten by just five seconds, it was not until Håkan Wolgé and Lars Andersson (both from Sweden) set a new record time for 275 stations that it appeared in the ''Guinness World Records'' Book again, in the 2008 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2008"/&gt; They set a new record of 18 hours, 25 minutes and 3 seconds, on 26 September 2006.

===270 stations===
Changes to the total number of stations meant that the record was 'reset' and broken three more times over a two-year period until Wood Lane station opened in October 2008, and the network settled at 270 stations.

The first holders of the 270-station record were Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who, on 14 December 2009, achieved a record time of 16 hours, 44 minutes and 16 seconds.&lt;ref name=Southwest&gt;{{Cite news|title = Richard's going underground on charity mission|quote = ''[will] attempt to dethrone Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who set the benchmark on December 14, 2009.''|publisher = This Is Plymouth|date = 4 February 2010|url = http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|accessdate = 12 July 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040236/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|archivedate = 14 June 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TfL used this route four years later as part of the Art on the Underground [[labyrinth]] project to mark the 150th anniversary of the [[London Underground]], installing permanent designs at stations in the same order that the world record route had taken, and later appeared in an ''Information Capital'' article.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Telegraph|title=How to do the Tube Challenge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11174269/How-to-do-the-Tube-Challenge.html|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record remained unbeaten for 17 months, until Marc Gawley from Denton, Greater Manchester, set a new time of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 57 seconds on 21 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|title=New world record for Denton man who travelled to all 270 London tube stations in under 17 hours|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1425496_new-world-record-for-denton-man-who-travelled-to-all-270-london-tube-stations-in-under-17-hours|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fast marathon runner, he revealed that he did not use any buses on the day, preferring instead to make all his connections on foot. Gawley's record was beaten 37 days later, when James and Wilson completed the challenge in just 44 seconds under Gawley's time, setting a new record of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 13 seconds on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2013"/&gt;

This record stood for over two years until August 2013, before being broken by previous record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] who along with Anthony Smith, completed the challenge in 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds,&lt;ref name="bbc2013"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=London Tube Station Visiting Record Broken|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24203949|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Londonist|title=New world record for Tube Challenges|url=http://londonist.com/2013/09/new-world-record-for-tube-challenge.php|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the record time was then published for the first time in seven years in the ''Guinness World Records'' in the 2015 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2015"/&gt;

Clive Burgess and Ronan McDonald set a new Guinness world record time of 16 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Brighton Argus|title=For the record, world was enthusiats's Oyster card|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12901532.For_the_record__world_was_enthusiast___s_Oyster__card_/|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken later that year, on 21 May, by previous record holders Andi James and Steve Wilson, in a time of 15 hours 45 minutes 38 seconds.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"/&gt;

==Other attempts==

Attempts to travel the network have been linked to charities such as Children in Need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wear/hi/front_page/newsid_9184000/9184337.stm|title=Pudsey Challenge 2010|publisher=BBC Sunderland|date = 12 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/going_underground_1_2769466|title=Going Underground|newspaper=Sunderland Echo|date = 26 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesthegill.blogspot.com/2009/03/red-nose-day-tube-challenge-2009.html|title=Aiming to misbehave|date = 14 March 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charity attempt known as "Tube Relief" was organised, following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], to raise money for the [[London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund]]. Fifty-one people rode the entire tube network for the day,&lt;ref name="Tube challenge for bomb charity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4180368.stm |title=Tube challenge for bomb charity|publisher=BBC News |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising over £10,000 towards the official charity fund. A [[Sue Ryder (charity)|Sue Ryder]] charity event took place in November 2011, when ten teams competed against each other to have their photo taken outside as many of the 270 stations as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day/|title=Visiting 270 London Underground stations in one day|publisher=Purple Frog|date=14 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424125549/http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day|archivedate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] subsequently organised a mass-participant event in 2014, called "Walk The Tube", which has become an annual event, raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geofftech.co.uk/tube/tube26.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1OF9dSMD4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States House of Representatives}}
The '''Committee on Energy and Commerce''' is one of the oldest [[standing committee (United States Congress)|standing committees]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Established in 1795, it has operated continuously—with various name changes and jurisdictional changes—for more than 200 years. The two other House standing committees with such continuous operation are the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]]. The Committee has served as the principal guide for the House in matters relating to the promotion of commerce and to the public’s health and marketplace interests, with the relatively recent addition of energy considerations among them.

==Role of the committee==
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has developed what is arguably the broadest (non-tax-oriented) jurisdiction of any congressional committee. The Committee maintains principal responsibility for legislative oversight relating to telecommunications, consumer protection, food and drug safety, public health, air quality and environmental health, the supply and delivery of energy, and interstate and foreign commerce.&lt;ref&gt;https://energycommerce.house.gov/about/&lt;/ref&gt; This jurisdiction extends over five Cabinet-level departments and seven independent agencies—from the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services, the Transportation Department to the Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration, and Federal Communications Commission—and sundry quasi-governmental organizations.

==Subcommittees==
To manage the wide variety of issues it encounters, the Committee relies on the front-line work of six subcommittees, one more than during the [[111th Congress]]. During the 111th Congress, Chairman Henry Waxman combined the traditionally separate energy and environment subcommittees into a single subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1462&amp;Itemid=93 |title=House Energy and Commerce Committee announces Subcommittee Chairs and Membership |date=January 8, 2009 |publisher=Energy and Commerce Committee Press Release |accessdate=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Chairman Fred Upton restored them as separate subcommittees at the start of the 112th Congress.

==History==
The Committee was originally formed as the '''Committee on Commerce and Manufactures''' on December 14, 1795. Prior to this, legislation was drafted in the Committee of the Whole or in special ad hoc committees, appointed for specific limited purposes. However the growing demands of the new nation required that Congress establish a permanent committee to manage its constitutional authority under the [[Commerce Clause]] to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States."

From this time forward, as the nation grew and Congress dealt with new public policy concerns and created new committees, the Energy and Commerce Committee has maintained its central position as Congress's monitor of commercial progress—a focus reflected in its changing jurisdiction, both in name and practice.

In 1819, the Committee’s name was changed to the '''Committee on Commerce''', reflecting the creation of a separate Manufacturers Committee and also the increasing scope of and complexity of American commercial activity, which was expanding the Committee’s jurisdiction from navigational aids and the nascent general health service to foreign trade and [[tariff]]s. [[Thomas J. Bliley]], who chaired the Committee from 1995 to 2000, chose to use this traditional name, which underscores the Committee's role for Congress on this front.

In 1891, in emphasis of the Committee's evolving activities, the name was again changed to the '''Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce'''—a title it maintained until 1981, when, under incoming Chairman [[John Dingell]], the Committee first assumed what is now its present name to emphasize its lead role in guiding the energy policy of the United States. Dingell regained chairmanship of the committee in 2007 after having served as [[ranking member]] since 1995. In late 2008, [[Henry Waxman]] initiated a successful challenge to unseat Dingell as chairman. His challenge was unusual as the party caucus traditionally elects chairmen based on committee seniority. Waxman formally became chairman at the start of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]].&lt;ref name=HRes8&gt;{{USBill|111|HRes|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Subduction-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8| Volcanic arc formation along a subducting plate]]

A '''volcanic arc''' is a chain of [[volcano]]es formed above a [[subduction|subducting plate]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
|url= http://www.theodora.com/geology/glossaryuv.html#VA

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
positioned in an arc shape as seen from above. Offshore volcanoes form islands, resulting in a volcanic [[island arc]]. Generally, volcanic arcs result from the [[subduction]] of an oceanic [[tectonic plate]] under another tectonic plate, and often parallel an [[oceanic trench]]. The oceanic plate is saturated with water, and volatiles such as water drastically lower the melting point of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. As the oceanic plate is subducted, it is subjected to greater and greater pressures with increasing depth. This pressure squeezes water out of the plate and introduces it to the mantle. Here the mantle melts and forms [[magma]] at depth under the overriding plate. The magma ascends to form an arc of volcanoes parallel to the subduction zone.

These should not be confused with [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanic chains, where volcanoes often form one after another in the middle of a tectonic plate, as the plate moves over the hotspot, and so the volcanoes progress in age from one end of the chain to the other. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] form a typical hotspot chain; the older islands (tens of millions of years old) to the northwest are smaller and more lush than the recently created (400,000 years ago) Hawaii island itself, which is more rocky.  Hotspot volcanoes are also known as "intra-plate" volcanoes, and the islands they create are known as Volcanic Ocean Islands. Volcanic arcs do not generally exhibit such a simple age-pattern.

There are two types of volcanic arcs: 
* '''oceanic arcs''' form when [[oceanic crust]] subducts beneath other oceanic crust on an adjacent plate, creating a volcanic island arc. (Not all [[island arcs]] are volcanic island arcs.)
* '''[[continental arc]]s''' form when oceanic crust subducts beneath [[continental crust]] on an adjacent plate, creating an arc-shaped [[mountain belt]].

In some situations, a single subduction zone may show both aspects along its length, as part of a plate subducts beneath a continent and part beneath adjacent oceanic crust.

Volcanoes are present in almost any mountain belt, but this does not make it a volcanic arc. Often there are isolated, but impressively huge volcanoes in a mountain belt. For instance, [[Vesuvius]] and the [[Mount Etna|Etna]] volcanoes in Italy are part of separate but different kinds of mountainous volcanic ensembles.

The active front of a volcanic arc is the belt where [[volcanism]] develops at a given time. Active fronts may move over time (millions of years), changing their distance from the [[oceanic trench]] as well as their width.

==Petrology==
In the [[subduction|subduction zone]], loss of [[water]] from the subducted  [[Slab (geology)|slab]] induces partial melting of the overriding [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and generates low-density, [[calc-alkaline]] [[magma]] that buoyantly rises to [[intrusion|intrude]] and be extruded through the [[lithosphere]] of the overriding plate. This loss of water is due to the destabilization of the mineral [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] at approximately 40–60&amp;nbsp;km depth.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, T. L., N. Chatterjee, S. W. Parman, and E. Médard (2006), The Influence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on Mantle Wedge Melting, ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'', ''249'', 74–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, T.L., C. B. Till, N. Chatterjee, and E. Médard (submitted 2008), Transport of H2O in subduction zones and its role in the formation and location of arc volcanoes, ''Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason for island arc volcanism at consistent distances from the subducting slab: because the temperature-pressure conditions for [[Flux melting|flux-melting]] volcanism due to chlorite destabilization will always occur at the same depth, the distance from the trench to the arc volcanoes is determined only by the dip angle of the subducting slab.

On the subducting side of the island arc is a deep and narrow [[oceanic trench]], which is the trace at the Earth’s surface of the boundary between the downgoing and overriding plates. This trench is created by the gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate pulling the leading edge of the plate downward. Multiple [[earthquake]]s occur along this subduction boundary with the [[seismic]] [[hypocenter]]s located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]s. The volcanic arc forms when the subducting plate reaches a depth of about 100&amp;nbsp;km.

Ocean basins that are being reduced by subduction are called 'remnant oceans' as they will slowly be shrunken out of existence and crushed in the subsequent [[orogeny|orogenic]] collision. This process has happened over and over in the geologic history of the Earth.

In the rock record, volcanic arcs can be seen as the volcanic rocks themselves, but because volcanic rock is easily [[weathering|weathered]] and [[erosion|eroded]], it is more typical that they are seen as [[plutonic rock]]s, the rocks that formed underneath the arc (e.g. the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] [[batholith]]), or in the sedimentary record as [[lithic sandstone]]s.

==Examples==
Two classic examples of oceanic island arcs are the [[Mariana Islands]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] in western [[North America]] and the [[Andes]] along the western edge of [[South America]] are examples of continental volcanic arcs. The best examples of volcanic arcs with both sets of characteristics are in the North Pacific, with the Aleutian Arc consisting of the [[Aleutian Islands]] and their extension the [[Aleutian Range]] on the [[Alaska Peninsula]], and the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc comprising the [[Kuril Islands]] and southern [[Kamchatka Peninsula]].
