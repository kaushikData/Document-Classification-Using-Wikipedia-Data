'''425 Park Avenue''' is an office building in [[New York City]], under redevelopment by [[L&amp;L Holding]] and [[GreenOak Real Estate]] with a redesign by architectural firm [[Foster + Partners]]. Work on the new structure began in 2016, and is expected to end in late 2019.
__NOTOC__

==History==
===Construction===
L&amp;L acquired the original structure on the site in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/02/425-park-avenue-finally-nears-transformation-into-steel-and-glass-stunner/|title=425 Park Ave. finally nears transformation into steel-and-glass stunner|last=Cuozzo|first=Steve|date=2 April 2018|publisher=NY Post|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original building was constructed in the 1950s, and contained 33 floors. Due to zoning restrictions, the new structure will contain the same number of square feet as the previous one, and will incorporate some of the original structure into its base.&lt;ref name=comobs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2018/06/under-construction-why-lls-425-park-avenue-development-was-delayed/|title=Under Construction: L&amp;L’s 425 Park Avenue Demo Nears the Finish Line|last=La Guerre|first=Liam|date=20 June 2018|publisher=Commercial Observer|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preserving the original structure led to difficulties during construction, requiring the developer to hire a third engineering firm.&lt;ref name=comobs/&gt; 

As of April 2018, the building was halfway to its full height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/17/17248766/425-park-avenue-norman-foster-construction-update|title=Norman Foster’s Park Avenue office tower is now halfway to its pinnacle|last=Walker|first=Ameena|date=17 April 2018|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facade installation began in June 2018, when the building was 22 floors from topping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/06/425-park-avenues-facade-installation-begins-as-construction-nears-halfway-point-midtown-east.html|title=425 Park Avenue’s Façade Installation Begins As Construction Nears Halfway Point, Midtown East|last=Nelson|first=Andrew|date=29 June 2018|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
[[Ely Jacques Kahn|Kahn &amp; Jacobs]] designed the original office building on the site. [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] in style, it replaced a row of townhouses. It was one of the first modernist buildings on Park Avenue.

Because of zoning restrictions, a portion of the former structure was included in thew new one. L&amp;L chose Foster + Partners to design the building after a competition to choose an architect.&lt;ref name=yimbylong&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2016/04/425-park-avenue-pioneer-of-modernism-loses-half-its-height-to-make-way-for-893-foot-tall-21st-century-beacon.html|title=425 Park Avenue, Pioneer Of Modernism, Loses Half Its Height To Make Way For 893-Foot-Tall 21st Century Beacon|last=Ogorodnikov|first=Vitali|date=8 April 2016|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; L&amp;L solicited bids from 11 architectural firms. These entries were narrowed to four final proposals, from [[Zaha Hadid Architects]], [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]], [[Rem Koolhaas|OMA]], and Foster + Partners. Each incorporated a portion of the original structure. Real estate news site ''YIMBY'' noted that, due to its three roughly 200-foot concrete fins, the Foster plan would have "[...] the most pronounced skyline effect" compared to the other proposals.&lt;ref name=yimbylong/&gt;

===Financing===
Lender HFF provided a $556 million construction loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2015/07/hffs-geoffrey-goldstein-talks-leaving-banking-for-brokering/|title=HFF’s Geoffrey Goldstein Talks Leaving Banking for Brokering|last=Ghigliotti|first=Damian|date=9 July 2015|publisher=Commercial Observer|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenants=== 
L&amp;L intended not to pre-lease the building, but in early 2016, hedge fund [[Citadel LLC|Citadel]] signed a lease for 200,000 square feet across several floors, including the penthouse floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bisnow.com/new-york/news/office/the-priciest-lease-in-nyc-history-may-have-just-been-signed-56099|title=The Priciest Lease In NYC History May Have Just Been Signed|last=Boysen|first=Ryan|date=17 February 2016|publisher=Bisnow|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yimbylong/&gt; At the time it was signed, it was the most expensive lease in the city's history. Delays in construction have led some to speculate that Citadel may back out of the lease, or that it was seeking temporary offices due to the delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bisnow.com/new-york/news/office/citadel-may-be-having-second-thoughts-on-its-lease-at-425-park-ave-89098|title=Citadel, After Signing Most Expensive NYC Office Lease Ever, Exploring Other Office Options|last=Hall|first=Miriam|date=1 June 2018|publisher=Bisnow|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; L&amp;L has asserted that the tenant will move in as planned.

The founders of restaurant Eleven Madison will open two restaurants in the building, originally announced in 2015. One will be two stories tall, in the building's base, totaling roughly 14,000 square feet. According to L&amp;L's founder, David Levinson, the intention is for the restaurant to be  "...a [[Four Seasons (restaurant)|Four Seasons]] on steroids for the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/06/10/this-new-restaurant-is-the-next-four-seasons/|title=Park Avenue tower will boast hot new eatery|last=Cuozzo|first=Steve|date=10 June 2015|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other restaurant will be open only to tenants, and will be located on the 27th floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.eater.com/2015/6/10/8756915/eleven-madison-park-daniel-humm-will-guidara-new-restaurant-park-avenue|title=Eleven Madison Park Team to Open Fine Dining Behemoth on Park Avenue|last=Preston|first=Marguerite|date=10 June 2015|publisher=Eater|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite construction delays, both venues are still expected to open when construction is complete as of June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.eater.com/2018/7/16/17578484/will-guidara-daniel-humm-financial-district-world-trade|title=Eleven Madison Park Team Nixes Plan for Big FiDi Restaurant|last=Dai|first=Serena|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Eater NY|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ActiveReports''' is a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] reporting tool used by developers of [[WinForms]], [[ASP.NET]], and [[HTML5]] applications. It was originally developed by [[Data Dynamics]], which was then acquired by [[GrapeCity]]. ActiveReports is a set of components and tools that facilitates the production of reports to display data in documents and web-based formats. It is written in managed C# code and allows [[Visual Studio]] programmers to leverage their knowledge of C# or [[Visual Basic.NET]] when programming with ActiveReports.

Among the components included with ActiveReports are exports to file formats such as [[PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[TIFF]]. The main components are a [[Visual Studio]] integrated report designer, and an API that developers use to create customized reports from a variety of data sources. ActiveReports Standard Edition also includes a Visual Query Designer, a customizable Windows Viewer control, an [[HTML5]] Viewer control, and a [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] Viewer control.

The integrated report designer handles three types of reports:

* Section Reports with banded sections like the original ActiveReports (reminiscent of [[Microsoft Access]] reports)
* Page Reports with a fixed layout for forms 
* RDL Reports with a continuous page layout like the original Data Dynamics Reports (uses [[Report Definition Language]])

The Professional Edition of ActiveReports includes the Standard Edition tools plus an End-User Report Designer control that developers use to host the report designer in their own Microsoft Windows applications to let end users create and modify reports. It also includes a server-side ASP.NET web viewer with Flash, PDF, and HTML viewer types; ASP.NET HTTP Handlers that export reports to HTML or PDF format without custom code; a [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] viewer; and advanced PDF encryption and rendering features.

==ActiveReports Server==
ActiveReports Server is a [[Scalability|scalable]] server platform with built in [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. It provides a secure and [[Extensibility|extensible]] report server to publish reports designed in ActiveReports. A comprehensive [[Representational state transfer|RESTful API]] enables integration of the [[Responsive web design|responsive]] [[HTML5]] Report Portal for end users to view, schedule and export reports.

==Known Issues==

In the past, ActiveReports was known to be unable to handle large reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.asp.net/p/1454550/3327154.aspx?Re+System+Out+of+Memory+Exception+active+reports+asp+net+C+&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was ongoing across years and versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/groups/topic/approach-to-building-a-large-report/#post-502669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9365434/pdf-tmp-file-are-not-deleted-and-out-of-memory-exception-when-cachetodisk-is-us&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, development efforts have focused on improving large report handling in every release.

ActiveReports can be used in many ways, so each project can have a number of reasons for consuming memory. In newer versions, CacheToDisk and CacheToDiskLocation properties were added for PDF exports. Some other considerations that may cause too much memory use in section reports include:&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/webhelp/AR10/index.html#OptimizingActiveReports.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Large or repeated images on every page 
* Subreports in repeating sections instantiated in the wrong event so that many new instances are created instead of one
* Summaries in header sections that delay rendering 
* Report and Document object instances not released from memory

Count '''Alfred Wojciech Potocki''' hr. [[Pilawa coat of arms|Pilawa]] (1785–1862) was a [[Poland|Polish]] nobleman ([[szlachcic]]), landowner, political and economic activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://genealogia.grocholski.pl/gd/osoba.php?id=003246 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421012542/http://genealogia.grocholski.pl/gd/osoba.php?id=003246 |archive-date=2016-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sejm-wielki.pl/b/3.662.587&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred was the 1st [[Ordynat]] of [[Łańcut]] estates. From 1809 until 1815 he served in the [[Polish Army]]. In 1812 he became [[aide-de-camp]] of Prince [[Józef Antoni Poniatowski]] and participated in [[Napoleon]]'s campaign against Russia.

In 1838 he created the Łańcut [[Ordynacja]]. Since 1861 Alfred was member of the National [[Sejm]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)#House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]. He served as Austrian councillor and was Great Galician [[Ochmistrz]].

Alfred helped to modernize the agriculture in Galicia. He founded textile (1839–1844) and sugar (1836 industries and 1841) factories. He was co-founder of the "Estate Credit Society" in [[Lwów]]. Since 1823 he ran the [[Lubomirski]] family distillery in [[Łańcut]], which exists today under the name [[Polmos Łańcut]].

His father was the writer [[Jan Potocki]], best known for his famous novel ''"[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]"''. His brother was Count [[Artur Potocki]] (1787–1832), who married Countess [[Zofia Branicka]].

==Marriage and issue==
Alfred Wojciech married Princess [[Józefina Maria Czartoryska]] on 21 June 1814 and had four children:

* Count [[Alfred Józef Potocki]] (1817 or 1822–1889), married Princess [[Maria Klementyna Sanguszko]]
* Countess [[Ewa Józefina Julia Potocka]] (1818–1895), married [[Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein]] 
* Countess Zofia Ewa Potocka (1820–1882), married Count [[Dietrichstein|Moritz von Dietrichstein]] (1801–1852)

== History ==
SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding.&lt;ref name="SanFranBusinessTimesRoundOne"&gt;{{cite news|title=SAP Ventures invests $6M in Alteryx Inc.|first=Steven|last=Brown|newspaper=San Francisco Business Times|date=5 April 2011|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2011/04/05/sap-ventures-invests-6m-in-alteryx-inc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"&gt;{{cite press release |title=SRC Corporate Overview |url= http://src.mediaroomshowcase.com/file.php/2441/SRC+backgrounder.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ExtendTheReach.Com / Products / SoloCast |url= http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate |archivedate=8 February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208021200/http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data.&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Census deal for O.C. firm |first=Jan |last=Norman |newspaper=The Orange County Register |date=17 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on [[CD-ROMs]] of [[United States Census|Census Data]] sold by the [[U.S. Census Bureau|Bureau]].&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCameraCensus"&gt;{{cite news|date=5 July 2001|newspaper=Daily Camera|title=SRC organizing census data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.&lt;ref name=10K2017/&gt;

The '''Ames Free Library''' is a [[public library]] designed by noted American architect [[H. H. Richardson]]. It is located at 53 Main Street, [[Easton, Massachusetts]], immediately adjacent to another Richardson building, [[Oakes Ames Memorial Hall]].

In 2016 the Ames Free Library won the Best Small Library in America award from the [[Library Journal]]. This award was created in 2005 by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] to encourage and showcase outstanding libraries serving populations of fewer than 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinstein|first1=Susan|title=Easton’s Ames Free Library named Best Small Library in America -- again|url=http://easton.wickedlocal.com/news/20160421/eastons-ames-free-library-named-best-small-library-in-america----again|accessdate=19 September 2017|agency=Wicked Local - Easton|date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berry III|first1=John N.|title=Culture Convener - Best Small Library in America 2016|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/01/lj-in-print/culture-convener-best-small-library-in-america-2016/|accessdate=19 September 2017|agency=Library Journal|date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the second time the library has won this award.

==History==
On the death of [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], he left $50,000 for the construction of a library.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"/&gt; The will stipulated that it was to be a private institution, not owned by the town, but operated in trust for the public.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"/&gt; The request was carried out by Ames' children, [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]] and Helen Angier Ames. They hired [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] to design the building.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"/&gt; The final cost of the building came to at least $80,000.&lt;ref name="Ochsner"&gt;{{cite book |title=H. H. Richardson: Complete Architectural Works |last=Ochsner |first=Jeffrey Karl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBDXfLHsnc4C |publisher=MIT Press |date=1984 |pages=68, 183 |isbn=0-262-65015-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library was built from 1877 to 1879, although it did not open until March 10, 1883. It is generally rectangular, with broad gable projecting from its north end and a rectangular tower rising where the gable meets the main mass. The gable's front facade contains a heavily arched entry on the first floor and a row of five arched windows separated by pairs of short columns above. The facade is light-brown Milford granite laid in random ashlar with reddish-brown Longmeadow brownstone trim. Its roof is red-orange tile. A children's wing (red brick) was added in 1931, eliminating the original lavatory and document room.

Within, the library's major rooms, stack wing, hall, and reading room are laid out longitudinally. The reading room's fireplace is primarily by [[Stanford White]], and the stone and bronze medallions of [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]] were designed by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].

'''Arthur Goodhart Altschul''' (6 April 1920 – 17 March 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]][http://ssdi.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi Rootsweb.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044629/http://ssdi.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American banker and a [[Goldman Sachs]] Group partner,&lt;ref name=NYTDeathsAltschul&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/classified/paid-notice-deaths-altschul-arthur-goodhart.html Paid Notice: Deaths: Altschul, Arthur Goodhart], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; and executive at his private [[family office]], Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father.&lt;ref name=overbrook/&gt;

==Early life==
Altschul was born in 1920 in [[Manhattan]] to Helen Lehman Goodhart (maternal granddaughter of [[Mayer Lehman]], one of the three founding brothers of Lehman brothers) and [[Frank Altschul]], an investment banker who was a senior partner at [[Lazard Frères]] until 1945 and chairman of General Investors Corporation until he retired in 1961.

He graduated from [[Deerfield Academy]] in Massachusetts and in 1943 from [[Yale College]].

==Career==
He served in the [[USMC|Marines]] from 1943 through 1945 and was a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the late 1940s.

As he had family connections to the [[Lehman family]], he worked as an analyst with [[Lehman Brothers]] before joining [[General American Investors Company]] (a closed-end investment concern in which his family has a substantial interest) and then [[Goldman Sachs]] where he served as a general partner from 1959 to 1977 and a limited partner from 1977 to 1999. He was also chairman of General American Investors from 1961 to 1995.&lt;ref name=NYTBankerCollector&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/20/nyregion/arthur-g-altschul-81-banker-art-collector-and-philanthropist.html|work=The New York Times|title= "Arthur G. Altschul, 81, Banker, Art Collector and Philanthropist"|author=Eric Pace|date= March 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the private [[family office]], Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. In 2002, the office opened to provides asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Over the years, Overbrook’s leadership passed to him, and then to the third generation, his son, Arthur Goodhart Altschul, Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook's Chairman.&lt;ref name=overbrook&gt;[https://www.overbrook.com/default.asp?P=1020720&amp;S=1020722 Our Team] overbrook.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Altschul was on the Board of Trustees of many museums and philanthropic organisations, including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[United Jewish Communities|United Jewish Appeal]], the [[Overbrook Foundation]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[The American Assembly]],&lt;ref name=NYTDeathsAltschul /&gt; and the International Foundation for Art Research.

[[Barnard College]] at its 1984 commencement ceremonies awarded Altschul its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].

'''Avraham Yosef Shapira''' ({{lang-he|אברהם יוסף שפירא}}; born 2 March 1921, died 26 June 2000) was an [[Israel]]i politician and businessman.

==Biography==
Born in Romania in 1921, Shapira attended the Kokhav MeYa'akov [[yeshiva]] in [[Trzebinia]], and was later certified as a teacher. He made [[aliyah]] to Israel in 1949. He began working with his father, a furrier. In 1959 he bought a carpet factory, Carmel Carpets, in [[Or Akiva]]. At its peak the business employed 1,600 employees and had an annual turnover of $500 million.&lt;ref name=G&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/04/guardianobituaries.israel Avraham Shapira: Religious powerbroker of Israel's turbulent politics] The Guardian, 4 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[Agudat Yisrael]], and became chairman of its [[Tel Aviv]] branch. He was elected to the Knesset on the party's list in [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and became chairman of the governing coalition. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], after which he chaired the Finance Committee. He also served as chairman of the [[Bank of Israel]]'s steering committee,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=177 Avraham Yosef Schapira: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; wielding a strong influence on the country's financial state.

He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], but returned to the Knesset in [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992]] (by which time the party had formed the United Torah Judaism alliance with [[Degel HaTorah]]). He lost his seat again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 elections]].

He died in 2000 at the age of 79.

'''Barry Cohen''' [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (3 April 1935 – 18 December 2017) was an Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] politician.  He was a minister in the government of [[Bob Hawke]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born in [[Griffith, New South Wales]] and educated at Griffith High School, [[Sydney Grammar School]] and [[North Sydney Technical High School]]. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the [[Australian National University]]. He was a businessman before entering politics.

He was the federal member for the seat of [[Division of Robertson|Robertson]] from [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] until his retirement before the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]]. Following the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s win under [[Bob Hawke]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]], he was Minister for [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs]] and [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|the Environment]] from 1983 to 1984 and then [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Environment]] until 1987.&lt;ref name=aph&gt;{{cite web

==After politics==
Cohen wrote a number of books on political anecdotes, and an autobiography:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*''From Whitlam to Winston''  (1997)
*''The Almost Complete Gough'' (2001)
*''The Life Of The Party – Political Anecdotes'' (1987)

In 2015, Cohen and three other former MPs brought a case before the [[High Court of Australia]], purporting that reductions to their retirement allowances and limitations on the number of "domestic return trips per year" under the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 were unconstitutional under S51(xxxi) of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. They lost the case in 2016, with the court finding that Parliament was entitled to vary the terms of allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Former MPs lose High Court challenge over entitlements | date=12 Oct 2016 | publisher=ABC News | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-12/high-court-rules-on-entitlements-gold-pass/7924916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cohen voted for the decriminalisation of [[homosexuality]] in the 1970s, he spoke out against gay marriage, arguing that "gay marriage and conventional marriage is [not] the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/commentary/opposing-gay-marriage-doesnt-mean-im-barking/story-e6frgd0x-1226038720460 | first=Barry | last=Cohen | title=Opposing gay marriage doesn't mean I'm barking | date=14 April 2011 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen died on 18 December 2017, having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease several years earlier.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barry Cohen, Hawke government minister and Alzheimer's campaigner, dies|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-18/minister-turned-alzheimers-campaginer-barry-cohen-dies/9268218|accessdate=18 December 2017|work=ABC News|date=18 December 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Cohen was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2007, for service to the Australian Parliament and to the community through a range of cultural and environmental roles and contributions to public discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1134701&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true COHEN, Barry], ''It's an Honour''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basilica of the Immaculate Conception''' is a historic [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[church (building)|church]] in [[Downtown Jacksonville|Downtown]] [[Jacksonville, Florida]], U.S. A parish church in the [[Diocese of St. Augustine]], it represents Jacksonville's oldest Catholic congregation. The current building, dating to 1910, was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992 as the Church of the Immaculate Conception, and was named a [[minor basilica]] in 2013. It is located at 121 East Duval Street; its current pastor is Father Ed Murphy.

==History==
[[File:CIC1901fire.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ruins of the Church of the Immaculate Conception after the [[Great Fire of 1901]].]]
The congregation was established in about 1845 as a [[Catholic mission|mission]] of the Catholic [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah|parish of Savannah]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the first church building was constructed by 1847. Immaculate Conception was designated its own parish in 1854, but the original building was destroyed by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. A second building was planned shortly after Jacksonville became part of the newly created Catholic [[Diocese of St. Augustine]] in 1870, and was completed in 1874. This was destroyed along with most of downtown Jacksonville in the [[Great Fire of 1901]].&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Wood 1992, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current building was designed in 1905 by architect M. H. Hubbard, also the designer of [[Bethel Baptist Institutional Church]]. Construction began in 1907 and completed on December 8, 1910, when the building was dedicated. The structure is an example of [[Late Gothic Revival architecture]], considered one of the best such examples in Florida, featuring a [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform floor plan]], [[pointed arch]]es, [[tracery]] on the windows, [[buttress]]es and [[pinnacle]]s, high [[spire]]s, and a high [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] on the interior. The building's {{convert|178.5|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]], topped by a gold-plated cross, was the highest point in the city for three years until the [[Heard National Bank Building]] was finished in 1913.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

In 1979 the church received ''solemn dedication'', meaning the structure cannot be demolished willfully or converted to another purpose besides a church.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; On December 30, 1992 it was listed in the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Duval/state.html Duval County listings] at [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com National Register of Historic Places]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2005 the church sought designation as a [[minor basilica]] from the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] due to its history. The request was renewed in 2013 by Bishop [[Felipe de Jesús Estévez]] and granted; the designation was announced on August 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= August 15, 2013 |title= Jacksonville's Immaculate Conception named a Minor Basilica |url= http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-08-15/story/jacksonvilles-immaculate-conception-named-minor-basilica |newspaper= The Florida Times-Union |location= |publisher= |accessdate= December 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence ==

Dr. Gilad, with Jan Herring, founded the Academy of Competitive Intelligence in 1996, and in 1999 they joined forces with Leonard Fuld to establish the first accredited professional program in CI.  The academy has experienced great success with a wide variety of students from many varying backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/ftse/About_Competitive_Intelligence.html About Academy of CI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121214732/http://www.academyci.com/ftse/About_Competitive_Intelligence.html |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications and awards ==

=== The Business Intelligence System ===

The Business Intelligence System published in 1988, co-authored with Tamar Gilad, was the first publication to introduce a model for a formal competitive intelligence function to the corporate world.  This model has been adopted by an overwhelming number of large companies in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="ben2"/&gt;

=== Business Blind Spots ===

Business Blind Spots, first published in 1994 with a second edition appearing in 1998, is about the important role of intelligence in a business, and what happens when managers choose to ignore intelligence and allow blind spots to persist.  The book also stresses the importance of the human aspect of intelligent corporations.  In the book, Dr. Gilad maintains that hardware and software are not the solutions to the weakness in corporations; instead the solutions are the application of human-led systems and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infonortics.com/publications/giladbb.html Publisher Web Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224051140/http://www.infonortics.com/publications/giladbb.html |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the first book to introduce the blind spots war game methodology.&lt;ref name="ben2" /&gt; The book was called "inspirational" &lt;ref&gt;http://thoughtblender.blogspot.com/2007_09_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been sold out in weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Albagli, A., W.A Baldwin and K. K. Coker. Book Review. The Journal of Technology Transfer, Vol. 22, No.1, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Warning ===

Early warning, published in 2003, is about limiting surprise in the business world.  The book covers the strategic early warning process model first written about by Dr. Gilad in 2001.&lt;ref name="ben2" /&gt;  It also covers developing a Competitive Early Warning system to avoid such surprises, manage risk effectively, and avoid “industrial dissonance,” which is when market realities outpace corporate strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amanet.org/books/book.cfm?isbn=9780814407868 American Management Association Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Gilad's Early Warning System has been quoted by Philip Kotler as one of the effective tools management can use in managing chaotic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P. and J. Castlione. Chaotics: The Business of Managing and Marketing in the Age of Turbulence. Amacom, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business War Games ===

Business War Games (2009) is both about the theory of, and a practical manual for, running simple, reality-based war games throughout a company, enabling managers at all levels to formulate better strategies.  War games are simulations of competitive dynamics in a business’ given market with the goal of “pressure testing” product, market, or the whole business unit’s strategic plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bengilad.com/business_war_games.php Business War Games Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403025605/http://www.bengilad.com/business_war_games.php |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book shows steps, and practical details, on how to decide whether war gaming is necessary, and which decisions to use it for.  It also covers: how to prepare, run, and organize an inexpensive game, how to predict competitor moves with accuracy and little information, and why one does not need computers, consultants, or specialized software to conduct such games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1601630301 Editorial Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles ===

Dr. Gilad has written multiple articles related to the field of Competitive Intelligence.  These articles appear in multiple CI related publications and on multiple web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/ResourceCenter/#bgart Academy of CI Article List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302093248/http://www.academyci.com/ResourceCenter/#bgart |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===

In 1996 Dr. Gilad was awarded the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] Meritorious Award.  This award is given to a single individual each year that has made significant and meritorious contributions to the competitive intelligence profession.  He was the second of the three Academy of Competitive Intelligence founders to be given the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scip.org/content.cfm?itemnumber=592&amp;navItemNumber=2236 SCIP Meritorious Award Winners List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110202204/http://www.scip.org/content.cfm?itemnumber=592&amp;navItemNumber=2236 |date=November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bunker Hill''' is a historic prominence that traditionally separated [[Downtown Los Angeles]] from the rest of the city to the west before the hill was [[2nd Street Tunnel|tunneled through at Second Street]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discoverlosangeles.com 2012-2013 Official Visitors Map], Los Angeles Tourism &amp; Convention Board, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, the hill was lowered in elevation, and the entire area was redeveloped to supplant old frame and concrete buildings with modern high-rises and other structures for residences, commerce, entertainment, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-angels-landing-20180530-story.html|title=Condos, restaurants, an elementary school. How an 80-story skyscraper could transform Bunker Hill|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Roger |last=Vincent|date=May 30, 2018|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Downtown-LA-1900.jpg|thumb|300px|A view of Bunker Hill, 1900, with [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]] in the foreground]]

===Early development===
In 1867, a wealthy developer, [[Prudent Beaudry]], purchased a majority of the hill's land. Because of the hill's excellent views of the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and the [[Los Angeles River]], he knew that it would make for an opulent subdivision. He developed the peak of Bunker Hill with lavish two-story [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses that became famous as homes for the upper-class residents of Los Angeles. [[Angels Flight]], now dubbed "The World's Shortest Railway", took residents homeward from the bottom of the 33% grade and down again.

Initially a residential suburb, Bunker Hill retained its exclusive character through the end of [[World War I]], but in the face of increased urban growth fed by an extensive streetcar system, its wealthy residents began leaving for enclaves on the Westside and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. Bunker Hill's houses were increasingly subdivided to accommodate renters. Still, Bunker Hill was at this time "Los Angeles's most crowded and urban neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;Mike Davis, "Hollywood's Dark Shadow," in ''Dead Cities and Other Tales'' (New York: The New Press, 2003; orig. ed. 2002), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; By [[World War II]], the [[Pasadena Freeway]], built to bring shoppers downtown, was taking more residents out. Additional postwar freeway construction left downtown comparatively empty of both people and services. The once-grand Victorian mansions of Bunker Hill became the home of impoverished pensioners.&lt;ref&gt;Documentary "Bunker Hill" special feature on the DVD ''[[The Exiles (1961 film)|The Exiles]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project===
In 1955, Los Angeles city planners decided that Bunker Hill required a massive [[slum clearance]] project. The top of Bunker Hill was cleared of its houses and then flattened as the first stage of the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project to populate Bunker Hill with modern plazas and buildings. When the height limit of buildings for Los Angeles was finally raised (previously buildings were limited to 150 feet), developers built some of the tallest skyscrapers in the region to take advantage of the area's existing dense zoning. In approving such projects, the city sought to project a modern, sophisticated image.

The project is the longest redevelopment project in Los Angeles history. The majority of the skyscrapers on Bunker Hill were built in the 1980s, with a new skyscraper or two being finished nearly every year. However, the momentum died down in the 1990s, shortly after the 52-story [[Two California Plaza]] was finished.&lt;ref name="nytimesNov1991"&gt;{{Citation | last = Stevenson | first = Richard W. | title = Office Glut Spreads in California | newspaper = New York Times | date = November 11, 1991 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DD1731F932A25752C1A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the vacancy rate for downtown commercial skyscrapers was 26%, one of the highest in the nation for that time. Planned office towers were canceled, including California Plaza Three,&lt;ref name="LAbusJrnl1993"&gt;{{Citation | last = Berton | first = Brad | title = Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's notice of default suit against Bunker Hill Associates | newspaper = Los Angeles Business Journal | date = April 26, 1993 | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Confusion+greets+Three+Cal+Plaza+default+notice,+some+see+union+tie-a013927656}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby four-towered Metropolis (brought back to life in 2005).

Many of the older buildings and the early high-rises surrounding Bunker Hill are undergoing [[adaptive reuse]] from commercial to residential. This trend began in 2000, when the Los Angeles City Council passed an adaptive reuse ordinance, allowing old unused office buildings to be redeveloped as apartments or "lofts". Developers realized there was a high level of pent-up demand for living in or near downtown by artists and employees of various firms in the [[Financial District, Los Angeles|Financial District]] and government workers in the [[Civic Center, Los Angeles|Civic Center]], and that they could profit by supplying housing to meet such demand.

Because of the popularity of the [[New Urbanism]] in California, the city has required developers to build mixed-use residential buildings as much as possible. This means that the first floor of such residential developments is devoted to commercial retailers, so that residents do not have to constantly drive around for all their shopping trips and buildings present a more welcoming facade to passersby on the sidewalk.

Contributing to the resurgence of Bunker Hill has been the construction of public venues, such as [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] and [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], as well as the [[Colburn School]], a community performing arts school and collegiate conservatory. 

In February 2007, $2.05 billion was approved for the [[Grand Avenue Project]], which over the next 10 years will bring in over 2,000 new residential units, over 400 of them being affordable units for all degrees of [[poverty|low-income]] families; a million square feet (93,000 m²) of office space; a [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]] hotel; 600,000 square feet (56,000 m²) of retail and entertainment space; and the [[Grand Park]], connecting City Hall to Bunker Hill. Office space and residential units will be in several [[skyscraper]]s ranging between 35-55 stories each. Nearby planned projects include [[L.A. Live]] on [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] in [[South Park, Los Angeles|South Park]] (the southern end of the Bunker Hill area). A new major modern art museum, [[The Broad]], opened on September 20, 2015, next to Disney Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-broad-opening-day-20150921-story.html|title=The heat and the lines couldn't keep them from the Broad on opening day|first=Deborah|last=Vankin|date=21 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Angels Flight]] tramway, which was rebuilt in 1996 near where it was originally located and shut down after a fatal accident in 2001, reopened on March 15, 2010, to provide a link between Bunker Hill and the revitalized downtown area. One sign of the success of the downtown renaissance is that the office vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 16%, compared to 19% for 2003, and 26% for 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Roger (13 February 2014) [http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/13/business/la-fi-property-report-20140213 "With sale of Two California Plaza, Bunker Hill is poised for comeback"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mix of housing options===
While developers are primarily building market-rate housing on Bunker Hill today, the City of Los Angeles has very strict laws, rules, and ordinances established that promote the inclusion of all income levels into the residential mix. Some examples include incentives for the creation of affordable housing (rather than market-rate housing), the preservation of existing affordable housing, the development of affordable housing by the city itself (rather than waiting for private developers), and others. The city has written documentation regarding the development of affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacity.org/lahd/curriculum/index.html http://www.lacity.org/lahd/curriculum/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216051527/http://www.lacity.org/lahd/curriculum/index.html |date=February 16, 2005 }} ''lacity.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the topic of building affordable housing for very low-income to moderate-income, Principal City Planner Jane Blumenfeld said, "We are trying to make it attractive to build [downtown] and get this added affordable housing that we normally wouldn't have. We need an adequate amount of lower income housing so that in 20 years Downtown doesn't become an exclusive neighborhood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2005/03/28/news/news02.txt http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2005/03/28/news/news02.txt]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''downtownnews.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emerson apartment building, owned by the [[Related Companies]], has 271 units, of which 216 are leased at market rates. The other 55 units are at subsidized rates to tenants whose annual incomes are less than 50% of the local median, which was $42,700 for a family of four in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Roger (October 1, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-property-report-emerson-20141002-story.html "Developer of new Bunker Hill apartment high-rise woos older residents"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Radio===
On "[[The Adventures of Philip Marlowe]]" radio program with episode named "Baton Sinister" dated September 17, 1949, Angels Flight is referenced as Marlowe has a rendezvous set in Bunker Hill.

===Film===
In the 1940s and 1950s, Bunker Hill was a popular film setting, especially in the [[film noir]] genre, because of its Victorian homes, its rambling hillside apartments and flophouses, its [[Angels Flight]] funicular, and its mean (or at least mean-looking) streets.&lt;ref&gt;LA Downtown News [http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/will-angels-flight-ever-roll-again/article_f99ee604-bc49-11e3-abe6-0019bb2963f4.html Will Angels Flight Ever Roll Again?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;tumblr.

Bunker Hill was a destination of many local artists and photographers, some in its heyday, others as it was being demolished and rebuilt. Among the latter was the Los Angeles photographer [[Ray McSavaney]].  

[[Angels Flight]] and its Third Street neighborhood, c. 1930s, were re-created in South Africa for the filming of ''[[Ask the Dust (film)|Ask the Dust]]'' (2006), based on the novel by [[John Fante]], which was set in the district in the 1930s. Fante also wrote a book called ''Dreams From Bunker Hill,'' his last novel, dictated near death to his wife.

The [[2nd Street Tunnel]] under Bunker Hill is widely used in film and advertising.

===Music===
Bunker Hill is also the title of (and referenced in) the 1992 song from the ''[[Free-for-All (Michael Penn album)|Free-for-All]]'' album by Angeleno transplant [[Michael Penn]] and a [[B-Side|B-side]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. [[Jim Dawson]]'s 2008 book ''[[Angels Flight]]'' includes several chapters, complete with many dozens of early photos, on Bunker Hill and its literary and film background.

===Books===
Bunker Hill is the setting for much of [[Robin Robertson]]'s 2018 verse narrative ''The Long Take'' which won the 2018 [[Goldsmiths Prize]]. The book includes a map of the old Bunker Hill neighbourhood.

===Other media===
It is represented in the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' as "Pillbox Hill" ("Pillbox" and "Bunker" being similar) in the game's rendition of Los Angeles as Los Santos.

'''Busy work''' (also referred to as '''make-work''' and '''busywork''') can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value.  Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as "work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork|title=Definition of BUSYWORK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational settings==
In the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills [[Learning|learned]] in the educational setting.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"&gt;(1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n2BMAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plans for busy work - Boston Primary Teachers' Association - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can consist of various types of [[schoolwork]] assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;

Busy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;  This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in [[primary education]], but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=475 |chapter=Busy work |author=[[Paul Monroe]] |title=A Cyclopedia of Education |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busy work has historical precedent in [[primary education]]. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.

==Business and work settings==
[[File:Lightmatter paperwork.jpg|thumb|The constant processing of [[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]] can be a form of busy work, particularly in situations when it is a lower priority compared to other tasks.]]
In business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an ''appearance'' of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid [[termination of employment|termination]] or sanctions).&lt;ref name="Slack"&gt;(2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3AuP7HV14SYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency - Tom DeMarco - Google Books &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2012/01/19/why-busy-work-doesnt-work/ | title=Why Busy Work Doesn't Work | publisher=Forbes Magazine | date=January 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kotter, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.

==Military settings==
Busy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle.  Tasks of this sort include [[military parade|drill]], memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, [[spit and polish]]ing footwear and other cleaning chores such as [[holystone|scrubbing the deck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=356 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America: The War of Independence and antebellum expansion and reform, 1763-1861 |author=Randall M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">'''Contract B''' is a concept in Canadian law.
A '''Contract B''' is formed when an Owner formally accepts a Bid or, colloquially, a submission of price.  Only a single Contract B is formed between the Owner and the successful bidder.  Tied to the concept of [[Contract A]], '''Contract B''' is a place holder in the concept, a marker at the end of a formalized process of equitable treatment of both bidders and owners&lt;ref&gt;Government Procurement, Fourth Edition, by Paul Emanuelli, p. 125, Published by Lexis Nexis Canada, Year of Publication: 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-433-47454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In many ways it is more of an academic detail within the Contract A - Contract B concept, but can also be thought of as a label for the actual construction contract.

The '''Critics Adult Film Association''' (CAFA) was a [[New York City|New York]]-based group of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] adult sex [[Film criticism|film critics]], which bestowed [[award]]s upon those working in [[pornographic film]] during the 1980s. The awards were first presented in 1981, honoring the movies of the previous year. ''Talk Dirty to Me,'' a sex [[comedy film|comedy]] starring [[John Leslie (pornographic actor)|John Leslie]], who won Best Actor, was voted best film of 1980. [[Samantha Fox (actress)|Samantha Fox]] was the first Best Actress, winning for her role in ''This Lady Is A Tramp,'' another sex comedy.

''[[Amanda By Night]]'', an adult [[Crime film|crime-drama]] and ''Roommates'', also a drama, would become CAFA's most-honored movies, with the latter being presented with seven awards in 1983, including Best Director ([[Chuck Vincent (director)|Chuck Vincent]]) and Best [[Actress]] ([[Veronica Hart]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Film Journal'' Volume 87, Pubsun Corp., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amanda By Night'' scooped six awards the previous year in a ceremony "held at the famed [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]":&lt;ref name="stagerotic8208"&gt;"1981 Adult Film Critics Awards", ''Porn Stars: The Stag Erotic Series'' Vol. 3 No. 4, July/August 1982, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Best Film, Best Actress (Hart), Best [[Supporting actor|Supporting Actress]] ([[Lisa De Leeuw]]), Best Director ([[Gary Graver|Robert McCallum]]), Best [[Screenplay]] and Best Editing.

The CAFA and [[Adult Film Association of America]] awards were considered the major adult film awards of the [[Golden Age of Porn]]. By 1985, sex news magazine ''Cheri'' declared: "Held at the Silver Lining, a snazzy little [[bistro]] on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]'s Restaurant Row, the fifth-annual Critics Adult Film Awards was a gentle reminder that porn films can be measured against standards other than the [[Penile plethysmograph|Peter Meter]]."&lt;ref name="cheri1085"&gt;"CAFA Capers: The N.Y. Critics Salute Porndom's Finest", ''Cheri Magazine'', October 1985, pp. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh CAFA Awards were presented May 27, 1987 in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711"&gt;Will H. Jarvis, "The 7th Annual CAFA Awards: The X-rated stars cum out at night!", ''Cinema Blue'' magazine, Vol. 4, No. 8, November 1987, pp. 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The association seems to have faded away after that, as did the New York-based adult film industry, overtaken by the [[X-Rated Critics Organization]] and its [[XRCO Award|Heart-On Awards]], which had first been presented two years earlier and which were based in California, the new centre of porn production.

In 1986 all three awards programs chose the same Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress.&lt;ref name="stag1286"&gt;Bill Bottiggi, "The 10th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Stag'' magazine, December 1986, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAFA Awards ==
The [[Trophy|trophies]] were called the Critics Adult Film Award and each was inscribed with the year the award was being given for, on a gold-plated round icon with decorative edges on a wooden base.&lt;ref name="spelvin-cafa"&gt;Photo [http://voices.yahoo.com/image/592220/index.html?cat=49 (enlarged)] accompanying [http://voices.yahoo.com/an-interview-porn-star-icon-georgina-3431958.html?cat=49 "An Interview with Porn Star Icon Georgina Spelvin"] by Charles Shea LeMone, June 8, 2009. Retrieved 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''Cinema Blue'' magazine described the voting as a two-stage process: "CAFA President Jack Shugg and officers Steffani Martin, Colette Connor and Will H. Jarvis, aided and abetted by the members of CAFA...mail out two ballots to the New York porn critics. On the first ballot, the critics make five choices for best movies and performers in each category. (This year, any film or video released between January 1, 1986 and February 28, 1987 was eligible.) The ballots are then mailed back and the officers and their assistants count them. The choices with the most votes are then listed on a second ballot and again mailed to the critics who make one final choice in each category. These votes are once again tabulated and the movie or performer in each category with the most votes becomes the winner."&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;

Winners are listed below by the year in which the awards presentation was held, not by year the award was for, which was the previous year.

=== Other Categories ===
Like the [[Academy Awards]], CAFA also honored the best in various production categories. For example, at the awards show held in 1985, ''Every Woman Has a Fantasy'' scooped up [[cinematography]] and music awards, ''Raw Talent'' polished off top honors for editing prowess and Sandy Amsterdam's production design and ''Talk DIrty to Me III'' netted make-up and costuming kudos for [[Traci Lords]]' mermaid tail.&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt;

However, unlike the Academy Awards, CAFA also presented awards in categories specific to the pornographic movie industry, such as Best Group Scene, bestowed in 1987 to ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones#The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning|The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning]]'' with [[Vanessa del Rio]] and seven studs.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VdR-blog" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dian Hanson and Vanessa del Rio, [http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/sex/reading_room/175.thats_slut_with_a_capital_s.5.htm "That's 'Slut' with a capital 'S' "], Taschen Books. Retrieved 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of pornography on video, a Best Adult Video award was created, won by [[Candida Royalle]] for ''Urban Heat''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Eve, [http://www.dreve.co.za/shop/femme-productions-–dvd.html "Femme Productions – DVD"]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 and ''Christine's Secret'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;

The annual [[Gerard Damiano]] Special Achievement Award, named after the producer, writer and director of the [[1972 in film|1972]] cult classic ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', went to actress [[Georgina Spelvin]] in 1982,&lt;ref name="stagerotic8208" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spelvin-cafa" /&gt; Erica Eaton, publicist and former CAFA chairperson, in 1985&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt; and [[Gloria Leonard]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exfg8801" /&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|byron|1}}There is a discrepancy as to which movie(s) Tom Byron won for in 1985. ''Cheri'' magazine states "He managed to walk off with Best Actor (for ''Sister Dearest'') and Best Supporting Actor (''Talk Dirty To Me III'')".&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt; Internet Adult Film Database founder Peter Van Aarle lists ''Private Teacher'' as his Best Actor win and ''Sister Dearest'' as his Best Supporting Actor award.&lt;ref name="rame" /&gt;

{{note|snake|2}} In the book ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide II'', author [[Robert Rimmer]] states, "In May 1987, the CAFA (a New York film critics group) gave ''Snake Eyes II'' awards for Best Script (Anne Randall), Best Actor (Jerry Butler, who also received it for the original ''Snake Eyes''), and Best Director (Cecil Howard)."&lt;ref name="Rimmer"&gt;Robert H. Rimmer, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/087975673X/ref=sib_dp_ptu#reader-link ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide II''], p. 522. Prometheus Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-87975-673-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this seems unlikely as ''Snake Eyes II'' was not released until 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0191473|''Snake Eyes II''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iafd"&gt;Data for ''Snake Eyes 2'' was taken from the [http://www.iafd.com/title.rme/title=snake+eyes+2/year=1987/snake-eyes-2.htm Internet Adult Film Database].&lt;/ref&gt; and it contradicts two other sources that list Butler and Howard winning in 1987 for ''Star Angel'' and no category called Best Script.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exfg8801" /&gt; Possibly ''Snake Eyes II'' won the following year, however, there doesn't seem to be a record of whether any awards were held in 1988.

In 2012 De Rubertis spearheaded the launch of Index Ventures’ $200 Million life sciences fund in partnership with [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (J&amp;J), to invest in early-stage biotechnology companies

De Rubertis is the author of several publications in international scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar search: "Francesco De Rubertis"|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Francesco+De+Rubertis%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 De Rubertis was named by ''BioWorld'' as one of 28 "movers and shakers" predicted to shape the biotechnology industry over the next two decades
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Future Is Here: Who Will Shape Biotech Over the Next 20 Years? BioWorld Says…|url= http://www.bioworld.com/img/BIO20.pdf|work= BioWorld 20th Anniversary Edition|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2012 De Rubertis was named by ''[[Xconomy]]'' as one of 40 of “Young and Proven” biotech venture capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Who Will Survive the Biotech VC Downturn? The Young and the Proven|url= http://www.xconomy.com/national/2012/10/22/who-will-survive-the-biotech-vc-downturn-the-young-and-the-proven/|work= [[Xconomy]]|date= October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Rubertis is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board of the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicxi.com/team/francesco-de-rubertis|title=Medicxi Partner bio: Francesco De Rubertis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 De Rubertis launches an independent venture capital firm Medicxi (formerly Index Ventures Life Sciences) and announces the closing of Medicxi Ventures 1 (MV1) a €210m fund including GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicxi.com/news/medicxi-formerly-index-ventures-life-sciences-launches-as-an-independent-venture-capital-firm-and-announces-closing-of-a-210m-fund-including-gsk-and-johnson-johnson-innovation|title=Medicxi Ventures, Formerly Index Ventures Life Sciences, Launches as an Independent Venture Capital Firm and Announces Closing of a €210m Fund including GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation {{!}} Medicxi|website=www.medicxi.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicxi is managed by four Partners Francesco de Rubertis, Kevin Johnson, David Grainger and Michèle Ollier all of whom previously led the Life Sciences practice at Index Ventures.

On November 30, 2017 De Rubertis was named in the Bloomberg Top 50 most influential people of 2017. He was selected as one of 10 nominees in the Tech (&amp; Science) category along with Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), Masayoshi Son (Softbank Group) and Martin Lau (Tencent Holdings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-bloomberg-50/|title=Meet This Year’s Bloomberg 50|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bloomberg Top 50 consists of 5 categories Tech (&amp; Science), Business, Politics, Finance and Entertainment.

De Rubertis’s reputation for halving the time it takes for a return on biotech investments has Silicon Valley eager to get in on a $300 million fund he’s raised for late-stage startups.

Medicxi Growth 1, which made its first investments in health care and diabetes treatments, is taking minority stakes in companies that are developing multiple therapies, have full management teams, and intend to go public as independent businesses. This is a departure for De Rubertis. He has focused on “skinny” startups—with small management teams and only one therapy—that can integrate into larger companies after being bought. The shift hasn’t diminished interest in the fund. Verily, Alphabet Inc.’s life-sciences arm, has also invested in MG-1

'''[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Gregorio Soriano Araneta''' (born ''' Gregorio Araneta y Soriano'''; April 16, 1869 – May 9, 1930) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[lawyer]], [[businessman]], [[nationalist]] and [[patriotism|patriot]], during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish]] and [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American colonial periods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhi.gov.ph/downloads/fihgov0012.pdf | title=Gregorio S. Araneta | work=National Historical Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
In 1891, he graduated from the [[University of Santo Tomas]] with a degree in law. He defended prominent Filipinos accused of financially supporting the [[Katipunan]].

In May 1898, Araneta was appointed member of the 21-man Consultative Assembly, which the Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] [[Basilio Agustin]] formed in an attempt to rally Filipinos to the Spanish side of the [[Spanish–American War]]. This assembly, however, failed.

===Aguinaldo's Cabinet===
Araneta participated in the drafting of the [[Malolos Constitution]]. He resigned as Secretary and accepted his appointment as Justice of the Ministry of Justice.

===Supreme Court===
On January 25, 1899, the Diplomatic Corps of the [[First Philippine Republic]] was organized and Araneta was among those appointed as member but he chose to abandon the revolutionary government. Months after the [[Philippine–American War]] broke out, America established the civil courts in the Philippines. In May 1899, General [[Elwell Otis]] appointed Araneta as Associate Justice of the [[Philippine Supreme Court]], the youngest to occupy the position at 30 years old. Araneta's sympathies became clearer when he joined the [[Federal Party (Philippines)|Federal Party]] that favored America’s annexation of the Philippines.

===Bureau of Justice===
On June 15, 1901, he was appointed [[Solicitor General (Philippines)|Solicitor General]]. When Attorney General Libbeus R. Wifley accepted a post in China, Araneta was made his successor. He took his oath of office as Attorney General on July 16, 1906. Two years after, July 1, 1908, he was appointed to the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] and at the same time Secretary of Justice and Finance. He was the first Filipino to hold a sensitive post, being a commissioner with portfolio. He resigned from government service on October 10, 1913. With Salvador Zaragoza, he established a law office, which attracted many clients.

==Later career==
During the [[Philippine Senate elections, 1916|first Senatorial election in 1916]], he ran for a seat in the Senate but lost to [[Rafael Palma]]. That same year, he accepted a teaching post in the [[University of Santo Tomas]] and at the same attended to his private law practice. Araneta convinced the Supreme Court to reverse its previous decision on two cases. Araneta also gained respect for his ethical principles.{{CN|date=March 2015}} He turned down the offer of House Speaker [[Sergio Osmeña]] to seat as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in favor of [[Manuel Araullo]], who he thought to be more deserving for the post. He was again offered the same position during the time of Senate President [[Manuel Luis Quezon]] but he also declined, this time for ''[[delicadeza]]'', because he was then involved in a case pending before the Supreme Court.

==Personal life==
Araneta married [[Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas]] on March 7, 1896. The couple had 14 children: Carmen, Jose, Salvador, Consuelo, Paz, Rosa, Antonio, Teresa, Ramon, Vicente, Conchita, Margarita, Luis and Francisco.

==Death==
He died on May 9, 1930 of [[myocardial infarction]].

{{Strategy}}
The '''growth–share matrix''' (aka the '''product portfolio matrix''',&lt;ref name="Product Portfolio"/&gt; '''Boston Box''', '''BCG-matrix''', '''Boston matrix''', '''[[Boston Consulting Group]] analysis''', '''portfolio diagram''') is a chart that was created by [[Bruce D. Henderson]] for the [[Boston Consulting Group]] in 1970 to help corporations to analyze their business units, that is, their [[product line]]s. This helps the company allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in [[brand|brand marketing]], [[product management]], [[strategic management]], and [[Modern portfolio theory|portfolio analysis]]. Some analysis of market performance by firms using its principles has called its usefulness into question.

== Overview ==
To use the chart, analysts plot a [[scatter graph]] to rank the business units (or products) on the basis of their relative [[market share]]s and growth rates.   
*'''''[[Cash cow]]s''''' is where a company has high market share in a slow-growing industry.  These units typically generate cash in excess of the amount of cash needed to maintain the business.  They are regarded as staid and boring, in a "mature" market, yet corporations value owning them due to their cash-generating qualities.  They are to be "milked" continuously with as little investment as possible, since such investment would be wasted in an industry with low growth.
*'''''Dogs''''',  more charitably called ''pets'',  are units with low market share in a mature, slow-growing industry.  These units typically "break even", generating barely enough cash to maintain the business's market share.  Though owning a break-even unit provides the social benefit of providing jobs and possible synergies that assist other business units, from an accounting point of view such a unit is worthless, not generating cash for the company.  They depress a profitable company's [[return on assets]] ratio, used by many investors to judge how well a company is being managed.  ''Dogs'', it is thought, should be sold off.
*'''''Question marks''''' (also known as '''problem children''' or '''Wild cats''') are businesses operating with a low market share in a high-growth market. They are a starting point for most businesses. Question marks have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If question marks do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. Question marks must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share.
*'''''Stars''''' are units with a high market share in a fast-growing industry.  They are graduated ''question marks'' with a market- or niche-leading trajectory, for example:  amongst market share front-runners in a high-growth sector, and/or having a [[monopolistic]] or increasingly dominant [[USP (marketing)|unique selling proposition]] with burgeoning/fortuitous [[proposition (value)|proposition]] drive(s) from:  novelty (e.g. [[Last.FM upon CBS Interactive's due diligence]]), fashion/promotion (e.g. newly prestigious [[List of celebrity-branded fragrances|celebrity-branded fragrance]]s), [[customer loyalty]] (e.g. [[greenfield (investment)|greenfield]] or [[military]]/[[gang enforcement]] backed, and/or innovative, [[grey-market]]/[[illicit retail of addictive drugs]], for instance the British East India Company's, late-1700s opium-based Qianlong Emperor embargo-busting, [[Canton System]]), [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] (e.g. [[Monopsony|monopsonies]]) and/or [[leverage (finance)|gearing]] (e.g. [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], for instance [[Portland cement producer]]s near [[boomtown]]s),{{citation needed| date= December 2013| pending= I have an authoritative cutting filed/to-bring, from FT or Economist as I recall.}} etc.  The hope is that stars become next cash cows.
:Stars require high funding to fight competitors and maintain their growth rate.  When industry growth slows, if they remain a niche leader or are amongst the market leaders, stars become cash cows; otherwise, they become dogs due to low relative market share.
As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either ''cash cows'' or ''dogs''. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as ''question marks'', then turn into ''stars''. Eventually, the market stops growing; thus, the business unit becomes a ''cash cow''. At the end of the cycle, the cash cow turns into a ''dog''.

As BCG stated in 1970:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Only a diversified company with a balanced portfolio can use its strengths to truly capitalize on its growth opportunities.  The balanced portfolio has:
*stars whose high share and high growth assure the future;
*cash cows that supply funds for that future growth; and
*question marks to be converted into stars with the added funds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Practical use==
"''To be successful, a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares. The portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows. High growth products require cash inputs to grow. Low growth products should generate excess cash. Both kinds are needed simultaneously.''"—Bruce Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Bruce|title=The Product Portfolio|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/classics/strategy_the_product_portfolio/|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each product or service, the 'area' of the circle represents the value of its sales. The growth–share matrix thus offers a "map" of the organization's product (or service) strengths and weaknesses, at least in terms of current profitability, as well as the likely cashflows.

The need which prompted this idea was, indeed, that of managing cash-flow. It was reasoned that one of the main indicators of cash generation was relative market share, and one which pointed to cash usage was that of market growth rate.

===Relative market share===
This indicates likely cash generation, because the higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of 'economies of scale' (a basic assumption of the BCG Matrix), it is assumed that these earnings will grow faster the higher the share. The exact measure is the brand's share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization's brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows. If this technique is used in practice, this scale is logarithmic, not linear.

On the other hand, exactly what is a high relative share is a matter of some debate. The best evidence is that the most stable position (at least in [[fast-moving consumer goods]] markets) is for the brand leader to have a share double that of the second brand, and triple that of the third. Brand leaders in this position tend to be very stable—and profitable; the Rule of 123.

The selection of the relative market share metric was based upon its relationship to the experience curve. The market leader would have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, Geoff.[http://www.business-portfolio-analysis.com/the-bcg-matrix-and-the-experience-curve/ "BCG Matrix and the Experience Curve"] Guide to the BCG Matrix&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason for choosing relative market share, rather than just profits, is that it carries more information than just cash flow. It shows where the brand is positioned against its main competitors, and indicates where it might be likely to go in the future. It can also show what type of marketing activities might be expected to be effective. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Market growth rate===
Rapidly growing  in rapidly growing markets, are what organizations strive for; but, as we have seen, the penalty is that they are usually net cash users – they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being 'bought' by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, Geoff.[http://www.business-portfolio-analysis.com/free-excel-template-download-of-the-bcg-matrix/how-to-guide/the-bcg-matrix-where-to-draw-the-line/ "BCG Matrix: Where to Draw the Line?"] Guide to the BCG Matrix&lt;/ref&gt; Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth–share matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from [[fast-moving consumer goods]] markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in BCG Matrix work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
Where it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market's strength, of its future potential (of its 'maturity' in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis.

===Critical evaluation===
While theoretically useful, and widely used, several academic studies have called into question whether using the growth–share matrix actually helps businesses succeed, and the model has since been removed from some major marketing textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share http://cogprints.org/5196/1/myth_of_market_share.pdf See discussion on page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Effects%20of%20portfolio%20planning%20methods-empirical%20results.pdf | title = Effects of portfolio planning methods on decision making: experimental results | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Roderick J. Brodie | journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–84 | year = 1994 | publisher = Science Direct | doi = 10.1016/0167-8116(94)90035-3 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100620225128/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Effects%20of%20portfolio%20planning%20methods-empirical%20results.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study ([http://jom.sagepub.com/content/18/4/717.abstract Slater and  Zwirlein, 1992]) which looked at 129 firms found that those who follow portfolio planning models like the BCG matrix had lower shareholder returns.

There are further criticisms to the B.C.G Matrix. The Matrix assumes that dogs have low market share and relatively low market growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duica|first=Andrea|date=July 2014`|title=The rise and fall of B.C.G. Matrix|url=http://conferinta.management.ase.ro/archives/2014/pdf/13.pdf|journal=PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE|volume=1|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be challenged as there are several dogs on the market which are very profitable and retain significant market share. BIC razor blades are a modern day example. BIC Razor Blades cost the firm an average of £0.05 to produce and have a retail selling price of £2.43.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191456/Sharp-practice-The-razor-heads-cost-just-5p-make-sell-2-43-each.html|title=The razor heads that cost just 5p to make, but sell for £2.43 each|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market is to expand by 25% annually for the next 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/23/gillette-shaving-club-wars/|title=Gillette is clawing back market share from the shaving clubs|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates how the B.C.G Matrix contradicts itself as a dog with little cash usage has considerably high market share within the market.

===Misuse===
As originally practiced by the [[Boston Consulting Group]],&lt;ref name="fut"&gt;[http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9435.htm the Rule of 123] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003100819/http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9435.htm |date=2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a portfolio composition as a function of the balance between cash flows.&lt;ref name="Product Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Bruce D.|title=The Product Portfolio|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/classics/strategy_the_product_portfolio/|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else—and is often what most students, and practitioners, remember.

This is unfortunate,{{according to whom|date=August 2013}} since such simplistic use contains at least two major problems:

*'Minority applicability'. The cashflow techniques are only applicable to a very limited number of markets (where growth is relatively high, and a definite pattern of product life-cycles can be observed, such as that of ethical pharmaceuticals). In the majority of markets, use may give misleading results.
*'Milking cash cows'. Perhaps the worst implication of the later developments is that the (brand leader) cash cows should be milked to fund new brands. This is not what research into the [[fast-moving consumer goods]] markets has shown to be the case. The brand leader's position is the one, above all, to be defended, not least since brands in this position will probably outperform any number of newly launched brands. Such brand leaders will, of course, generate large cash flows; but they should not be 'milked' to such an extent that their position is jeopardized. In any case, the chance of the new brands achieving similar brand leadership may be slim—certainly far less than the popular perception of the Boston Matrix would imply.

Perhaps the most important danger&lt;ref name="fut"/&gt; is, however, that the apparent implication of its four-quadrant form is that there should be balance of products or services across all four quadrants; and that is, indeed, the main message that it is intended to convey. Thus, money must be diverted from 'cash cows' to fund the 'stars' of the future, since 'cash cows' will inevitably decline to become 'dogs'. There is an almost mesmeric inevitability about the whole process. It focuses attention, and funding, on to the 'stars'. It presumes, and almost demands, that 'cash cows' will turn into 'dogs'.
 
The reality is that it is only the 'cash cows' that are really important—all the other elements are supporting actors. It is a foolish vendor who diverts funds from a 'cash cow' when these are needed to extend the life of that 'product'. Although it is necessary to recognize a 'dog' when it appears (at least before it bites you) it would be foolish in the extreme to create one in order to balance up the picture. The vendor, who has most of his (or her) products in the 'cash cow' quadrant, should consider himself (or herself) fortunate indeed, and an excellent marketer, although he or she might also consider creating a few stars as an insurance policy against unexpected future developments and, perhaps, to add some extra growth.  There is also a common misconception that 'dogs' are a waste of resources.  In many markets 'dogs' can be considered loss-leaders that while not themselves profitable will lead to increased sales in other profitable areas.

===Alternatives===
As with most marketing techniques, there are a number of alternative offerings vying with the growth–share matrix although this appears to be the most widely used. The next most widely reported technique is that developed by McKinsey and General Electric, which is a three-cell by three-cell matrix—using the dimensions of 'industry attractiveness' and 'business strengths'. This approaches some of the same issues as the growth–share matrix but from a different direction and in a more complex way (which may be why it is used less, or is at least less widely taught). A more practical approach is that of the [[Boston Consulting Group's Advantage Matrix]], which the consultancy reportedly used itself though it is little known amongst the wider population.

==Other uses==
The initial intent of the growth–share matrix was to evaluate business units, but the same evaluation can be made for [[product line]]s or any other cash-generating entities.  This should only be attempted for real lines that have a sufficient history to allow some prediction; if the corporation has made only a few products and called them a product line, the [[sample variance]] will be too high for this sort of analysis to be meaningful.

==Career==
Leonard began as a cost accountant in [[Washington, D.C.]] and later moved into the film industry.&lt;ref name="McG84"&gt;McGilligan, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst his notable clients were [[James Garner]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].&lt;ref name="Broadcasting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Broadcasting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjgoAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 January 2011|year=1965|publisher=Cahners Pub.

Patrick McGilligan, who wrote a 1999 biography of Eastwood, describes Leonard as follows:

{{quotation|"During the ebb and flow of agents, Leonard and [[Frank Wells]] took over the negotiating of Clint's contracts. Together they pioneered unique clauses, including structuring Clint's earnings to avoid paying undue taxes.... Leonard was someone in the Eastwood family tradition who stressed savings, prudent investment and long-range consolidation. He specialized in creating trust and pension funds for his clients. And above all, Leonard was wily about devising imaginative contract perks and bonuses - the perdiems and extras that would increasingly be seen by Clint as indispensable icing on the cake. Leonard's clients were expected to turn over their entire salary cheques to him and let him handle one hundred percent of their business transactions. Notoriously frugal, he then doled out personal allowances to clients that were strictly enforced... And he [Eastwood] loved the fact that Leonard was a pit bull about money, more of a tightwad than him"&lt;ref name="McG104"/&gt;}} 

Leonard died shortly before Christmas 1969, aged 53.&lt;ref name="McG177"/&gt; Friends of Eastwood say he was never as devastated in his life as to when he heard the news of Leonard's passing.&lt;ref name="McG177"/&gt; Leonard had employed two bookkeepers, Roy Kaufman and Howard Berstein, who after his death formed a new entity, Kaufman and Bernstein Inc., and continued to handle Eastwood's portfolio.&lt;ref name="McG177"/&gt;

But in 1983, he accepted his dad's invitation to return to the family business, joining the company as an entry-level management trainee. After working many different management jobs in just about every area of the company, and earning his master's degree in business along the way, Jim became chairman in 1991 and also took over as advertising spokesperson, appearing in humorous TV commercials.

'''Ken Davy''' (born 1941) is an English businessman. He is the chairman of the [[rugby league]] club [[Huddersfield Giants]] and former chairman of  [[Premier League]] football club [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

==Career==
Davy grew up in [[Filey]] on the East Coast of Yorkshire. He left school at 15 with no academic qualifications and worked as a photographer for [[P&amp;O Cruises|P&amp;O]]. At 21 he set up a commercial photography business in [[Huddersfield]] before joining [[Abbey Life]] in 1971. In 1979 he formed the independent financial advice company DBS, which he sold in June 2001, for £75&amp;nbsp;million. In 2003, he set up SimplyBiz, providing development, research and marketing services to financial advisers.

In 2011, he gave his views on the changes happening in the financial services industry "Restricted advice will prove much less attractive than many organisations believe. I can see why life insurers would be attracted to it, because it is a way of increasing their profits, but it does nothing for consumers or advisers."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/mm-profile-ken-davy/ retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later launched a national Restricted (rather than Independent) advice firm - ''Sandringham Partners'' in 2012, backed by £2m from SimplyBiz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/ken-davy-unveils-sandringham-financial-partners/  retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huddersfield Giants==
In 1996, Davy took over as chairman of Huddersfield Giants rugby league club. In 1999, he merged Huddersfield Giants with [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield Eagles]], a move which resulted in the formation of the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants. It was an unpopular move with supporters, and after one season the club reverted to being the Huddersfield Giants.

During Davy's chairmanship Huddersfield Giants played [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in the [[2006 Challenge Cup|2006]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final at [[Twickenham Stadium]], [[London]]. It was the first time that the Giants had reached the final since 1962. Also during Davy's chairmanship, Giants won the League Leaders Shield for the first time in 81 years, after a 40-0 victory over [[Wakefield Trinity|Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]].

==Huddersfield Town==
Davy led the successful consortium, out of three interested, that took over Huddersfield Town in 2003, when they were in administration following the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] and Town's recent relegation to [[the Football League]]'s [[Football League Third Division|bottom tier]]. As part of the takeover Huddersfield Town's 40% share in the ground was transferred to a holding company, Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd. Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd holds a 60% stake in the Huddersfield ground with the combined original stakes of the football and rugby club, the other 40% stake is owned by Kirklees Council.

In September 2006, he was criticised for failing to offer Town a significant transfer budget for the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season]] to enable the club to build on their play-off position of the previous season. The budget, which was unspecified, was (according to former manager [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]]) already used up on signing just two players, [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Matt Glennon]] and [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Luke Beckett]] despite the release of several players. However, Davy stated that Jackson was given the opportunity to strengthen his squad in order to mount a drive for promotion. This was not utilised and Jackson's "inability to attract key players" was one of the reasons given by Davy for the manager's dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/huddersfield_town/6422635.stm "Huddersfield sack manager Jackson"], [[BBC Sport]], 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After Huddersfield's 2–3 loss to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 16 September 2006, he addressed a peaceful demonstration of around 100 Town fans who had called for him to up the transfer budget or go, because of Town's poor start to the season in [[Football League One]], in which they only picked up nine points from the first nine games.

On 3 June 2009, he handed over the chairmanship to [[Dean Hoyle]] and, after a brief period of retaining a minority shareholding, relinquished all ownership in Huddersfield Town.&lt;ref name="TeamTalk"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105062245/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1822_3406615,00.html "Hoyle to be Terriers chairman"], [[TEAMtalk]], retrieved 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the [[University of Huddersfield]] and an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simplybizgroup.co.uk/about-us/ken-davy/ retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Word of note, the authenticity of Creed is dubious at best; the below claims are made by the manufacturer alone and not confirmed by any sources. The oldest Creed bottle found dates from 1975 and perfume collectors agree that Creed, as a perfume house, does not predate 1970.

The term '''Marketing research mix''' (or the "MR Mix") was created in 2004 and published in 2007 (Bradley - see references). It was designed as a framework to assist researchers to design or evaluate marketing research studies.  The name was deliberately chosen to be similar to the [[Marketing mix|Marketing Mix]] - it also has four Ps. Unlike the marketing mix these elements are sequential and they match the main phases that need to be followed. These four Ps are: Purpose; Population; Procedure and Publication.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the research is the reason why it is being done. The word “purpose” is useful because it has a wide coverage. It can be specifically defined or it can be loosely explained. The wide term also embraces studies to gather marketing intelligence, where the manager’s role is to scan the environment for useful data, and there may be no specific objective.

Many marketers avoid the term hypothesis entirely and tend to use the words “research objective” or “aim”. The word hypothesis (plural, hypotheses) is quite different from the terms mentioned above. It is an essential starting point for quantitative researchers, but takes a lesser role for qualitative researchers.  The term is deeply rooted in the history of scientific thought. In statistics we expend much time and energy to generate hypotheses, to test hypotheses, and to reject them.  Some people argue that we should only test one hypothesis; others say we should test several. In hypothesis testing we create a statement, which may be true or false, this statement is a "proposition" - we propose that something may be the case.   If it is right then we accept it.  If it is not right, if it is "wrong" then we reject it.

The first step is to formulate the null-hypothesis, abbreviated to Ho.   This is usually intended to be rejected.   Another carefully constructed hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis or the H1; this is actually called the 'research hypothesis'.  After these have been articulated the researcher can design a research programme to test the hypotheses. When the results are received, they are examined against the prediction of the null hypothesis. The basic idea is to use this possible explanation and then look for data to support the explanation (or not).  It is best to spend as much time as possible on the hypothesis: it is the research question, and it determines how the study is carried out.  It determines the design because it defines the problem.

The subject of hypothesis testing has been debated heavily for many years and there are suggestions that misuse of null hypothesis significance testing is widespread and damaging (Finch et al. 2001), at least in psychological research. It is relevant to cite an article on hypothesis testing in marketing research by Lawrence (1982) who tells us: "Practical survey researchers (realise) that, in many cases, no adequate theory exists for setting up hypotheses in advance".  The article continues:  "Drawing one-off hypotheses out of the air offers no solution to the problem.  Researchers will be guided by their own ideas, experiences, hunches".

== Population ==
When considering any market sector we need to ask “Who is involved in this marketplace?” Who are the players? Who should be the centre of the investigation and where are those subjects? This area considers the target audience, customer or player; the users or non-users. Who will become the respondent or informant? Should we contact all players or just some of them? Should we carry out a census or a sample: should respondents be selected by probability or non-probability methods? An important concept for primary research is sampling. We choose to interview or observe people who we think will give us the information that will solve our problems. So in choosing our research method, we need to consider whom we select and how we select.  This applies to qualitative research, with only a few people, and quantitative research with many people. Much emphasis in marketing research is on the end user, but “experts” can bridge the gap between primary and secondary data.  An expert may be someone who has been in the business for many years. This part of the MR Mix involves identifying relevant sampling frames.

== Procedure ==
When considering the procedure the key question is “How should the study be conducted?” Will it be qualitative or quantitative? This area also covers the question of timing: when will the fieldwork take place?

The best research starts by looking at secondary data, this information already exists. The two basic sources: internal (within an organisation) and external, published by someone outside have become easier to access in recent years. Information Technology, with Intranets and the Internet, has improved our ability to find such data. If secondary data doesn’t solve the problem then original data (primary data) is sought. It is useful to think of different primary methods in these terms: we can ask people what they are doing; we can watch them or detect what they have done by counting or we can manipulate some variables to discover the effect. This creates three categories: questioning; observation and experimentation.

Primary data collection techniques can be subdivided into: interviewer-administered or respondent-administered; direct or indirect; personal or impersonal. Processing data, analysis and interpretation are essential parts of the procedure.  Detailed examination of the appropriate tools used in the data collection needs to take place.

== Publication ==
Under the heading of “Publication” the key questions are: Who is the audience for the results? What should be communicated? When and how should they be communicated? Research is of no use if findings are kept within the research team; similarly commercially sensitive information will have no competitive advantage if placed in the public domain. Choices need to be made on how publication takes place. Will a written report be created? Will tabulations be provided? Will a personal presentation take place? Who should be allowed sight of the results?

There are many different readers of research reports and these audiences all have very different expectations. Reporting must be personalised, writing and presentation style must be customised and adapted to the user. At one extreme there is the general public. There are many reasons why research is reported to the “mass consumer”. It may be a government report that has been commissioned to be in the public interest: concerning health, welfare, transport and so on. It may be a consumer report: [[Consumer Watchdog|consumer watchdog]] reports are of great interest to the man on the street, so we find the Which? Magazine and similar bodies have enabled the layman appreciate survey findings. Editors of periodicals regularly commission research for editorial reasons, so the results may become part of an article for mass consumption. The research agency may report directly to the public on web pages, by email or by post, this is because it is now common to offer a short summary report to a respondent as a gesture of goodwill, an incentive, a thank you for co-operating in the research. Research findings may appear as part of a promotional campaign, appealing to the consumer’s need to know that indeed this is a best seller (“nine out of ten cat-owners prefer…”).

Then there are smaller audiences such as managers who are anxious to receive a report in order to make instant decisions. Additionally there are managers who will benefit from the information much later when the report is consulted as secondary data in the future.

The '''Merchant Shipping Act 1995''' is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] passed in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1995. It consolidated much of the UK's maritime legislation, repealing several Acts in their entirety and provisions in many more, some dating back to the mid-nineteenth century.  It appoints several officers of [[Admiralty Jurisdiction]] such as the [[Receiver of Wreck]].  The Act of 1995 updates the prior [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894]].  The lead part on '''British ships''' was impacted by the outcome of the [[R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport|Factortame case]], as the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] was impugned by the [[Common Fisheries Policy]].

==Content of Act==
The Act comprises 316 sections divided into 13 Parts:
* Part I: British ships
* Part II: Registration
* Part III: Masters and Seamen
* Part IV: Safety
* Part V: Fishing Vessels
* Part VI: Prevention of Pollution
* Part VII: Liability of Shipowners and Others
* Part VIII: Lighthouses
* Part IX: Salvage and Wreck
* Part X: Enforcement Officers and Powers
* Part XI: Accident Investigations and Inquiries
* Part XII: Legal Proceeding
* Part XIII: Supplemental

===Part VIII: Lighthouses===
Part VIII of the Act provides the powers and duties of the [[General Lighthouse Authorities]] and '''Local Lighthouse Authorities'''.

===Part IX: Salvage and Wreck===
[[Receiver of Wreck]] is a post defined in Part IX of the Act. It is an official of the British government whose main task is to process incoming reports of shipwrecks in order to give legitimate owners the opportunity to retrieve their property and ensure that law-abiding finders of wreck receive an appropriate reward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-rowrole/mcga-dops_row_receiver_of_wreck.htm Maritime and Coastguard Agency] - Role of the Receiver Of Wreck&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Act, a wreck falls into one of four categories:
; [[Flotsam]] : goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished which are recoverable because they have floated.
; [[Jetsam]] : goods cast overboard (jettisoned) in order to lighten a vessel which is in danger of sinking, even if they ultimately perish.
; [[Derelict (maritime)|Derelict]] : property which has been abandoned and deserted at sea by those who were in charge without any hope of recovering it. This includes vessels and cargo.
; Lagan (or ligan) : goods cast overboard from a ship, which afterwards perish, buoyed so that they can be recovered later.

===Part XI: Accident Investigations and Inquiries===
Part XI of the Act provides the powers and duties of the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]].

==Subsequent Amendments==
The [[Merchant Shipping (Pollution) Act 2006]] amended section 178(1) of the Act. It restricts claims to being enforced within three years of the damage occurring, whereas previously it had been restricted to within three years after "the claim against the Fund arose", and within six years of the damage occurring.

The [[Marine Navigation Act 2013]] made four changes to the Act: &lt;ref name="explanatory notes"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 47 was amended so that regulations relating to manning requirements on ships may refer to information contained in other documents.
* Section 193 was amended to specify the area of sea in which each Authority may operate.
* Section 197 was amended and section 197A added to enable the [[General Lighthouse Authorities]] to enter into a broader range of commercial agreements. The income from these agreements will supplement revenue from [[Light dues]], used to fund the work of the Authorities. 
* Section 252 was amended to enable lighthouse authorities to mark wrecks by electronic methods as well as physical [[navigation aid|aids to navigation]].

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
There are three types of mochibun kaisha:

*'''[[Gōmei gaisha]]''', in which all members have [[unlimited liability]] for the company's debts (similar to a [[general partnership]])
*'''[[Gōshi gaisha]]''', in which some members have unlimited liability and some have [[limited liability]] (similar to a [[limited partnership]])
*'''[[Gōdō gaisha]]''', in which all members have limited liability (very similar to a U.S. [[limited liability company]])

Mochibun kaisha are formed by preparing articles of incorporation and depositing the articles with a local Legal Affairs Bureau.

The Japanese civil code also provides for {{Nihongo|partnerships|組合|kumiai}}, a different type of business organization. Civil code partnerships lack legal personality and are mainly used for investment funds and professional firms.

'''NewSport''' is a defunct American [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television network]] that was owned by Rainbow Programming Holdings, a [[joint venture]] between the [[Rainbow Media]] subsidiary of [[Cablevision]], [[NBC]] and [[Liberty Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ailes cure for CNBC, talk web|url=https://variety.com/1993/scene/news/ailes-cure-for-cnbc-talk-web-110057/|author=John Dempsey|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 31, 1993|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predating the launch of the originally similar [[ESPNews]] by three years, it focused on 24-hour coverage of [[sports journalism|sports news]] and analysis.

==History==
NewSport debuted on October 1, 1993, replacing [[SportsChannel America]], a national version spun off of Rainbow's SportsChannel [[regional sports network]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ESPN 2 Ready For Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/sports/espn-2-ready-for-prime-time.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 1993|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NewSport developed a unique [[news ticker|sports ticker]], known as the "NewSport Score Box", which debuted in 1995 and provided constantly updated score information on ongoing games and schedules for upcoming sports events at the bottom right of the screen.

The network also aired original programs such as ''NewSport Talk'' (a sports discussion program), ''NewSport Journal'', ''NewSport Tonite'' (a nightly program featuring news and analysis on the day in sports) and ''Scoreboard Central'' (which premiered on April 29, 1995, a 12-hour sports news program that aired on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEWSPORT TO LAUNCH NEWS PROGRAM SCOREBOARD CENTRAL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1995/04/26/Sports-Media/NEWSPORT-TO-LAUNCH-NEWS-PROGRAM-SCOREBOARD-CENTRAL.aspx?hl=NewSport&amp;sc=0|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=April 26, 1995|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network was slow to grow in coverage, with relatively limited carriage on cable system operators besides Cablevision, owner of SportsChannel and NewSport parent Rainbow Media. Ironically, even Cablevision did not give the network full-time coverage as it carried NewSport on the channel slots also occupied by [[The Weather Channel]] on some of their systems through a time-share arrangement. At its peak, NewSport had only about 10 million subscribers nationwide. This slow growth and lack of viewers, combined with the wide distribution and success of ESPNEWS and Rainbow reportedly losing more than $20 million operating the network, resulted in Rainbow Programming Holdings deciding to shut down NewSport on July 9, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEWSPORT ENDS OPERATION; SUBSCRIBERS GET NEW CLASSIC CHANNEL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/05/2/Sports-Media/NEWSPORT-ENDS-OPERATION-SUBSCRIBERS-GET-NEW-CLASSIC-CHANNEL.aspx?hl=NewSport&amp;sc=0|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=May 2, 1997|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Sports Classics==
'''American Sports Classics''' is a network that focused on sports nostalgia programming; it was originally set to launch after NewSport ceased operations on July 9, 1997, however its launch was postponed "indefinitely" for a time, after Rainbow Media transferred control of the network to Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture between [[News Corporation]], Liberty Media and Cablevision created after News Corporation acquired a 40% stake in Cablevision's sports properties for $850 million in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPORTS LANDSCAPE ALTERED WITH FOX/LIBERTY-CABLEVISION DEAL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/23/Sports-Media/SPORTS-LANDSCAPE-ALTERED-WITH-FOXLIBERTY-CABLEVISION-DEAL.aspx?hl=American%20Sports%20Classics&amp;sc=1|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=June 23, 1997|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it launched that fall, the network featured a broad mix of biographical and magazine-style programs.

ASC's format contrasted with the similarly focused Classic Sports Network (which later became [[ESPN Classic]]), which at the time mostly showed archived sports event telecasts. Indeed, the reason why the launch was postponed in the first place was due to problems Rainbow faced in trying to obtain the rebroadcast rights to sporting events from the major professional and collegiate sports leagues or their broadcast partners, forcing American Sports Classics to rely on the magazine and biographical programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AMERICAN SPORTS CLASSICS' LAUNCH ON HOLD "INDEFINITELY"|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/07/9/Sports-Media/AMERICAN-SPORTS-CLASSICS-LAUNCH-ON-HOLD-INDEFINITELY.aspx?hl=American%20Sports%20Classics&amp;sc=1|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like NewSport, ASC was unable to stand up to its competitors, specifically Classic Sports Network. The network ceased operations in mid-1998, shortly after SportsChannel discontinued operations upon its merger with [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]].

[[File:Locked Gates Occupy Harvard.jpg|thumb|Administrators locked the gates to Harvard Yard for several weeks]]

'''Occupy Harvard''' was a student demonstration at [[Harvard University]] identifying itself with the global [[Occupy Movement]]. It sought to create a forum for discussing economic inequality at Harvard, in the United States, and throughout the world. It criticized Harvard's influence on global economic policy and its involvement with the American financial sector. It also supported wage campaigns by Harvard workers and a divestment demand initiated by [[Hotel Workers Rising]].

Facing resistance from administration and police, the group established an encampment in [[Harvard Yard]] after a march on November 9, 2011. Immediately after this march, the gates to Harvard Yard were locked and only people with Harvard identity cards were allowed through. Although the encampment gained many faculty supporters, it was not popular among Harvard undergraduates. The security checkpoints were not removed until after the group packed up its tents in December 2011. Occupy Harvard continued to organize into 2012, with a focus on the university's library system.

The demonstration raised issues of privilege and economic inequality, particularly as they relate to students and administration at one of the world's wealthiest and best-known universities.&lt;ref name="Carmichael &amp; Baker 11 Nov"&gt;Mary Carmichael and Billy Baker., "[http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2011/11/11/harvard_officials_decide_to_keep_harvard_yard_locked_in_wake_of_occupy_tents/ Occupy Harvard left up to students: Harvard officials decide to keep Harvard Yard locked in wake of Occupy tents]", ''Boston Globe, November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters described Occupy Harvard as a "fight for Harvard's soul", questioning whether the university would "continue to prioritize money above social justice".&lt;ref name="AsiaOne 16 Nov"/&gt; Opponents called the demonstrators over-privileged and under-informed attention seekers.&lt;ref name="Petri 14 Nov"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Harvard University]] is one of the most exclusive universities in the world, with an admission rate of 5.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Ellis, "[http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/pf/college/acceptance_rates_ivy_league/index.htm Harvard, Princeton post record low acceptance rates]", ''CNN Money'', March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard is famous for its wealthy graduates but also for its generous financial aid programs.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Noah, "[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_customer/2011/02/the_harvard_effect.html Does Harvard's 'affirmative action for the affluent' screw the proles?]", ''Slate'', February 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[financial endowment]] of over $30 billion, on which it does not pay taxes, is the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Upton and Christopher Schnaars, "[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-09-09/where-endowment-money-goes/57704440/1 Endowments fund dorms, salaries—and sometimes tuition]", ''USA Today'', September 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the world's richest non-profits, competing only with the [[Catholic Church]] (and perhaps the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]).&lt;ref name="Gharavi 13 Nov"&gt;Maryam Monalisa Gharavi, "[http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/post/12736839518/crimson-front Crimson Front]", ''LA Review of Books'', November 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Harvard graduates work in the financial sector based on [[Wall Street]]; many others hold prominent positions in the world of business. Prominent faculty such as former president [[Larry Summers]]—who become director of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] under Obama—have played major roles in shaping United States economic policy. This status has led critics to connect Harvard closely with America's domestic and international economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles H. Ferguson]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/may/21/heist-century-university-corruption Heist of the century: university corruption and the financial crisis]", ''Guardian'', May 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's investments have also come under scrutiny (as they did during divestment campaigns targeting apartheid in South Africa), with particular criticism leveled at holdings in [[HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts]].&lt;ref name="Dwyer 10 Nov"/&gt;
[[File:2011 OccupyBoston 6232448715 Oct10.jpg|thumb|Nighttime at the Occupy Boston media tent]]&lt;!--why is a background photo from occupy Boston in the article about Occupy harvard?--&gt;
Harvard has been the site of workers' campaigns, notably the long-term [[Harvard Living Wage Campaign]] which peaked in 2001. This movement—which established an open 100-tent shantytown in Harvard Yard—won concessions from Harvard including the formation of a jobs committee and a moratorium on outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Offner, "[http://www.troublemakershandbook.org/Text/Strikes/harvard%20Sit-In.htm Winning a Sit-In]", ''Troublemakers' Union'' (accessed October 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Holbrook, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2001/5/2/pitching-tents-pitching-in-pits-a/ Pitching Tents, Pitching In]", ''Harvard Crimson'', May 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In general, student activism at Harvard is limited to official channels. Although many Harvard students are involved in community service or public policy, these avenues for change have been criticized (in the words of a queer student activist at Harvard) as "technocratic," and oriented towards "research solutions, policy solutions, economic solutions, bureaucratic solutions to all problems rather than any type of social movement." Another student said, "It’s uncomfortable to acknowledge one’s own privilege and position—it can feel like a personal attack."&lt;ref name="Merrigan &amp; Sun 23 Feb"/&gt;

[[Occupy Wall Street]] (itself inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] began on September 17, 2011, sparking a wave of public encampments that came to be known as the [[Occupy Movement]]. Students at Harvard began organizing in response to that movement, and began to collaborate with the [[Occupy Boston]] encampment established on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jose A. DelReal, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/7/occupy-boston-movement-protesters/ Students Join 'Occupy Protests]", ''Harvard Crimson'', October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard workers, many of them members of Local 615 ([[SEIU]]) and Local 26 ([[UNITE HERE|UNITE HERE!]]), also joined with Occupy Boston and helped to plan Occupy Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer R. Cook, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/13/harvard-union-occupy-boston/ Harvard Union Members Join Occupy Boston Movement]", ''Harvard Crimson'', October 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Harvard Crimson'' generally opposed the Occupy actions, and defended police officers who arrested Harvard students at Occupy Boston.&lt;ref name="Gharavi 13 Nov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crimson staff, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/13/Occupy-Boston-Wall-Street-Harvard-Crimson-Arrests-Police/ Brutality? Hardly: The Boston Police were not at fault in stopping illegal protests]", ''Harvard Crimson'', October 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ec 10 walkout===
On Wednesday, November 2, 2011, about 70 students walked out of Economics 10 ("Ec 10"), Harvard's introductory economics class taught by [[N. Gregory Mankiw]], former economic advisor to [[George W. Bush]] and then-current advisor to [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name="DealReal 2 Nov"&gt;Jose A. DelReal, "[http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article/2011/11/2/mankiw-walkout-economics-10/ Students Walk Out of Ec10 in Solidarity with 'Occupy'"], ''Harvard Crimson'', 2 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isidore 2 Nov"&gt;Chris Isidore, "[http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/02/news/economy/mankiw_harvard_ows/ O.W.S. stages walk-out of Harvard econ class]", ''CNN Money'', November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Demonstrators expressed support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] and published an open letter to Mankiw:&lt;ref name="Walkout"&gt;Concerned students of Economics 10, "[http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/ An Open Letter to Greg Mankiw]", ''Harvard Political Review''. November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Harvard graduates play major roles in the financial institutions and in shaping public policy around the world. If Harvard fails to equip its students with a broad and critical understanding of economics, their actions are likely to harm the [[global financial system]]. The last five years of economic turmoil have been proof enough of this.
We are walking out today to join a Boston-wide march protesting the corporatization of higher education as part of the global Occupy movement. Since the biased nature of Economics 10 contributes to and symbolizes the increasing economic inequality in America, we are walking out of your class today both to protest your inadequate discussion of basic economic theory and to lend our support to a movement that is changing American discourse on economic injustice.}}
The letter criticized Mankiw's class specifically for presenting a conservative perspective as absolute truth, and for excluding academic data and primary sources (relying heavily, instead on Mankiw's own textbook).&lt;ref name="Moore 13 Dec"/&gt; Students cited, for example, Mankiw's claim that economics dictated a zero-sum relationship between economic efficiency and economic equality.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9007274177 Anti-Capitalism Protests Spread to US Colleges]", ''FARS'', November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The walkout immediately produced heated debate about Harvard and Ec 10, in particular the question of whether the class really separates "descriptive" from "normative" claims.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Patashnik, "[http://hpronline.org/harvard/in-defense-of-ec-10/ In Defense of Ec10]", ''Harvard Political Review'', November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan Angelopoulos, "[http://hpronline.org/harvard/in-defence-of-the-students-who-walked-out/ Defending the Walkout]", ''Harvard Political Review'', November 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An Occupy organizer who supported the walkout said that the class promotes a "strongly conservative neoliberal ideology"; the secretary for the Harvard Republican Club said that "the class is about pure economic efficiency. Ideology comes into play when we determine how to balance efficiency with social equity."&lt;ref name="George 2 Nov"/&gt;

Mankiw said that his course was a "relatively apolitical" introduction to economics, that he was planning to teach a lecture on inequality, a topic that might interest the protestors, and that he could "understand their desire to think about alternative ways to structure society."&lt;ref name="Isidore 2 Nov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="George 2 Nov"&gt;Michael C. George, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/2/students-protest-Ec-10/ Group Endorses Walk Out in Economics 10]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Mankiw, "[http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/11/occupy-wall-street-comes-to-ec-10.html Occupy Wall Street comes to Ec 10]", ''Greg Mankiw's Blog: Random Observations for Students of Economics'', November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encampment==
[[File:Thayer gate - funnel.png|thumb|Marchers displaying Harvard identity cards attempt to enter Thayer gate as police begin to close it]]
{{Commons category|Occupy Harvard at Thayer Gate}}
On November 9, 2011, hundreds of demonstrators (estimates range between 300 and 500; not all of them Harvard students) met at Harvard Law School and marched toward Harvard Yard.&lt;ref name="Gharavi 13 Nov"/&gt; After allowing through some students with identity cards, [[Harvard University Police Department|Harvard Police]] closed the gates on all of the protestors. Some reported police roughness and minor injuries.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 10 Nov"&gt;John Stephen Dwyer, "'[http://blastmagazine.com/archive/the-news/local-news/occupy-harvard-begins-on-harvard-yard/ Occupy Harvard begins on Harvard Yard]", ''Blast'' magazine, November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who entered the Yard set up tents that had been stored previously in nearby dormitories, establishing a camp near the Yard's [[John Harvard (statue)|John Harvard statue]].&lt;ref name="Segal 20 Nov"/&gt;

The next morning (November 10), the group issued an official statement which included specific criticisms of Harvard management:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thenation.com/blog/164522/harvard-joins-occupy-movement# Harvard Joins the Occupy Movement]", ''The Nation'', November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We see injustice in the 180:1 ratio between the compensation of Harvard’s highest-paid employee—the head of internal investments at Harvard Management Company—and the lowest-paid employee, an entry-level custodial worker. We see injustice in Harvard’s adoption of corporate efficiency measures such as job outsourcing. We see injustice in African land grabs that displace local farmers and devastate the environment. We see injustice in Harvard’s investment in private equity firms such as HEI Hotels and Resorts, which profits off the backbreaking labor of a non-union immigrant workforce. We see injustice in Harvard’s lack of financial transparency and its prevention of student and community voice in these investments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The group also announced that it would make policies through a regular [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General Assembly]].

===Gates of Harvard Yard===
[[File:Thayer gate 08.png|thumb|left|Police outside and inside the closed gate]]
While the tents were standing, Harvard administrators kept the gates locked—during this time, no one was allowed into Harvard Yard without appropriate identification. A November 14 statement attributed this decision to "health and safety issues that have arisen elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Segal 20 Nov"&gt;Corinne Segal, "[http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/harvard-s-gates-locked-due-to-occupy-protest-1.2674793# Harvard's gates locked due to Occupy protest]", ''Tufts Daily'', November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who held Occupy Harvard responsible for the locked gate maintained that it was necessary to prevent the mayhem (rape, assault, drugs, and more) that occurred at other Occupy encampments.&lt;ref&gt;Avishai D. Don, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/30/Harvard-Occupy-Wall-Street-Rape-Murder-Don/ Holding Occupy Harvard Accountable]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With the gates closed and attendance restricted to Harvard students, the Occupy Harvard encampment may have been one of the most orderly and polite in the nation. According to reporter John Stephen Dwyer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The shutting of Harvard’s gates has determined the character of the protest and the criticism made against it.  Whereas Occupy Boston has attracted all kinds of wild characters, the atmosphere at Occupy Harvard is calm and polite.  The occupiers are almost invariably well-groomed and articulate.  The donation jar took in $130 one day, most of it in $20 bills, and it didn’t disappear when no one had their eye on it. &lt;br&gt; It is, to use a word popular in Dewey Square, "bougy" (fancy, bourgeois).  Many holders of Harvard IDs have a decent shot of joining the 1% if they weren’t already born into it.  The occupiers in the Yard say this privilege – earned through hard work in many cases, inherited in others – gives them more obligation to try to fix the system rather than less.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 24 Nov"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Womack @ teach in.png|thumb|Professor [[John Womack]] (Harvard class of 1959) lectures Occupy Harvard at a December 7, 2011 teach-in, urging the audience to learn more about the 99% they wish to engage and assist]]
[[File:Occupydaycare4.jpg|thumb|"Subsidize my daycare" sign]]
Supporters of the demonstration criticized the gate closure, saying that the administration was reinforcing its elitist image and "shutting down" the university by preventing free flow of people and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz 18 Dec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jose A. DelReal, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/14/occupy-security-administrators-tension/ Occupy Harvard Security Measures Cause Tension]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty supporters published open letters to Harvard President [[Drew Faust]] asking her to reopen the gates.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 24 Nov"/&gt; One group of professors connected to Romance Language programs at Harvard wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We sympathize with your difficult position, but all of us agree that locking the gates is contrary to the principle of open inquiry for which the university stands. Historically, Harvard has never locked its gates (at least, not in recent memory), and we believe that security issues can be addressed differently.  We do not share the perception that the Occupy movement constitutes a threat to Harvard. To the contrary, we are in sympathy with protests against increasing inequality in the United States and believe that Harvard should welcome discussions of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Beizer, [[Gennaro Chierchia]], [[Tom Conley (philologist)|Tom Conley]], Verena Conley, David Damrosch, Amy Rose Deal, Sergio Delgado, Brad Epps, Francesco Erspamer, Luis Fernández Cifuentes, Luis Girón Negrón, Adriana Gutierrez, Sylvaine Guyot, James Huang, Alice Jardine, Jay Jasanoff, Biodun Jeyifo, Clémence Jouët-Pastré, Caroline Light, Maria Grazia Lolla, Giuliana Minghelli, Mylène Priam, José Rabasa, Sarah Richardson, Jeffrey Schnapp, Nicolau Sevcenko, Mariano Siskind, Doris Sommer, and Susan R. Suleiman, "[http://romancesphere.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k56942&amp;pageid=icb.page480086 An Open Letter to President Drew Faust concerning Occupy Harvard]", ''Romance Sphere'', 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Law professor [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] said that "the massive security presence, albeit friendly enough, had a Homeland Security feel to it."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Johnson, "[http://thinkprogress.org/special/2011/11/12/367040/harvard-law-professor-criticizes-homeland-security-feel-of-overreaction-to-occupy-harvard/ Harvard Law Professor Criticizes 'Homeland Security Feel' of 'Overreaction' to Occupy Harvard]", ''ThinkProgress'', November 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], a Jesuit priest at [[Harvard Divinity School]], described the demonstration as a "Vigil" and  called the security "unduly strict, disproportionate, unnecessary".&lt;ref name="Dwyer 24 Nov"/&gt; To the irritation of students opposed to the demonstration, some professors held classes outside the gates to protest their closure.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne 16 Nov"/&gt; Many students, tourists, and local businesses complained about the gates, which were locked for a month and a half.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz 18 Dec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zavadski 14 Nov"/&gt; Relatives of students and members of the press were also excluded.&lt;ref name="Gharavi 13 Nov"/&gt;

===Tents===
The tents themselves served what organizers called a "symbolic" role, since members of Occupy Harvard continued attending school and work during the encampment.&lt;ref name="Carmichael &amp; Baker 11 Nov"/&gt; Some students criticized participants for not being present with the tents.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz 18 Dec"/&gt; (Many students themselves felt conflicted about competing obligations to the demonstration and to their academic work.)&lt;ref name="Merrigan &amp; Sun 23 Feb"/&gt; The tents were reportedly purchased with funds from the [[Student Labor Action Coalition]], and the [[Service Employees International Union]].&lt;ref name="Zavadski 14 Nov"&gt;Katie R. Zavadski, "The morning after 'Occupy,' Harvard Yard on Lockdown", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation consisted of 30 tents and a core group of 100 activists at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 24 Nov"&gt;John Stephen Dwyer, "[http://blastmagazine.com/archive/the-news/local-news/occupy-harvard-continues-on-the-locked-down-yard/ Occupy Harvard continues on the locked down Yard]", ''Blast'' magazine, November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Message===
Members of Occupy Harvard used the encampment as a platform to create discussion about the university and its role in the world. Many criticized Harvard's role in the global economy (and [[2007–2012 global economic crisis|crisis therein]]): "Year after year, Harvard supplies traders and analysts and financial advisers who go on to run the economy into the ground", said one participating graduate student.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne 16 Nov"&gt;"[http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20111116-311023.html Anti-Wall Street protests take root on Harvard lawn]", ''AsiaOne'' (AFP), November 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupiers also criticized finances within the university. Said one doctoral student studying slavery, "I am grateful for what the school has given me, but the lack of transparency about where all that lovely money comes from is something I do not feel comfortable with."&lt;ref name="Moskowitz 18 Dec"/&gt;
[[File:Old Yard, Harvard University, Cambridge MA.jpg|thumb|right|Information tent remaining in Harvard Yard at the start of January 2012]]
A constant theme, connected to the broader Occupy slogan of "people over profits", was the desire for Harvard to prioritize educating the populace above money. One post-doc said that Occupy Harvard's "goal is to reaffirm Harvard as a marketplace of ideas where all viewpoints are discussed and analyzed without regard to the amount of money supporting the different ideas.""&lt;ref name="Dwyer 24 Nov"/&gt; When journalist [[Chris Hedges]] addressed the group (outside the gates, so that others could attend), he stressed the symbolic importance of Occupy Harvard to a larger struggle against [[plutocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;NBBooks, "Chris Hedges at Occupy Harvard—feeding plutocracy and why the cops are scared", ''DailyKos'', December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
On Monday, December 12, 2011, Occupy Harvard chose to strike its Harvard Yard camp, citing winter weather and a desire for the Yard's gates to reopen.&lt;ref name="Miraval 16 Dec"&gt;Nathalie R. Miraval, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/16/Occupy-Remove-Tents-Stage/ Occupy Harvard Protestors to Remove Tents from Harvard Yard]", ''Harvard Crimson'', December 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Yard was reopened—during daytime hours—on December 22, 2011.&lt;ref name=LessOccupied&gt;" [http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/12/occupy-harvard-removes-tents-yard-to-reopen Harvard Yard, Less Occupied]", ''Harvard Magazine'', December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin C.

The group maintained its information tent, a single weather-proof dome, until administrators ordered the structure removed on Friday, January 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="Miraval 17 Jan"&gt;Nathalie R. Miraval, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/17/occupy-administrators-remove/ Harvard Administrators Remove Last Remnants of Occupy Harvard Camp]", ''Harvard Crimson'', January 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A "crafts working group" created miniature tents out of paper to display on the site.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/01/administrators-remove-last-remnants-of-occupy-harvard Last Remnants of Occupy Harvard Removed]", ''Harvard Magazine'', January 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==

===Finance recruiting ===
Occupy Harvard denounced [[financial services|finance industry]], which it described as bad for the economy and a source of inequality. Campus opposition to corporate recruiting has increased, with some describing it as similar to military recruiting. Recent declines in recruitment rates for the finance sector have been attributed partly to the growing sense that these jobs are undesirable and unethical.&lt;ref name="Moore 13 Dec"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bloomberg 13 Dec"&gt;John Lauerman and Oliver Staley, "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-13/goldman-says-class-dismissed-as-occupy-harvard-mars-recruiting-sessions.html Goldman Says Class Dismissed as 'Occupy Harvard' Mars Recruiting Sessions]", ''Bloomberg'', December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, November 28, 2011, Occupy Harvard conducted a "Rally to Defend Freedom of Speech" in Harvard Yard. The group expressed solidarity with UC Berkeley and UC Davis, where students had recently come into conflict with police. About 25 of the demonstrators proceeded from the Yard to a [[Goldman Sachs]] recruiting session, behind held at Harvard's "On-Campus Interview Facility". They stood outside and chanted "Goldman Sachs, you can't hide / We can see your greedy side!" Students who attempted to enter were denied access to the building by [[Harvard University Police Department|Harvard Police]] and Office of Career Services officials, even after showing [[identity card]]s.&lt;ref name="Moore 13 Dec"&gt;Galen Moore, "[http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2011/12/13/occupy-harvard-nixes-goldman-recruiting.html Occupy Harvard nixes Goldman Sachs campus recruiting event (report)]", ''Boston Business Journal'', December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Friedman, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/29/occupy-protest-goldman-sachs/ Occupy Harvard Rally for Free Speech Targets Goldman Sachs Recruiting Event]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman Sachs canceled recruiting events scheduled for December 8, 2012, reportedly in response to the demonstration.&lt;ref name="Moore 13 Dec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 13 Dec"/&gt; ''The Crimson'' criticized the demonstrators for singling out Goldman Sachs and for attempting to create animosity towards their peers bound for jobs in finance.&lt;ref&gt;Crimson staff. "Occupy Recruiting: Occupying Goldman and interested students is yet another bad idea." ''Harvard Crimson'', December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Coscarelli, "Harvard Students Defend Harvard Students' Right to Get Rich", ''New York Magazine'', December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Janitors===
The group supported Harvard janitors in their campaign better wages, citing the discrepancy between pay for janitors and pay for Harvard's administrators.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Moore, "Harvard janitors plan protest, threaten strike if contract not resolved", ''Boston Business Journal'', November 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The janitors, unionized with SEIU Local 615, credited the Occupy group helping them to win a stronger five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Marcus, "[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=418304&amp;c=1 Occupations are read the Riot Act by havens of free thought]", ''Times Higher Education'', December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crimson'' approved the new contract but criticized Occupy Harvard for "attempting to link local and global issues", writing that "discussing the custodians' contract in the context of the global Occupy movement seems misguided."&lt;ref name="Crimson 22 Nov"&gt;Crimson staff. "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/22/staff-harvard-occupy-janitors/ Justice for Janitors: The new contract is excellent, now it's time for Occupy to move out]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newt Gingrich===
[[File:Newt Mic Check Vid.ogv|thumb|Video of Occupiers "[[Mic check#As a form of protest|mic checking]]" Newt Gingrich as he begins to speak]]
On November 18, Occupy Harvard and Occupy Boston disrupted a speech by [[Newt Gingrich]] (then a [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012|presidential candidate]]) at the [[Kennedy School of Government]].&lt;ref name="Norton 30 Nov"&gt;[[Quinn Norton]], ""[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/11/harvard-occupy/all/ Occupy Harvard's an exclusive affair, but not by choice]", ''Wired'', Threat Level blog, November 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video: "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR43rnbX00c Newt Gingrich Mic Checked]" on YouTube, posted by OccupyBoston on November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich was presenting his film ''A City Upon A Hill: The Spirit of American Exceptionalism'', sponsored by [[Citizens United Productions]], made famous by the Supreme Court's 2009 [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]] ruling.&lt;ref&gt;John Stephen Dwyer.

''Blast'' magazine, November 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Gingrich began to speak, demonstrators in the audience said "Thank you for standing up for corporations. They have rights too!" and "We are the 99 percent!" before being removed by security. Gingrich responded "I think we are 100 percent. We are all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Kaufman, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/21/gingrich-occupy-protest-hks/ Occupy Heckles Newt Gingrich]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gingrich suggested later in his speech that janitors should not be members of unions, and that their jobs should be given to children living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Allen. "Video: Newt Gingrich Says Replace Janitors With Children". ''Opposing Views'', November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hotel workers===
The group also joined with the [[Hotel Workers Rising]] campaign, pressuring Harvard to divest its holdings in [[HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts]].&lt;ref name="Norton 30 Nov"/&gt; In December 2011, Harvard agreed to review its holdings in HEI&lt;ref&gt;Mercer R. Cook, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/12/HEI-Investments-Harvard-Review/ Harvard to Review HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts Business Practices]", ''Harvard Crimson'', December 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;—in March 2012, it agreed to divest.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/9/Harvard-HEI-Reinvest/ HEI Reconsidered: Not reinvesting in hotel company is the right choice for Harvard]", editorial in the ''Harvard Crimson'', April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard libraries===
In early 2012, Harvard announced imminent sweeping changes to its [[Harvard University Library|library system]]. These changes would have led to layoffs, as well as cuts in other library resources.&lt;ref&gt;Justin C. Worland, "Library System Seeks to Reduce Staff", ''Harvard Crimson'', January 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew Faust, "Reflections on the Future of the Harvard Library", ''Office of the President'', February 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Library workers, members of the Harvard Union of Clerical &amp; Technical Workers (HUCTW), reacted in January with protests, with occupiers distributing petitions in support.&lt;ref name="Dou et al 26 Jan"&gt;Dan Dou, Radhika Jain, and Samuel Y. Weinstock, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/26/library-layoffs-protests/ University Library Workers Protest Layoffs]", ''Harvard Crimson'', January 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors asked leaders HUCTW, historically not an aggressive union, to back the endangered workers.&lt;ref name="Dou et al 26 Jan"/&gt;

In February, three members of Occupy Harvard published a statement in ''The Crimson'' describing an ongoing forum, held in [[Lamont Library]], to discuss the course of these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah L. Hofheinz, Derin Korman, and Timothy S. McGrath, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/13/harvard-occupy-library/ Take a Break. Think.]", ''Harvard Crimson'', February 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (This editorial parodied the official statement of President Drew Faust on the library reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Faust"[http://www.harvard.edu/president/reflections-on-future-harvard-library Reflections on the Future of Harvard Library]", February 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the Harvard community confronts this transition, the New Harvard Library Working Group of Occupy Harvard has acted autonomously to open a persistent community space for critical thought, engaged learning, and insistent action in the Lamont Library Café. In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning. […]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We think of the proposed Harvard library transition as a manifestation of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement—on campuses and in public parks—not only possible but also fruitful. In Lamont Library, we are creating a community of knowledge sharing that is open, horizontal, and free from the destructive impulses that too often guide our university and that seem to be shaping the library transition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:No signs in the library.png|thumb|left|Students in Lamont Library are asked to remove a sign they have attached to the wall (still from an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auExcY7_yik Occupy Harvard video])]]
The group announced intentions to hold Think Tanks and other meetings in the library from Sunday February 12 through Friday February 17.&lt;ref&gt;Occupy Harvard, "New Harvard Library Occupation", cited by Alex R. Shams, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/24/occupy-resurgent-shams/ Occupy Resurgent and Revolutionary]", ''Harvard Crimson'', February 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme of the protests, was again the relationship of money to values. Topics included [[privatization]] and the larger economic ideology of [[neoliberalism]], which occupiers said interfered with freedom and openness of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thenation.com/blog/166225/occupy-harvard-occupies-lamont-library Occupy Harvard Occupies Lamont Library]", ''The Nation'', February 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrators sought to remove Occupy Harvard from the library, threatening to revoke library access for participating students. Participants, instructed to take down signs because they violated an unwritten library policy, argued that the signs were protected by written library policy defending [[free speech]].&lt;ref name="Seo 14 Feb"&gt;Jane Seo. "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/14/occupy-lamont-staying/ Occupy Harvard Protestors Remain in Lamont Cafe]." ''Harvard Crimson'', February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Police removed the protestors' signs, but did not ban anyone from the library. Harvard students quoted in the ''Crimson'' said that they were not bothered by the group and in some cases did not notice its presence.&lt;ref name="Seo 14 Feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seo 20 Feb"/&gt;

The group held a rally outside of Lamont on Friday September 17, 2012, announcing support for library workers, holding signs, and chanting (e.g., "Hey, Harvard, you can't hide / We can see your greedy side!")&lt;ref&gt;Mercer R. Cook, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/17/protests-lamont/ Occupy Protests Outside Lamont]", ''Harvard Crimson, February 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupiers inside the library left the same day, as planned.&lt;ref name="Seo 20 Feb"&gt;Jane Seo, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/20/occupiers-leave-lamont-library/ Occupiers Leave Lamont]", ''Harvard Crimson'', February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations around Harvard's libraries and library workers continued through Commencement 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer R. Cook, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/23/occupy-commencement-library-layoffs/ Occupy Harvard to Protest at Commencement]". ''Harvard Crimson'', May 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Noam Chomsky 5.JPG|thumb|[[Noam Chomsky]] speaking to Occupy Harvard in February]]
[[File:Occupyoutside.jpg|thumb|Message of support displayed at Harvard's William James Hall]]
Occupy Harvard received praise&lt;ref&gt;David A. Weinfeld, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/5/Weinfeld-Goldman-Sachs-Harvard-Crimson-Occupy-JPMorgan/ Goldman Sachs is the Right Target for Occupy Harvard]", ''Harvard Crimson'', December 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  and criticism&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt N. Troia, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/21/occupy-harvard-failure/ Why Occupy Harvard Failed]". ''Harvard Crimson'', February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Katie R. Zavadski, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/14/liberal-critique-occupy-freedom/ A Liberal Critique]", ''Harvard Crimson'', December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. The ''Crimson'' itself opposed the encampment and published numerous editorials urging the group to move out of Harvard Yard.&lt;ref name="Gharavi 13 Nov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 22 Nov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 15 Nov"&gt;Crimson staff, "Out of the Yard", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Contentious issues included the possible hypocrisy of privileged Harvard students, wastefulness of the tents, and, most of all, inconvenience created by the locked gates.&lt;ref name="Matthews 11 Nov"&gt;Dylan Matthews, "[http://www.salon.com/2011/11/11/occupy_harvard_gets_the_old_college_jeer/ Occupy Harvard gets the old college jeer: In the school of the 1 percent, griping greets the movement]", ''Salon.com'', November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crimson'' also cited the possibility of anarchist violence.&lt;ref name="Crimson 15 Nov"/&gt; An editorial published by Harvard graduate [[Alexandra Petri]] (class of 2010) in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' argued that the protestors were motivated not by an authentic desire for justice but instead by need to alleviate their own feelings of elitism and guilt—urging them to "go to class" and learn something while at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Petri 14 Nov"&gt;[[Alexandra Petri]], "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/why-occupy-harvard/2011/11/14/gIQANpKMLN_blog.html Why Occupy Harvard]", ''Washington Post'', November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrations raised questions for Harvard students about their own role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called "1%".&lt;ref&gt;See a discussion in the ''Harvard Independent'' about whether the Harvard student body 'belongs' to the 99% or the 1%. Gary Gerbrandt, "[http://www.harvardindependent.com/2011/11/are-we-the-one-percent-point-1117/ Point: 1.0 − 0.01 = 0.99]", and Meghan Brooks, "[http://www.harvardindependent.com/2011/11/are-we-the-one-percent-counterpoint-1117/ Counterpoint: We Are the 1%]", ''Harvard Independent'', November 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Even participants struggled with the question of how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Harleen Gambhir, "[http://hpronline.org/harvard/occupy-comes-to-harvard/ Occupy Comes to Harvard]", ''Harvard Political Review'', November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] policies.&lt;ref name="O'Leary 22 Nov"&gt;Lucy O'Leary, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/22/leah-occupy-reasons/ This Is Why We Occupy]", ''Harvard Crimson'', November 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Gabler]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' that Harvard students were "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Neal Gabler]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/education/edlife/one-percent-education.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 One Percent Education]", ''New York Times'', January 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One Harvard graduate who had already joined [[Occupy Boston]] told the ''Boston Globe'' that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: "I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and I worked hard to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’"&lt;ref name="Carmichael &amp; Baker 11 Nov"/&gt; Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting "We are the one percent" and yelling insults.&lt;ref name="Matthews 11 Nov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Backman, "[http://hpronline.org/harvard/the-unintended-consequences-of-occupy-harvard/ The Unintended Consequences of Occupy Harvard]", ''Harvard Political Review'', November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by students in Statistics 104 suggested that student approval of Occupy Harvard averaged 2.85 on a scale of 1–10.&lt;ref name="Joseph 13 Feb"&gt;Anita J. Joseph, "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/13/joseph-occupy-harvard/ Why Didn't We Occupy Harvard?: Today's Ivy League student thrives in the embrace of an institution]", ''Harvard Crimson'', February 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A petition titled "Free Harvard", which asked the occupiers to go somewhere else in order to have the Harvard Yard gates reopened, obtained 700 signatures.&lt;ref name="Segal 20 Nov"/&gt; (Occupiers complained that the University had managed to blame demonstrations for the administration's own  decision to lock the gates.)&lt;ref name="Moskowitz 18 Dec"&gt;Eric Moskowitz, "[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/12/18/occupy_harvard_poised_for_transition/?page=full Occupy Harvard poisted for transition]", ''Boston Globe'', December 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other students expressed confusion or curiosity about the purpose of the encampment.&lt;ref name="Djagalov 11 Jan"&gt;Rossen Djagalov, "[http://www.possible-futures.org/2012/01/11/reflections-on-occupy-harvard/ Reflections on Occupy Harvard]", ''Possible Futures'', January 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 70 faculty members signed letters of support for the demonstration.&lt;ref name="Segal 20 Nov"/&gt;

The group also provoked response from within. Many said it was a good first step in creating awareness about global economic issues, and creating drama and emotion around political issues (particularly as contrasted with Harvard's [[Harvard Institute of Politics|Institute of Politics]]).&lt;ref name="Merrigan &amp; Sun 23 Feb"&gt;Tara W. Merrigan and Kevin Sun, "The Dilemma of the Radical: On-Campus Activism in the Age of Occupy", February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Others said that it picked up on struggles that already had momentum—for example, HEI divestment, which was already being championed by the Student Labor Action Movement.&lt;ref name="Cook &amp; Rouse 24 May"/&gt; They stressed the importance but also the difficulty of raising awareness about economic injustice at a school for the wealthy and privileged.&lt;ref name="Merrigan &amp; Sun 23 Feb"/&gt; Some felt that the process was dominated by graduate students, particularly in its "2.0" phase that focused on the libraries.&lt;ref name="Cook &amp; Rouse 24 May"&gt;Mercer R. Cook and Hana N. Rouse, "Did Occupy Matter?, ''Harvard Crimson'', May 24, 2012 ([http://www.thecrimson.com/feature/commencement2012/year-in-review/ Commencement 2012: Year in Review]).&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants were already familiar with [[consensus decision-making]]; others were new—to its pitfalls as well as to its advantages.&lt;ref name="Djagalov 11 Jan"/&gt; One student criticized Occupy Harvard for being too cautious: "Occupy Harvard is so different from the activism I’ve done in Oakland. In Oakland people don’t hesitate to strike, they don’t hesitate to do radical stuff. Here we need to discuss every nuance before we act. I’ve had to adjust my style and be more patient."&lt;ref name="Norton 30 Nov"/&gt;

'''Paca Street Firehouse''', also known as Truck House No. 2, is a historic [[fire station]] located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. The architect of Paca Street Firehouse is John E. Lafferty. It is a 1909 two-story brick structure with a highly detailed stone [[Renaissance Revival]]  façade. The principal space is a large room subdivided at the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway|Paca Street]] end into offices. It is one of three early 20th century firehouses standing and is the only one to retain its original features, particularly in the interior.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-767.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Paca Street Firehouse|date=September 1983|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Peter Kurtze, Gregory Johnson, Larry Hughes, and Timothy Bishop|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Cudahy Jr.''' (kŭd ŭ hay); March 17, 1849 – July 25, 1919) was an [[United States|American]] [[industrialist]] in the meat packing business and a [[patriarch]] of the Cudahy family.

==Background==
Cudahy was born on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in [[Callan, County Kilkenny]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1213&amp; Cudahy, Patrick 1849 - 1919] - Dictionary of Wisconsin History - Wisconsin Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestockexpo.org/ssclub/ssbook_pdfs/abc.pdf ''"Saddle and Sirloin Portrait Catalogue"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183359/http://www.livestockexpo.org/ssclub/ssbook_pdfs/abc.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }} - North American International Livestock Exposition - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Jeff. [http://staff.onmilwaukee.com/buzz/articles/cudahy.html ''"Milwaukee Talks: Michael Cudahy"''] - OnMilwaukee.com - August 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after he was born, his family moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].  He worked his way up at the Plankinton and Armour [[Meat packing industry|meat packing]] plant in the [[Menomonee River Valley, Milwaukee|Menomonee River Valley]], becoming the superintendent in 1874.  In 1888, the owner, [[John Plankinton]], transferred the company to Patrick and his brother, John.  The company became known as Cudahy Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM87686 Cudahy Brothers Co. Letterhead]. Wisconsin Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wmh/id/48517 Caught in the Middle: The Seizure and Occupation of the Cudahy Brothers Company, 1944-1945]". ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'', vol. 78, no. 3 (Spring, 1995): 200-218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/cudahy-brothers/ Cudahy Brothers]. ''Encyclopedia of Milwaukee''.&lt;/ref&gt; The company changed its name to Patrick Cudahy, Inc. in 1957, long after Cudahy's death.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1892, Cudahy moved the company to a 700-acre (2.8&amp;nbsp;km²) plot of land south of [[Milwaukee]] which he and his brother John bought for the purpose. This land was in the former [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]], which is now divided between the municipalities of Milwaukee, St. Francis, and Cudahy.

Cudahy "had a bittersweet relationship with the village of Cudahy" in part because he supported [[temperance movement|temperance]] and "fought against liquor". He "argued with the Cudahy Common Council about the spread of taverns in the village", although he also worked to assist business development and the construction of a new library. He 
said, "It is a source of satisfaction to me to look over those 25 years and see what has been accomplished, 
but I would feel much better if there were not the antagonistic spirit in Cudahy which seems to prevail to a 
great extent among its citizens."&lt;ref name="Wisconsin"&gt;[http://www.ansci.wisc.edu/Meat_HOF/1993/cudahy.htm Patrick Cudahy and Michael F. Cudahy] WISCONSIN MEAT INDUSTRY HALL OF FAME University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Cudahy is buried at [[Calvary Cemetery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Calvary Cemetery]] in Milwaukee.

'''Peter Grubb Jr.''' (1740–1786), [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] and second son of [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter and Martha Bates Grubb]], was a second-generation member of the [[Grubb Family Iron Dynasty]] along with his older brother [[Curtis Grubb]]. They operated the [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Ironworks]], making significant contributions to the [[American Revolutionary War]] effort.

The brothers inherited the ironworks from their father in 1754, with Peter, as the youngest, receiving only a one-third interest. They took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, took over the nearby [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]], making [[bar iron]] from [[pig iron]] produced by Curtis at [[Cornwall Furnace]]. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789.&lt;ref name = dibert&gt;{{cite book | last = Dibert | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Iron, Independence and Inheritance | publisher = [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]]  | year = 2000 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb&gt;{{cite book | last = Grubb | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Grubb Family of Grubb's Landing, Delaware | publisher = Higginson Book Co.  | year = 2008 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Cornwall Ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]] who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire.  But a portion remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of [[Mount Hope Estate]].

== Patriotism ==

The Grubb brothers were major contributors to the Revolutionary War effort, their Cornwall Ironworks supplied cannon, ammunition, shot and saltpans (used to make salt from seawater) to the Colonial forces. [[George Washington]] personally visited Cornwall to inspect the facility. Both brothers were elected as militia [[colonel]]s, Peter's unit was the 8th Lancaster Battalion and Curtis' was the 2nd Lancaster Battalion, both assigned to the [[Flying Camp]].

== Business career ==

Peter and his brother took over the operation of the ironworks about 1765, with Peter operating the Hopewell Forges and Curtis the Cornwall Furnace. They were successful operators of the ironworks through the Revolution. They were, however, complex individuals whose affairs were closely intertwined and became increasingly acrimonious. Their ongoing feuds and legal entanglements led to the fragmentation of the ironwork's ownership and its eventual loss by the Grubb family into the hands of [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]], who used it to build his fortune.

Tensions between the brothers reached the crisis point in 1783 when Curtis decided to marry his 20-year-old cousin Ann Grubb, granddaughter of the brothers' uncle [[Nathaniel Grubb]]. Inheritance concerns by Curtis' oldest son, Peter III (actually called Peter Jr. to distinguish him from Curtis' brother Peter), resulted in him being given a portion of Curtis' holdings, which then required a legal division of the assets that had previously been shared informally. Included in Peter III's newly acquired assets were a one-third interest in the Hopewell Forges. Peter, who had been running the forges, became fearful and reacted by purchasing land at Mount Hope to build his own furnace in competition with his brother, going heavily into debt. The feud intensified and Peter III became concerned for the business and sold his interest to Robert Coleman, a friend who had worked for the brothers and was by then also an ironmaster. Curtis, concerned with the competition, allied himself with Coleman and tried various tactics to put Peter out of business. Succumbing to the pressure, Peter became distraught and committed suicide in 1786, at the age of only 45. The ironworks were apportioned by the courts among Curtis, Peter's estate, and Coleman.

Robert Coleman additionally acquired the Mount Hope furnace from Peter's estate.  After Curtis' death in 1789 he operated the ironworks for the heirs until 1798, when they sold their interests to him. Thus Robert Coleman became the owner of most of the former Grubb holdings, which he added to his own and expanded to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire.

The holdings remaining in Peter's estate were eventually expanded upon by his second son [[Henry Bates Grubb]], whose family went on to become one of Pennsylvania's largest iron producers in the mid-19th century, with their center of operations at [[Mount Hope Estate]].

== Personal life ==

Before the brothers took over the ironworks in 1765, Peter had moved to the mansion built by his father and was learning the iron making business. He continued to reside in the mansion and took over operation of the Hopewell Forges. The [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forge Mansion]] still stands, denoted by a historic marker, on modern-day Route 322.

Peter married Mary Shippen Burd, of Lancaster, in 1771, at the Burd family estate known as "Tinian." They had two sons, Alan Burd Grubb and [[Henry Bates Grubb]], but unfortunately Mary died from complications of childbirth. Peter never got over the loss, became despondent, and never married again.  He was the less gregarious of the brothers, and being a minority partner in the ironworks probably didn't help his disposition.  He developed an increasing drinking problem and was known for sometimes erratic behavior.  On two occasions he was brought before Council to answer for statements he made while drinking; he was acquitted both times, as he had just "behaved in his usual mad way." Certainly Peter's drinking problem contributed to his suicide in 1786; he took his own life at the Hopewell Forges and was buried there by his brother-in-law [[Jasper Yeates]].&lt;ref name = pistol&gt;{{cite book| title = The History of a Flintlock Pistol | author = Samuel E. Dyke | year = 1955 | location = Lancaster Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Peter Grubb Jr. Grave Memorial | url = https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/52188974 | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peter never married again, he did have a relationship with Hannah Bellarby Grubb, the adopted daughter of his uncle Samuel Grubb. Hannah came into Peter's household after Mary's death to help with the two infants. Peter and Hannah had a daughter, Hannah Elizabeth Grubb, late that same year. Peter acknowledged his daughter, later remembering her in his will, but did not marry Hannah. Hannah is believed to have then moved with her daughter to Curtis Grubb's household to help care for his two young children, whose mother had also died, probably in childbirth. Hannah later bore Curtis a son, [[Jehu Grubb]]. Peter also had a relationship with a Susan Brandelbury before he was married; a son was produced, Samuel Brandelbury, who was also remembered in Peter's will.

== Sons in the family iron business ==

With their remaining share of Peter's estate as a foundation, this family become one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the mid-19th century.

=== Son of Peter Grubb Jr. ===

*[[Henry Bates Grubb]] (1774–1823) was the family's first "real" ironmaster; he bought out his brother, Alan Burd Grubb, and built the original mansion at [[Mount Hope Estate]].

=== Sons of Henry Bates Grubb ===

*[[Edward Burd Grubb Sr.]] (1810–1867) was a family ironmaster, an ardent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and a leading citizen in [[Burlington, New Jersey]].
*[[Clement Brooke Grubb]] (1815–1889) was a family ironmaster and banker, the first manager of Mount Hope Estate, and the owner of several iron production operations.
*Alfred Bates Grubb (1821–1885) was involved in the family iron business, bought 50% of Mount Hope Estate from Clement for $25,000, managing it until his death. His estate sold it back to Clement for $300,000.

== Other descendants of interest ==

=== Descended from Henry Bates Grubb ===

*[[Edward Burd Grubb Jr.]] (1841–1913) was a Civil War General, a candidate for Governor, and later Ambassador to Spain. After the war he joined the family iron business as President of the Lebanon Valley Furnace Company.
*Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb (1850–1936) was the youngest daughter of Clement Brooke Grubb, who inherited the [[Mount Hope Estate]] and was its last family resident. She transformed the 12 room Federal style mansion into a 32-room Victorian mansion that  is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
*Edward Burd Grubb III (1893–1973) was President of the [[New York Curb Exchange]] during the critical period after the creation of the SEC.

=== Descended from Hannah Elizabeth Grubb ===

*[[Samuel P. Heintzelman]] (1805–1880) was a Civil War General who commanded the 3rd Corps during the [[Peninsula Campaign]].

'''Plant lifecycle management''' ('''PLM''') is the process of managing an industrial facility's data and information throughout its lifetime. Plant lifecycle management differs from [[product lifecycle management]] by its primary focus on the integration of '''logical''', '''physical''' and '''technical''' plant data in a combined plant model.

A PLM model can be used through a plants whole lifecycle, covering:
*Design,
*Construction,
*Erection,
*Commissioning,
*Handover,
*Operation,
*Maintenance/Refurbishment/Life Extension,
*Decommissioning,
*[[Land rehabilitation]].

== Parts of the model ==

=== Logical model ===
The logical plant model may cover:
*[[Process and instrumentation diagram|Process &amp; instrumentation diagrams]] (P&amp;ID)
*[[Piping and instrumentation diagram|Pipe &amp; instrumentation diagrams]] (P&amp;ID)
*[[P&amp;ID|P&amp;I schematic]]
*[[Process flow diagram|Process flow]]
*Massflow diagram (similar to the process flow but used in the mineral industry)
*Electrical key diagram
*Cabling diagram
*Electrical
*[[Hydraulics|Hydraulic]]
*[[Pneumatic]]
*Heating venting &amp; air-conditioning ([[HVAC]])
*Water and wastewater

=== Physical model ===
Physical parts of a plant are usually represented by 3D CAD models.
The [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] system used would typically focus on top-down, routing, and [[Digital mockup|DMU]] and would differ on many point from the systems used in the mechanical industry, or for [[Architectural engineering]].

The '''Purple Line''' is a [[heavy rail]] [[Rapid transit|subway line]] operating in [[Los Angeles]], running between [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] and the [[Mid-Wilshire]]/[[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]] districts. It is one of six lines on the [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Metro Rail System]], operated by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]].

The Metro Purple Line is one of the city's two [[Rapid transit|subway]] lines (along with the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]]). Although they separate west of Downtown Los Angeles, the two subway lines (Purple and Red) were originally branded as two branches of the Red Line. The Purple Line was instituted as its own line, separate from the Red Line, in 2006. {{As of|2013|October}}, the combined Red and Purple lines averaged 169,478 boardings per weekday.&lt;ref name="ridership"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metro.net/news/pages/ridership-statistics/ |title=Ridership Statistics - Rail Ridership Estimates |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of the eight stations served, only two of them are exclusive to the Purple Line, with the other six shared with the Red Line.

==Service description==

===Route===
[[File:Interior of Metro Purple Line Train.JPG|thumb|Inside train fleet number #530 on the Metro Purple Line|left]]
The Metro Purple Line is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km|adj=on}} line&lt;ref name="linelength" /&gt; that begins at Union Station. At Union Station, passengers can connect to the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] bus rapid transit line, and the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]]. The Purple Line travels southwest through [[Downtown Los Angeles]], passing the Civic Center, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core) and the Financial District. Passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line (both directions) at Civic Center Station. At Pershing Square Station, passengers can board the northbound Metro Silver Line bus at Olive Street/5th Street.  At {{LA Metro station|7th St/Metro Center}} Station, travelers can connect to the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]], [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] and the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]].  From here, the train travels between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard (and briefly Ingraham Street) west through Pico-Union and Westlake, arriving at {{LA Metro station|Wilshire/Vermont}} in the city's [[Mid-Wilshire]]/[[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]] district.  Up to this point, track is shared with the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]]: at Wilshire/Vermont, the two lines diverge.  The Purple Line continues west for one additional mile, and terminates at {{LA Metro station|Wilshire/Western}}.

====Duplicate service on Wilshire====
The Purple Line runs underground, below [[Wilshire Boulevard]] which is served on the surface by Metro Local route 20 and [[Metro Rapid]] route 720.  Despite the duplicate service, Metro considers the redundant bus service justified because both bus routes run frequently from Downtown Los Angeles. Unlike the Purple Line, they run along the ''entire'' Wilshire corridor, west to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] and [[Santa Monica]].

===Hours of operation===
Trains run between approximately 4:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. daily, with late night weekend service running until approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.metro.net/riding_metro/bus_overview/images/802.pdf |title=Red &amp; Purple lines timetable |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority |date=June 23, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First and last train times are as follows:

'''To/From Wilshire/Western'''&lt;br&gt;
:''Eastbound''
:*First Train to Union Station: 4:41 a.m.
:*Last Train to Union Station: 11:42 p.m. (2:01 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights)

:''Westbound''
:*First Train to Wilshire/Western: 4:56 a.m.
:*Last Train to Wilshire/Western: 11:27 p.m. (2:12 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights)

During the evenings Purple Line trains sometimes run as shuttles.  Passengers must transfer to a Red Line train at Wilshire/Vermont.  This will change once the Purple Line is extended to Westwood.

===Headways===
Trains on the Purple Line operate every ten minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.metro.net/riding_metro/maps/images/system_map.pdf |title=Metro Bus &amp; Rail System Map |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and all day on the weekends after approximately 10 a.m. (with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings).  Night service can range between 20–30 minutes.

===Ridership===
The Purple Line is utilized mostly as a downtown shuttle on its shared segment with the Red Line. The stub between Vermont and Western has a very low ridership. According to Metro Service Coordinator Conan Cheung, the stub is operating 11% full during peak hours, and even lower at other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dana|last=Gabbard |url=http://la.streetsblog.org/2010/11/23/metros-conan-cheung-updates-on-next-18-months-of-service-planning/ |title=Metro’s Conan Cheung Updates on Next 18 Months of Service Planning |work=Streetsblog LA |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Los Angeles Metro Rail and Busway}}

The current Purple Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to central and western portions of the city with a heavy rail subway system. Originally planned in the 1980s to travel west down [[Wilshire Boulevard]] to [[Fairfax Avenue]] and then north to the [[San Fernando Valley]], a methane explosion at a [[Ross Dress for Less]] clothing store near Fairfax in 1985, just as construction got underway, led to a legal prohibition on tunnelling in a large part of Mid-Wilshire. Instead, after some wrangling, a new route was chosen up [[Vermont Avenue]] to [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. However, a short one-mile branch down Wilshire from [[Wilshire/Vermont station|Vermont]] to [[Wilshire/Western station|Western]] was allowed to remain in the system.

The service currently designated as the Purple Line opened in two ''minimum operating segments:''

*MOS-1, which consisted of the original five stations from {{LA Metro station|Union Station}} to {{LA Metro station|Westlake/MacArthur Park}}, opened on January 30, 1993.&lt;ref name="MOS1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Katches |authorlink= |title=Red Line Rolls to Raves – It's Smooth Railing As L.A. Subway Opens |url= |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |publisher= |date=January 31, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*MOS-2A, including three new stations between {{LA Metro station|Westlake/MacArthur Park}} and {{LA Metro station|Wilshire/Western}}, opened in 1996.&lt;ref name="MOS2A"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Bloom |authorlink= |title=MTA Unveils New Downtown Line |url= |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |publisher= |date=May 22, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Vermont branch began service in 1999. Initally, both branches were designated as part of the Red Line, but in 2006 trains travelling between Union Station and Wilshire/Western were rebranded the Purple Line for greater clarity.

== Current and proposed extension ==
{{Main|Purple Line Extension}}
Metro is now aiming to complete the subway to the Westside.  The new project is called the [[Purple Line Extension]] (the project was previously called the Westside Subway Extension) and the first phase broke ground on November 7, 2014. Metro released the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) on March 19, 2012, and the first phase of the project (to Wilshire / La Cienega) was approved by Metro's Board of Directors on April 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metro.net/projects/westside/final-eis-eir/ |title=Purple Line Extension - Final EIR/EIS |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notice to proceed was issued to [[Tutor Perini]] on April 26, 2017 for phase two from Wilshire/La Cienega Station to Century City/Constellation Station. Pre-construction has commenced. &lt;ref&gt;http://thesource.metro.net/2017/04/27/notice-to-proceed-issued-for-section-2-of-purple-line-extension/&lt;/ref&gt; Metro is still attempting to obtain funding for phase three.

==Operations==

===Maintenance===
The Purple Line is operated out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard) located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue Los Angeles. This yard stores the fleet used on the Red and Purple Line. It is also where heavy maintenance is done on the fleet. Subways get to this yard by continuing on after Union Station. Trains make a right turn before coming to surface level at Ducommun Street, and then travel south to 1st Street where they enter the yard.

===Rolling stock===
The Purple Line uses [[Breda A650]] {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} electric [[multiple unit]] cars built by [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] in [[Italy]]. Trains usually run in four-car consists during peak hours and two-car consists outside of peak hours. The acceleration for cars #531 and up is similar to that of cars used by the [[Washington Metro rolling stock|Washington Metro]] because they both use [[General Electric]] [[traction motor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob9oItpOyEc&amp;feature=related Red line train]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlutTFq4WjA&amp;feature=related Washington Metro train]&lt;/ref&gt; The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Drive near 4th Street alongside the [[Los Angeles River]] in Downtown Los Angeles.

In March 2017, Metro ordered new [[CRRC HR4000]] railcars, some of which will operate on the Purple Line once the extension is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/mechanical/news/LA-Metro-inks-pact-with-CRRC-for-up-to-282-new-rail-cars--51154 | title=L.A.

'''Sales variance''' is the difference between actual [[sales]] and budget sales. It is used to measure the performance of a sales function, and/or analyze business results to better understand [[Market (economics)|market]] conditions.

There are two reasons actual sales can vary from planned sales: either the volume sold varied from plan (sales volume variance), or sales were at a different price from what was planned (sales price variance). Both scenarios could also simultaneously contribute to the variance.

For example: The plan was to sell 5 widgets at $3 each, for a budgeted sales of: (5*$3)=$15. In reality, 6 widgets were sold at $2 each, for an actual sales of: (6*$2)=$12. The total variance was thus ($12–$15)=$3 (U)nfavourable or minus $3, since total sales was less than planned.

== Sales price variance ==
Sales Price Variance: The sales price variance reveals the difference in total revenue caused by charging a different selling price from the planned or standard price. The sales price variance is calculated as: Actual quantity sold * (actual selling price - planned selling price). In the example, the sales price variance was 6*($2–$3)= -$6 (U)nfavourable or minus $6, since the sales price was less than planned.

== Sales volume variance ==
Sales Volume Variance is calculated as: budgeted selling price*(actual sales volume-budgeted sales volume)

Sales Volume Variance is further sub-divided into two variances.
# Sales Mix Variance
# Sales Quantity Variance

==Total variance ==
The total variance can thus be seen [[algebra]]ically to be (minus $6) plus (plus $3), giving (minus $3). Or: -6+3=-3.

This result tells us that the negative effect of [[selling]] at a lower price was twice the positive effect of selling at a higher volume than planned. This might have occurred where prices were lowered to increase volume, but actual volume increases did not meet expectations, perhaps due to competitors also cutting their prices, or changes in customer preferences.

==Early life, family, and education==
Pudjiastuti was born 15 January 1965, in [[Pangandaran]], [[West Java]], the daughter of [[Hajji|Haji]] Ahmad Karlan and [[Hajji|Hajjah]] Suwuh Lasminah. She is [[Javanese people|Javanese]], but her family are fifth-generation settlers of Pangandaran which is predominantly [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]]. Her family business was engaged primarily in [[real estate]] and [[livestock]] farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edukasi.kompasiana.com/2014/11/11/keuletan-dan-ketekunan-bisa-mengalahan-budi-pekerti-belajar-dari-menteri-susi-pudjiastuti-685942.html | title=Keuletan dan Ketekunan Bisa "Mengalahkan" Fanatisme Pendidikan Budi Pekerti (Belajar Dari Sosok Menteri Susi Pudjiastuti) | work=Kompasiana | date=11 November 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Mengkaka, Blasius | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218053216/http://edukasi.kompasiana.com/2014/11/11/keuletan-dan-ketekunan-bisa-mengalahan-budi-pekerti-belajar-dari-menteri-susi-pudjiastuti-685942.html | archivedate=18 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[junior high school]], Pudjiastuti continued [[senior high school]] at SMA Negeri 1 Yogyakarta, but did not complete her studies after she was expelled for political activism in the Golput (Golongan Putih, or [[Absentee ballot|absenteeism]] in protest of [[Golkar]] rule) movement, which was banned under then President [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merdeka.com/politik/ini-penyebab-menteri-susi-pudjiastuti-cuma-berijazah-smp.html | title=Ini penyebab Menteri Susi Pudjiastuti cuma berijazah SMP | work=Merdeka | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Simanjuntak, Laurencius }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pudjiastuti was the first Indonesian minister to have never completed a high school education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indopos.co.id/2014/10/susi-pudjiastuti-pengusaha-sukses-tak-lulus-sma-bisa-jadi-menteri.html | title=Susi Pudjiastuti, Pengusaha Sukses Tak Lulus SMA Bisa Jadi Menteri | work=Indopos | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Kurniawan, Aryo | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218065931/http://www.indopos.co.id/2014/10/susi-pudjiastuti-pengusaha-sukses-tak-lulus-sma-bisa-jadi-menteri.html | archivedate=18 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although after she became a government minister she enrolled for a late high school program (''Paket C'') and she officially graduated in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hermansyah |first1=Dadang |title=Menteri Susi Lulus Ujian Paket C dan Dapat Ijazah Setara SMA |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4113497/menteri-susi-lulus-ujian-paket-c-dan-dapat-ijazah-setara-sma |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=detiknews |date=13 July 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susi Pudjiastuti has three children,  Panji Hilmansyah, Nadine Kaiser, and Alvy Xavier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/susi-air-and-mechtronix-team-up-to-develop-cessna-grand-caravan-simulator-117231718.html| title=SUSI AIR AND MECHTRONIX TEAM UP TO DEVELOP CESSNA GRAND CARAVAN SIMULATOR | work=PR News Wire | date=2 March 2014 | accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first son, Panji Hilmansyah, died aged 31 at January 2016 in [[Florida]] due to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.detik.com/berita/3120507/almarhum-panji-hilmansyah-insinyur-pesawat-terbang-putra-menteri-susi&lt;/ref&gt; Susi is divorced and is known to have tattoos and be a chain-smoker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/02/27/the-13466-island-problem | date=27 February 2016 | work=The Economist | title=The 13,466-island problem | accessdate=15 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship and Susi Air==

In 1983 Pudjiastuti embarked on a career as an entrepreneur, starting as a [[seafood]]  distributor at a Fish Auction Facility (TPI) in Pangandaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/17051/who-is-susi-pudjiastuti-indonesias-marine-and-fishery-minister/ | title=Who is Susi Pudjiastuti, Indonesia’s Marine and Fishery Minister? | work=Indopos | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her distributorship evolved into a seafood processing plant in 1996 named PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product which specialized in export-quality [[lobster]]s packaged as "Susi Brand." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://politik.kompasiana.com/2014/10/30/tak-ada-gading-yang-tak-retak-688678.html | title=Tak Ada Gading yang Tak Retak | work=Kompasiana | date=31 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Yuli, Saskia | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218050913/http://politik.kompasiana.com/2014/10/30/tak-ada-gading-yang-tak-retak-688678.html | archivedate=18 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product expanded and began exporting its products to [[Asia]] and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bisnis.liputan6.com/read/2124703/cuma-tamat-smp-bos-susi-air-mampu-jadi-menteri-kelautan | title=Cuma Tamat SMP, Bos Susi Air Mampu Jadi Menteri Kelautan | work=Liputan 6 | date=26 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Dwi Afriyadi ,  Achmad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing demand for PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product's fresh seafood lead to rapid air transport as a necessity for the business. In 2004, Pudjiastuti acquired a [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] and established PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation. The [[Cessna]] was given the call-sign "[[Susi Air]]" and was used to transport fresh Indonesian seafood to Jakarta as well as overseas to [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://politik.kompasiana.com/2014/10/30/tak-ada-gading-yang-tak-retak-688678.html | title=Tak Ada Gading yang Tak Retak | work=Kompasiana | date=30 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218050913/http://politik.kompasiana.com/2014/10/30/tak-ada-gading-yang-tak-retak-688678.html | archivedate=18 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] which devastated [[Aceh]] and the west coast of [[Sumatra]], Susi Air, which at the time only consisted of two [[Cessna Grand Caravan]]s, was one of the first responders which distributed food and supplies to victims in isolated areas of the disaster. During this period, Susi Air was routinely chartered in Aceh by [[NGO]]s for [[humanitarian relief]] missions. The revenues earned from the NGO Aceh missions enabled Susi Air to acquire new airplanes and expand its fleet to routes in [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[Kalimantan]]. Susi Air is now the largest operator of Cessna Grand Caravans in the Asia Pacific region &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/29/executive-column-susi-air-a-business-started-accident.html| title=Executive Column: Susi Air, a business started by accident | work=The Jakarta Post | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment as Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries==
On 26 October 2014, President [[Joko Widodo]] appointed Pudjiastuti as Minister of [[Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (Indonesia)|Marine Affairs and Fisheries]] under his 2014-2019 [[Working Cabinet (Joko Widodo)|working cabinet]]. Prior to accepting her appointment, Pudjiastuti relinquished her position as President Director of  PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product and PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2014/10/26/susi-pudjiastuti-langsung-lengser-dari-jabatan-dirut-susi-air| title=Susi Pudjiastuti Langsung Lengser Dari Jabatan Dirut Susi Air| work=Tribun News | date=26 October 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She inherited an agency in danger of being eliminated. Foreign fishing boats regularly encroached on Indonesian waters surrounding the archipelago's 17,500 islands. She impounded hundreds of foreign fishing boats and then blew them up. Since taking office, most of the 10,000 foreign fishing boats preying on Indonesia's biodiversity have quit Indonesian waters. From 2013–2017 fishing stocks have more than doubled on her watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |last2=Suhartono |first2=Muktita |title=Indonesian minister doesn't mind making enemies |url=https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20180625/282879436483004 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesian 'enforcer' helps revive fishery |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/1248922/meet-indonesias-enforcer-of-the-seas |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |agency=Associated Press |date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2016, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] awarded her the Leaders for a Living Planet Award. This is in recognition of her efforts as Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries in promoting sustainable development in the Indonesian fisheries sector and conservation of the marine ecosystem, as well as her fierce crackdown on illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Susi Pudjiastuti Terima Penghargaan WWF Leaders for a Living Planet | date = 18 September 2016 | work = WWF Indonesia | url = http://www.wwf.or.id/?50982/Susi-Pudjiastuti-Terima-Penghargaan-WWF-Leaders-for-a-Living-Planet | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Susi's aggressive anti-illegal fishing policies have "reduced total fishing effort by at least 25%, (...) [potentially] generate a 14% increase in catch and a 12% increase in profit."&lt;ref name="susipudjiastuti"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Rapid and lasting gains from solving illegal fishing |last1=Cabral|first1=Reniel B.|author2=et al.| date = April 2018 | work = Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0499-1.epdf?shared_access_token=0f0Asv4Lo7P6CA7kwiwIP9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PRh-MpU0vTRaPU4XNu_ty6PpXG9KvG-Nn5n_Og1NcloOQZWPlc45hInonEKvs7oFWh37E9A0Ns-snQqo465Ak9N_l9CjVYu2-NCC3vwIW8LDyBgncd8v0lb7O2vcTR2B0%3D| volume = 2 | pages = 650–658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel''' is a 34-story, 638-room hotel and casino in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] [[Nevada]], owned and operated by Derek and Greg Stevens. 

The D is located at the eastern end of the [[Fremont Street Experience]]. It has a {{convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} casino, several restaurants, a business center, and a pool. The casino now has more than 1,000 slot machines and 22 table games located on two floors.  It is the tallest building in downtown Las Vegas and the second-tallest inside the city limits, having been surpassed by [[Allure Las Vegas]] in 2007.

As Fitzgeralds, it had a "luck of the Irish" theme, with [[shamrock]]s and a [[leprechaun]]. In fall 2012, The D completed a property-wide renovation and rebranding to replace the Irish theme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/173676061.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013014631/http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/173676061.html |date=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/photos/galleries/2012/oct/10/1009DRooms/#axzz2Y0Su4QR4 |title=Renovations at the D Las Vegas - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a more contemporary feel.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
===Sundance Hotel (1980&amp;ndash;1987)===
The '''Sundance Hotel''' opened in 1980 on land owned by [[Moe Dalitz]]. Dalitz, an organized crime figure, faced difficulty from the [[Nevada Gaming Commission|Gaming Commission]], so the casino was nominally run by his associates, Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, who also owned the [[Stardust Resort &amp; Casino|Stardust]] and [[Fremont Hotel and Casino|Fremont]] casinos.&lt;ref name="Newton2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Newton |title=Mr. Mob: The Life and Crimes of Moe Dalitz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZCUIxhP7ikC&amp;pg=PA259 |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3516-6 |pages=259–260|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Sachs and Tobman faced suspension of their gaming licenses due to charges of [[Skimming (casinos)|skimming]]. Dalitz applied to manage the Sundance himself, but the Gaming Commission stalled on his application, until July 1984, when he agreed to surrender management to [[Jackie Gaughan]] until the casino could be sold.

===Fitzgeralds Hotel and Casino (1987&amp;ndash;2012)===
[[File:A-2863813824.jpg|thumb|left|Former casino front under the Fitzgeralds name.]]
Finally, in 1987, the Sundance was sold to [[Fitzgeralds Gaming|Lincoln Management Group]] (later Fitzgeralds Gaming) and renamed as Fitzgeralds Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=Newton2009 /&gt;

In December 2001, with Fitzgeralds Gaming in bankruptcy, [[The Majestic Star Casino, LLC]], owned by [[Don Barden]], bought the property, along with two other Fitzgeralds casinos in Colorado and Mississippi, for a total of $149 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Detroiter Builds Out-Of-State Casino Empire|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/detroiter-builds-out-of-state-casino-empire-119934|accessdate=9 October 2011|newspaper=Casino City Times|date=21 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, Barden became the first [[African American]] casino owner in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwebportal.com/wire/DA.cfm?ArticleID=527 |title=Don Barden, The New Black Face Of Vegas |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210020045/http://www.blackwebportal.com/wire/DA.cfm?ArticleID=527 |archivedate=December 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barden separated Fitzgeralds Las Vegas from the Majestic Star umbrella two years later, to free it from restrictions imposed by the company's lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fitzgeralds’ loss widens on occupancy weakness|first=Liz|last=Benston|date=13 November 2003|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/fitzgeralds-loss-widens-on-occupancy-weakness/|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, it was reported that Barden was pledging the property to generate a $35-million equity stake in a slots-only casino in Pittsburgh, making a sale likely for Fitzgeralds Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Benjamin Spillman | url= http://www.lvrj.com/business/18721114.html | title= 'For sale' sign could be headed for Fitzgeralds | work=Las Vegas Review-Journal | date=7 May 2008 | accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently reported, however, that Barden had no need to sell Fitzgeralds to maintain a stake in the slots-only casino in Pittsburgh and that it would remain an asset which he could use to generate cash for his struggling gambling portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Benjamin Spillman | url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/24623654.html | title=Fitz off the market for now | work=Las Vegas Review-Journal | date=12 July 2008 | accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, several months after Barden's death, his estate sold Fitzgeralds to brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, majority owners of the [[Golden Gate Hotel and Casino|Golden Gate]] casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fitzgerald's new owners plan makeover, new name |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |first=Caitlin |last=McGarry |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/fitzgerald-s-new-owners-plan-makeover-new-name-132843123.html |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek took a 78% ownership share, with 22% for Greg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stevens brothers get approval of Fitzgeralds purchase, say they’re planning upgrades |first=Cy |last=Ryan |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/oct/20/stevens-brothers-get-approval-purchase-fitzgeralds/ |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The D Las Vegas (2012&amp;ndash;present)===
The new owners completed a $22 million renovation and rebranding to become the D Las Vegas in Fall 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stutzlas |first=Howard |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/derek-stevens-integral-downtown-revival |title=Derek Stevens integral to downtown revival &amp;#124; Las Vegas Review-Journal |publisher=Reviewjournal.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel stands for "downtown", and also refers to Derek Stevens' nickname, and the Stevens' hometown of [[Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fitzgeralds in downtown Vegas to become the D |author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57396670/fitzgeralds-in-downtown-vegas-to-become-the-d/ |work=CBS News |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remodel gave the property a more modern feel, including the addition of dancing dealers in table games. The second-floor casino has a "Vintage Vegas" theme featuring one of the only operational [[Sigma Derby]] games in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The multimillion-dollar renovation upgraded all of the guest rooms and created luxury suites. The D also added a fine Italian steakhouse, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2013/jan/22/d-imports-new-steakhouse-detroit/ |title=The D imports new steakhouse from Detroit |publisher=Vegas Inc |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened the first [[American Coney Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/oct/03/original-american-coney-island-dog-stand-coming-la/#axzz2XveLhXRT |title=Original American Coney Island dog stand coming to Las Vegas - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside of Michigan on the building's Fremont Street frontage. The property also features three distinct bars: Longbar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stapleton |first=Susan |url=http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2012/03/13/fitzgeralds-converts-to-d-las-vegas-with-one-longbar.php |title=Fitzgerald's Converts to D Las Vegas with One Longbar - Eater Vegas |publisher=Vegas.eater.com |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to be the longest bar in Nevada at just fewer than 100 feet long; D Bar – a permanent outdoor bar on Fremont Street Experience featuring flair bartenders as well as dancing bartenders;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/properties-fremont-street-turn-permanent-bars |title=Properties on Fremont Street turn to permanent bars &amp;#124; Las Vegas Review-Journal |publisher=Reviewjournal.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vue Bar inside the second floor casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtown-vegas.com/hotel-the-d-las-vegas/ |title=downtown-vegas.com |publisher=downtown-vegas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property's Fremont Street façade was enhanced with the addition of an exterior escalator and interactive video exhibition created by former Cirque du Soleil producer Roger Parent, which together feature more than 40 giant flat-screen monitors combined with hundreds of feet of LED signage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.vegas.com/las-vegas-hotels/a-resort-is-reborn-under-new-ownership-in-downtown-las-vegas-24772/ |title=A resort is reborn under new ownership in downtown Las Vegas &amp;#124; Las Vegas Blogs |publisher=Blog.vegas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parent is also responsible for the casino's interior escalator which uses LED technology and music depicting vintage imagery to transport guests to the vintage second-floor casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sylvester |first=Ron |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/mar/07/elevating-senses-escalator-d-las-vegas-features-to/ |title=Elevating the senses: Escalator at D Las Vegas features touch of Cirque - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, The D added an exterior video wall promoted as the "World's Largest Keno Board", displaying a live feed of keno numbers as they're drawn inside the casino.

In 2013, the D expanded into hosting [[martial arts]] events as the venue hosted [http://www.lionfight.com/ Lion Fight] 11, a [[Muay Thai]] Tournament. The main event featured a match between [[Tetsuya Yamato]], former [[World Boxing Council Muaythai|WBC Muay Thai]] Japan Champion, and [[Kevin Ross (kickboxer)|Kevin Ross]], an American Muay Thai boxer. In addition, Lion Fight 11 was featured on [[AXS TV]], a company founded by [[Mark Cuban]].

In late 2013, the D became the first casino in the world to accept [[bitcoin]] for hotel rooms, restaurants, and gift shop items. Additionally, a [[bitcoin ATM]] was installed next to the gaming floor where customers can buy and sell bitcoin instantly for cash. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3035594/why-bitcoin-is-poised-to-win-big-in-las-vegas&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trading while insolvent''' is unlawful in a number of legal systems, and may result in the directors becoming personally liable for a company's debts.

Under [[UK insolvency law]] trading once a company is legally insolvent can trigger several provisions of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110709051253/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 July 2011|website=Insolvency.gov.uk|publisher=UK Statutes Crown|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Wrongful trading]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 214
*[[Undervalue transaction|Transaction at an undervalue]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 238
*[[Unfair preference|Preferences]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 239
*Extortionate credit transactions&amp;nbsp;– Section 244

A limited company becomes [[insolvent]] when it can no longer pay its bills when due, or its liabilities—including [[contingent liabilities]] such as [[redundancy payments]]—outweigh the company’s assets. This is a critical point in the lifespan of a company as it denotes when the [[Director (business)|directors]]' responsibilities change from the [[shareholders]] to the [[creditors]]. It also means that the directors need to be extremely careful when considering whether to continue to trade, or not. Any director who knows that the company is insolvent and makes the decision to continue to [[Trade (financial instrument)|trade]], and in doing so increases the debts of the company can be made liable for the company debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading whilst insolvent|url=https://www.companyliquidation.solutions/trading-whilst-insolvent-wrongful-trading/|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In most legal systems, the liability in respect of other transactions only extends for a certain period of time prior to the company going into liquidation. In the UK, directors are exposed in respect of transaction at an undervalue, preferences, and extortionate credit transactions if the transaction occurred: a) while the company was insolvent; and b) within 2 years before the onset of liquidation if the transaction was with a connected person, and 6 months if the transaction was with an unconnected person.

Directors who continue to trade while insolvent may face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provision of this act, when a company goes into [[liquidation]], the liquidator must make a report to the Disqualification Unit of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] on the conduct of all directors. If the liquidator has come across any conduct which makes the director unfit to be involved in the management of a company in the future (which things would include trading while insolvent) the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will apply to the Court for an order disqualifying the director or directors from acting as a [[Board of directors|company director]] for a certain period of time.

Many other countries have similar laws, often referred to as 'insolvent trading' or [[wrongful trading]].
