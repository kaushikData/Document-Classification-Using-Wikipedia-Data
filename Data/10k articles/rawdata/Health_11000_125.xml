The '''2009 Southeast Asian haze''' was an episode of large scale [[air pollution]] primarily caused by [[slash and burn]] practices used to clear land for agricultural purposes in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It affected the areas surrounding the [[Straits of Malacca]] which besides Indonesia include [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

The haze began in early June 2009 and progressively became worse toward July. With a prevailing dry season caused by [[El Nino]], burning and hence the haze was expected to continue until August or September when the [[monsoon]] season arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Indonesia forest fires flare, Malaysia hit by haze | publisher=Reuters | date=12 June 2009 | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idINTRE55B1BX20090612?sp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acquired generalized lipodystrophy''' (also known as "Lawrence syndrome,"&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set|author1=Rapini, Ronald P.|author2=Bolognia, Jean L.|author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L.|publisher=Mosby|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1|location=St. Louis|pages=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Lawrence–Seip syndrome",&lt;ref name="Bolognia" /&gt; abbreviation: AGL) is a rare [[skin condition]] that appears during childhood or adolescence, characterized by [[Lipodystrophy|fat loss]] affecting large areas of the body, particularly the face, arms, and legs.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book|title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology|author1=James, William D.|author2=Berger, Timothy G.|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6|location=|pages=|doi=|oclc=|display-authors=etal|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|496}} There are 4 types of [[lipodystrophy]] based on its onset and areas affected: acquired or [[Inherited disease|inherited]] ([[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or familial), and generalized or [[Partial lipodystrophy|partial]]. Both acquired or inherited lipodystrophy present as loss of [[adipose tissue]]s. The near-total loss of [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[adipose tissue]] is termed generalized lipodystrophy while the selective loss of adipose tissues is denoted as partial lipodystrophy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Rebecca J.|last2=Chan|first2=Jean L.|last3=Jaffe|first3=Elaine S.|last4=Cochran|first4=Elaine|last5=DePaoli|first5=Alex M.|last6=Gautier|first6=Jean-Francois|last7=Goujard|first7=Cecile|last8=Vigouroux|first8=Corinne|last9=Gorden|first9=Phillip|date=2016-01-02|title=Lymphoma in acquired generalized lipodystrophy|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=57|issue=1|pages=45–50|doi=10.3109/10428194.2015.1040015|pmid=25864863|pmc=4755279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as the name suggests, AGL is a near-total deficiency of adipose tissues in the body that is developed later in life. It is an extremely rare disease that only about 100 cases are reported worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Abhimanyu|date=2004-03-18|title=Acquired and Inherited Lipodystrophies|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=350|issue=12|pages=1220–1234|doi=10.1056/nejmra025261|pmid=15028826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=79086|title=Orphanet: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy|last=RESERVED|first=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|website=www.orpha.net|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main etiologies of AGL suspected: [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]], [[panniculitis]]-associated, or [[Idiopathy|idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hussain|first=Iram|last2=Garg|first2=Abhimanyu|title=Lipodystrophy Syndromes|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889852916300706|journal=Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America|volume=45|issue=4|pages=783–797|doi=10.1016/j.ecl.2016.06.012|pmid=27823605|pmc=4947059|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its onset, the disease progresses over a few days, weeks, months, or even in years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clinical presentations of AGL are similar to other lipodystrophies, including metabolic complications and hypoleptinemia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Treatments are also similar and mainly supportive for symptomatic alleviation. Although HIV- or drug-induced lipodystrophy are a type of acquired lipodystrophy, its origin is very specific and distinct hence is usually not discussed with AGL (see [[HIV-associated lipodystrophy|HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy]]).

== Symptoms  ==
The clinical presentation is similar to people with [[congenital lipodystrophy]]: the only difference is that AGL patients are born with normal fat distribution and symptoms develop in childhood and adolescence years and rarely begins after 30 years of age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Females are more often affected than males, with ratio being 3:1.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greenspan's basic &amp; clinical endocrinology|others=Gardner, David G.,, Shoback, Dolores M.,, Greenspan, Francis S. (Francis Sorrel), 1920-|isbn=9781259589287|edition=Tenth|location=[New York]|oclc=995848612|last1 = Gardner|first1 = David G.|last2=Shoback|first2=Dolores M.|date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hallmark characteristics are widespread loss of [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous fat]], ectopic fat deposition, [[leptin]] deficiency, and severe [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic abnormalities]] such as [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musso|first=Carla|last2=Major|first2=Maria Laura|last3=Andres|first3=Eugenia|last4=Simha|first4=Vinaya|date=2017-01-05|title=Metreleptin Treatment in Three Patients with Generalized Lipodystrophy|journal=Clinical Medicine Insights: Case Reports|language=en|volume=9|pages=123–127|doi=10.4137/ccrep.s40196|pmid=28096701|pmc=5217977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subcutaneous fat loss in AGL patients are visible in all parts of the body. AGL mostly affects face and the extremities and may look sunken or swollen in the eyes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the degree and location of severity may vary by person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Especially, intra-abdominal fat loss is variable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As subcutaneous fat is lost, affected areas show prominent structures of veins and muscle. Those with panniculitis-associated AGL may present erythematous nodules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Billings|first=J. K.|last2=Milgraum|first2=S. S.|last3=Gupta|first3=A. K.|last4=Headington|first4=J. T.|last5=Rasmussen|first5=J. E.|date=December 1987|title=Lipoatrophic panniculitis: a possible autoimmune inflammatory disease of fat. Report of three cases|journal=Archives of Dermatology|volume=123|issue=12|pages=1662–1666|pmid=3688906|doi=10.1001/archderm.123.12.1662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metabolic complications include insulin resistance, high metabolic rate, and uncontrolled lipid levels such as hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and high LDL. Patients may develop [[diabetes mellitus]] secondary to [[insulin resistance]].

Recent case reports revealed that [[lymphoma]] is present in some patients but its prevalence is not known at this time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Cause  ==
There is no known cause for this disease; however, three origins of AGL are generally suspected: [[panniculitis]]-associated, [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]]-associated, and [[Idiopathy|idiopathic]] AGLs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Triggers may include [[infection]]s that aggravate the [[panniculitis]], or any disease state that can induce [[autoimmunity]]. Overlap between panniculitis and autoimmune types also exists.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handelsman|first=Yehuda|last2=Oral|first2=Elif A.|last3=Bloomgarden|first3=Zachary T.|last4=Brown|first4=Rebecca J.|last5=Chan|first5=Jean L.|last6=Einhorn|first6=Daniel|last7=Garber|first7=Alan J.|last8=Garg|first8=Abhimanyu|last9=Garvey|first9=W.

=== [[Panniculitis]]-associated AGL ===

About 25% of previously reported AGL is associated with [[panniculitis]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Panniculitis]] is an inflammatory nodules of the subcutaneous fat, and in this type of AGL, adipose destruction originates locally at the infection or inflammation site and develops into [[Lipodystrophy|generalized lipodystrophy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== [[Autoimmunity|Autoimmune]]-associated AGL ===

AGL with autoimmune origin is responsible for about 25% of all AGL reports.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Those with autoimmune origin stems from other autoimmune diseases, most commonly with [[juvenile dermatomyositis]] and [[autoimmune hepatitis]], but also occurs with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematous]], and [[Sjögren syndrome|Sjogren syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== [[Idiopathy|Idiopathic]] AGL ===

Although idiopathic AGL accounts for about 50% of all AGL, it can vary in its origin and its is unclear how it develops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

No known preventive measurement has been reported.

== Mechanism ==
The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is mostly unknown; however, each of three main origins, autoimmune, panniculitis, or idiopathic, may have different mechanisms of pathogenesis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nolis|first=Tom|title=Exploring the pathophysiology behind the more common genetic and acquired lipodystrophies|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=59|issue=1|pages=16–23|doi=10.1038/jhg.2013.107|pmid=24152769|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, [[adipose tissue]]s contain [[adipocyte]]s to store fat for energy during [[fasting]] period and release [[leptin]] to regulate [[homeostasis]] of energy and sensitize insulin. In AGL patients, adipose tissues are insufficient and leads to fat deposition in non-adipose tissues, such as [[muscle]] or [[liver]], resulting in [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. Continuous elevation in [[triglyceride]] levels further contributes to metabolic problems including [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oral|first=Elif Arioglu|last2=Simha|first2=Vinaya|last3=Ruiz|first3=Elaine|last4=Andewelt|first4=Alexa|last5=Premkumar|first5=Ahalya|last6=Snell|first6=Peter|last7=Wagner|first7=Anthony J.|last8=DePaoli|first8=Alex M.|last9=Reitman|first9=Marc L.|date=2002-02-21|title=Leptin-Replacement Therapy for Lipodystrophy|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=8|pages=570–578|doi=10.1056/nejmoa012437|pmid=11856796}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the level of [[leptin]] in the body is proportional to the amount of adipose tissue present, AGL patients also have a deficiency of [[leptin]] which contributes to excessive eating and worsens the [[metabolic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a few patients with AGL, the presence of [[Antibody|antibodies]] against [[adipocyte]] has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hübler|first=A.|last2=Abendroth|first2=K.|last3=Keiner|first3=T.|last4=Stöcker|first4=W.|last5=Kauf|first5=E.|last6=Hein|first6=G.|last7=Stein|first7=G.|date=1998|title=Dysregulation of insulin-like growth factors in a case of generalized acquired lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus (Lawrence Syndrome) connected with autoantibodies against adipocyte membranes|journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Diabetes|volume=106|issue=1|pages=79–84|doi=10.1055/s-0029-1211955|pmid=9516065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made comprehensively, together with visual observation, body fat assessment, a review of lab panels consisting of A1c, glucose, lipid, and patient history.

Caliper measurements of skinfold thickness is recommended to quantify fat loss as a supportive information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In this measurement, skinfold thickness of less than 10mm for men and 22mm for women at the anterior thigh is suggestive cutoff for the diagnosis of lipodystrophy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Less commonly, biphotonic absorptiometry and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can be done for the measurement of body fat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other forms of insulin resistance may be assessed for [[differential diagnosis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Resistance to conventional therapy for hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia serves as an indication for lipodystrophy. Specifically, the diagnosis is strongly considered for those requiring ≥200 units/day of insulin and persistent elevation of ≥250&amp;nbsp;mg/dl of triglyceride levels.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The use of leptin levels should be carefully approached.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While low leptin levels are helpful for making the diagnosis, they are not specific for the lipodystrophy. High leptin levels can help excluding the possible lipodystrophy, but there is no well-established standardized leptin ranges.

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Initial and general approach for AGL patients are to treat the metabolic complications such as [[leptin]]-replacement therapy and/or to control the abnormal levels of [[lipid]]s or [[glucose]] levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Anti-diabetic medication]]s such as [[insulin]], [[metformin]], or [[thiazolidinedione]]s are used for insulin-resistance or high glucose levels, or [[statin]]s or [[fibrate]]s are used for [[hyperlipidemia]]. If symptoms persist, [[metreleptin]] can be prescribed.

[[Metreleptin]] (MYALEPT'''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;)''' is a recombinant human [[leptin]] analog and was approved by FDA in 2014 for generalized lipodystrophy as an adjunct therapy to diet to treat the complication of [[leptin]] deficiency.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myalept.com/|title=Homepage {{!}} Myalept|website=www.myalept.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only drug option approved for generalized lipodystrophy-related symptoms and is not intended to use for patients with [[HIV-associated lipodystrophy|HIV-related lipodystrophy]] or complications of [[partial lipodystrophy]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Although it is a recombinant human leptin analog, it is not completely the same as natural leptin as it is produced in ''[[Escherichia coli|e. coli]]'' and has added [[methionine]] residues at is amino terminus.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It works by binding to the human [[leptin receptor]], [[Leptin receptor|ObR]], and activates the [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The receptor belongs to the Class I [[Cytokine|cytokine family]] and signals the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK/STAT pathway]]. It is available as 11.3&amp;nbsp;mg powder in a vial for subcutaneous injection upon reconstitution and needs to be protected from the light. For treatment, patients and their doctors need to be enrolled and certified in the [[Metreleptin|Myalept]]'''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''' [[Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy|Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)]] Program because people on this treatment has a risk of developing anti-metreleptin [[Antibody|antibodies]] that decrease the effectiveness of metreleptin, and increased risk of [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Clinical study with GL patients who took [[metreleptin]] had increased [[insulin]] sensitivity, as indicated by decreased [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA1c]] and fasting glucose level, and reduced caloric intake as well as fasting [[triglyceride]] levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Plasmapheresis]] was previously an option for lowering extremely high [[triglyceride]] levels for preventing [[pancreatitis]] and painful [[xanthoma]], but its use has been decreased after the approval of metreleptin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolan|first=Charles|last2=Oral|first2=Elif Arioglu|last3=Gorden|first3=Phillip|last4=Taylor|first4=Simeon|last5=Leitman|first5=Susan F.|date=January 2002|title=Intensive, long-term plasma exchange therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia in acquired generalized lipoatrophy|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=87|issue=1|pages=380–384|doi=10.1210/jcem.87.1.8176|pmid=11788680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic treatments, such as [[facial reconstruction]] or [[Implant (body modification)|implant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, can be done &lt;nowiki/&gt;to replace [[adipose tissue]]s.

Lifestyle modifications are also recommended, including changes into less fat diet and exercise.

The [[prognosis]] of the disease is unknown as of December, 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Recent research ==
Many researches for the treatment of lipodystrophy focus on the safety and efficacy of leptin replacement therapy and the outlook is positive in many studies.

According to a prospective, open-label clinical study at the NIH, metreleptin decreased the fasting glucose level from 180&amp;nbsp;mg/dL to 121&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, HbA1c from 8.4% to 6.4%, total cholesterol from 214&amp;nbsp;mg/dL to 146&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, and triglycerides from 467 (200-847)mg/dL to 180 (106-312)mg/dL after 12 months of use (p&lt;0.001).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diker-Cohen|first=Talia|last2=Cochran|first2=Elaine|last3=Gorden|first3=Phillip|last4=Brown|first4=Rebecca J.|date=2015-05-01|title=Partial and Generalized Lipodystrophy: Comparison of Baseline Characteristics and Response to Metreleptin|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1802–1810|doi=10.1210/jc.2014-4491|pmid=25734254|pmc=4422900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients also had decreased use of anti-diabetic medications, lipid-lowering medications, and insulin (p&lt;0.001).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In other clinical reports studying 3 patients diagnosed with AGL accompanied by hypoleptinemia, uncontrolled diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia who were treated with metreleptin for 12–168 weeks, patients had great reduction in HbA1c, from 10.9% to 5.8%, and had normalized serum triglycerides with a mean decline of 90%. Patients reported improved quality of life and reduced need for other medications without significant adverse effects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

One research published in 2017 reported an middle-aged patient developed AGL after treatment and recovery for autoimmune thrombocytopenia that included immunoglobulin therapy and prednisone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Julia|last2=Nadal|first2=Rosa|last3=Broome|first3=Catherine|title=Acquired Generalized Lipodystrophy Following Immune Thrombocytopenia|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000293431730503X|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=130|issue=10|pages=e445–e446|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.04.035|pmid=28549922|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests the autoimmune trigger may contribute to the development of AGL.

Other researches focus on genetics of lipodystrophy; however its relevance to acquired generalized lipodystrophy has not been confirmed so far. One clinical report published in July 2017 stated two brothers with juvenile-onset generalized lipodystrophy was due to [[lamin]] C-specific mutation but it is unknown at this point if this will fall into acquired or familial lipodystrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patni|first=Nivedita|last2=Xing|first2=Chao|last3=Agarwal|first3=Anil K.|last4=Garg|first4=Abhimanyu|date=2017-09-01|title=Juvenile-onset generalized lipodystrophy due to a novel heterozygous missense LMNA mutation affecting lamin C|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|language=en|volume=173|issue=9|pages=2517–2521|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.38341|pmid=28686329|pmc=5593256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been many published case reports. Meta-analysis of published case reports published within the decade will be very helpful in establishing patient demographic, etiologies, and prognosis of the diagnosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7297">The '''British Occupational Hygiene Society''' (BOHS), whose vision is ''a healthy working environment for everyone'', was established as a charity in 1953 to reduce work-related ill-health, and makes a distinct and valuable contribution to preventing ill-health in the workplace.  BOHS is both a learned society, publishing the world-renowned, scientific, peer-reviewed journal, ''Annals of Occupational Hygiene'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/ Annals of Occupational Hygiene]&lt;/ref&gt; and the only professional society representing qualified [[occupational hygienists]] in the UK. The Society supports, develops and connects its members with resources, guidance, events and training, and encourages new members. Its Faculty of Occupational Hygiene  sets professional standards and is the only UK examining board for qualifications in occupational hygiene which are recognised internationally.

BOHS is the only UK based organisation that:
* brings together everyone involved in the science and practical application of occupational hygiene
* champions and facilitates the development of professional competency
* promotes the science and practice of occupational hygiene worldwide

== Occupational hygiene ==
Occupational hygiene is the scientific discipline that protects people against the wide range of health risks that can arise from exposure to health hazards at work. The breadth of knowledge and skills brought together in occupational hygiene is unique.

It focuses:
* on the recognition of hazards, assessment of exposure, and control of risks to health
* at the interface of people with the workplace and work activities
* where science and engineering meet the human element of work

== Structure ==
BOHS is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation which is managed by a board of directors, known as the Council. The Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is run by the Faculty Board and reports to Council through its Registrar. The Society’s Head Office, based in Derby, is led by a Chief Executive  who is directly accountable to Council, with a senior management team responsible for finance and operations, membership services, conferences and events, publications, examinations management, marketing and communications, and overall administrative services. It also has a range of committees, chaired by members and with input from other volunteers and staff; these committees, alongside a team of regional organisers (also volunteers from the membership) provide technical, strategic and project-by-project input to the Society’s various initiatives and on-going activities.

== Faculty of Occupational Hygiene ==
The Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is the professional arm of BOHS. Membership is restricted to BOHS members with specific qualifications in occupational hygiene and related subjects.

As the examining board for the profession, the Faculty administers a suite of examinations and awards qualifications in occupational hygiene and allied subjects, and provides a qualifications’ verification service. 

The Faculty also runs the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Scheme, which is mandatory for all non-retired Faculty members. 

It maintains a Directory of Occupational Hygiene Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohs.org/OHServices-directory/ Directory of Occupational Hygiene Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614161913/http://www.bohs.org/OHServices-directory/ |date=June 14, 2011 }} British Occupational Hygiene Society&lt;/ref&gt; which is searchable online or available in hard copy, and is free of charge.

==Affiliations==
BOHS is a founding member of the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA). It has collaborated with other global organisations including the [[International Labour Organization]], [[World Health Organization]], [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]], [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]], and [[Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors]], among others to carry out research, develop training and sponsor conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohs.org/usefullinkspartners/ Partner Organisations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001134123/http://www.bohs.org/usefullinkspartners/ |date=October 1, 2011 }}. British Occupational Hygiene Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Occupational Hygiene Society has worked in partnership with a number of health and safety professional bodies to develop the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultant Register ([[OSHCR]]). This will establish a new benchmark standard for health and safety consultants and help to raise the quality of advice being given to businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshcr.org/ Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register]. OSHCR.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
BOHS publishes the ''Annals of Occupational Hygiene'', a peer-reviewed scientific journal (via [[Oxford University Press]]). Additionally, the Society produces Exposure magazine, e-bulletins, guidance and position statements, and a directory of occupational hygiene services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohs.org/library/ Publications] British Occupational Hygiene Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Every two years, BOHS awards the Thomas Bedford Memorial Prize. Named for the society's first president and instituted initially in 1978, the prize is given to the best paper in the ''Annals of Occupational Hygiene'' and includes a £500 award. BOHS also gives the Ted King and David Hickish Awards to recognize top certificate- and diploma-earning hygienists. Annually, the Peter Isaac Award is given each year to honor an occupational hygienist for valuable contributions workplace health. The Bedford Award which was instituted in 1978, named after the first President of BOHS, Thomas Bedford CBE, and is the Society’s prime honour. It is awarded irregularly, and marks outstanding contributions to the discipline of occupational hygiene, either in the general field or in work for the Society.

'''Candex''' is a [[dietary supplement]] manufactured by [[Pure Essence Laboratories]]. It is marketed as an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] remedy to treat the yeast infection [[Candida (genus)|candida]]. Having the status of a [[dietary supplement]], its efficiency has not been proven in scientifically controlled and peer-reviewed trials. Similar formulas exist, such as [[Candigest]].

==Mechanism of action==
Candex contains the fibre digesting [[enzyme]]s, [[cellulase]] and hemicellulase. The manufacturer claims because yeast cell walls are built mainly of fibre, which is mostly made of the complex carbohydrate, [[cellulose]], cellulase and hemicellulase are capable of killing yeast.

However, a review of the scientific literature suggests that this mechanism of action is unlikely to be true. For while plant [[cell wall]]s are made predominantly of [[cellulose]], yeast [[cell wall]]s are not ([[yeast]] are classified as fungi).  For example, in the article, "Synthesis of the yeast cell wall and its regulation" in the ''Annual Review of Biochemistry'', there is mention of many other complex carbohydrates found in yeast cell walls, but there is no mention of cellulose&lt;ref name="Synthesis of the Yeast Cell Wall and its Regulation"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bi.51.070182.003555 | title=Synthesis of the Yeast Cell Wall and its Regulation | author=E Cabib | author2=R Roberts | author3=B Bowers | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |date=July 1982 | volume=51 | pages=763–793 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.51.070182.003555}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is cellulose mentioned as a cell wall component in ''[[candida albicans]]'', the yeast strain most frequently associated with human fungal infections.&lt;ref name="Surface Glycans of Candida albicans"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Surface Glycans of Candida albicans and Other Pathogenic Fungi | author=Masuoka, J | journal=Clinical Reviews of Microbiology |date=April 2004 | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=281–310 | doi=10.1128/cmr.17.2.281-310.2004 | pmid=15084502 | pmc=387410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, scientists have even modified yeast cells so they can make their own cellulases. This allows the modified yeast to ferment widely available plant material, which is made mostly of cellulose, and turn plant cellulose into alcohol for biofuels ([[cellulosic ethanol]]). One scientific article even called yeast an "ideal host strain" for producing cellulases.&lt;ref name="Endowing non-cellulolytic microorganisms with cellulolytic activity"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=23473971 | title=Endowing non-cellulolytic microorganisms with cellulolytic activity aiming for consolidated bioprocessing. | vauthors=Yamada R, Hasunuma T, Kondo A | journal=Biotechnol Adv |date=Nov 2013 | volume=31 | issue=6 | pages=754–63 | doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with cellulase not being toxic to yeast and no mention was made of any toxic effect of cellulases on the modified yeast.

Furthermore, while many internet sites claim that cellulase enzymes might degrade the [[chitin]] found in yeast cell walls, once again no evidence is presented for this.  [[Enzymes]] are known to be highly specific and in general cellulases have not been found to be active on chitin. To quote one scientific article: "The purified cellulase was devoid of
chitinase, pectinase and mannanase activities".&lt;ref name="Substrate Specificity of a Cellulase"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/169/0389/1690389.pdf | title=Substrate Specificity and Mode ofAction of a Celiulase | author=PL Hurst | author2=PA Sullivan | author3=MG Sheperd | journal=Biochem. J. | year=1978 | volume=169 | pages=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, in contrast to the previously mentioned fact that yeast bioengineered to make cellulases remain healthy,&lt;ref name="Endowing non-cellulolytic microorganisms with cellulolytic activity" /&gt; when a [[chitinase]] gene was bioengineered into the same yeast strain it resulted in complete growth inhibition.&lt;ref name="Growth inhibition"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Growth inhibition of the yeast transformant by the expression of a chitinase from Coprinellus congregatus. | vauthors=Lim H, Choi HT | journal=J Microbiol |date=Oct 2010 | volume=48 | issue=5 | pages=706–708 | doi=10.1007/s12275-010-0272-x | pmid=21046352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again suggests cellulases do not in general contain significant chitinase activity.
  
Similarly, although many internet sites claim cellulase degrades yeast [[biofilm]]s, no peer-reviewed scientific evidence was offered in support of this. The exact chemical composition of yeast biofilms remains poorly understood and although there is evidence for it containing many different types of [[polysaccharides]], there was no evidence presented that it contains [[cellulose]] or is susceptible to cellulase digest.&lt;ref name="Biofilm matrix of Candida albicans"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/55/8/999.long | title=Biofilm matrix of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis: chemical composition and role in drug resistance | author=MA Al-Fattani | author2=LJ Douglas | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |date=Aug 2006 | volume=55 | pages=999–1008 | doi=10.1099/jmm.0.46569-0 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacturer further claims Candex enzymes kill yeast but don't stimulate the yeast to release toxins, thereby avoiding unpleasant [[Herxheimer reaction|die-off]] reactions, contrary to using [[fungicide|fungicidal]] drugs and herbs. But once again, there is no reference to a [[peer-reviewed]] scientific journal to support these claims. An alternative explanation might be that there are no unpleasant die-off reactions simply because the Candex enzymes do not effectively kill yeast.

The remaining enzymes found in Candex: [[amylase]], [[glucoamylase]], [[diastase]], and [[invertase]] are involved in basic carbohydrate and sugar [[metabolic]] pathways and are not involved in cell wall [[lysis]]. For example, [[Invertase]] catalyzes the conversion of [[sucrose]] (common table sugar) into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Much of the invertase used in the food industry is actually purified from yeast itself as yeast contain an abundance of their own naturally produced invertase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eng.umd.edu/~nsw/ench485/lab14.htm | title=Enzyme Kinetics of Invertase | accessdate=5 December 2013 | author=Nam Sun Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug status==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
Being classified as a [[dietary supplement]], it is not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] to diagnose, treat, or prevent any condition of disease.

===Trials and tests===
A non-verified study from 2002 by the Progressive Medical Group claims that after testing the remedy on 52 patients, all of them had "at least minimal improvement not only in any upper gastrointestinal symptoms (probably associated with the natural digestive enzyme), but also in lower gastrointestinal symptoms and yeast-associated problems (altered cognition, craving carbohydrates, arthralgias, myalgias, allergies, etc.)." The study claims that side effects were "minimal with only rare gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, etc.) that resolved when association with food intake was altered", and that these side effects were deemed to not be statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coastherbal.com/product_info.php/products_id/329 Candex, A Clinical Study, CoastHerbal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The study has not been reviewed by scientific peers, nor published in medical journals.  Some have questioned its usefulness due to the lack of a control group.

As of January 2007, no [[peer review]]ed articles were indexed by the [[National Library of Medicine]] referencing Candex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed PubMed database, 21 Jan. 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditions associated with the '''childbirth in Uzbekistan''' are based on merging of the traditions of various ethnic groups which contributed to the creation of the [[Uzbek people]].&lt;ref name=beshiktui/&gt;

==Birth of a child==
The birth of a child is usually accompanied with “[[Aqiqah]]”. Based on the means of the family they are slaughtering one sheep during the birth of a girl and two- for the birth of a boy. After 9, 10, or 11 days after the birth of the boy they carried the rite of laying baby into the Beshik (cradle), and after 21 or 40 days (Chilla – 40 days after the birth) as a rule they arranged “Beshik Tuyi” ("cradle celebration").&lt;ref name=beshiktui&gt;[http://khorezm.zn.uz/hotels-in-khorezm/traditional-ceremonies-khorezm-in-the-example-beshik-tui-sunnat-tui-and-lachak-tui/ "“Beshik tui”, “Sunnat tui” and “lachak tui”"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the first child is a girl, it is believed that the seven generations of this family will live in prosperity, and “Beshik Tuyi” is carried out after 7 days from the birth. When the child begins to walk by himself they arranged “Oyek turi”. In Bausun, Sherabad, Altynsay, Denau, Sariasiya regions this ceremony is called “Tushov Kesdi”. They prepare it in advance and fix the date. A child is dressed in new clothes, from the cotton yarn they twist a thin thread (“Toshov”) and tie a child’s feet with it, but so that this thread does not interfere with child’ movement. In the presence of the guests a child begins to walk and with the words “tushov kesildi, tushov kesildi” this thread should be cut with scissors by any of elders. Baby is showered with coins, sweets, what is called “sachala”- “sochki”.

==Special ceremonies==

A traditional rite of sunnat (khatna) tuyi was also called “Sunnat tuyi”&lt;ref name=beshiktui/&gt;– in Obodon, Tula villages of hurchinskiy region; chokborron- in Chakar, Eshon villages of Uzunskiyn region. Sunnat tui&lt;ref&gt;“Sunnat tuyi” ceremony such ceremonies as “Maslahat oshi”, “non pishirar , “mol suyish”, “khatmi kuron tushirish”, “sunnat kildirish” are connected.&lt;/ref&gt; is carried when a child is in an odd number of years, i.e. in 3, 5, 7, in some cases – 9, 11 years.

Depending on the capabilities kurash and kupkari with the prizes were held on the Sunnat tuys. A close relatives ascended to the roof of the house and showered the boy with money and sweets from there.  There were songs, melodies, epics, the men sang “Heyr”, women- “Lo-o-lo”.

In some villages in Northern Surkhan, “Utin yigar” (it is like to collect some woods for housekeeping) events are carried before, the rite in which the boys dividing into the groups and go to the mountains and gather wood. The one, who will pick more firewood, is awarded with the prize. Men responsible for the activity assigned a close friends and relatives for various services. In order to make the event successful and to honor the memory of ancestors they read “Khatmi Kuran” first.

Uzbek people have a saying: “Tuyga tuyona bilan”. (It means to come to the wedding with a gift). Wedding expenses are generally significant and tuyona  (wedding gift) – is the material support from the friends and relatives.

The '''Cholderton and District Water Company''' is a private water supplier, serving an area on the border of [[Hampshire]] and [[Wiltshire]] in the south of England. Until 1st May 2018 it was by far the smallest licensed water company in England and Wales, but since this time is no longer regulated by [[Ofwat]] and its area has formally become part of the area covered by [[Wessex Water]] as a licensed water company.  It supplies about 2500 people over an area of around 21&amp;nbsp;km² in the parishes of [[Cholderton]] and [[Bulford]] in Wiltshire, and [[Shipton Bellinger]], [[Thruxton, Hampshire|Thruxton]], [[Amport]] and [[Quarley]] in Hampshire and is a private limited company with company number 357098.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk UK Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt;

The water company was established by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1904 by [[Henry Charles Stephens]], of [[Finchley]], north London, the son of [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]], the founder of the Stephens Ink Company. It is owned by the Cholderton Estate.

Cholderton and District Water Company does not provide sewerage services; mains sewerage facilities are provided by [[Southern Water]] in its area.

Generally, the terms ''equality of opportunity'' and ''equal opportunity'' are interchangeable, with occasional slight variations; the former has more of a sense of being an abstract political concept while "equal opportunity" is sometimes used as an adjective, usually in the context of employment regulations, to identify an employer, a hiring approach, or law. Equal opportunity provisions have been written into regulations and have been debated in courtrooms.&lt;ref name=twsH44&gt;{{cite news

[[File:FactoryProcessing.png|thumb|In a factory setting, equality of opportunity is often seen as a procedural fairness along the lines of "if you assemble twice as many lamps, you'll be paid double" and in this sense the concept is in contrast to the concept of [[equality of outcome]], which might require that all workers be paid similarly regardless of how many lamps they made]]
According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the concept assumes that society is stratified with a diverse range of roles, some of which are more desirable than others.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; The benefit of equality of opportunity is to bring fairness to the selection process for coveted roles in [[corporations]], [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[nonprofit organizations|nonprofits]], [[universities]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=twsL11&gt;{{citation

[[#Formal equality of opportunity|Formal equality of opportunity]] is a lack of (unfair) direct discrimination. It requires that deliberate discrimination be relevant and meritocratic. For instance, job interviews should only discriminate against applicants for job incompetence. Universities should not accept a less-capable applicant instead of a more-capable applicant who can't pay tuition.

[[#Substantive equality of opportunity|Substantive equality of opportunity]] is absence of indirect discrimination. It requires that society be fair and meritocratic. For instance, a person should not be more likely to die at work because they were born in a country with corrupt labor law enforcement. No one should have to drop out of school because their family needs of a full-time carer or wage earner.

Formal equality of opportunity does not imply substantive equality of opportunity. Firing any employee who gets pregnant is formally equal, but substantively it hurts women more.

Substantive inequality is often more difficult to address. A political party that formally allows anyone to join, but meets in a non-wheelchair-accessible building far from public transit, substantively discriminates against both young and old members as they are less likely to be able-bodied car-owners. However, if the party raises membership dues in order to afford a better building, it discourages poor members instead. Grade-cutoff university admission is formally fair, but if in practice it overwhelmingly picks women and graduates of expensive user-fee schools, it is substantively unfair to men and the poor. The unfairness has already taken place and the university can choose to try to counterbalance it, but it likely can not single-handedly make pre-university opportunities equal. [[Social mobility]] and the [[Great Gatsby curve]] are often used as an indicator of substantive equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;https://milescorak.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/income-inequality-equality-of-opportunity-and-intergenerational-mobility.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Both equality concepts say that it is unfair and inefficient if extraneous factors rule people's lives. Both accept as fair inequality based on relevant, meritocratic factors. They differ in the scope of the methods used to promote them.

Formal equality of opportunity&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt; is sometimes referred to as the nondiscrimination principle&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; or described as the absence of direct discrimination,&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt; or described in the narrow sense as equality of access.&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashmore, Ellis, Dictionary of Race and Ethnic Relations, London: Routledge, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by:
# Open call. Positions bringing superior advantages should be open to all applicants&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; and job openings should be publicized in advance giving applicants a "reasonable opportunity" to apply. Further, all applications should be accepted.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;
# Fair judging. Applications should be judged on their merits,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; with procedures designed to identify those best-qualified.&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; The evaluation of the applicant should be in accord with the duties of the position and for the job opening of choir director, for example, the evaluation may judge applicants based on musical knowledge rather than some arbitrary criterion such as hair color.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;
# An application is chosen. The applicant judged as "most qualified" is offered the position while others are not. There is agreement that the result of the process is again unequal, in the sense that one person has the position while another does not, but that this outcome is deemed fair on procedural grounds.

The formal approach is seen as a somewhat basic "no frills" or "narrow"&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; approach to equality of opportunity, a minimal standard of sorts, limited to the [[public sphere]] as opposed to private areas such as the [[family]], [[marriage]], or [[religion]].&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; What is considered "fair" and "unfair" is spelled out in advance.&lt;ref name=twsL17&gt;{{cite news

In the substantive approach, the starting point before the race begins is unfair since people have had differing experiences before even approaching the competition. The substantive approach examines the applicants themselves before applying for a position and judges whether they have equal abilities or talents; and if not, then it suggests that authorities (usually the government) take steps to make applicants more equal before they get to the point where they compete for a position and fixing the before-the-starting-point issues has sometimes been described as working towards "fair access to qualifications".&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; It seeks to remedy inequalities perhaps because of an "unfair disadvantage" based sometimes on "prejudice in the past".&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt;

According to John Hills, children of wealthy and well-connected parents usually have a decisive advantage over other types of children and he notes that "advantage and disadvantage reinforce themselves over the life cycle, and often on to the next generation" so that successful parents pass along their wealth and education to succeeding generations, making it difficult for others to climb up a social ladder.&lt;ref name=twsH14&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Daiane Conterato2 crop.jpg|thumb|Issues about equal opportunity have been raised about the skin color of runway models at the [[São Paulo Fashion Week]] and in 2009 quotas requiring that at least 10 per cent of models be "black or indigenous" were imposed as a substantive way to counteract a "bias towards white models", according to one account&lt;ref name=twsH43/&gt;]]
In a sense, substantive equality of opportunity moves the "starting point" further back in time. Sometimes it entails the use of [[affirmative action]] policies to help all contenders become equal before they get to the starting point, perhaps with greater training, or sometimes redistributing resources via [[restitution]] or [[taxation]] to make the contenders more equal. It holds that all who have a "genuine opportunity to become qualified" be given a chance to do so and it is sometimes based on a recognition that unfairness exists, hindering [[social mobility]], combined with a sense that the unfairness should not exist or should be lessened in some manner.&lt;ref name=twsH13&gt;{{cite news

The substantive approach tends to have a broader definition of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of a hiring decision. One editorial writer suggested that among the many types of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of hiring decisions was personal beauty, sometimes termed "[[lookism]]": {{quote|Lookism judges individuals by their physical allure rather than abilities or merit.

The substantive position was advocated by [[Bhikhu Parekh]] in 2000 in ''Rethinking Multiculturalism'', in which he wrote that "all citizens should enjoy equal opportunities to acquire the capacities and skills needed to function in society and to pursue their self-chosen goals equally effectively" and that "equalising measures are justified on grounds of justice as well as social integration and harmony".&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, Bhikhu, Rethinking Multiculturalism.

[[Affirmative action]] programs usually fall under the substantive category.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; The idea is to help disadvantaged groups get back to a normal starting position after a long period of [[discrimination]]. The programs involve government action, sometimes with resources being transferred from an advantaged group to a disadvantaged one and these programs have been justified on the grounds that imposing [[:wikt:Quota|quotas]] counterbalances the past discrimination&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; as well as being a "compelling state interest" in diversity in society.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; For example, there was a case in [[São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]] of a quota imposed on the [[São Paulo Fashion Week]] to require that "at least 10 percent of the models to be black or indigenous" as a coercive measure to counteract a "longstanding bias towards white models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Equality of fair opportunity ====
Philosopher [[John Rawls]] offered this variant of substantive equality of opportunity and explained that it happens when individuals with the same "native talent and the same ambition" have the same prospects of success in competitions.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH77e&gt;{{cite news

This would imply that the unmusical individual who wants to be a concert pianist should receive more training than the child prodigy.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;}}

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] agrees mostly with the [[Rawlsian]] approach in that he would like to "create the society each of us would want if we didn’t know in advance who we’d be".&lt;ref name=twsH12/&gt; Krugman elaborated: "If you admit that life is unfair, and that there's only so much you can do about that at the starting line, then you can try to ameliorate the consequences of that unfairness".&lt;ref name=twsH12/&gt;

==== Level playing field ====
[[File:Cesc Fàbregas Anderson.jpg|thumb|The match's outcome is deemed legitimate if there is a level playing field and rules do not favor either player or team arbitrarily (photo: [[w:Cesc Fàbregas|Cesc Fàbregas]] duels with [[w:Anderson Luís de Abreu Oliveira|Anderson]] in a [[football (soccer)|football]] match in 2008)]]
Some theorists have posed a level playing field conception of equality of opportunity,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; similar in many respects to the substantive principle (although it has been used in different contexts to describe formal equality of opportunity)&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; and it is a core idea regarding the subject of [[distributive justice]] espoused by [[John Roemer]]&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roemer, John, 1995, "Equality and Responsibility", Boston Review, April–May issue, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roemer, John, 1998, Equality of Opportunity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald Dworkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald, 2000, ''Sovereign Virtue'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH21&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Like the substantive notion, the level playing field conception goes farther than the usual formal approach.&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; The idea is that initial "unchosen inequalities" – prior circumstances over which an individual had no control, but which impact his or her success in a given competition for a particular post – these unchosen inequalities should be eliminated as much as possible, according to this conception. According to Roemer, society should "do what it can to level the playing field so that all those with relevant potential will eventually be admissible to pools of candidates competing for positions".&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; Afterwards, when an individual competes for a specific post, he or she might make specific choices which cause future inequalities – and these inequalities are deemed acceptable because of the previous presumption of fairness.&lt;ref name=twsH77f&gt;{{cite news

==== Meritocracy ====
There is some overlap among these different conceptions with the term ''[[meritocracy]]'' which describes an administrative system which rewards such factors as individual [[intelligence]], [[credentials]], [[education]], [[morality]], [[knowledge]] or other criteria believed to confer merit. Equality of opportunity is often seen as a major aspect of a meritocracy.&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; One view was that equality of opportunity was more focused on what happens before the race begins while meritocracy is more focused on fairness at the competition stage.&lt;ref name=twsH77b&gt;{{citation

=== Moral senses ===
There is general agreement that equality of opportunity is good for society, although there are diverse views about how it is good since it is a [[value judgement]].&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; It is generally viewed as a positive political ideal in the abstract sense.&lt;ref name=twsH11&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of equal opportunity can conflict with notions of [[meritocracy]] in circumstances in which [[individual differences]] in human abilities are believed to be determined mostly by [[genetics]] as in such circumstances there can be conflict about how to achieve fairness in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Herrnstein, R. J. et al. ''The Bell Curve''. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical considerations ==
=== Difficulties with implementation ===
There is general agreement that programs to bring about certain types of equality of opportunity can be difficult and that efforts to cause one result often have unintended consequences or cause other problems. There is agreement that the formal approach is easier to implement than the others, although there are difficulties there too.

A government policy that requires equal treatment can pose problems for lawmakers. A requirement for government to provide equal health care services for all citizens can be prohibitively expensive. If government seeks equality of opportunity for citizens to get health care by rationing services using a maximization model to try to save money, new difficulties might emerge. For example, trying to ration health care by maximizing the "quality-adjusted years of life" might steer monies away from disabled persons even though they may be more deserving, according to one analysis.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Dan W., 2000, "Health Care Resource Prioritization and Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities," in Leslie Pickering Francis and Anita Silvers, eds., Americans with Disabilities: Exploring Implications of the Law for Individuals and Institutions, New York and London: Routledge, pp. 223–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, BBC News questioned whether it was wise to ask female army recruits to undergo the same strenuous tests as their male counterparts since many women were being injured as a result.&lt;ref name=twsH36&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination can present vexing challenges for policymakers trying to implement equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Norman, 1985, Just Health Care, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKerlie, Dennis, 1989, "Equality and Time," Ethics 99, pp. 475–91&lt;/ref&gt; According to several studies, attempts to be equally fair to both a young and an old person are problematic because the older person has presumably fewer years left to live and it may make more sense for a society to invest greater resources in a younger person's health.&lt;ref&gt;McKerlie, Dennis, 1999, "Justice Between the Young and the Old," Philosophy and Public Affairs 30, pp. 152–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Temkin, Larry S., 1993, Inequality, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; Treating both persons equally while following the letter of the equality of opportunity seems unfair from a different perspective.

Efforts to achieve equal opportunity along one dimension can exacerbate unfairness in other dimensions. For example, take public bathrooms: if for the sake of fairness the physical area of men's and women's bathrooms is equal, the overall result may be unfair since men can use urinals, which require less physical space.&lt;ref name=twsMolotch/&gt; In other words, a more fair arrangement may be to allot more physical space for women's restrooms. The sociologist [[Harvey Holotch]] explained: "By creating men's and women's rooms of the same size, society guarantees that individual women will be worse off than individual men."&lt;ref name=twsMolotch&gt;[[Harvey Molotch]], Sociological Forum, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/684625?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Rest Room and Equal Opportunity]'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 128–132, Retrieved September 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difficulty is that it is hard for a society to bring substantive equality of opportunity to every type of position or industry. If a nation focuses efforts on some industries or positions, then people with other talents may be left out. For example, in an example in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', a warrior society might provide equal opportunity for all kinds of people to achieve military success through fair competition, but people with non-military skills such as farming may be left out.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;

Lawmakers have run into problems trying to implement equality of opportunity. In 2010 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a legal requirement "forcing public bodies to try to reduce inequalities caused by class disadvantage" was scrapped after much debate and replaced by a hope that organizations would try to focus more on "fairness" than "equality" as fairness is generally seen as a much vaguer concept than equality,&lt;ref name=twsH22&gt;{{cite news

=== Difficulties with measurement ===
The consensus view is that trying to measure equality of opportunity is difficult&lt;ref name=twsH77b/&gt; whether examining a single hiring decision or looking at groups over time.
* Single instance. It is possible to reexamine the procedures governing a specific hiring decision, see if they were followed and re-evaluate the selection by asking questions such as "Was it fair? Were fair procedures followed? Was the best applicant selected?". This is a judgment call and it is possible that biases may enter into the minds of decision-makers. The determination of equality of opportunity in such an instance is based on mathematical [[probability]]: if equality of opportunity is in effect, then it is seen as fair if each of two applicants has a 50 per cent chance of winning the job, that is, they both have equal chances to succeed (assuming of course that the person making the probability assessment is unaware of all variables – including valid ones such as talent or skill as well as arbitrary ones such as race or gender). However, it is hard to measure whether each applicant had in fact a 50 per cent chance based on the outcome.
* Groups. When assessing equal opportunity for a type of job or company or industry or nation, then [[statistical analysis]] is often done by looking at patterns and abnormalities,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; typically comparing subgroups with larger groups on a percentage basis. If equality of opportunity is violated, perhaps by [[discrimination]] which affects a subgroup or population over time, it is possible to make this determination using statistical analysis, but there are numerous difficulties involved.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Nevertheless, entities such as city governments&lt;ref name=twsP44a&gt;{{citation

It is difficult to prove unequal treatment although statistical analysis can provide indications of problems, but it is subject to conflicts over interpretation and methodological issues.

Statistical analysis of equal opportunity has been done using sophisticated examinations of computer databases.

=== Marketplace considerations ===
Equal opportunity has been described as a fundamental basic notion in business and commerce and described by [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] as a basic economic precept.&lt;ref name=twsL19/&gt; There has been research suggesting that "competitive markets will tend to drive out such discrimination" since employers or institutions which hire based on arbitrary criteria will be weaker as a result and not perform as well as firms which embrace equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Firms competing for overseas contracts have sometimes argued in the press for equal chances during the bidding process, such as when American oil corporations wanted equal shots at developing oil fields in [[Sumatra]];&lt;ref name=twsH41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and firms, seeing how fairness is beneficial while competing for contracts, can apply the lesson to other areas such as internal hiring and promotion decisions. A report in ''[[USA Today]]'' suggested that the goal of equal opportunity was "being achieved throughout most of the business and government labor markets because major employers pay based on potential and actual productivity".&lt;ref name=twsH52&gt;{{cite news

Fair opportunity practices include measures taken by an organization to ensure fairness in the employment process. A basic definition of equality is the idea of equal treatment and respect. In job advertisements and descriptions, the fact that the employer is an equal opportunity employer is sometimes indicated by the abbreviations EOE or MFDV, which stands for Minority, Female, Disabled, Veteran. Analyst Ross Douthat in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that equality of opportunity depends on a rising [[economy]] which brings new chances for [[social mobility#Upward and downward mobility|upward mobility]] and he suggested that greater equality of opportunity is more easily achieved during "times of plenty".&lt;ref name=twsH16&gt;{{cite news

=== History ===
According to professor [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of Macquarie University, an underlying [[Big History]] trend has been a shift from seeing people as resources to exploit towards a perspective of seeing people as individuals to empower. According to Christian, in many ancient agrarian civilizations, roughly nine of every ten persons was a peasant exploited by a ruling class. In the past thousand years, there has been a gradual movement in the direction of greater respect for equal opportunity as political structures based on generational hierarchies and [[feudalism]] broke down during the late [[Middle Ages]] and new structures emerged during the [[Renaissance]]. [[monarchy|Monarchies]] were replaced by [[democracy|democracies]]: kings were replaced by parliaments and congresses. [[Slavery]] was also abolished generally. The new entity of the [[nation state]] emerged with highly specialized parts, including [[corporation]]s, laws and new ideas about [[citizenship]] as well as values about [[individual rights]] found expression in constitutions, laws and statutes.

[[File:Thurgoodmarshall1967.jpg|thumb|[[African Americans|African-American]] [[civil rights]] lawyer [[Thurgood Marshall]] fought numerous battles in the courts for equal opportunity for all races in the United States; argued the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case and won; and in 1967 was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]]]
In the United States, one legal analyst suggested that the real beginning of the modern sense of equal opportunity was in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] which provided "equal protection under the law".&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; The amendment did not mention equal opportunity directly, but it helped undergird a series of later rulings which dealt with legal struggles, particularly by [[African Americans]] and later women, seeking greater political and economic power in the growing republic. In 1933, a congressional "Unemployment Relief Act" forbade [[discrimination]] "on the basis of race, color, or creed".&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision furthered government initiatives to end discrimination.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt;

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed [[Executive Order 10925]] which enabled a presidential committee on equal opportunity,&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; which was soon followed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Executive Order 11246]].&lt;ref name=twsL33&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became the legal underpinning of equal opportunity in employment.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Businesses and other organizations learned to comply with the rulings by specifying fair hiring and promoting practices and posting these policy notices on bulletin boards, employee handbooks and manuals as well as training sessions and films.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Courts dealt with issues about equal opportunity, such as the 1989 Wards Cove decision, the Supreme Court ruled that statistical evidence by itself was insufficient to prove racial discrimination. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] was established, sometimes reviewing charges of discrimination cases which numbered in the tens of thousands annually during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Some law practices specialized in [[employment law]]. Conflict between formal and substantive approaches manifested itself in backlashes, sometimes described as [[reverse discrimination]], such as the [[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|Bakke case]] when a white male applicant to medical school sued on the basis of being denied admission because of a quota system preferring minority applicants.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfuss, Joel (1979). The Bakke Case: the Politics of Inequality.

=== Measures ===
Many economists measure the degree of equal opportunity with measures of [[economic mobility]]. For instance, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] asserts that with five economic divisions and full equality of opportunity, "20 percent of those in the bottom fifth would see their children in the bottom fifth. Denmark almost achieves that&amp;nbsp;– 25 percent are stuck there. Britain, supposedly notorious for its class divisions, does only a little worse (30 percent). That means they have a 70 percent chance of moving up. The chances of moving up in America, though, are markedly smaller (only 58 percent of children born to the bottom group make it out), and when they do move up, they tend to move up only a little". Similar analyses can be performed for each economic division and overall. They all show how far from the ideal all industrialized nations are and how correlated measures of equal opportunity are with [[income inequality]] and [[wealth inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (pp. 18–19). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Equal opportunity has ramifications beyond income; the American Human Development Index, rooted in the capabilities approach pioneered by [[Amartya Sen]], is used to measure opportunity across geographies in the U.S. using health, education and standard of living outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/|title=Measure of America - Human Development|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is speculation that since equality of opportunity is only one of sometimes competing "justice norms", there is a risk that following equality of opportunity too strictly might cause problems in other areas.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estlund, David, 2000, "Political Quality," Social Philosophy and Policy 17, pp. 127–60.&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothetical example was suggested: suppose wealthier people gave excessive amounts of campaign contributions; suppose further that these contributions resulted in better regulations; and then laws limiting such contributions on the basis of equal opportunity for all political participants may have the unintended long term consequence of making political decision-making lackluster and possibly hurting the groups that it was trying to protect.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Philosopher [[John Kekes]] makes a similar point in his book ''The Art of Politics'' in which he suggests that there is a danger to elevating any one particular political good&amp;nbsp;– including equality of opportunity&amp;nbsp;– without balancing competing goods such as justice, property rights and others.&lt;ref name=twsH77h&gt;{{cite news

[[Conservatism|Conservative]] thinker [[Dinesh D'Souza]] criticized equality of opportunity on the basis that "it is an ideal that cannot and should not be realized through the actions of the government" and added that "for the state to enforce equal opportunity would be to contravene the true meaning of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]] and to subvert the principle of a free society".&lt;ref name=twsH63&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Souza described how his parenting undermined equality of opportunity: {{quote|I have a five-year-old daughter. Since she was born&amp;nbsp;... my wife and I have gone to great lengths in the Great Yuppie Parenting Race.&amp;nbsp;... My wife goes over her workbooks. I am teaching her chess. Why are we doing these things? We are, of course, trying to develop her abilities so that she can get the most out of life. The practical effect of our actions, however, is that we are working to give our daughter an edge&amp;nbsp;– that is, a better chance to succeed than everybody else's children. Even though we might be embarrassed to think of it this way, we are doing our utmost to undermine equal opportunity. So are all the other parents who are trying to get their children into the best schools&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt;}}

[[File:BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.jpg|thumb|Equal opportunity theorists generally agree that once the race begins, who wins is a function of talent, hard work and competitive drive (photo: runner [[Billy Mills]] crossing the finish line in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]])]]
D'Souza argued that it was wrong for government to try to bring his daughter down, or to force him to raise up other people's children,&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt; but a counterargument is that there is a benefit to everybody, including D'Souza's daughter, to have a society with less anxiety about downward mobility, less class resentment and less possible violence.&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt;

An argument similar to D'Souza's was raised by Nozick in ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', who wrote that the only way to achieve equality of opportunity was "directly worsening the situations of those more favored with opportunity, or by improving the situation of those less well-favored".&lt;ref name=twsH77d&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick gave an argument of two suitors competing to marry one "fair lady": X was plain while Y was better looking and more intelligent. If Y did not exist, then "fair lady" would have married X, but Y exists and so she marries Y. Nozick asks: "Does suitor X have a legitimate complaint against Y on the basis of unfairness since Y did not earn his good looks or intelligence?".&lt;ref name=twsH77d33&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick suggests that there is no grounds for complaint. Nozick argued against equality of opportunity on the grounds that it violates the [[rights]] of property since the equal opportunity maxim interferes with an owner's right to do what he or she pleases with a property.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;

Property rights were a major component of the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and are sometimes referred to as "Lockean rights".&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; The sense of the argument is along these lines: equal opportunity rules regarding, say, a hiring decision within a factory, made to bring about greater fairness, violate a factory owner's rights to run the factory as he or she sees best; it has been argued that a factory owner's right to property encompasses all decision-making within the factory as being part of those property rights. That some people's "natural assets" were unearned is irrelevant to the equation according to Nozick and he argued that people are nevertheless entitled to enjoy these assets and other things freely given by others.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] felt that luck was too much of a variable in economics, such that one can not devise a system with any kind of fairness when many market outcomes are unintended.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; By sheer chance or random circumstances, a person may become wealthy just by being in the right place and time and Hayek argued that it is impossible to devise a system to make opportunities equal without knowing how such interactions may play out.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; Hayek saw not only equality of opportunity, but all of [[social justice]] as a "mirage".&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;

Some conceptions of equality of opportunity, particularly the substantive and level playing field variants, have been criticized on the basis that they make assumptions to the effect that people have similar genetic makeups.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Other critics have suggested that social justice is more complex than mere equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; [[Robert Nozick]] made the point that what happens in society can not always be reduced to competitions for a coveted position and in 1974 wrote that "life is not a race in which we all compete for a prize which someone has established", that there is "no unified race" and there is not some one person "judging swiftness".&lt;ref name=twsH77d33/&gt;

}}
The '''Exotic Shorthair''' is a breed of cat developed to be a short-haired version of the [[Persian cat|Persian]]. The Exotic is similar to the Persian in many ways, including temperament and conformation, a flat nose and face with the exceptions of the short dense coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.petmd.com/cat/breeds/c_ct_exotic_shorthair|title=Exotic Shorthair|last=|first=|date=|website=PetMD|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an [[outcross]] by some [[American Shorthair]] breeders. This was done in secret in order to improve their body type, and crosses were also made with the [[Russian Blue]] and the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]]. The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring, but unhappy American Shorthair breeders successfully produced a new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed signs of [[crossbreed]]ing. One American Shorthair breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/American Shorthair cross proposed and eventually got the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] judge and American Shorthair breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses, leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed.

Because of the regular use of Persian as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a 1 in 4 chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by the Cat Fanciers' Association, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians. Other associations like the [[American Cat Fanciers Association]] register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.&lt;ref&gt;Helgren, J. Anne. (2006) [http://www.iams.com/iams/en_US/jsp/IAMS_Page.jsp?pageID=CBD&amp;breedPage=exotshor.html Iams Cat Breed Guide: Exotic Shorthair] Telemark Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Exotic Shorthair meets every standard for the Persian breed, except for the coat.

'''Head:'''
Oval, massive. Very broad skull. Rounded forehead. Round, full cheeks. Short, broad, round muzzle. Short, broad nose with pronounced stop. Strong chin. Broad, powerful jaws.

'''Ears:'''
Small, rounded at the tip, not too open at the base. Widely spaced and well-furnished with hair on the inside.

'''Eyes:'''
Large and round. Pure, deep color corresponding to that of the coat (gold to copper in most varieties; green in the chinchilla and the golden; blue in the white and the [[Colorpoint Shorthair|colorpoint]]).

'''Neck:'''
Short and thick.

'''Body:'''
Medium-sized, [[Dog terminology#Body|cobby]], low to the ground. Broad chest. Massive shoulders. Large-boned with powerful muscles. Weight: 3.5 – 6 kilograms.

'''Paw:'''
Short, straight and large. Round, large paws. Tufts of hair between the toes.

'''Tail:'''
Short, thick, carried low. Rounded tip.

'''Coat:'''
Shorthaired but slightly longer than other shorthaired breeds. Dense, fluffy, erect hair. All Persian colors are recognized.

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Exotic sh 12months.jpg|thumb|right|Male Exotic Shorthair – 12 months]]
Exotic Shorthairs have a gentle and calm personality reminiscent of the Persian, but are generally livelier than their longhaired ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/exotic-shorthair#0_sb32r7w2|title=Exotic Shorthair|last=|first=|date=|website=VetStreet|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curious and playful, they are friendly to other cats and dogs, but they don't like being left alone and need the presence of their owner. They tend to show more [[affection]] and [[loyalty]] than most breeds and make excellent lap cats. Their calm, steady nature makes them ideal apartment cats for city dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsCJ/Exotic.aspx|title=About The Exotic|last=|first=|date=|website=The Cat Fancier's Association|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Exotics retain some of the energetic spark of the American Shorthair, and they are often capable [[mouse]] hunters.

== Care and grooming ==
Unlike the high-maintenance Persian, the Exotic is able to keep its own [[fur]] tidy with little human assistance, though weekly brushing and combing is recommended to remove loose hair and reduce shedding and [[hairball]]s.

As with other [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|flat-faced]] animals, the Exotic's tear ducts are prone to overflowing due to the [[nasolacrimal duct]], which can dampen and stain the face. This can be relieved by periodically wiping the cat's face with a cloth moistened with [[water]] or one of the commercial preparations made expressly for the purpose.

This breed ages slowly, as it does not reach maturity until around two years of age and enters puberty fairly late. When two Exotic Shorthairs are crossed, they may produce long-haired kittens called "Exotic Longhairs" by the Cat Fanciers' Association. Externally, they look like Persians.

==Health==
{{see also|Persian (cat)#Health|label 1=Persian cat health}}
The Exotic Shorthair is a brachycephalous breed, meaning that its problems result from having the nose and eyes in close proximity to each other, giving the appearance of a pushed-in face. As well as issues with the tear ducts, sinus problems can also occur. Due to the shortened jaw, there is a chance of tooth misalignment or tooth crowding.

* '''[[Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome]]'''. Also referred to as brachycephalic respiratory syndrome or congenital obstructive upper airway disease, this causes upper airway abnormalities ranging in severity. The syndrome can cause increased airway resistance, inflammation of structures in the airways, and increased strain on the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vcahospitals.com/main/pet-health-information/article/animal-health/brachycephalic-airway-syndrome-in-cats/3732|title=Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats|last=|first=|date=|website=VCA Animal Hospitals|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment includes weight loss, surgery, and avoiding humid or hot conditions.

* '''Feline polycystic kidney disease''' (PKD). Exotic Shorthairs, as well as Persians and other Persian-derived cats, have a high chance of inheriting PKD, a disease that can lead to kidney failure. Several studies using ultrasound scan screening have shown that the prevalence of PKD in Exotics is between 40–50% in developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = C. | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA screening for PKD is recommended for all Exotic cats used in breeding programs to reduce the incidence of kidney disease by [[spaying]] and [[neutering]] PKD positive cats.

== Recognition ==
The Exotic has steadily gained popularity among cat fanciers with the help of the devoted advocates of the breed who saw the value in a Persian and Shorthair crossbreed. 
* In 1967, the Exotic Shorthair was first accepted for Championship status by the Cat Fanciers' Association. 
* In 1971, the first Exotic Shorthair achieved the status of Grand Champion. 
* In 1986, the [[Fédération Internationale Féline]] recognized the Exotic Shorthair. 
* In 1991, an Exotic was the Cat Fanciers' Association's Cat of the Year.
* In 1992, the Cat Fanciers' Association's Best Kitten was an Exotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.petfinder.com/cat-breeds/Exotic-Shorthair|title=Exotic Shorthair Cat|last=|first=|date=|website=Pet Finder|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This successful use of bacterial mutagenicity as a screen for carcinogenicity confirmed the use of this methodology as a rapid and efficient test, in comparison to animal testing alone, and led to its further development. The availability of such simpler tests in turn gave rise to greater government oversight and testing of compounds to which the public would be exposed.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">'''The Grant Study''' is part of the Study of Adult Development at [[Harvard Medical School]]. It is a 75-year longitudinal study of 268 physically- and mentally-healthy [[Harvard]] college [[Sophomore year|sophomores]] from the classes of 1939–1944.  It has run in tandem with a study called "[[Sheldon Glueck|The Glueck Study]]," which included a second cohort of 456 disadvantaged nondelinquent inner-city youths who grew up in Boston neighborhoods between 1940 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Eman Vaillant|Vaillant, G.]], Mukamal K. Successful Aging. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 2001: 158:839–847&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects were all male and of American nationality. The men continue to be studied to this day. The men were evaluated at least every two years by questionnaires, information from their physicians, and in many cases by personal interviews. Information was gathered about their mental and physical health, career enjoyment, retirement experience and marital quality. The goal of the study was to identify predictors of healthy aging.

The study, its methodology and results are described in three books by a principal investigator in the study, [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]]. The first book&lt;ref&gt;[[George Eman Vaillant|Vaillant, George E.]] ''Adaptation to Life'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; describes the study up to a time when the men were 47 years of age, and the second book&lt;ref&gt;[[George Eman Vaillant|Vaillant, George E.]] ''Aging Well'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; to when the inner-city men were 70 years old and the Harvard group were eighty. In 2012, Vaillant and [[Harvard University Press]] published ''Triumphs of Experience'', sharing more findings from the Grant Study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674059825&lt;/ref&gt;

The study is part of [[The Study of Adult Development]], which is now under the direction of [[Robert J. Waldinger|Dr. Robert J. Waldinger]]&lt;ref&gt;http://adultdevelopment.wix.com/harvardstudy&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. The study included four members who ran for the U.S. Senate. One served in a presidential Cabinet, and one was President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200906/happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The study is unique partly because of the long time span of the cohort, and also partly because of the high social status of some of the study participants.

== Main results==
George Vaillant, who directed the study for more than three decades, has published&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Triumphs-Experience-Harvard-Grant-Study/dp/0674059824&lt;/ref&gt; a summation of the key insights the study has yielded:
* [[Alcoholism]] is a disorder of great destructive power.
** Alcoholism was the main cause of divorce between the Grant Study men and their wives.
** Strongly correlates with neurosis and depression, which tended to follow alcohol abuse, rather than precede it.
** Together with associated cigarette smoking, was the single greatest contributor to their early morbidity and death.
* Financial success depends on warmth of relationships and, above a certain level, not on intelligence.
** Those who scored highest on measurements of "warm relationships" earned an average of $141,000 a year more at their peak salaries (usually between ages 55 and 60).
** No significant difference in maximum income earned by men with IQs in the 110–115 range and men with IQs higher than 150.
* Political mindedness correlates with intimacy: Aging liberals have more sex.
** The most-conservative men ceased sexual relations at an average age of 68.
** The most-liberal men had active sex lives into their 80s.
* The '''warmth of childhood relationship with mothers''' matters long into adulthood:
** Men who had "warm" childhood relationships with their mothers earned an average of $87,000 more a year than men whose mothers were uncaring.
** Men who had poor childhood relationships with their mothers were much more likely to develop dementia when old.
** Late in their professional lives, the men's boyhood relationships with their mothers—but not with their fathers—were associated with effectiveness at work.
** The warmth of childhood relationships with mothers had no significant bearing on "life satisfaction" at 75.
* The '''warmth of childhood relationship with fathers''' correlated with:
** Lower rates of adult anxiety.
** Greater enjoyment of vacations.
** Increased "life satisfaction" at age 75.

Vaillant's main conclusion is that "warmth of relationships throughout life has the greatest positive impact on 'life satisfaction'". Put differently, Vaillant says the study shows: "Happiness is love. Full stop."

'''Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Burma''' (or [[Burma|Myanmar]]), recognised as a disease of concern by the [[Ministry of Health (Burma)|Ministry of Health]] and is a major social and health issue in the country. In 2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in Burma was 1.3% (200,000 - 570,000 people), according to [[UNAIDS]], and early indicators show that the epidemic may be waning in the country, although the epidemic continues to expand in parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/myanmar_statistics.html#25 |title=At a glance: Myanmar - statistics |accessdate=9 January 2007 |work=UNICEF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAIDSasia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/UNA-docs/REPORT_ICAAP_01July05_en.pdf |title=A scaled-up response to AIDS in Asia and the Pacific |accessdate=10 January 2007 |date=1 July 2005 |format=PDF |work=UNAIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="06decUNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/EpiReport/2006/05-Asia_2006_EpiUpdate_eng.pdf |title=Asia |accessdate=9 January 2007 |format=PDF |work=UNAIDS |date=December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different strains of HIV are believed to have originated from Burma, along heroin trafficking routes in northern, eastern and western Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=HIV and National Security: Where are the Links? |last=Garrett |first=Laurie |year=2005 |publisher=Council of Foreign Relations |url=http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/HIV_National_Security.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intravenous drug users (43%), along with miners (who often become infected through drug use) and sex workers (32%), are along the most likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="06decUNAIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beyrer |first1=Chris |author2=Chris Beyrer |author3=Voravit Suwanvanichkij |author4=Nicole Franck Masenior |author5=Thaung Htun |year=2008 |title=HIV AIDS in Burma: Public Health Constrained |journal=Public Health Aspects of HIV/AIDS in Low and Middle Income Countries |publisher=Springerlink |volume= |issue= |pages= 433–455|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l912j57q2x706515/fulltext.html |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-72711-0_19 |isbn=978-0-387-72710-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least half of the 300,000 to 500,000 drug users (according to conservative estimates) in Burma are intravenous drug users, and Burma (Shan State and Kachin State) is a major regional supplier of [[heroin]] (with a major domestic shift from opium consumption to heroin consumption occurring in the late 1980s) and [[methamphetamine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/brief17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form of heroin is a highly refined injectable product colloquially known as "Number 4."

The national government, in 2005, spent US$137,120 (K150,831,600) on HIV, while international donors (the governments of [[Norway]], [[the Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Sweden]]) donated US$27,711,813 towards HIV programmes in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/fham_annual_progress_report_2005_pp_v281106.pdf |title=Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar - Annual Progress Report |accessdate=9 January 2007 |format=PDF |work=UNAIDS | date=1 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burma (ranked 51 out of 166 countries) has one of Asia's highest adult [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|HIV prevalence rates]], following [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]]. An estimated 20,000 (range of 11,000 to 35,000) die from HIV/AIDS annually.&lt;ref name="myUN2004epid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/Publications/Fact-Sheets01/Myanmar_EN.pdf |title=Myanmar: Epidemiological Fact Sheets

In geographic terms, the lowest rates of HIV were in the West ([[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] and [[Chin State]]), while intermediate rates were in the central region ([[Ayeyarwady Region|Ayeyarwady]], [[Mandalay Region|Mandalay]], [[Magwe Region|Magway]], [[Sagaing Region|Sagaing]], [[Yangon Region|Yangon]] and [[Bago Region]]s), and the highest infection rates were in the North ([[Kachin State]]), East ([[Shan State|Shan]] and [[Kayin State]]), and South ([[Mon State]], [[Tanintharyi Region]]).&lt;ref name="myUN2004epid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12626892&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=Assessing the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Burma.

==Government action==
The Ministry of Health began surveying for HIV/AIDS in Burma in 1985.&lt;ref name="moh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/HIV%20AIDS.pdf |title=HIV/AIDS |accessdate=9 January 2007 |format=PDF |work=Ministry of Health, Burma }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[HIV]] case in Burma was reported in 1988, and the first [[AIDS]] patient in Burma was reported in 1991.&lt;ref name="moh"/&gt; Surveillance for HIV began the following year, and a prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme subsequently began in 2000. In 2005, [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral]] therapy was introduced to the public sector, although only 3% of HIV/AIDS patients currently receive such treatment.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSasia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moh"/&gt; Currently, AIDS is one of the priority diseases in the National Health Plan. On 18 August 2005, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis &amp; Malaria]] terminated its US$98,400,000 grant (US$19,200,000 towards HIV/AIDS) in Burma after the national government imposed restrictions on travel of its staff, which contradicted earlier written agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/media_center/press/pr_050819_factsheet.pdf |title=Termination of Grants to Burma |accessdate=10 January 2007 |date=18 August 2007 |format=PDF |work=The Global Fund |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231135529/http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/media_center/press/pr_050819_factsheet.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
According to the report named "Preventable Fate", published by [[Doctors without Borders]] (also known as [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that could largely have been prevented by [[antiretroviral therapy]] drugs and proper treatment. There was simply not enough money coming in from the government or from outside donors, and people are too poor to afford the treatment themselves.&lt;ref name="msf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msf.org/source/countries/asia/myanmar/2008/PreventableFate/PreventableFatereport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225081933/http://www.msf.org/source/countries/asia/myanmar/2008/PreventableFate/PreventableFatereport.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Médecins Sans Frontières had to restrict the number of new cases it could treat in Burma in 2008.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pushed to its limit by the lack of treatment on offer by other care providers, Médecins Sans Frontières has recently been forced to make the painful decision to drastically reduce the number of new patients it can treat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 2008 Médecins Sans Frontières had become the major health provider of antiretroviral therapy and treatment in Burma, not the government or any public or private medical institution. It gave antiretroviral therapy, essential for surviving AIDS, to about 11,000 people, while over 70,000 people need the treatment.&lt;ref name="msf.org"/&gt; However, less than 20% of HIV/AIDS patients receive the treatment necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/world/asia/01iht-myanmar.html?_r=1&amp;ref=asia | work=The New York Times | title=Dying, and Alone, in Myanmar | first=Seth | last=Mydans | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burma's government spends the least percentage of its GDP on health care of any country in the world, and international donor organisations give less to Burma, per capita, than any other country except India.&lt;ref name="msf.org"/&gt; Unsafe medical practices, like the reuse of unsterilised equipment, as well as insufficient blood screening, has also been a source of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in the blood: sex, politics and AIDS in Southeast Asia |last=Beyrer |first=Chris |year=1998 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location= |isbn=978-1-85649-532-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the relative lack of accessible health care in conflict areas along the Burmese border make it difficult for AIDS patients to seek medical help. Interruptions in supply and delivery of ART lead to [[drug resistance]] and could lead to new strains of HIV.

The criminal nature of sex work in Burma, as it is prohibited by the Suppression of Prostitution Act in 1949, also contributes to the ineffectiveness of reaching out to sex workers in Burma with regard to HIV/AIDS awareness and condom usage.&lt;ref name="sexwork"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talikowski |first=Luke |authorlink= |author2=Sue Gillieatt |year=2005 |title=http://www.acewh.dal.ca/pdf/GBA%20Scenarios/Female_sex_work_in_Yangon_%20Myanmar.pdf |journal=Sexual Health |volume=2 |issue= 3|pages=193–202 |id= |url=http://www.acewh.dal.ca/pdf/GBA%20Scenarios/Female_sex_work_in_Yangon_%20Myanmar.pdf |accessdate=7 April 2009 |quote= |pmid=16335547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Yangon, there are over 100 brothels and up to 10,000 sex workers, with between 70 and 90% having a history of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and less than 25% having been tested for HIV.&lt;ref name="sexwork"/&gt; An anecdotal study found that nearly half of sex workers in Yangon have HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="sexwork"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''HealthRoster''' is [[Employee scheduling software]] for e-rostering, used in the [[National Health Service]] produced by Allocate Software.

It provides a computerised method for efficiently managing when staff are required to work and to ensure wards and departments have the right staff in the right place at the right time. It is used by over 80% of electronically rostered NHS trusts to plan and roster their staff. It permits bank nurses to check shifts that are available on their phones or computers at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital staff celebrate e-rostering award|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/11665780.Hospital_staff_celebrate_e_rostering_award/?ref=mr|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Warrington Guardian|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust]] uses the software, which was installed in October 2007, to manage staffing of 160 different areas of nursing. The manager says it is much more efficient than their previous paper-based system, especially as it could keep a record of requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hertfordshire NHS Trust extends rollout of e-rostering software to save costs|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2159118/hertfordshire-nhs-trust-extends-rollout-rostering-software-save-costs|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Computing|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in [[University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust]], where it was used by [[Alison Leary]] in her study of safe nurse staffing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lintern|first1=Shaun|title=Leaked NHS England study links nursing numbers and care quality|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-leaked-nhs-england-study-links-nursing-numbers-and-care-quality/5087118.article?blocktitle=News&amp;contentID=15303#.VYu9Cba_UYC|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warrington &amp; Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]] claims it has permitted them to reduce  the use of bank and agency staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital staff celebrate e-rostering award|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/11665780.Hospital_staff_celebrate_e_rostering_award/?ref=mr|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Warrington Guardian|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust]] has established a Responsive Workforce Model using HealthRoster Software and SafeCare, which they say has been crucial in permitting them to reduce expenditure on agency staff, ensured quality and freed up nurses for hands-on care.  Matrons and ward managers can now organise their rotas more efficiently which enables them to be fairer with staff and frees them up to spend more time on direct patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Always ready to care|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/home/always-ready-to-care/5085519.article|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Nursing Times|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nike, weights, measuring tape.jpg|thumb|188x188px]]
Health and fitness are dominating [[western culture]], and while adults are able to communicate with or hire trained professionals to assist in their journeys to overall health, many teenagers and students do not have access to the resources necessary to answer any questions they may have, or point them in the right direction when starting on their road to fitness. This Wikipedia page aims to teach all those who read it how to create and maintain a healthy lifestyle, regardless of your financial status, schedule, or location.

Highlights:
# What is a Healthy Diet?
# Establishing Goals
# Creating a Diet/Exercise Plan
# Maintaining a Healthy Diet
# Finding Time to Exercise
# Measuring Progress

== What is a Healthy ''''''Diet'''''''?==
Many people believe that a diet is simply a meal-plan someone starts when they want to lose weight. While this is true, your diet is not a scheduled meal-plan that you start and finish, nor is it something that lasts from the start of your journey to health until you achieve your goal. Your diet is literally everything you eat and drink in a day, regardless of if you are working toward a goal number on the scale or just living your life day by day. According to the dictionary, a healthy diet is "a diet which is heavily weighted towards ‘good foods’ while minimizing ‘bad foods.’" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = healthy diet|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/healthy+diet|website = TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A healthy diet does not simply depend on the food pyramid, or any variation of targeted amountsing of food-groups. Though it is important to eat a certain amount of fruit and vegetables each day, meeting these suggested servings is not the same thing as creating a diet that will help you live the best life you can.

== Establishing Goals ==
[[File:GOALS.jpg|thumb|216x216px]]
Before beginning your road to overall health, it is extremely important to set aside specific goals you wish to achieve through changing your lifestyle. Evaluate why you want to life a healthy lifestyle, find motivation for yourself to continue when it might seem difficult or easier to just give up. Make it fun, creative, and enticing. After all, if it seems like a chore to do it, you won't want to do it.

When creating your #GOALS, don't go overboard. Your list should contain 5–7 specific things you want to see change in your life, and should not include anything extreme, like losing more than 20 pounds.* Don't make all your goals number-oriented either. You don't have to focus on your weight or pant size if that is not what you are aiming to change. Your goals are yours, make them personal. They don't need to revolve around fitness if that's not what you're looking to gain from your new lifestyle. Health is more than physical, and your goals should include some emotional or mental targets as well.

Example goals include:
# Doing more than 100 consecutive push-ups.
# Running 3 miles under 20 minutes.
# Improving my overall diet to prevent any familial diseases/occurrences (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol), and to ensure the longevity of my life.
# Getting 7 hours of sleep every night.
# Lowering my stress levels.
# Feeling more energetic throughout the day.
# Maintaining a positive attitude, regardless of the task at hand.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;If you want to lose more than 20 pounds, consult your doctor first. Make sure your goal weight is healthy, reasonable, and necessary for your overall health. In general, losing more than 10 pounds could make your life dramatically different, and put you at a BMI that is lower than average.

 follow what worked for someone else, try new things and make discoveries about what does and doesn't work for ''your'' body.

First things first, you should eliminate huge sources of trans fats, unnatural sugars, and processed foods. However, the amount you cut down on depends on how much you previously consumed daily and how unnatural those foods were. A general rule to live by: If you can't pronounce most of the ingredients listed on the package, it probably isn't natural enough to be in your body. That said, checking the ingredients list is a very important step in making the transition away from processed foods. Avoid artificial flavors and colors, as some are made from insects or could cause cancer. How many ingredients are listed for the product? Chances are the more you read, the less healthy it will be. Our bodies are meant to consume certain foods, and if the ingredients list runs long, you should find an alternative food item that either has simpler and fewer ingredients, or try to make the item on your own. There shouldn't be more than ten ingredients for a granola bar, for instance, because it really only needs five (granola, oats, some sort of nut, some sort of dried berry, and maybe maple syrup or honey as a glue for the previous ingredients).

Sodium is also something to watch out for. Consuming too much actually reverses the effects of eliminating all these "bad foods." Try using less salt when cooking, don't add soy sauce to your rice, put the bag of chips down. If you have to add more than a pinch of salt when preparing the dish, add something flavorful instead (peppers, onions, garlic, spices, etc.).

Do not be afraid of carbs, they are vital to your metabolism. The majority of energy produced and used by our bodies comes from carbohydrates. Just be smart in the kinds you consume, and don't fill up on carbs if you plan on lounging around all day. The main point of consuming such energy-providing foods is to fuel you through a day full of activity. The same can be said for protein. It is vital, but should be utilized when you perform moderate to heavy exercise. ''You must consume some sort of carbohydrate and protein every day'', but dial it back when you know you'll be sitting in class or doing homework at your desk for the majority of the day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18472">{{Original research|date=June 2015}}
The '''immune cycle''' is a natural [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] oscillation of the [[immune system]] when chronic inflammation is occurring.&lt;ref name=Cov2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coventry BJ, Ashdown ML, Quinn MA, Markovic SN, Yatomi-Clarke SL, Robinson AP |title=CRP identifies homeostatic immune oscillations in cancer patients: a potential treatment targeting tool? |journal=Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=7 |issue= |pages=102 |year=2009 |pmid=19948067 |pmc=2791755 |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-7-102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[menstruation|menstrual cycle]], the exact wavelength and waveform of each particular individual patient is different.&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt; That is, different people have different immune cycles although each cycle is typically repeated every seven days.&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt;

[[C-reactive protein]] levels in the blood need to be measured every few days in order to have enough time points to show a repeating fluctuation (a wave-like cycle).&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010&gt;{{cite web |first1=Martin |last1=Ashdown |first2=Brendon |last2=Coventry |url=http://www.australasianscience.com.au/article/issue-may-2010/matter-time.html |title=A Matter Of Time |work=Australasian Science |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by the synchronous division of [[T cell]]s over time, with T-effector cells boosting immune activity followed by T-regulatory cells suppressing the immune response.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt; 

Although the exact reason for the immune cycle is not yet clear, it appears to be a result of repeating and alternating stimulation and inhibition of the immune response, which has been demonstrated to exist in cancer patients. Many cycles occur in the body - like temperature regulation and hormone levels - and the exact cause for these cycles is also unknown, but it is thought to involve the [[hypothalamus]].

The process used to identify this cycle is called 'immune cycle mapping', while the process that uses this cycle in treatment is called 'immune synchronisation'.&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt; It is important to note that the immune cycle and immune synchronisation still "require a lot more testing" before treatment methods can become viable because the "research is still in its early stages".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/rhythms-of-the-immune-system/3039532#transcript&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/162047/Cancer-code-is-cracked&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:William Coley 1892.jpg|thumbnail|left|First to note fluctuations in responses to treatments and speculate on a possible cycle, Dr [[William Coley]].]]
The idea of an immune cycle has existed for well over a hundred years. In 1891, Dr [[William Coley]] noticed that some of his patients responded better to treatment than other patients, even with complete responses.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt; Almost a century later, in 1975, physicist [[George Irving Bell]] developed a mathematical equation to predict a hypothetical immune cycle. Dr Robert North, writing in the 1980s, demonstrated that chemotherapy encouraged the growth of tumors in mice, whose immune systems are very similar to humans.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt; Unfortunately, these pioneers of the immune cycle were unable to establish its existence, particularly since the necessary technology had not yet come into existence.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt;

In the late 1990s, Associate Professor [[Brendon Coventry]] noticed that some of his patients responded better to a [[Melanoma]] vaccine than other patients despite receiving identical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/budget-2015/budget-grants-regime-ignores-innovation-cancer-pioneer/story-fntfbo9p-1227358206121{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When local cancer tumours where injected with the vaccine, cancers that had not been injected began to shrink as well, thus indicating an immunogenic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surgeons.org/media/21677517/ASC-Media-Release-Unexpected-Benefits-Observed-in-Cancer-Treatments.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations led him to speculate that the immune system operates in a cyclical manner, with peaks and troughs.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt; Operating on this theory, Coventry was able to increase complete response rates to treatment of advanced melanoma from 7% to 17% and without noticeable negative side effects to [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2014/s3987364.htm|title=AM - Melanoma vaccine increases survival rate 17/04/2014|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-17/melanoma-vaccine-giving-cancer-victims-hope/5396594|title=Melanoma vaccine giving cancer victims hope|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Associate Professor Manfred W. Beilharz et al. from the [[University of Western Australia]] began reporting on similar patterns in the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]] infected mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beilharz MW, Sammels LM, Paun A, Shaw K, van Eeden P, Watson MW, Ashdown ML |title=Timed ablation of regulatory CD4+ T cells can prevent murine AIDS progression |journal=Journal of Immunology |volume=172 |issue=8 |pages=4917–25 |year=2004 |pmid=15067071 |url=http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15067071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Mr. Martin Ashdown, a minor contributor to this 2004 paper, claimed to have discovered this cycle in 2002, although this is inconsistent with the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cancer-discovery-heads-for-trials/2005/10/24/1130006063250.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 publication of ''CRP identifies homeostatic immune oscillations in cancer patients: a potential treatment targeting tool?'' in the [[Journal of Translational Medicine]], of which Coventry was lead author, signalled for the first time that the immune cycle existed in some form.&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt; Speaking on ABC radio in 2010, Coventry explained the reasoning behind how the cycle was discovered by numerous practitioners and researchers:
{{quotation|"We really didn't know that it did until we started taking daily blood measurements. With these daily measurements, it revealed that the inflammatory markers in the blood are going up and down. At first we thought this was an aberration, we didn't think it was anything terribly significant at all, but when we started studying it we noticed that a cycle began to emerge and that the blood levels were going down and then going up and then going down again and going up. We then started to try and work out why this might be occurring...  We're all finding the same thing, and this then compels us to want to investigate it much closer and much further, because we think there could be enormous cost savings in this. If we could deliver the right chemotherapy at the right time, then we may be able to alter the cost of cancer care and in particular alter the efficiency at which we deliver it." ''Coventry, ABC Radio,14 April 2010''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/rhythms-of-the-immune-system/3039532#transcript&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current scientific status==

In 2010, Professor Michael Quinn from the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]] announced that trials would be conducted on women suffering from [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/radical-ovarian-cancer-treatment-offers-hope-20100223-p0tf.html&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Roxana S. Dronca et al. from the [[Mayo Clinic]] found that the immune cycle is also evident in fluctuations beyond [[C-reactive protein]], as it can be seen in "infradian immune biorhythms of both immune cell subpopulations and cytokines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dronca RS, Leontovich AA, Nevala WK, Markovic SN |title=Personalized therapy for metastatic melanoma: could timing be everything? |journal=Future Oncology |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1401–6 |year=2012 |pmid=23148614 |pmc=4012533 |doi=10.2217/fon.12.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Daily Express]] newspaper in the UK, Quinn said 
{{quotation|"Everyone, including non-cancer patients, has an immune cycle which fluctuates every 12 to 14 days. That’s why if someone in the family comes in with a cough or cold, only some members of the family will develop it. The immune system also attacks cancer cells, which is why we need to give chemotherapy on the right day... The concept is sensational. If you can treat people at the right time it could dramatically improve their chance of a successful outcome. The research is still in its early stages, however if we are proved right this method of treatment could be applied to all cancers and in fact all diseases." ''Quinn, 7 March 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/162047/Cancer-code-is-cracked&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in 2014, Dr Mutsa Madondo et al. (in a team that included Professor Quinn) were unable to replicate the results of the 2009 Coventry et al. paper. They discovered that "[t]he statistical analysis used showed no evidence of periodic oscillation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madondo MT, Tuyaerts S, Turnbull BB, Vanderstraeten A, Kohrt H, Narasimhan B, Amant F, Quinn M, Plebanski M |title=Variability in CRP, regulatory T cells and effector T cells over time in gynaecological cancer patients: a study of potential oscillatory behaviour and correlations |journal=Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=12 |issue= |pages=179 |year=2014 |pmid=24957270 |pmc=4082498 |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-12-179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anticancerfund.org/projects/synchronization-of-chemotherapy-to-the-anti-tumor-immune-cycle{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Coventry - in a team that included Professor [[Maciej Henneberg]] - argued that [[cancer]] had become highly developed over time and could counter mainstream cancer treatments by manipulating the immune cycle:
{{quotation|"Clearly, the cancer cell appears as an adaptive and highly evolved entity able to switch on certain genes to survive the onslaught of radiation and chemotherapy, despite having genetic/chromosomal errors. So, in this sense it is a very sophisticated survival machine." ''Coventry et. al., 2015'' &lt;ref&gt;https://f1000research.com/articles/4-552/v1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In late 2016, one of the patent holders, Biotempus Limited - whose Chief Scientific Officer, Mr. Martin Ashdown, was involved in the 2009 paper - went into administration and liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;https://insolvencynotices.asic.gov.au/browsesearch-notices/notice-details/Biotempus-Limited-096281542/d4775df1-49d2-4073-8373-d2ec6f9fb568{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other patent holder, the [[Mayo Clinic]] in the US, is presently conducting a clinical trial into immune synchronisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20151849&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immune synchronised cancer treatments==

The use of the immune cycle in treatment through immune synchronisation remains in the very early stages of research, as demonstrated above. According to a 2012 article in [[Cancer Management and Research]], a well timed treatment and the use of agent [[Interleukin 2]] could force the immune system into overdrive, expanding and maximising the period of T-effector cell activity.&lt;ref name=Cov2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coventry BJ, Ashdown ML |title=Complete clinical responses to cancer therapy caused by multiple divergent approaches: a repeating theme lost in translation |journal=Cancer Management and Research |volume=4 |issue= |pages=137–49 |year=2012 |pmid=22740774 |pmc=3379856 |doi=10.2147/CMAR.S31887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coventry, "[t]he immune system works in waves that seems to be switching on and off constantly. And now what we're trying to do is see whether we can identify periods or phases in that cycle where we could target [Melanoma vaccine treatments] more effectively..."&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

However, the research can also apply to [[Chemotherapy]] and [[Radiotherapy]] more generally because it is applicable to the treatment of cancers that are, or are likely to be, immunogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11444127 |title=Long-held breast cancer theories could be inaccurate |first=Eli |last=Orzessek |work=New Zealand Herald |date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this shows is that a patient's treatment outcome may be largely determined by when treatment is administered in relation to their immune cycle, making treatment more a game of chance than a game with fixed rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancersa.org.au/research/beat-cancer-projects/2013|title=Beat Cancer Project - Cancer Council SA|work=Cancer Council South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the ability to administer treatment at the most effective time in a patient's immune cycle means that significantly smaller dosages of [[chemotherapy]] can be used, which in turn means far fewer negative side effects to treatment or, possibly, no significant side effects.&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27437102&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coventry BJ, Lilly CA, Hersey P, Michele A, Bright RJ |title=Prolonged repeated vaccine immuno-chemotherapy induces long-term clinical responses and survival for advanced metastatic melanoma |journal=Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer |volume=2 |issue= |pages=9 |year=2014 |pmid=27437102 |pmc=4950896 |doi=10.1186/2051-1426-2-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"Everything in nature exists in a delicate balance. The mammalian immune system has finely tuned opposing forces of immunity and tolerance. This balance can allow vigorous and selective responses to microorganisms and cancer while avoiding damaging responses to normal healthy tissue." ''Brendon Coventry et al., May 2010''&lt;ref name=AshdownCoventry2010/&gt;}}

==Public Awareness==
The [[Australian Melanoma Research Foundation]] has undertaken many initiatives to promote this research and the potential benefits it could have on cancer patients, as well as advertising clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melanomaresearch.com.au/research-projects/melanoma-trial-commences.html|title=Australian Melanoma Research Foundation - Melanoma Vaccine Trial|author=Melanoma Research|work=melanomaresearch.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] has helped raise public awareness about this research, a fact that has been noted in the acknowledgements of numerous journal articles.&lt;ref name=pmid27437102/&gt;

Numerous submissions and presentations on these findings were made to committees of the [[Parliament of Australia]]. In a 2014 submission to the Standing Committee on Health into Skin Cancer in Australia, the [[Australian Melanoma Research Foundation]] stated that without the application of the new knowledge on the immune cycle cancer treatment was a "mathematically random" process.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Health/Skin_Cancer/Submissions|title=Submissions|work=aph.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that treatment on mice with the new knowledge resulted in a "complete eradication of established tumours in 60% of mice".&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt; Their 2015 submission to the ''Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Inquiry into the Availability of New, Innovative and Specialist Cancer Drugs in Australia'' states that the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced cancer is consistent with statistical probability that a patients treatment will be administered at exactly the right place in their immune cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Cancer_Drugs/Submissions{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Dr Svetomir Markovic of the [[Mayo Clinic]] gave a public lecture in which he described the immune cycle and the potential developments to medicine it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXX-9t8xiAo|title=Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma: Could Timing Be Everything?|date=24 April 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association''' ('''IFOPA''') is a US-based [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] supporting medical research, education and communication for those afflicted by the rare genetic condition [[Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva]] (FOP). IFOPA's mission is to fund research to find a cure for FOP while supporting, connecting, and advocating for individuals with FOP and their families, and raising awareness worldwide. IFOPA is governed by a volunteer [[board of directors]] which may range in number from 9 to 15, at least one of whom must have FOP. The association's location is 1520 Clay St., Suite H2, [[North Kansas City]], MO, 64116,  part of the [[Kansas City, Missouri]] metropolitan area.

==Founding and history==
[[File:Jeannie L Peeper.jpg|thumb|left|Jeannie L Peeper &lt;br&gt;IFOPA Founder and President]]IFOPA was founded in 1988 by Jeannie L. Peeper. Diagnosed with FOP in 1962 at age four, Peeper graduated from college in 1985 with a bachelor of arts degree in social work. [[Michael Zasloff]], then at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), was studying FOP and put Peeper in contact with all FOP patients known to the NIH, eighteen in total, to whom Peeper mailed a questionnaire. Eleven responded. In early 1988, Peeper started a newsletter called ''FOP Connection'' in collaboration with Nancy Sando, one of the respondents. In June of that year, Peeper founded the IFOPA to facilitate fund raising for FOP research and generally create awareness of the disease. With an initial association membership of eleven, Peeper became the inaugural president and Sando was appointed vice president. In 1989, Peeper collaborated with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to support establishment of the FOP Collaborative Research Project, and in 1992, the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders, efforts spearheaded by Drs. Frederick S. Kaplan, Michael Zasloff, and Eileen M. Shore.

Throughout the 1990s, IFOPA organized two international symposiums on FOP and several FOP family meetings. In the first decade of the 2000s, two more international symposiums were hosted by IFOPA, and other FOP scientific and family meetings were held in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.  In April 2006, the Center for Research in FOP discovered the FOP gene. By 2014, the organization had over 500 members from 57 countries and had partnered with FOP organizations and communities in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, The Netherlands, People's Republic of China, Poland, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

In 2010, IFOPA implemented the first annual Jeannie L Peeper Awards to recognize philanthropy, community involvement, international leadership and youth leadership in support of the FOP cause. Also in 2010, the Central Florida Chapter of the Association of Fund Raising Professionals named Peeper as winner of the 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award for her work in founding and establishing the IFOPA. A gathering of FOP families, supporters, researchers, and pharmaceutical industry representatives was held in Orlando in late 2013 on the 25th anniversary of the Association.

In early 2014, IFOPA appointed its first Global Research Development Director to partner with research groups internationally in the development of therapeutic approaches for the treatment of FOP.

In July 2014, a Phase II clinical trial investigating [[palovarotene]] for the treatment of FOP began. Palovarotene is a drug shown to prevent heterotopic bone formation in animal models of FOP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raredr.com/publications/Rare-Disease-Report/2015/october-2015/orphan-drug-designation-fop&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, a Phase II clinical trial of the activin antibody REGN2477 began. A third clinical trial is underway at Kyoto University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ For clinical trials on FOP, use search term "fibrodysplasia".&lt;/ref&gt;

IFOPA hosted FOP drug development forums in 2014 and 2016 in Boston, Massachusetts, and in Sardinia Italy in 2017. The forums discussed questions and challenges of developing a safe transformative therapy for FOP. The 2016 Drug Development Forum attracted 169 attendees from around the world including 38 universities, 13 pharmaceutical companies and a number of government experts, investment firms, and FOP patient and parent advocates.

In early 2017, IFOPA closed its Orlando office and moved administrative operations to North Kansas City, Missouri.  A reorganization plan entailed creation of several new positions as follows: Director of Research Development and Partnerships, Family Services Director, and Administrative Coordinator.  Two additional key functions, FOP Connection Registry Study Manager and Fundraising Events Manager, were contracted to outside consultants.

==Use of funds and fund raising==
Historically, IFOPA has allocated over 80% of its annual budget to medical research and programs, donating in the range of $350,000 to $650,000 annually to the FOP Laboratory.  IFOPA is a [[GuideStar]] Gold Participant by virtue of the public information IFOPA provides beyond that available from the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/59-2918100/international-fop-association.aspx |title=International FOP Association, Inc., Casselberry, Florida : GuideStar summary |publisher=Guidestar.org |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; General overhead, defined as a combination of fund raising and management expenses, has for the past decade averaged below the Association of Fundraising Professionals statement that the average American believes 23 cents on the dollar being spent on such costs is a reasonable figure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afpnet.org/Audience/ReportsResearchDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=12845&lt;/ref&gt; The association's financial statements and 990s are posted on the IFOPA website.

IFOPA fund raising results principally from family-organized activities rather than large nationwide events. In addition to the association's own annual appeal, several grants, and traditional family/friends letter drives, the range of family fund raisers includes golf tournaments, barbecues, bingos, auctions, comedy shows, rock concerts, holiday card sales, raffles, suppers, athletic events, and a variety of other social events and receptions. Some of the more unusual fund raisers include an annual Burns Supper in Aberdeen Scotland, an ice fishing contest, and the auctioning of a quilt decorated with a double helical border symbolizing both the DNA double helix and the quest to find a cure. In 2010, the association established the Jeannie Peeper Heritage Society, a fund raising program that targets major donors and estate giving.

==Medical and scientific advisors==
IFOPA's medical and scientific advisors are Frederick S. Kaplan, Eileen M. Shore, and [[Michael Zasloff]].  The foregoing advise the association on issues such as family support and counseling, dissemination of medical documents and treatment guidelines, medical document translation, physician awareness strategies, research funding requests and initiatives, and other matters for which their expertise is required.

Kaplan is the Isaac and Rose Nassau Professor of Orthopaedic Molecular Medicine and Chief of the Division of Orthopaedic Molecular Medicine at the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania]]. Kaplan co-directs the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders and is recognized as the world's leading expert on genetic disorders of [[heterotopic ossification]] and skeletal metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8778&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Kaplan was awarded the first endowed chair in the USA for orthopaedic molecular medicine. In 2006, [[Newsweek]] named Kaplan as one of "15 people who make America great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2006/07/02/the-giving-back-awards-15-people-who-make-america-great.html |title=The Giving Back Awards : 15 People Who Make America Great |publisher=Newsweek.com |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Kaplan was elected to the [[Institute of Medicine]], an organization established by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] to honor professional achievement in the health sciences.

Shore is the Cali and Weldon Research Professor in FOP, and Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and Genetics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Co-Director of the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders, and director of the FOP Molecular Biology Laboratory. She is a past-president of the Advances in Mineral Metabolism (AIMM) Board of Directors and served on the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Council. Shore was awarded a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania (Cell and Molecular Biology) followed by post-doctoral training in [[cell biology]] at the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]] in Philadelphia. Shore's collaboration with Kaplan led to the discovery of the mutated genes in both FOP and POH [[Progressive osseous heteroplasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n5/abs/ng1783.html |title=A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva - Nature Genetics |publisher=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-24 |volume=38 |doi=10.1038/ng1783 |journal=Nature Genetics |pages=525–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa011262 |title=Paternally Inherited Inactivating Mutations of the GNAS1 Gene in Progressive Osseous Heteroplasia |publisher=Nejm.org |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Zasloff.JPG|thumb|alt= A photo of Michael Zasloff, Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Georgetown University School of Medicine|Michael Zasloff, Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics, Georgetown University School of Medicine]]
[[Michael Zasloff]] is Scientific Director, MedStar-Georgetown Transplant Institute, [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]].  In the early 1980s, during his tenure at the National Institutes of Health as Chief of the Human Genetics Branch, he began clinical and basic studies of FOP and helped found the IFOPA with Jeannie Peeper.  In 1989, as the Upham Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania and Chief of the Division of Human Genetics of the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], he began his collaboration with Fred Kaplan to find both the cause and cure of FOP.

==Services and programs==
As a result of the rareness of FOP, the condition is little known even among medical clinicians. Close to 90% of FOP patients worldwide are misdiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/5/e1295 |title=Early Diagnosis of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva |author=Kaplan |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |accessdate=2015-10-24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, the association directly supports research, makes information about FOP including symptoms and treatment guidelines available to both physicians and families, and supports afflicted families with mentoring, family meetings and an information network. Below are IFOPA's programs of research, education, family support, and advocacy. Additional information about these programs, including downloadable reports, articles and other materials, may be obtained from the IFOPA website.

The '''International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology''' ('''IUPHAR''') is a voluntary, non-profit association representing the interests of scientists in [[pharmacology]]-related fields to facilitate ''Better [[medication|Medicines]] through Global Education and Research'' around the world.

==History==
Established in 1959 as a section of the International Union of Physiological Sciences, IUPHAR became an independent organization in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uvnäs|first1=Börne|title=From Physiologist to Pharmacologist - Promotion or Degradation|journal=Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.|date=1984|volume=24|pages=1–19|doi=10.1146/annurev.pa.24.040184.000245}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/our-members/?icsudocid=scientific-unions|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=ICSU Scientific Unions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first World Congress of Pharmacology was held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1961 and subsequently held every three years.  After 1990 the World Congresses were moved to a four-year interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/meetings/congresses|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=IUPHAR Congresses}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These meetings present the latest pharmacological research, technology, and methodology, and provide a forum for international collaboration and exchange of ideas.  A General Assembly, consisting of delegates from all the member societies, is convened during the congresses so member societies have an opportunity to elect the Executive Committee and vote on matters concerning the governance and activities of the union.

==Members==
IUPHAR members are regional, national and special-interest societies  around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/societies|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=IUPHAR Member Societies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various sections and committees are composed of individuals from [[academia]], [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], and government organizations. IUPHAR resources are available to all members of the pharmacology-related societies that adhere to IUPHAR.

==Composition==
IUPHAR is divided in sectional topics. The Division of Clinical Pharmacology, including 3 subcommittees of [[Developing Countries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/developing-countries|website=IUPHAR Subcomittee for Clinical Pharmacology in Developing Countries|accessdate=20 May 2016|title=Developing Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geriatrics]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/geriatric|website=IUPHAR Geriatric Pharmacology Subcommittee|accessdate=20 May 2016|title=Geriatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance, focuses on the needs and research tools for clinicians.  The Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR) provides a uniform guideline for naming and classifying results from the [[Human Genome Project]], naming proteins derived from new sequences as functional receptors and ion channels. Sections specializing in various areas of pharmacology have been established, including [[Drug metabolism|Drug Metabolism and Drug Transport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/drug-metabolism-a-transport|website=IUPHAR Drug Metabolism &amp; Drug Transport Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Drug Metabolism and Drug Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/education|website=IUPHAR Education Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gastrointestinal Pharmacology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/gastrointestinal|website=IUPHAR Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Gastrointestinal Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Immunopharmacology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/immunopharmacology|website=IUPHAR Immunopharmacology Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Immunopharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacology of [[Natural products]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/natural-products|website=IUPHAR Pharmacology of Natural Products Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Pharmacology of Natural Products}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuropsychopharmacology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npp.iuphar.org|website=IUPHAR Neuropsychopharmacology Section|accessdate=19 May 2016|title=Neuropsychopharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pediatrics]] Clinical Pharmacology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/pediatric|website=IUPHAR Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pharmacogenetics]] and [[Pharmacogenomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/sections-subcoms/genetics-genomics|website=IUPHAR Pharmacogenetics-genomics Section|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volunteers participate in the various sections and division according to their interests and training.

==Activities==

A primary purpose of IUPHAR is providing global free access to a major, on-line repository of characterization data for [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], ion channels, enzyme target classes and [[drug]]s through the Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR), established in 1987. The [[Guide to Pharmacology]] established in 2012 superseded the earlier IUPHAR-DB. This is a joint endeavor with the [[British Pharmacological Society]], and has been supported by the [[Wellcome Trust]]. It includes all the [[G protein]]-coupled receptors, [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s, 7TM receptors, [[nuclear receptor]]s, [[ligand-gated ion channel]]s and [[Kinase]]s which are known to be in the [[human genome]]. Where relevant, data on the rat and mouse [[homology (biology)|homologues]] are presented to assist researchers and clinicians in developing and/or enhancing therapeutics for eventual medication in humans.

NC-IUPHAR also promulgates standards of name [[nomenclature]] for research in pharmacology and the related disciplines.

In general, IUPHAR offers individual pharmacologists free curriculum expertise, career development and job listings (the non-profit PharmacoCareers.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacocareers.org/|website=PharmacoCareers|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=IUPHAR Career Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;), research resources, and collaboration opportunities.  IUPHAR offers its member societies venues for participating in world-wide initiatives, publicizing member meetings and activities, nominating individuals for Young Investigator awards, and naming delegates to the quadrennial General Assemblies.  A biannual newsletter entitled ''Pharmacology International'' is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/about-us/publications/newsletters |title=Pharmacology International Newsletters |website=Iuphar.org |date= 9 December 2015 |author= |accessdate= 1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[non-government organization]] in official relations with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), IUPHAR representatives help shape international policy on [[essential medicines]], appropriate dose therapeutics for children, and [[clinical pharmacology]] core competencies among its many WHO-related activities.

The Division of Clinical Pharmacology compiled and released the Research in Humans Compendium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuphar.org/index.php/clinical-division/reports|website=IUPHAR Clinical Pharmacology Division Publications|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Research in Humans Compendium}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free resource to provide the scientific community interested in human research with information on the design of research [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocols]] to assess the effectiveness of a drug in a series of pathological conditions.

IUPHAR is involved in the development of pharmacology in [[developing country|developing countries]].  In conjunction with ICSU the Pharmacology for [[Africa]] (Phar''f''A) initiative was undertaken in 2006 to promote and organize pharmacology on the African continent.  The South African Society of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology is building a database and network of institutions and pharmacologists to create an infrastructure for training and funding pharmacologists.  The long-term goal is for the African continent to attain the necessary pharmacological knowledge and resources to address disease-related issues affecting the population.  As part of this mission, with the support of ICSU and the [[American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics]], the IUPHAR Education Section organized a series of workshops, mostly in Africa, to train young investigators on ethical laboratory practices, including the [[The Three Rs (animals)|three Rs of ethical use of animals]].

IUPHAR Pharmacology Education Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacologyeducation.org//|website=IUPHAR Pharmacology Education Project|accessdate=20 May 2016|title=IUPHAR Pharmacology Education Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a website developed by IUPHAR, with support from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET), as a learning resource to support education and training in the pharmacological sciences. The materials are intended for use by students of pharmacology, clinical pharmacologists, and others interested in the pharmacological sciences. The stated aim is to produce a simple, attractive, easily searchable resource that will support students and teachers of the biomedical sciences, medicine, nursing and pharmacy. It is also intended as an introduction to some of the new data in the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, particularly for those less familiar with such material.

==Future directions==
The early years of the 21st century will be focused on integrating basic and clinical research to implement [[translational medicine]] techniques more quickly.  The 9th World Conference on Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in [[Québec City]], Canada was the last IUPHAR meeting to present clinical pharmacology separately.  The World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark on July 17–23, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldpharma2010.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928061133/http://worldpharma2010.org/ |archivedate=28 September 2015|title=WorldPharma 2010 |website=worldpharma1010.org|date=2010 |author= |accessdate= 1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first integrated meeting.  The merging of these different approaches to the same discipline is to accelerate the introduction of improved therapeutics for humans.

Educational components will be emphasized for both existing pharmacology programs as well as increasing and enhancing pharmacology training in developing countries.  This topic was a central theme of the 17th World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (WCP2014) held July 13–18, 2014 in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcp2014.org/ |title=17th World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (WCP2014)|website=Wcp2014.org |date=  |author= |accessdate= 1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (WCP2018) being held in Kyoto, Japan on July 1–6, 2018 will focus on drug development and therapeutics using new methodologies such as genome sequencing, stem cell biology, nanotechnology and systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcp2018.org/ |title=18th World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (WCP2018) |newspaper=Wcp2018.org |date=  |author= |accessdate= 1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''job-exposure matrix''' (JEM) is a tool used to assess exposure to potential [[health]] [[hazard (risk)|hazards]] in [[occupational hygiene|occupational]] [[epidemiology|epidemiological studies]].

Essentially, a JEM comprises a list of levels of exposure to a variety of harmful (or potentially harmful) agents for selected occupational titles. In large population-based epidemiological studies, JEMs may be used as a quick and systematic means of converting coded occupational data (job titles) into a matrix of possible exposures,&lt;ref name="kauppinen"&gt;Kauppinen TP, Mutanen PO, Seitsamo JT. Magnitude of misclassification bias when using a job-exposure matrix. [Internet]. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health 1992 Apr;18(2):105-112.[cited 2011 Dec 16] Available from: http://www.sjweh.fi/show_abstract.php?abstract_id=1604&lt;/ref&gt; eliminating the need to assess each individual's exposure in detail.

==Advantages==
Assessing exposure by title is less costly than looking at individual cases. JEMs may also reduce differential information bias that might occur when evaluating exposure for individuals from medical records in which their jobs are apparent.&lt;ref name="kauppinen"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Variability of exposure within occupational classes in different workplaces, countries, or throughout time is commonly not taken into account, which can result in nondifferential exposure misclassification.&lt;ref name="kauppinen"/&gt;

'''''Multidimensional Measurement of Religiousness/Spirituality for Use in Health Research''''' is a report, originally published in 1999, by a [[Fetzer Institute]] / [[National Institute on Aging]] working group on the measurement of religion and spirituality.&lt;ref name=workgroup/&gt; A revised version with a new preface was published in 2003. The book presents a series of 12 self-report questionnaire measures, each focused on a particular aspect of religiousness or spirituality, along with reviews of underlying theory and supporting research. The book's purpose is to provide validated measures of spiritual and religious factors in health research. The book includes the '''Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality''' ('''BMMRS'''), a practical measure with selected items from the 12 previous chapters.

The book has been widely cited in health and behavioral science research,&lt;ref name=psycinfocount/&gt; and several subsequent publications have been partially or entirely dedicated to evaluating and critiquing the measures.&lt;ref

==Topics covered==
Both editions contain an introduction, followed by 12 chapters, each on the measurement of a particular aspect ("domain") of religion or spirituality. Combining all these questions gives the  Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality. (MMRS). Concluding pages of each edition select items for a briefer 38-item version of the questionnaire ('''BMMRS'''), along with data from a US national survey that incorporated many of its items.

'''''Background and purpose'''''. The Introduction states the book is responding to "a growing body of literature.... indicat&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that various dimensions of religiousness and spirituality may enhance subjective states of well-being... lower levels of depression and psychological distress... and reduce morbidity and mortality.... elicit&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; considerable attention from medical researchers in epidemiology, psychology, sociology, gerontology, and other fields" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). However,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Health researchers who seek to include religious or spiritual domains in their studies typically confront various problems. Few health researchers have a scholarly background in religiousness/spirituality and most are not acquainted with the long history of attempts to conceptualize and measure multiple dimensions of religiousness... &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we currently have no widely used and validated set of standard measures for key religious/spiritual domains to recommend to interested health researchers (pp. 1-2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, "the [[National Institute on Aging|NIA]] and the [[Fetzer Institute]] established a core working group to:
::*Identify those domains of religiousness/spirituality most likely to impact health
::*Suggest potential mechanisms whereby these variables might operate; and
::*Provide a short multidimensional survey for use in clinical research." (p. 2)

'''''Plausibility of health effects'''''. The Introduction described a variety of "potential mechanisms" by which religiou/spirituality might affect health. These include "behavioral mechanisms" (e.g., less drug abuse), "social mechanisms" (e.g., community ties), "psychological mechanisms" (e.g., emotional support or [[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|religious coping]]), and physiological mechanisms" (e.g., prayer or meditation that elicits a "relaxation response") (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4).

'''''Cultural orientation'''''. The Introduction also noted that "While many of the items have a strong Judeo-Christian focus... the group also proposed a number of items relevant to the growing proportion of Americans who engage in spiritual activities outside the content of churches and synagogues" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

'''''Domain-focused chapters'''''. The titles of the 12 domain-focused chapters, each written by one of the committee members,&lt;ref name=workgroup/&gt; are shown in the adjacent table. A sample question from each chapter's questionnaire measure is also shown in the table.

'''''Brief measure'''''. The final chapter contains a "short form" (BMMRS) with 36 items mostly drawn from the longer measures that appear in the previous 12 chapters (see table). Two additional items elicit a respondent's overall self-ranking (e.g., "To what extent to you consider yourself a spiritual person?", with a similar question about being a "religious person").&lt;ref&gt;Responses are 1) very spiritual, 2) moderately spiritual, 3) slightly spiritual, or 4) not spiritual at all. The other question asks "To what extent do you consider yourself a religious person?" (p. 88).&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter is entitled:
:*Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality: 1999

'''''Survey data'''''. The appendix contains results from administering the BMMRS to a US nationally representative sample, through the [[General Social Survey]], in 1998. For example, it was found that 24.4 percent of US adults reported engaging in private prayer "more than once a day", and 9.0 percent reported engaging in meditation "more than once a day" (p.&amp;nbsp;92). The appendix is entitled:
:*Appendix A: Additional Psychometric and Population Distribution Data

In the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'', [[Harold G. Koenig]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Fetzer Institute’s Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality is rapidly becoming the standard measure of religiousness/spirituality in the spirituality and health field overall, given its comprehensive nature... There also exist national norms for the short version of this instrument (p. 352&lt;ref name=koenig08/&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, he expressed concern that some items for some of the domains of the BMMRS might be "contaminated": "Among its spirituality subscales are meaning, values, and forgiveness subscales &lt;nowiki&gt;[containing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; items such as... 'Knowing that I am a part of something greater than myself gives meaning to my life'... &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 'It is easy for me to admit that I am wrong,' ... these positive traits could very well be the outcome or the results of spirituality. However, should they be part of the definition itself?... completely secular persons and atheists may experience these things as frequently or more frequently than so called 'spiritual persons" (p.&amp;nbsp;352&lt;ref name=koenig08/&gt;). Others have empirically tested this issue for the BMMRSs Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale finding that it is composed of two factors - theism and civility — with many people who eschew religion and spirituality scoring highly on civility.&lt;ref&gt;Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. B. (2013). “As a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats”: Does the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale encapsulate separable theistic and civility components? Social Indicators Research, 110(1), 131-146.[[doi:10.1007/s11205-011-9920-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Research on Aging'', Idler and other working group members reported results of in-depth analyses of data from administering the BMMRS in the 1998 [[General Social Survey]]. The various BMMRS questions "had the expected relationships with other measures of &lt;nowiki&gt;[religious]&lt;/nowiki&gt; concepts. Overall, the instrument has the appropriate characteristics of reliability and validity to be used in further research." (p.&amp;nbsp;356&lt;ref name=idler03/&gt;). Another analysis of the same data suggested that the BMMRS "is useful for
multiethnic research," and that the daily spirituality and values/beliefs scales could benefit by being combined (p.&amp;nbsp;446&lt;ref name=neff06/&gt;).

Several researchers evaluated how well the BMMRS appeared to work when given to different populations. One study concluded that "most BMMRS measures are reliable and valid for use among adolescents" (p.&amp;nbsp;439&lt;ref name=harris08/&gt;). Another found that the "BMMRS is a viable multifactor measure of &lt;nowiki&gt;[religion/spirituality]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for use with young adults" when the "wording on some items was slightly altered to be more inclusive of various religious traditions" (pp.&amp;nbsp;106, 110&lt;ref name=masters09/&gt;). A third reported that in a sample of midwestern US college students, "despite having a collection of items from 12 different domains, these items really constitute two major areas of interest: one relating to spiritual experiences and the other to religious involvements" (p.&amp;nbsp;194&lt;ref name=piedmont06/&gt;). In a population of patients undergoing rehabilitation, it appears that "the BMMRS assesses distinct positive and negative aspects of religiousness and spirituality that may be best conceptualized... as... (a) Spiritual Experiences... (b) Religious Practices... (c) Congregational Support; and (d) Forgiveness" (p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;ref name=johnstonejrh09/&gt;). Findings from Southern US adults suggested that the MMRS appears best at measuring "3 primary factors (Meaning, Spirituality, Religious Practices and Organized Religiousness) and 2 secondary factors (Guilt vs. God’s Grace, and Loving/Forgiving God)" (p.&amp;nbsp;181&lt;ref name=stewart06/&gt;).

[[John Traphagan]], in ''Research on Aging'', examined how the book can "raise questions about the extent to which basic ideas associated with the study of Judeo-Christian religions are meaningful in contexts such as Japan" and other Asian countries (p.&amp;nbsp;387&lt;ref name=traphagan05/&gt;). He argued that questions suggested for many of the 12 domains are irrelevant to understanding religiousness/spirituality in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "questions such as 'If I hear a sermon, I usually think about things that I have done wrong' (Fetzer Report 1999:36) are unlikely to be useful in Japan, because there is no tradition of confession and no sense of a need to confess one’s transgressions in order to achieve salvation. Sermons are not an important part of most religious gatherings, and when they do occur, they are not generally focused on moral behavior" (p. 404).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few MMRS domains held promise. For example, with regard to religious coping, he stated that "certain kinds of ritual performance in Japan can be understood in terms of coping mechanisms, and this is an area identified in the Fetzer report that holds promise for cross-cultural research (at least in relation to Japan)" (p.&amp;nbsp;405&lt;ref name=traphagan05/&gt;).

According to the book's 2003 preface, the Fetzer Institute continues to receive requests for the booklet, and at that time had distributed 2,000 print copies and 1200 internet downloads. The preface reports that "the most popular subscales being used are the Religious/Spiritual Coping and the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scales (DSES). One fourth of respondents have used the booklet in either a course that they teach, in a seminar, or in a symposium." (p. ii)

==Editions==
[[Fetzer Institute]] published the original paperbound edition in 1999, and published a paperbound "reprint" in 2003 that contained a new preface. The 2003 edition is also available for downloading without charge from the Fetzer Institute website (see external links). The two editions are:

The mandate centred on uncontroversial ambitions: reducing rates of premature death, enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions, enhancing recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS Mandate 2014 to 2015|url=http://mentalhealthpartnerships.com/resource/nhs-mandate-2014-to-2015/|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=Mental health Partnerships|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015-16==

==2016-17==
There was a consultation process for the 2016 to 2017 mandate in the autumn of 2015.  It was criticised as having little publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You’ve been asked to have your say on the NHS.

==2017-18==

The mandate for 2017-18 centres on the implementation of the [[Five Year Forward View]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pressure increases on CCGs to meet GP access targets|url=https://www.onmedica.com/newsArticle.aspx?id=721c8235-4658-4c36-8e46-df98cf6648c0|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=OnMedica|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It requires NHS England to provide weekend and evening access to primary care for 40% of the population by the end of 2017-18 and sets goals to improve the performance of [[Accident and Emergency]] departments with the majority of trusts meeting the [[Four-hour target in emergency departments|95% target]] in March 2018. It promises to reduce bed-blocking to 3.5%, the equivalent of releasing more than 2000 extra beds a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS pledges to free up thousands of hospital beds by allowing home care|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/20/nhs-pledges-free-thousands-hospital-beds-allowing-home-care/|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is to be achieved by NHS trusts integrating social care services for elderly patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS Announces Move Toward Integrating Social Care with Health Services|url=http://swns.com/news/nhs-announces-move-toward-integrating-social-care-with-health-services-83407/|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=SWNS|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Hopson, Chief executive of [[NHS Providers]], representing [[NHS foundation trust]]s responded by saying "Taken together with the other commitments set out in the document, the gap between demands on the health service and the resources available in the coming year remains unbridgeable. We maintain that just stabilising the deterioration in performance would be an achievement in itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extended NHS obligations in 2017-18 mandate ‘well beyond reach’|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/extended-nhs-obligations-in-2017-18-mandate-well-beyond-reach|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=National Health Executive|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control''' '''(NAFDAC)''' is a [[Regulatory agency|federal agency]] under the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Nigeria)|Federal Ministry of Health]] that is responsible for regulating and controlling the manufacture, importation, exportation, advertisement, distribution, sale and use of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals and packaged water in [[Nigeria]].

== The Formation of NAFDAC ==
The organization was formed to checkmate illicit and counterfeit products in Nigeria in 1993 under the country's health and safety law. 
[[Adulterant|Adulterated]] and [[counterfeit drugs]] are a problem in Nigeria. In one 1989 incident, over 150 children died as a result of [[paracetamol]] syrup containing [[diethylene glycol]]. The problem of fake drugs was so severe that neighbouring countries such as [[Ghana]] and [[Sierra Leone]] officially banned the sale of drugs, foods and beverages products made in Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Such problems led to the establishment of NAFDAC, with the goal of eliminating counterfeit pharmaceuticals, foods and beverages products that are not manufactured in Nigeria and ensuring that available medications are safe and effective.

The formation of NAFDAC was inspired by a 1988 [[World Health Assembly]] resolution requesting countries' help in combating the global health threat posed by [[counterfeit pharmaceuticals]].

In December 1992, NAFDAC's first governing council was formed. The council was chaired by Tanimu Saulawa. In January 1993, supporting legislation was approved as legislative Decree No. 15 of 1993. On January 1, 1994 NAFDAC was officially established as a “parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Health”.

NAFDAC replaced an earlier Federal Ministry of Health body, the Directorate of Food and Drug Administration and Control, which had been deemed ineffective, partially because of lack of laws concerning fake drugs.

== Administration of NAFDAC ==

===Chairman and council===

“(NAFDAC) is headed by a chairman who presides over a governing council appointed by the president on the recommendation of the Minister of Health.”Other council members are: 
#The permanent secretary of the Ministry of Health
#The director-general of NAFDAC
#[[Standard Organization of Nigeria]] (SON)
#[[National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] (NIPRD)
#The chairman of the [[Pharmacists Council of Nigeria]] (PCN)
#The chairman of the [[National Drug Law Enforcement Agency]] (NDLEA)
#A representative each of the Pharmaceutical Group and the Food and Beverages Group of the [[Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria]].
Three people from the general public are also represented on the council.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;[http://www.nafdacnigeria.org/about.html About NAFDAC]. 2005. Retrieved on 2006-03-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Several units make up NAFDAC:
*The Legal unit is charged with offering legal advice on “law arising from Employee-Employer relationship and is the custodian of legal documents and all agreements relating to the Agency."&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt;
*The Public Relations unit is headed by the director-general’s office. Its main function is to inform, sensitivize, enlighten and create awareness concerning the role of the Agency. The agency is divided into eight directorates with the last two newly added.
*Internal Audit provides a means of measuring the effectiveness of the system of internal control and accounting, and carries out special investigations.

== Functions  ==

NAFDAC has various basic functions. According to the requirements of its enabling decree, the Agency was authorized to:
*Regulate and control the importation, exportation, manufacture, advertisement, distribution, sale and use of drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, packaged water and chemicals
*Conduct appropriate tests and ensure compliance with standard specifications designated and approved by the council for the effective control of quality of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, packaged water, and chemicals.
*Undertake appropriate investigation into the production premises and raw materials for food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water and chemicals and establish a relevant quality assurance system, including certification of the production sites and of the regulated products
*Undertake inspection of imported foods, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water, and chemicals and establish a relevant quality assurance system, including certification of the production sites and of the regulated products.
*Compile standard specifications, regulations, and guidelines for the production, importation, exportation, sale and distribution of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water, and chemicals
*Undertake the registration of food, drugs, medical devices, bottled water and chemicals
*Control the exportation and issue quality certification of food, drugs, medical devices, bottled water and chemicals intended for export
*Establish and maintain relevant laboratories or other institutions in strategic areas of Nigeria as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.

NAFDAC envisions that by making these functions known, that its actions will be apparent “in all sectors that deal with food, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water, and chemicals to the extent of instilling extra need for caution and compulsion to respect and obey existing regulations both for healthy, living and knowledge of certain sanctions or default.Despite the establishment of NAFDAC, the sale and use of fake drugs did not end.

== New amendments since 2001 ==
Dissatisfied with progress in combating fake drugs, President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s administration dissolved the management of NAFDAC in August 2000. In April 2001, a new management team, with Dora Akunyili as director-general, was inaugurated.&lt;ref name="NAFDAC"&gt;[http://www.nigeriafirst.org/printer_315.shtml NAFDAC: Battle against fake drugs]. 2003-03-04. Retrieved on 2006-03-25&lt;/ref&gt; The team re-organized the agency, which has been successful in the recent past due to three new federal policies:
*The outright ban on the importation of drugs and other regulated products through land borders.
*The designation of [[Calabar]] and [[Apapa]] sea ports, [[Murtala Mohammed International Airport|Murtala Muhammed]] and [[Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport]]s as exclusive ports of entry for the importation of drugs and pharmaceutical raw materials.
*Release of shipping and cargo manifests by the Nigerian Ports Authority, shipping lines and airlines to NAFDAC inspectors.&lt;ref name="NAFDAC"/&gt; For several years, Nigeria was drowned in an ocean of fake drugs. Then “Dora Akunyili approached her job with zeal…, to preserve in ridding the Nigerian market of fake drugs and contaminated water sold as “pure water.”&lt;ref name="DORA"&gt;[http://www.nafdacnigeria.org/dg.html The Director General: Prof. Dora Nkem Akunyili (OFR) – Biography]. NAFDAC Nigeria. Retrieved on 2007-07-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
NAFDAC has made several achievements over the years, including
*The creation of six zonal and 36 state offices for easier accessibility, which are being equipped to function effectively,
*Organization of workshops to enlighten various stakeholders, such as (a) pure water producers (b) the Patent and Proprietary Medicine Dealers Association (PPMDA), and (c) the National Union of Road Transport Workers and National Association of Road Transport Owners (NURTW &amp; NARTO),
*Raising awareness not just in Nigeria, also in other countries like [[India]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Egypt]],
*Holding meetings, in concert with the Chairman, House Committee on Health and his members, with Ambassadors of countries identified with exporting fake drugs into Nigeria and solicited their support to stop the trend,
*Achieving excellent results in the fight against counterfeit drugs, as evidenced by the public destruction of about 2 billion Naira worth of drugs from four sources, namely those handed over by repentant traders, those found in secret warehouses on tip off by the drug sellers and the public, and those seized by the drug sellers' internal task forces and NAFDAC task forces,
*Launch of [http://www.dailytrust.dailytrust.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17233:drug-trafficking-nafdacs-cutting-edge-technology&amp;catid=12:health-reports&amp;Itemid=13 anti-counterfeiting technologies by the Nigerian presidency] see NOTE below:

'''Although the project has been launched, there are serious concerns of complicity, compromise and lack of professionalism in the delivery of the project; it does not however appear that the Presidency is aware of this. The above is buttressed by the following:

*Ensuring the formation of a wholesale Drug Mart as the bedrock of the sanitization exercise,
*Making NAFDAC activities more efficient to reduce delays in, for example, registration and inspection,
*Holding consultations with national and international stakeholders leading to various areas of assistance, including, in the areas of staff training, equipment donations and information sharing from United States Food and Drug Agency (USFDA), Environmental and Occupational Health Science Institute (EOHSI), South African Medicines and Medical Devices regulatory Agency (SAMMDRA),
*Sending proposals for reviewing obsolete laws to the [http://www.nassnig.org/ National Assembly], and
*Putting new guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOP) in place for all regulatory processes.&lt;ref name="Achieve"&gt;Achievements. (2005). Retrieved on March 31, 2006, from http://www.nafdacnigeria.org/achievements.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The activities of NAFDAC have been the subject of considerable scrutiny in recent years. The agency has drawn fire for being susceptible to overt government interference, subject to bribery, internal feuding and constant rumours and or allegations abound concerning misappropriation of funds. In one high-profile (and typical) case, the former NAFDAC director of finance and accounts, Andrew Ademola Mogbojuri, alleged mass fraud in 2015 against the agency's director-general, Dr. Paul Orhii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okoghenun|first1=Joseph|title=NAFDAC denies alleged funds misuse by DG|url=http://guardian.ng/news/national/nafdac-denies-alleged-funds-misuse-by-dg/|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency claimed sour grapes was behind the allegation and labelled Mogbojuri's claim "misleading and cheap blackmail".

Orhii was also the subject of a sweeping fraud allegation by NAFDAC [[whistleblowers]] earlier in 2015. A petition was sent to Nigerian President [[Muhammadu Buhari]], alleging frivolous contract awards and supplies, manipulated publicity efforts, donations and international air travel [[racketeering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NAFDAC In Rotting State, Petitioners Say, Alleging Fraud And Waste|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/07/17/nafdac-rotting-state-petitioners-say-alleging-fraud-and-waste|accessdate=29 August 2016|agency=Sahara Reporters|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the world's largest brewers have been caught up in NAFDAC scandals as well. From a 2013 report alleging bribery conducted by [[Guinness]] and [[Heineken International|Heineken]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Two multinational beer companies (Guinness and Heineken) have decided to do it the illegal way, which insiders alleged is to bribe officials of National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration Control (NAFDAC) to deny the manufacturers of local herbal gin accreditation, knowing that Nigerians who had been patronizing them will desist once they are not accredited by the agency. The bribes amount to millions of Naira.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oluwabunmi|first1=Obarotimi|title=Multinational conspiracy as Guinness and Nigerian Breweries Team-Up Against Local Herbal Gin Makers|url=http://bunmiobarotimi.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/multinational-conspiracy-as-guiness-and.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|agency=Society Gazette|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Guinness was back in the NAFDAC glare in 2016. Having been fined about ₦1 billion in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oguh|first1=Chibuike|title=NAFDAC fines Guinness $5 million over expired raw materials|url=http://www.financialnigeria.com/nafdac-fines-guinness-5-million-over-expired-raw-materials-news-171.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|agency=Financial Nigeria|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for allegedly re-validating and using expired raw materials without prior approval, the multinational brewer responded with a lawsuit, which was quietly dropped in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinness Nigeria withdraws suit against NAFDAC, pays N11.4 million fine|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/199996-guinness-nigeria-withdraws-suit-nafdac-pays-n11-4-million-fine.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|agency=Premium Times|date=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==
NAFDAC ensures it maintains very close contact with a number of national and international organizations whose activities relate to the functions of NAFDAC. Such Organizations include the following.&lt;ref name="stake"&gt;Stakeholders. (2005). Retrieved on April 10, 2006 from http://www.nafdacnigeria.org/stakeholders.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Personal Training Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nationalpti.edu|title = Personal Trainer Certification from The National Personal Training Institute|website = nationalpti.edu|access-date = 2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a school that provides students with the education and training to become certified personal trainers. It is a 500 or 600 hour-long program that can be completed within 4, 6 or 12 months.  The course covers roughly 100 hours of [[exercise]] program design, 100 hours of [[nutrition]], 100 hours of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], and 200 hours of practical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nationalpti.edu/training-programs/|title = Personal Training Programs at NPTI|website = nationalpti.edu|access-date = 2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of each day is spent in a classroom setting learning the academic information and the remainder of each day is spent in a gym setting learning the practical aspects of personal training and actually working out.

The school is approved by the Department of Education in the states that they operate in.  The school was founded by Gene McIlvaine in April 2001 with four schools; there are currently over 30 schools nationwide.  The headquarters is in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Upon graduation students receive a diploma in personal training that does not expire, with the title of CPT (Certified Personal Trainer), they are Certified in Basic Nutrition, and they are certified in CPR/AED and First Aid.  Successful completion of the class also makes a student eligible to take the [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]] Certification.  The National Personal Training Institute expanded to Toronto, Canada in 2011. Ten NPTI school locations now offer federal financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalpti.edu/fafsa-title-iv-school-locations/|title=Personal Training Program Financial Aid - NationalPTI|website=nationalpti.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
Heat-related illnesses from occupational heat stress have several risk factors. Some of these factors include high temperatures, [[humidity]], radiant heat sources, limited air movement, metabolic heat from physical exertion of energy, not drinking enough fluids, personal protective equipment and clothing, physical condition and health problems, medications, pregnancy, lack of acclimatization, advanced age, having a previous heat-related illness and others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
[[File:Residential construction worker (9256407214).jpg|thumb|Construction Worker]]

== Examples of high risk occupations ==
Workers in many occupations are at high risk for exposure to heat stress. Some of the higher risk occupations include [[firefighter]], bakery worker, [[miner]], [[military personnel]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[construction worker]], factory worker, boiler room worker, landscaper, some athletes and agricultural worker.&lt;ref name="dir.ca.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/Title8/3395.html|title=California Code of Regulations, Title 8, section 3395 Heat Illness Prevention.|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Symptoms of heat stress ==
The main symptoms of heat stress are [[perspiration]], [[Tachycardia|increased heart rate]], and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aastrand|first=Irma|date=1975|title=Heat Stress in Occupational Work|url=|journal=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and Springer|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other general symptoms include painful muscle cramps, extreme weakness, nausea, dizziness, headache, breathing fast and clammy, pale, cool, and/or moist skin or red, dry skin. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/etools/08-006/whatis.htm|title=Heat Illness Prevention - Title 8 Section 3395|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Prevention ==
Employers can establish prevention programs, which focus on  having protocols to gradually increases workloads and concede on allowing on more breaks for new hired workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html|title=OSHA's Campaign to Prevent Heat Illness in Outdoor Workers|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers can control heat stress through engineering controls, work practices, providing training, implementing an acclimatization schedule, providing water and encouraging workers to drink often, and ensuring workers take appropriate rest breaks to cool down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html|title=CDC - Heat Stress - Recommendations - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Occupational standards ==

=== International ===
[[International Organization for Standardization]] helps set standards for monitoring environments, analyzing data, and interpreting results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Ken|date=2013-01-01|title=Occupational Health Impacts of Climate Change: Current and Future ISO Standards for the Assessment of Heat Stress|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth/51/1/51_2012-0165/_article|journal=Industrial Health|volume=51|issue=1|pages=86–100|doi=10.2486/indhealth.2012-0165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Section 5(a)(1) of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] of 1970 declares that "Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=OSHACT&amp;p_id=2743|title=OSHA Content Document|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] provides guidelines and recommendations to employers for preventing heat stress among workers. There guidelines and recommendations are not enforced regulations, but instead completely voluntary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arlweb.msha.gov/s&amp;hinfo/heatstress/manual/heatmanual.htm|title=Heat Stress - Safety Manual Number 6|website=arlweb.msha.gov|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] conducts research on occupational hazards such as heat stress in order to provide better intervention methods and protect workers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/|title=CDC - Heat Stress - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three of the fifty states have created worker regulations regarding heat: California, Washington, and Minnesota.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; California Code of Regulations states that employers of  high risk outdoor workers are entitled to protection against heat. The employer must provide access to water and shade, practice high heat procedures, practice emergency response procedures, and practice acclimatization methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dir.ca.gov"/&gt; Washington State Legislature states that employers of high risk outdoor workers follow regulations to prevent heat stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Minnesota Administrative Rules state that indoor ventilation and temperature are regulated to prevent heat stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Recommended standards ==
[[File:Protect Your Workers From Heat Stress (14584030356).jpg|thumb|"Protect Your Workers From Heat Stress", CDC]]Beginning in 1972, NIOSH published a recommended standard for hot work environments, and has periodically revised to take new scientific findings into account.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/default.html|title=CDC - Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments - NIOSH Publications &amp; Products|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the NIOSH Recommended Standard for Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments is to prevent injury, disease, death, and reduced productivity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The recommendations include workplace limits and surveillance, medical monitoring, surveillance of heat-related sentinel health events, posting of hazardous areas, protective clothing and equipment, worker information and training, control of heat stress, and record keeping.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Control of heat stress ===
Control of heat stress has recommended general requirements, engineering controls, work and hygienic practices, and a heat alert program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== General Requirements ====
[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] recommends that every employer should create and implement a written program aimed at reducing heat exposures. Engineering and work practice controls should be used to reduce exposures, and a heat alert program should be implemented.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Engineering Controls ====
Air temperatures should be reduced so it does not exceed skin temperatures. [[Radiant heat]] should be reduced by creating barriers around the source. Evaporative heat loss can be increased by increasing air movement around the worker.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Work and Hygienic Practices ====
The time workers spend in hot environments should be limited, with an increase of recovery time spent in cool environments. Use of more efficient procedures and tools is beneficial to reducing metabolic demands of the job. Heat tolerance may be increased by implementing a heat tolerance plan and increasing physical fitness. Employees should be trained to recognize and treat the early signs and symptoms of heat illnesses, and employers should provide cool water for employees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Heat Alert Program ====
Heat alert programs should be developed for implementation when hotter than normal temperatures, or a [[heat wave]] occurs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Paresis''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|ˈ|p|æ|r|ə|s|ɪ|s}}) is a condition typified by a weakness of voluntary movement, or partial loss of voluntary movement or by impaired movement. When used without qualifiers, it usually refers to the limbs, but it can also be used to describe the muscles of the [[Human eyes|eyes]] ([[ophthalmoparesis]]), the [[stomach]] ([[gastroparesis]]), and also the [[vocal cord]]s ([[Vocal cord paresis]]).  Neurologists use the term ''paresis'' to describe weakness, and ''plegia'' to describe [[paralysis]] in which all voluntary movement is lost. The term ''paresis'' comes from the {{lang-grc|πάρεσις}} "letting go" from παρίημι "to let go, to let fall".

==Types==

===Limbs===
* [[Monoparesis]] – One leg or one arm
* [[Paraparesis]] – Both legs
* [[Hemiparesis]] – One arm and one leg on either side of the body
* [[Triparesis]] Three limbs. This can either mean both legs and one arm, both arms and a leg, or a combination of one arm, one leg, and face
* [[Double Hemiparesis]]  all four limbs are involved, but one side of the body is more affected than the other
* [[Tetraparesis]] – All four limbs.
* [[Quadriparesis]] All four limbs, equally affected
* These terms frequently refer to the impairment of motion in [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="MedlinePlusEncyclopedia"&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000748}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cerebral palsy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/types-and-forms|title=Types of Cerebral Palsy|work=cerebralpalsy.org|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
* [[Gastroparesis]] – impaired stomach emptying

'''Induced Systemic Resistance''' (ISR) is a resistance mechanism in [[plant]]s that is activated by [[infection]]. Its mode of action does not depend on direct killing or inhibition of the invading [[pathogen]], but rather on increasing [[Physical change|physical]] or [[chemical]] barrier of the [[host (biology)|host]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choudhary DK, Prakash A, Johri BN | title = Induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants: mechanism of action | journal = Indian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–97 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 23100680 | pmc = 3450033 | doi = 10.1007/s12088-007-0054-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Systemic acquired resistance|Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR)]] a plant can develop defenses against an invader such as a pathogen or parasite if an infection takes place.  In contrast to SAR which is triggered by accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins or [[salicylic acid]], ISR instead relies on [[signal transduction]] pathways activated by [[jasmonate]] and [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan Z, Reddy MS, Ryu CM, McInroy JA, Wilson M, Kloepper JW | title = Induced systemic protection against tomato late blight elicited by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 1329–33 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 18943888 | doi = 10.1094/phyto.2002.92.12.1329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The induction of plant-induced resistance to pathogen protection was identified in 1901 and was described as the "system of acquired resistance." Subsequently several different terms have been used, namely, "acquired physiological immunity", "resistance displacement", "plant immune function" and "induced system resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conrath U | title = Systemic acquired resistance | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 179–84 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 19521483 | pmc = 2634024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of stimulus have been found to induce the plant to the virus, bacteria and fungi and other disease resistance including Mechanical factors ([[dry ice]] damage, [[electromagnetic]], [[ultraviolet]], and low [[temperature]] and high temperature treatment, etc.) Chemical factors ([[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] salts, water, [[salicylic acid]]) and Biological factors ([[fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and their [[metabolite]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walters DR, Ratsep J, Havis ND | title = Controlling crop diseases using induced resistance: challenges for the future | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 1263–80 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23386685 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/ert026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode of action ==
Induced resistance of plants has two major modes of action: the SAR pathway and the ISR pathway. SAR can elicit a rapid local reaction, or [[hypersensitive response]], the pathogen is limited to a small area of the site of [[infection]]. As mentioned, salicylic acid is the mode of action for the SAR pathway. ISR acts on a jasmonic acid (JA) mode of action. Both act on the effect of the NPR-1, but SAR utilizes PR genes. ISR enhances the defense systems of the plant by It is important to note that the two mediated responses have regulatory effects on one another. As SA goes up, it can inhibit the effect of JA. There is a balance to be maintained when activating both responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Traw MB, Bergelson J | title = Interactive effects of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellin on induction of trichomes in Arabidopsis | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | pages = 1367–75 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14551332 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.027086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISR responses can me mediated by rhizobacteria which has shown to be effective against  necrotrophic pathogens and insect herbivores that are sensitive to JA/ET defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieterse CM, Zamioudis C, Berendsen RL, Weller DM, Van Wees SC, Bakker PA | title = Induced systemic resistance by beneficial microbes | journal = Annual Review of Phytopathology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 347–75 | date = 2014-08-04 | pmid = 24906124 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-phyto-082712-102340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR has been widely reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieterse CM, Van Pelt JA, Van Wees SC, Ton J, Léon-Kloosterziel KM, Keurentjes JJ, Verhagen BW, Knoester M, Van der Sluis I, Bakker PA, Van Loon LC |date=2001 |title=Rhizobacteria-mediated Induced Systemic Resistance: Triggering, Signalling and Expression |journal=European Journal of Plant Pathology |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=51–61|doi=10.1023/a:1008747926678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Siddiqui IA, Shaukat SS |date=September 2002 |title=Rhizobacteria-mediated Induction of Systemic Resistance (ISR) in Tomato against Meloidogyne javanica |journal=Journal of Phytopathology |volume=150|issue=8-9|pages=469–473|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0434.2002.00784.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Bakker PA, Ran LX, Pieterse CM, Van Loon LC |date=March 2003|title=Understanding the involvement of rhizobacteria-mediated induction of systemic resistance in biocontrol of plant diseases |journal=Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology |volume=25 |issue=1| pages=5–9 |doi=10.1080/07060660309507043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biological factors of plant-induced system resistance generally include two broad categories, namely classical plant-induced resistance to disease induction (PGPR) or fungi that promote plant growth (PGPF), and plant growth-promoting [[rhizosphere]] bacteria (PGPR) or plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). The difference is mainly due to the fact that the latter can effectively promote plant growth and increase crop yield while causing (or increasing) plant resistance to diseases (sometimes including [[Pest (organism)|pests]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beneduzi A, Ambrosini A, Passaglia LM | title = Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR): Their potential as antagonists and biocontrol agents | journal = Genetics and Molecular Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 (suppl) | pages = 1044–51 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23411488 | pmc = 3571425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on insects ==

Some studies have also reported negative effects of beneficial microbes on plant-insect interactions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pineda A, Dicke M, Pieterse CM, Pozo MJ |date=2013-02-11|title=Beneficial microbes in a changing environment: are they always helping plants to deal with insects? |journal=Functional Ecology |volume=27|issue=3|pages=574–586|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied research==

To date, work on induction of plant systemic resistance has shown that inducing plant system resistance work has important implications for basic and applied research. 

Induced resistance applications in [[melon]]s, [[tobacco]], [[bean]], [[potato]], and [[rice]] have achieved significant success. Over the past decade, the study of induced system resistance has become a very active field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaturvedi S, Paul Khurana SM |date=July 6, 2018|title=Induced Systemic Resistance  |journal=Open Access Journal of Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology |url=https://medwinpublishers.com/OAJMB/OAJMB16000126.pdf |volume= 3 | issue = 1 |pages= 126 | doi = 10.23880/oajmb-16000126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to artificially activate the ISR pathway is an active area of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welling LL | title = Induced resistance: from the basic to the applied | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 445–7 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11686134 | doi = 10.1016/S1360-1385(01)02046-5 | url = https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(01)02046-5?large_figure=true&amp;code=cell-site }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research and application of inducing plant system resistance have been encouraging but are not yet a major factor in controlling plant pathogens. Incorporation into intergrated pest management programs have shown some promising results. There is research regarding defense against leaf chewing insect pests, by the activation of jasmonic acid signalling triggered by root-associated microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung SC, Martinez-Medina A, Lopez-Raez JA, Pozo MJ | title = Mycorrhiza-induced resistance and priming of plant defenses | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–64 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22623151 | doi = 10.1007/s10886-012-0134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ongoing research into ISR includes (1) how to systematically improve the selection of induction factors; (2) the injury of induced factors; (3) the phenomenon of multi-effect of induced factors; (4) the effects of chemical induction factors on environmental factors; (5) Establishment of population stability of multivariate biological inducible factor. Research into ISR is driven largely by a response to pesticide use including 1) Increasing resistance by pathogens to pesticides, 2) the necessity to remove some of the more toxic pesticides from the market, 3) health and environment problems caused as an effect of pesticide use, and 4) the inability of certain pesticides to control some pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EmRHv9xcpAIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Plant+breeding+for+ISR&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q9h12SQT48&amp;sig=zJJpIt0uLHLAri1XXD3kWJdBMJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk-ozMrPDeAhVlk-AKHc4CBAwQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Plant%20breeding%20for%20ISR&amp;f=false|title=Multigenic and Induced Systemic Resistance in Plants|last=Sadik|first=Tuzun|last2=Elizabeth|first2=Bent|date=2006-10-26|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387232669|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pregnancy test''' attempts to determine whether or not a woman is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Indicative markers are found in [[blood]] and [[urine]], and pregnancy tests require sampling one of these substances. The first of these markers to be discovered, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), was discovered in 1930 to be produced by the [[syncytiotrophoblast]] cells of the [[Zygote|fertilised ova]] (eggs).

While hCG is a reliable marker of pregnancy, it cannot be detected until after [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]];&lt;ref name="wilcox"/&gt; this results in [[false negative]]s if the test is performed during the very early stages of pregnancy. HCG can be detected via blood 8 days after fertilization of the egg, and in the urine 10.

[[Obstetric ultrasonography]] may also be used to detect pregnancy. Obstetric ultrasonography was first practiced in the 1960s; the first home test kit for hCG was invented in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/patents/US3579306|website=Google Patents|publisher=USPTO and Google|accessdate=27 August 2014|title=Patent US3579306 Diagnostic test device}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kits went on the market in the United States and Europe in the mid-1970s.

==Modern tests==
At the beginning of the 1930s, [[Hillel Abbe Shapiro|Hillel Shapiro]] and Harry Zwarenstein, who were researchers at the University of Cape Town, discovered that if urine from a pregnant female was injected into the South African [[Xenopus]] toad and the toad ovulated, this indicated that the woman was pregnant. This test was used throughout the world from the 1930s to 1960s, with Xenopus toads being exported live in great numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophers|first=S.

The test for pregnancy which can give the quickest result after fertilisation is a [[rosette inhibition assay]] for [[early pregnancy factor]] (EPF).  EPF can be detected in blood within 48 hours of [[Human fertilization|fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fan XG, Zheng ZQ | title = A study of early pregnancy factor activity in preimplantation | journal = Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 359–64 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9196793 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1997.tb00244.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, testing for EPF is expensive and time-consuming.

Most chemical tests for pregnancy look for the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood or urine. hCG can be detected in urine or blood after implantation, which occurs six to twelve days after fertilization.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title = Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 23 | pages = 1796–1799 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10362823 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199906103402304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative blood (serum beta) tests can detect hCG levels as low as 1&amp;nbsp;mIU/mL, while [[urine test strip]]s have published detection thresholds of 10&amp;nbsp;mIU/mL to 100&amp;nbsp;mIU/mL, depending on the brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web| author=Waddell, Rebecca Smith| year=2006| title=FertilityPlus.org| work=Home Pregnancy Test hCG Levels and FAQ| url=http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.html| accessdate=2006-06-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615212054/http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.html| archivedate=2006-06-15| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative blood tests generally have a threshold of 25&amp;nbsp;mIU/mL, and so are less sensitive than some available home pregnancy tests. Most home pregnancy tests are based on [[Lateral flow test|lateral-flow]] technology.

With [[obstetric ultrasonography]] the [[gestational sac]] sometimes can be visualized as early as four and a half weeks of [[gestational age|gestation]] (approximately two and a half weeks after ovulation) and the [[yolk sac]] at about five weeks' gestation. The [[Embryo#The human embryo|embryo]] can be observed and measured by about five and a half weeks. The heartbeat may be seen as early as six weeks, and is usually visible by seven weeks' gestation.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Joseph | title = Why and when is Ultrasound used in Pregnancy? | work = Obstetric Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Guide | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/ | accessdate = 2007-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boschert"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boschert, Sherry |title=Anxious Patients Often Want Very Early Ultrasound Exam |journal=OB/GYN News |publisher=FindArticles.com |date=15 June 2001 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Anxious+Patients+Often+Want+Very+Early+Ultrasound+Exam.-a076636730 |accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==

A systematic review published in 1998 showed that home pregnancy test kits, when used by experienced technicians, are almost as accurate as professional laboratory testing (97.4%). When used by consumers, however, the accuracy fell to 75%: the review authors noted that many users misunderstood or failed to follow the instructions included in the kits. Improper usage may cause both false negatives and false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian LA, Nanda K, Hasselblad V, Simel DL | title = Diagnostic efficiency of home pregnancy test kits. A meta-analysis | journal = Arch Fam Med | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 465–9 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9755740 | doi = 10.1001/archfami.7.5.465 | url = http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9755740 | accessdate = 2008-05-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20081206110632/http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9755740 | archivedate = 2008-12-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing of test===
[[Type I and type II errors|False negative]] readings can occur when testing is done too early. Quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually begin to detect hCG shortly after implantation, which can occur anywhere from 6 to 12 days after [[ovulation]]. hCG levels continue to rise through the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, so the chances of false negative test results diminish with time (gestation age).&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; Less sensitive urine tests and qualitative blood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10362823 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304 | volume=340 | issue=23 | title=Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy | date=June 1999 |vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | pages=1796–9 | journal=New England Journal of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; tests may not detect pregnancy until three or four days after implantation. [[Menstruation]] occurs on average 14 days after ovulation, so the likelihood of a false negative is low once a menstrual period is late.

Ovulation may not occur at a predictable time in the [[menstrual cycle]], however. A number of factors may cause an unexpectedly early or late ovulation, even for women with a history of regular menstrual cycles. Using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), or charting the [[fertility awareness|fertility signs]] of [[cervix|cervical]] mucus or [[basal body temperature]] give a more accurate idea of when to test than day-counting alone.&lt;ref name="tcoyf"&gt;{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | pages=374 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}

The accuracy of a pregnancy test is most closely related to the day of ovulation, not of the act of intercourse or [[insemination]] that caused the pregnancy. It is normal for [[sperm]] to live up to five days in the [[fallopian tube]]s, waiting for ovulation to occur.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="tcoyf"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ellington | first = Joanna | title = Sperm Transport to the Fallopian Tubes | work =  Frequently Asked Questions with Dr. E | publisher = INGfertility Inc | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ingfertility.com/FAQs.html#Sperm_Leaking_Out_After_Intercourse-_Lessons_in_Sperm_Transport_Through_the_Cervix_ | accessdate = 2006-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060713234557/http://www.ingfertility.com/FAQs.html#Sperm_Leaking_Out_After_Intercourse-_Lessons_in_Sperm_Transport_Through_the_Cervix_ |archivedate = 2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It could take up to 12 further days for [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] to occur,&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; meaning even the most sensitive pregnancy tests may give false negatives up to 17 days after the act that caused the pregnancy. Because some home pregnancy tests have high hCG detection thresholds (up to 100 mIU/mL),&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; it may take an additional three or four days for hCG to rise to levels detectable by these tests — meaning false negatives may occur up to three weeks after the act of intercourse or insemination that causes pregnancy.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===False positives===
[[Type I and type II errors|False positive]] test results may occur for several reasons, including errors of test application, use of drugs containing the hCG molecule, and non-pregnant production of the hCG molecule.  Urine tests can be falsely positive in those that are taking the medications: [[chlorpromazine]], [[phenothiazines]] and [[methadone]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallach|first=Jacques|title=Interpretation of diagnostic tests|year=2007|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781730556|page=866|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCbXDdOvB9IC&amp;pg=PA866|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurious ''evaporation lines'' may appear on many home pregnancy tests if read after the suggested 3–5 minute window or reaction time, independent of an actual pregnancy. False positives may also appear on tests used past their expiration date.

A woman who has been given an hCG injection as part of [[infertility]] treatment will test positive on pregnancy tests that assay hCG, regardless of her actual pregnancy status. However, some infertility drugs (e.g.,  [[clomid]]) do not contain the hCG hormone.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

Some diseases of the [[liver]], [[cancer]]s, and other medical conditions may produce elevated [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] and thus cause a false positive pregnancy test. These include  [[choriocarcinoma]] and other [[germ cell tumor]]s, [[Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency|IgA deficiencies]], [[Heterophile|heterophile antibodies]], enterocystoplasties, [[gestational trophoblastic disease]]s (GTD), and gestational [[trophoblastic neoplasm]]s.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}

==Viability==
Pregnancy tests may be used to determine the viability of a pregnancy. Serial quantitative blood tests may be done, usually 3–4 days apart. Below an hCG level of 1,200 mIU/ml the hCG usually doubles every 48–72 hours, though a rise of 50–60% is still considered normal. Between 1,200 and 6,000 mIU/ml serum the hCG usually takes 72–90 hours to double, and above 6,000 mIU/ml, the hCG often takes more than four days to double. Failure to increase normally may indicate an increased risk of [[miscarriage]] or a possible [[ectopic pregnancy]].

[[Obstetric ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] is also a common tool for determining viability. A lower than expected heart rate or missed development milestones may indicate a problem with the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="boschert" /&gt; Diagnosis should not be made from a single ultrasound, however. Inaccurate estimations of fetal age and inaccuracies inherent in ultrasonic examination may cause a scan to be interpreted negatively. If results from the first ultrasound scan indicate a problem, repeating the scan 7–10 days later is reasonable practice.&lt;ref name="woo" /&gt;

Records of attempts at pregnancy testing have been found as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ian cultures. The ancient Egyptians watered bags of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] with the urine of a possibly pregnant woman. Germination indicated pregnancy. The type of grain that sprouted was taken as an indicator of the fetus's sex. [[Hippocrates]] suggested that a woman who had missed her period should drink a solution of [[honey]] in water at bedtime: resulting abdominal distention and cramps would indicate the presence of a pregnancy. [[Avicenna]] and many physicians after him in the [[Middle Ages]] performed ''[[uroscopy]]'', a nonscientific method to evaluate urine.

[[Selmar Aschheim]] and [[Bernhard Zondek]] introduced testing based on the presence of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speert | first = Harold | title = Iconographia Gyniatrica | publisher = F. A. Davis | year = 1973 | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-8036-8070-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of hCG had concluded that it was produced by the [[pituitary gland]]. In the 1930s, Doctor [[Georgeanna Jones]] discovered that hCG was produced not by the pituitary gland, but by the [[placenta]]. This discovery was important in relying on hCG as an early marker of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="jones obit"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Damewood MD, Rock JA | title = In memoriam: Georgeanna Seegar Jones, M.D.: her legacy lives on | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 541–2 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16363033 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.04.019 | url = http://www.jonesinstitutefoundation.org/downloads/GeorgeannaJones.pdf | publisher = American Society for Reproductive Medicine | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-12-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209064615/http://www.jonesinstitutefoundation.org/downloads/GeorgeannaJones.pdf | archivedate = 2008-12-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aschheim and Zondek test, an infantile female [[mouse]] was injected subcutaneously with urine of the person to be tested, and the mouse later was killed and dissected. Presence of [[ovulation]] indicated that the urine contained hCG and meant that the person was pregnant. A similar test was developed [[Rabbit test|using immature rabbits]]. Here, too, killing the animal to check her ovaries was necessary. An improvement arrived with the frog test, introduced by [[Lancelot Hogben]], which still was used in the 1950s and allowed the frog to remain alive and be used repeatedly: a female [[frog]] was injected with [[Serum (blood)|serum]] or urine of the patient; if the frog produced [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] within the next 24 hours, the test was positive. This was called the Bufo test, named after the toad genus ''[[Bufo]]'', which was originally used for the test. Other species of toads and frogs have been used later on.

Hormonal pregnancy tests such as [[Primodos]] and [[Duogynon]] were used in the 1960s and 1970s in the UK and Germany. These tests involved taking a dosed amount of hormones, and observing the response a few days later. A pregnant woman does not react, as she is producing the hormones in pregnancy; a woman not pregnant responds to the absence of the hormone by beginning a new menstrual cycle. While the test was (is) generally considered accurate, research advancements have replaced it with simpler techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.muvs.org/contraception/pregnancy-tests/duogynon-id1614|title=Titel: Museum für Verhütung und Schwangerschaftsabbruch - Museum of Contraception and Abortion|first=Creator, Autor: Christian|last=Fiala|date=29 March 2018|website=en.muvs.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immunologic pregnancy tests were introduced in 1960 when Wide and [[Carl Axel Gemzell|Gemzell]] presented a test based on in-vitro hemagglutination inhibition. This was a first step away from in-vivo pregnancy testing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yzrOivXR75QC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33&amp;dq=carl+gemzell#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20gemzell&amp;f=false  |vauthors=Bleavins MR, Carini C, Malle JR, Rahbari R | title=Biomarkers in Drug Development: A Handbook of Practice, Application, and  Strategy, Chapter 1, Blood and Urine Chemistry | publisher=John Wiley and Sons|  year=2010 | page=|  isbn=978-0-470-16927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intapp3.phadia.com/PageFiles/27898/Wide.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130517/http://intapp3.phadia.com/PageFiles/27898/Wide.PDF |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiated a series of improvements in pregnancy testing leading to the contemporary at-home testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wide L | title = Inventions leading to the development of the diagnostic test kit industry--from the modern pregnancy test to the sandwich assays | journal = Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–216 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16454158 | doi=10.3109/2000-1967-066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct measurement of [[antigen]]s, such as [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], was made possible after the invention of the [[radioimmunoassay]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yalow RS, Berson SA | title = Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 1157–75 | date = July 1960 | pmid = 13846364 | pmc = 441860 | doi = 10.1172/JCI104130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioimmunoassays require sophisticated apparatus and special radiation precautions and are expensive.

[[Organon International]] obtained the first patent on a home pregnancy test in 1969, two years after product designer [[Margaret Crane]] noticed that the laboratory testing procedure was relatively simple and made a prototype.  The product became available in Canada in 1971, and the United States in 1977, after delays caused by concerns over sexual morality and the ability of women to perform test and cope with the results without a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/opinion/sunday/could-women-be-trusted-with-their-own-pregnancy-tests.html|title=Could Women Be Trusted With Their Own Pregnancy Tests?|last=Kennedy|first=Pagan|date=2016-07-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another home pregnancy testing kit was based on the work of [[Judith Vaitukaitis]] and Glenn Braunstein, who developed a sensitive hCG assay at the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name=Vaitukaitis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaitukaitis|first1=JL|title=Development of the home pregnancy test|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=December 2004|volume=1038|pages=220–2|pmid=15838116|doi=10.1196/annals.1315.030|bibcode=2004NYASA1038..220V}}&lt;/ref&gt; That test went onto the market in 1978.&lt;ref name=Thin-Blue-Line&gt;{{cite web|last1=A Thin Blue Line: The History of the Pregnancy Test Kit|title=A Timeline of Pregnancy Testing|url=http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/thinblueline/timeline.html|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1970s, the discovery of [[monoclonal antibodies]] led to the development of the relatively simple and cheap [[immunoassay]]s, such as agglutination-inhibition-based assays and [[ELISA#Sandwich ELISA|sandwich ELISA]], used in modern home pregnancy tests.  Tests are now so cheap that they can be mass-produced in a general publication and used for advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nudd|first1=Ti|title=Ikea Wants You to Pee on This Ad.

== History ==
In 1979, veteran social worker and the then [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] [[Sarsanghachalak]] Shri [[Balasaheb Deoras]] addressed a mammoth gathering of volunteers at [[Ambedkar Stadium]], [[Delhi]], on 8 April 1978, where he called upon them to start service activities among the neglected sections of the society. He asked the volunteers to raise self-respect of the socially and economically deprived people of India. This speech is considered to be the initiating first step that led to starting the Seva Bharati. Although the volunteers of RSS and other allied organisations had been informally working for the betterment of the under-privileged, it was opined that a formal structure would help coordinate the service programs all over the country. Seva Bharati was thus established later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://organiser.org//Encyc/2004/4/18/Sangh-Samachar-br----br---Seva-Bharati-Delhi-organises-Mass-marriage-on-Dr-Hedgewar-s-birthday.aspx?NB=&amp;lang=3&amp;m1=&amp;m2=&amp;p1=&amp;p2=&amp;p3=&amp;p4=]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seva Bharati British Deputy High Commissioner's visit.jpg|thumb|left|300px|British Deputy High Commissioner Stuart Innes visiting Seva Bharati's rehabilitation centre for child labor, Telangana]]
Seva Bharati has large number of centers that provide vocational training to economically underprivileged women. It trains women in making [[handicrafts]] and decorative items and helps to market these products. Hundreds of girls trained by Seva Bharati over the years are transforming handicrafts into a successful cottage industry mostly in the [[North-east India|North Eastern states of India]]. Seva Bharati also conducts camps and organises exhibitions of handicrafts churned out at such camps and works as a catalyst in marketing these items. The participants are usually trained in fabric painting, hand stitching, pot-painting, glass painting, jute work, flower-making, cane and bamboo craft, pith and banana fibre craft. As a volunteer notes, the best part is that the items produced by these women are in demand because of their quality and hence are getting bulk orders. The handicrafts are today finding their way into homes across India.&lt;ref name = telegraph&gt;Girls craft their destinies, The Telegraph, Friday, 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Seva Bharati reports that it has a total of 1404 such training projects across India, including centers that teach computers, tailoring, shorthand, stitching, sweater making, typing, carpentry, nursing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/14/stories/2008011461220400.htm Training in home nursing], 14 January 2008.

===Human rights campaign===
From the Valley of Kashmir to the Hills of the North-eastern India Seva Bharati works tirelessly for the basic human rights. The campaign for the [[Kashmiri Pandits]] or the campaign for the Pardhees of Maharashtra (labeled at birth as criminal tribe) or the Chenchu tribals of Nallamala Andhra Pradesh or the Gonds of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh the campaign for a better life and rights continues.

Pardhees are one of the 150 communities that the British notified as criminals in 1871. Though the Indian republic denotified them in 1952, 60&amp;nbsp;million of them continue to be social outcasts and victims at the hands of the police.

It has taken up the issues such as wage deprivation, assault and abuse and has also represented their concerns to various governmental bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Week after help's death in Gurgaon, no head way, Siddhartha Sarma, ''The Indian Express'', New Delhi, 31 January, [http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=115958]&lt;/ref&gt; It has coordinated with the governmental agencies to save rescue girls from abuse and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/10/stories/2006031005360700.htm "Teenage girls brought back to Kochi from Goa"], ''The Hindu'', 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driver roams with body in ambulance for 5 days, Sify.com, 22 February 2008 23:02:06 [http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14609349]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relief and rehabilitation during natural calamities==

===Following the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake===
As many as 25,000 volunteers, including 600 doctors, from Seva Bharati, worked to rescue and rehabilitate the victims of the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]]. Nearly 10,000 operations were performed and over 19,000 patients were treated of injuries and other ailments. Besides, the organisation sent huge amounts of relief material for the quake-hit victims from different parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010208/region.htm '&amp;#39;The Tribune'&amp;#39;, Chandigarh, 02-08-2001]. ''The Tribune''. (8 February 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

News magazine ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' reported "Literally within minutes RSS / Seva Bharati volunteers were at the scenes of distress. Across Gujarat, the (RSS) cadres were the saviours. Even as the state machinery went comatose in the first two days after the quake, the cadre-based machinery of the Sangh fanned out throughout the state. Approximately 35,000 RSS members in uniform were pressed into service."

In the words of the district collector of Ahmedabad K. Srinivas: "This is an old tradition in the RSS. To be the first at any disaster strike: floods, cyclone, drought and now quake. In [[Kachchh]], too, the RSS / Seva Bharati was the first to reach the affected areas. At Anjar, a town in ruins, the RSS was present much before the Army and took the lead in finding survivors and fishing out the dead."

''[[India Today]]'', arguably India's most respected weekly, reported in its issue of 12 Feb 2001, that "It is conceded by even their worst detractors that the RSS through Seva bharati has been in the forefront of the non-official rescue and relief (operations). This has led to an upsurge of goodwill for the Sangh".&lt;ref name="india-today.com"/&gt;

===Following the 2004 tsunami===
When the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] hit the southern coasts of India, thousands of volunteers, under the aegis of the Seva Bharati, engaged in relief work. The volunteers, in cooperation with organisations like Ramakrishna Mutt in Tamil Nadu, Nair Service Society, Sri Narayana Guru Dharma Paripalana Yogam and Mata Amrithanandamayi Mutt in Kerala and Janakshema Samiti in Andhra Pradesh, set up relief camps in tsunami-affected districts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They distributed thousands of food packets, organised teams doctors and cremated thousands of dead bodies.

''Tughlaq'', a magazine based in Chennai, carried a report on the relief work of the tsunami that hit the coasts of Tamil Nadu. It reported that when the tsunami left the whole government machinery paralysed, it was because of the immediate relief work of Seva Bharati that hundreds of lives were saved. "Seva Bharati had started rehabilitating people fleeing from the waves, losing their houses, boats, nets, etc., by feeding them, settling them in dry places, etc. during the first day itself. Medical relief was also made available in all the 208 places spread over nine districts." It further adds "The task of even taking the dead bodies to the medical centres appeared too daunting. It was the Seva Bharati workers who dared to venture into seashores and retrieve the bodies. From the beginning of the calamity on the morning of the 26th up to writing this on 2 January, the number of dead retrieved by Seva Bharati is 2,469! There have been occasions when some have been rescued alive while searching for bodies." The editor of Tughlaq, and noted dramatist Cho Ramaswamy says "The concerned authorities admit privately that it was the RSS-sponsored Seva Bharati, which did yeoman service everywhere. Politics forbids them to acknowledge this in public".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hvk.org/articles/0305/22.html Tughlaq, January 12, 2005 (Translated version)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212174102/http://www.hvk.org/articles/0305/22.html |date=12 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitating the victims of terrorism==
Seva Bharati has adopted a hundred children from the insurgency and militancy affected regions of Jammu and Kashmir including Gul, Mohore, Dharmani and Buddhal Tehsils in Udhampur and Rajouri districts. The children, both Hindu and Muslim, who have been adopted have been rendered orphans by terrorist attacks in which many of the family members have been killed. The children are in the age group of five to fifteen. They will study till Class 12 in boarding schools in Delhi, which are funded or supported by the Seva Bharati.

The project by Seva Bharati hopes to give these children a life away from bloodshed and give them back their lost childhood and new dreams to chase. Their parents and guardians are happy that their children are in safe hands.

The Indian Army, which has selected the NGO for adoption, says that they are optimistic that these children after 10 years, will be some of the finest citizens of the country. The army sees a bright future for these children and believes that the humane gesture of NGOs like Seva Bharati and similar organisations from various parts of the country will go a long way in boosting the efforts to bring in an era of peace and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir and more so root out the evil of terrorism from this region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/jammu-kids-get-home-away-from-guns/14093-3.html?from=search Jammu kids get home away from guns, IBN live, Wed, 28 Jun 2006].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7542">'''Supportive psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic approach]] that integrates various schools to provide therapeutic support. It includes components from therapeutic schools such as [[psychodynamic]], [[cognitive-behavioral]], and [[interpersonal psychotherapy|interpersonal]] conceptual models and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Winston, Arnold; Richard N. Rosenthal; &amp; Henry Pinsker. ''Introduction to Supportive Psychotherapy''. Washington, D.C., American Psychiatric Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of supportive psychotherapy is to reduce or to relieve the intensity of manifested or presenting symptoms, distress or disability. It also reduces the extent of behavioral disruptions caused by the patient's psychic conflicts or disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewald|first=P. A.|date=1994|title=Principles of supportive psychotherapy|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=48|issue=4|pages=505–518|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1994.48.4.505|issn=0002-9564|pmid=7872414}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the [[psychotherapist|therapist]] is to reinforce the patient's healthy and adaptive [[cognitive therapy|patterns of thought]] [[behavioral therapy|behaviors]] in order to reduce the intrapsychic conflicts that produce symptoms of [[mental disorder]]s. Unlike in [[psychoanalysis]], in which the analyst works to maintain a neutral demeanor as a "blank canvas" for [[transference]], in supportive therapy the therapist engages in a fully emotional, encouraging, and supportive relationship with the patient as a method of furthering healthy [[defense mechanisms]], especially in the context of [[interpersonal relationships]].

==Uses==
This therapy has been used for patients suffering from severe cases of addiction as well as [[bulimia nervosa]], stress and other mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Werman, David S. ''The Practice of Supportive Psychotherapy''. New York, New York, Psychology Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supportive psychotherapy is used as an initial therapy, to be reduced and not to be prolonged, in situations or periods where there is a lack of means for a systematic approach or [[behaviorism]]. Examples of such situations include: 
* critical negotiations
* volatile but unavoidable everyday life or decisive situations
* compromises (to introduce at least minimal operational, efficient relationship conditions) in long term, engaged relationships, based on lasting agreements

A [[systematic review]] examined the effectiveness of supportive therapy for people with [[schizophrenia]]:

Internet-based supportive psychotherapy is a type of supportive psychotherapy that is characterized by having a two-hour initial meeting between the client and therapist, and then periodic and occasional study conducted by therapist through email and telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06122057| pmid=17974932|title = A Randomized, Controlled Proof-of-Concept Trial of an Internet-Based, Therapist-Assisted Self-Management Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder| journal=American Journal of Psychiatry| volume=164| issue=11| pages=1676–1684|year = 2007|last1 = Litz|first1 = Brett T.| last2=Engel| first2=Charles C.| last3=Bryant| first3=Richard A.| last4=Papa| first4=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The success of [[vaccines]] and [[anti-virus software]] in preventing major outbreaks relies on the mechanism of [[herd immunity]], also known as community immunity, where the immunization of individuals provides protection for not only the individuals, but also the community at large.&lt;ref name=JohnJacob2000&gt;

|pages=601–606
|doi=10.1023/A:1007626510002
|pmid=11078115
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of biological contagions such as [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[chicken pox]], immunizing a [[critical community size]] can provide protection against the disease for members who cannot be vaccinated themselves (infants, pregnant women, and [[immunocompromised]] individuals). Often however these vaccine programmes require the immunization of a large majority of the population to provide herd immunity.&lt;ref name=communityimmunity&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have been shown to be [[scale-free networks]] and as such exhibit a [[power-law]] distribution for the [[degree distribution]]. In large networks this results in the vast majority of nodes (individuals in [[social networks]]) having few connections or low degree ''k'', while a few "hubs" have many more connections than the average &lt;''k''&gt;.&lt;ref name=BAmodel1999&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This wide variability ([[heterogeneity]]) in degree offers immunization strategies based on targeting members of the network according to their connectivity rather than random immunization of the network. In epidemic modeling on scale-free networks, targeted immunization schemes can considerably lower the vulnerability of a network to epidemic outbreaks over random immunization schemes. Typically these strategies result in the need for far fewer nodes to be immunized in order to provide the same level of protection to the entire network as in random immunization.&lt;ref name=PastorVespignani2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka2014&gt;

'''Examples'''

A common approach for targeted immunization studies in scale-free networks focuses on targeting the highest degree nodes for immunization. These nodes are the most highly connected in the network, making them more likely to spread the contagion if infected. Immunizing this segment of the network can drastically reduce the impact of the disease on the network and requires the immunization of far fewer nodes compared to randomly selecting nodes.&lt;ref name=PastorVespignani2002 /&gt; However, this strategy relies on knowing the global structure of the network, which may not always be practical.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;

Another strategy, ''acquaintance immunization'',&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenMadar2004&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; tries to target all of the most highly connected nodes for immunization by going through their neighbors without knowing the full [[network topology]]. In this approach a random group of nodes are chosen and then a random set of their neighbors are selected for immunization. The most highly connected nodes are far more likely to be in this group of neighbors so immunizing this group results in targeting the most highly connected but requiring far less information about the network.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChristakisFowler2010&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant of this strategy again calls for the random selection of nodes but instead asks for one of their neighbors with a higher degree, or at least more than a given threshold degree and immunizes them.&lt;ref name=GallosLiljeros2007 /&gt; These degree based strategies consistently require fewer nodes to be immunized and as such improve a network's chances against epidemic attacks.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenMadar2004 /&gt;

A recent centrality measure, Percolation Centrality, introduced by Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piraveenan|first=Mahendra|last2=Prokopenko|first2=Mikhail|last3=Hossain|first3=Liaquat|date=2013-01-22|title=Percolation Centrality: Quantifying Graph-Theoretic Impact of Nodes during Percolation in Networks|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53095|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3551907|pmid=23349699|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853095P}}&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly useful in identifying nodes for vaccination based on the network topology. Unlike node degree which depends on topology alone, however, percolation centrality takes into account the topological importance of a node as well as its distance from infected nodes in deciding its overall importance. Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has shown that percolation centrality-based vaccination is particularly effective when the proportion of people already infected is on the same order of magnitude as the number of people who could be vaccinated before the disease spreads much further. If infection spread is at its infancy, then ring-vaccination surrounding the source of infection is most effective, whereas if the proportion of people already infected is much higher than the number of people that could be vaccinated quickly, then vaccination will only help those who are vaccinated and herd immunity cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="communityimmunity" /&gt; Percolation centrality-based vaccination is most effective in the critical scenario where the infection has already spread too far to be completely surrounded by ring-vaccination, yet not spread wide enough so that it cannot be contained by strategic vaccination. Nevertheless, Percolation Centrality also needs full network topology to be computed, and thus is more useful in higher levels of abstraction (for example, networks of townships rather than social networks of individuals), where the corresponding network topology can more readily be obtained.

==Increasing immunization coverage==
Millions of children worldwide do not receive all of the routine vaccinations as per their national schedule. As immunization is a powerful public health strategy for improving child survival, it is important to determine what strategies work best to increase coverage. A Cochrane review assessed the effectiveness of intervention strategies to boost and sustain high childhood immunization coverage in low- and middle income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oyo-Ita|first1=A|last2=Nwachukwu|first2=CE|last3=Oringanje|first3=C|last4=Meremikwu|first4=MM|title=Interventions for improving coverage of child immunization in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 July 2011|issue=7|pages=CD008145|pmid=21735423|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008145.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394698|date = July 2018}} Fourteen trials were included but most of the evidence was of low quality. Providing parents and other community members with information on immunization, health education at facilities in combination with redesigned immunization reminder cards, regular immunization outreach with and without household incentives, home visits, and integration of immunization with other services may improve childhood immunization coverage in low-and middle income countries.

'''Tornwaldt's disease''' is the inflammation or abscess of the embryonic [[cyst]] of [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] [[bursa]].It is located in the midline of the posterior wall of the [[nasopharynx]]. It is covered anteriorly by mucosa in the adenoid mass. It is bounded posteriorly by [[longus muscle]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7856446|year=1994|last1=Miyahara|first1=H.|title=Tornwaldt's disease|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica. Supplementum|volume=517|pages=36–9|last2=Matsunaga|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tornwaldt's disease was noted by Mayer in 1840. He noted it in an [[autopsy]] specimen but founded as a [[pathologic]] entity by German physician Gustavust L. Tornwaldt in 1855.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7860/JCDR/2014/8086.4695 |pmid=25302225 |pmc=4190747|year=2014 |last1=Jyotirmay |first1=H. |title=Recent Trends in the Management of Thornwaldts cyst: A Case Report |journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=KD03–4 |last2=Kumar |first2=S. A. |last3=Preetam |first3=P. |last4=Manjunath |first4=D. |last5=Bijiraj |first5=V. V. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few cases have been reported in Japan between 1929 and 1992.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In 2008-2009, six patients were diagnosed to have [[nasopharyngeal]] [[bursitis]].Out of which four were males and two females&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=3|pages=331–4|pmid=21116338|pmc=2990394|year=2010|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S13257|last1=El-Shazly|first1=A.|title=Nasopharyngeal bursitis: From embryology to clinical presentation|last2=Barriat|first2=S.|last3=Lefebvre|first3=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Tornwaldt's disease is caused by many different causative agents of stimulus. This includes excessive alcohol and tobacco which causes decrease in local immune resistance and so the pathogenic microbes take advantage and lead to the disease. Frequent contact with high temperature, malnutrition, chronic heart disease, kidney disease, joint disease, poor living and working conditions and contact with dust and harmful gases leads to the thornwaldt's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pharyngeal bursitis|url=http://www.healthfrom.com/Disease/view-2965.html|website=www.healthfrom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
Tornwaldt's disease is a rare benign disorder caused by persistent [[notochord]] remnants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwok|first1=P|last2=Hawke|first2=M|last3=Jahn|first3=AF|last4=Mehta|first4=M|title=Tornwaldt's cyst: clinical and radiological aspects|journal=The Journal of Otolaryngology|date=March 1987|volume=16|issue=2|pages=104–7|pmid=3599152}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disease almost remains asymptomatic.{{cn|date=October 2018}} At about the 10th week of embryonic development, the pharyngeal pouch forms by adhesion of the [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] [[ectoderm]] to the cranial end of the notochord. This become closed at the orifice or crusts adhere to the orifice without closing.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The contact between these remnants and pharyngeal ectoderm leads to the growth of respiratory [[epithelium]]. This forms Tornwaldt's bursa which drains into the nasopharyngeal cavity. This only forms cyst when the orifice partially or completely obstructed by infection. A Tornwaldt's cyst progresses in to Tornwaldt's disease only after infection or inflammation occurs.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms usually appear when there is inflammation of pharyngeal bursa causing Tornwaldt's cyst. This is caused by spontaneous drainage in the nasopharyngeal cavity or can also be caused because of involvement of nervous plexus.
The symptoms are occipital headache, cough, middle ear effusion,cervical myalgia, halitosis ie bad breath. When there is an enlargement of the cyst it causes symptoms like nasal obstruction, post nasal discharge with foul smelling odour, blockage of Eustachian tube causing otalgia and secretory otitis media, retro orbital pain.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Diagnosis==
[[CT scan]] shows solid mass of Tornwaldt's cyst and [[MRI]] shows glass shaped lesion with a fluid on upper part of posterior nasopharyngeal wall. Additionally, a cystic mass in upper part of nasopharyngeal wall and [[mucopurulent]] discharge from upper part of the mass can be seen on nasal [[endoscopy]]. Among them MRI is the best for diagnosing the Tornwaldt's cyst.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Treatment==
Antibiotics are given to treat the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=PL Dhingra, Shruti Dhingra|title=Diseases of EAR, NOSE and THROAT &amp; HEAD and NECK SURGERY |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-81-312-3431-0 |page=245 |edition= 6th|date=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a large symptomatic lesion, surgery by transnasal endoscopic marsupialisation is the treatment option because it is safe,fast and provides good visualization during surgery and for small lesion Endonasal approach is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

The '''UCSF School of Nursing''' is the [[nursing school]] of [[University of California, San Francisco]], and is located in San Francisco, California. It is the number one nursing school in the United States by [[NIH]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSF Is Top Public Recipient of NIH Research Funding for 6th Consecutive Year|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/03/406096/ucsf-top-public-recipient-nih-research-funding-6th-consecutive-year|website=UC San Francisco|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized as one of the premier graduate nursing schools in the United States. 

==History==
Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in [[Golden Gate Park]] and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges (now called [[UCSF]]). This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of health facilities. Finally, in April 1907 one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and in 1907, the UC Training School for Nurses was established as the fourth Affiliated College of the [[University of California]] Medical Department, joining the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1868-1898 - Introduction - A History of UCSF |url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/story.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valeri Vladimirovich Polyakov''' ({{lang-ru|Валерий Владимирович Поляков}}, born '''Valeri Ivanovich Korshunov''' on April 27, 1942) is a former Russian [[cosmonaut]]. He is the holder of the record for the longest single [[human spaceflight|stay in space]] in human history, staying aboard the [[Mir]] [[space station]] for more than 14 months (437 days 18 hours) during one trip.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwirtz|first=Michael|title=Staying Put on Earth, Taking a Step to Mars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/science/space/31mars.html|accessdate=15 May 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His combined space experience is more than 22 months.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Valeri Vladimirovich Polyakov|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=132|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Space History|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected as a cosmonaut in 1972, Polyakov made his first flight into space aboard [[Soyuz TM-6]] in 1988. He returned to Earth 240 days later aboard [[Soyuz TM-7|TM-7]]. Polyakov completed his second flight into space in 1994–1995, spending 437 days in space between launching on [[Soyuz TM-18]] and landing on [[Soyuz TM-20|TM-20]], setting the record for the longest time continuously spent in space by an individual in human history.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

== Early life ==
Polyakov was born in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in the USSR on April 27, 1942. Born Valeri Ivanovich Korshunov, Polyakov legally changed his name after being adopted by his stepfather in 1957. He was educated at the Tula Secondary School No. 4, from which he graduated in 1959.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

He enrolled in the I. M. Sechenov 1st Moscow Medical Institute, where he graduated with a doctoral degree. After, he enrolled in the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems, Ministry of Public Health, Moscow, where he specialized in [[Aerospace medicine|astronautics medicine]]. Polyakov dedicated himself to the field of space medicine in 1964 after the flight of the first physician in space, [[Boris Yegorov]], aboard [[Voskhod 1]].&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

== Cosmonaut career ==

[[File:Cosmonaut Polyakov Watches Discovery's Rendezvous With Mir - GPN-2002-000078.jpg|thumb|right|Polyakov observes rendezvous operations with the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] on its [[STS-63]] mission through a window on the [[Mir Core Module]] in February 1995.]]

Polyakov was selected as a cosmonaut in [[List of astronauts by year of selection#1972|Medical Group 3]] on March 22, 1972. His first flight into space occurred on [[Soyuz TM-6]] in 1988. After staying aboard the Mir space station and conducting research for 240 days, Polyakov returned to Earth aboard [[Soyuz TM-7]].&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

Polyakov's second spaceflight, the longest human spaceflight in history, began on January 8, 1994 with the launch of the [[Soyuz TM-18]] mission. He spent approximately 437 days aboard Mir conducting experiments and performing scientific research. During this flight, he completed just over 7,000 orbits of the Earth. On January 9, 1995, after 366 days in space, Polyakov formally broke the spaceflight duration record previously set by [[Vladimir Titov]] and [[Musa Manarov]] six years earlier.&lt;ref name=leavingearth&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimmerman|first=Robert|title=Leaving earth: space stations, rival superpowers, and the quest for interplanetary travel|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08548-9|pages=366–372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0e2vl0sev2IC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=valeri+polyakov#v=onepage&amp;q=valeri%20polyakov&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Earth aboard [[Soyuz TM-20]] on March 22, 1995.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt; Upon landing, Polyakov opted not to be carried the few feet between the [[Soyuz-TM|Soyuz capsule]] and a nearby lawn chair, instead walking the short distance. In doing so, he wished to prove that humans could be physically capable of working on the surface of [[Mars]] after a long-duration transit phase.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis|title=March 22, 1995: Longest Human Space Adventure Ends|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0322cosmonaut-space-record/|accessdate=23 June 2016|newspaper=Wired.com|date=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyakov volunteered for his 437-day flight to learn how the human body would respond to the [[Micro-g environment|micro-gravity]] environment on long-duration missions to Mars.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Upon returning from his second spaceflight, Polyakov held the record for the most total time in space. This record was later broken by [[Sergei Avdeyev]] and is currently held by [[Gennady Padalka]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirnasa/&gt; Data from Polyakov's flight has been used by researchers to determine that humans are able to maintain a healthy mental state during long-duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manzey|first1=Dietrich |last2=Lorenz|first2=Bernd |last3=Poljakov|first3=Valeri |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight|journal=Ergonomics|date=1 April 1998|volume=41|issue=4|pages=537–559|doi=10.1080/001401398186991|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/001401398186991|accessdate=28 January 2011|pmid=9557591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyakov underwent medical assessments before, during, and after the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared the results of these medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of [[Jungian cognitive functions|cognitive functions]], Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sy&gt;{{cite web|title=March 22nd, 1995 – 15th Anniversary of Valeri Polyakov’s return to Earth|url=http://spaceyuga.com/march-22nd-1995-15th-anniversary-valeri-polyakovs-return-earth/|publisher=Space Yuga|accessdate=2 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827170518/http://spaceyuga.com/march-22nd-1995-15th-anniversary-valeri-polyakovs-return-earth/|archivedate=27 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as [[Manned mission to Mars|manned missions to Mars]].&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;

=== Spaceflights ===
* [[Soyuz TM-6]] / [[Soyuz TM-7]] – August 28, 1988 to April 27, 1989 – 240 days, 22 hours, 34 minutes
* [[Soyuz TM-18]] / [[Soyuz TM-20]] – January 8, 1994 to March 22, 1995 – 437 days, 17 hours, 58 minutes

== Personal life ==

Polyakov retired from his position as a cosmonaut in June 1995, with a total of just over 678 days in space.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyakov |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/polyakov.htm |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=27 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302031757/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/polyakov.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in experiment SFINCSS-99 (Simulation of Flight of International Crew on Space Station) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Валерий Владимирович Поляков|year=2011|url=http://www.astronaut.ru/crossroad/210.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyakov is currently the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Public Health in Moscow, where he oversees the medical aspects of long-duration space missions.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt; He is a member of the Russian Chief Medical Commission, participating in the qualification and selection of cosmonauts. He also holds membership in the International Space Researcher's Association and the [[International Academy of Astronautics]].&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=iaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership List|url=http://www.iaaweb.org/iaa/Membership/membershiplist.pdf|publisher=International Academy of Astronautics|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyakov is married and has one child.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

Since returning from space, Polyakov remained active in the discipline of international spaceflight, becoming a "cosmonaut-investigator" for the United States, Austria, Germany, and France during their respective space science missions to the Mir space station.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Polyakov has won several awards for his spaceflight and academic achievements, including the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Order of Lenin]], [[Legion of Honour|Order of the Legion of Honour]], and the [[Order of Parasat]]. He is a member of organizations related to [[astronautics]], including the Russian Chief Medical Commission on cosmonauts' certification.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

Polyakov holds the title of "Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR" and has published several works pertaining to [[life sciences]], medical aspects of space missions, and the results of research conducted on long-duration spaceflights.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;

Polyakov's record for longest cumulative time in space of 678 days over two missions stood until surpassed in 1999 by cosmonaut [[Sergei Avdeyev]] with a total of 747 days in space during three different missions.&lt;ref name=nmmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirnasa&gt;{{cite web|title=Mir Space Station|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/mir/mir.htm|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vegetable box scheme''' is an operation that delivers fresh fruit and vegetables, often locally grown and [[Organic food|organic]], either directly to the customer or to a local collection point. Typically the produce is sold as an ongoing weekly [[subscription]] and the offering may vary week to week depending on what is [[Seasonal food|in season]].

The first organic box scheme was created by [[Guy Watson]] in 1987,{{cn|date=October 2017}} who delivered fresh produce locally from [[Riverford]] farm. These schemes are usually operated by the grower or a small [[co-operative]]. There are approximately 600 such schemes operating in the UK&lt;ref name="BBC Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |title=Boxes of delight |publisher=BBC Green |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614075148/http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |archivedate=June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by early 2007, according to the [[Soil Association]], retail sales via such schemes were in excess of £100 million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0Bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce!OpenDocument |title=How to set up a vegetable box scheme |year=2007 |publisher=The Soil Association |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517015208/http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce%21OpenDocument |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schemes are run on a local or regional basis, delivering food direct from the producer to the consumer. Other schemes offer a nationwide delivery, with produce supplied by a network of growers, co-operatives and wholesalers negating the [[local food]] affiliation of these schemes. Some British [[supermarket]]s have also begun offering vegetable boxes.&lt;ref name="BBC Green" /&gt;

==How a vegetable box scheme works==
A box scheme usually works by subscription. A customer signs up to a weekly or fortnightly delivery of fresh vegetables and/or fruit. The contents will vary week to week as selected by the box scheme provider on the basis of [[seasonality]] and availability. Some schemes offer the option of purchasing extra goods to be delivered along with the vegetable box, such as dairy produce and meat.&lt;ref name="Timesonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article1380105.ece|title=Top 35 organic box schemes in the UK|date=March 3, 2008|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Wyke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6640">'''Wildcrafting''' (also known as [[foraging]]) is the practice of [[harvest]]ing plants from their natural, or 'wild' habitat, primarily for [[food]] or [[medicine|medicinal]] purposes. It applies to uncultivated plants wherever they may be found, and is not necessarily limited to [[wilderness]] areas. Ethical considerations are often involved, such as protecting [[endangered species]], potential for [[tragedy of the commons|depletion of commonly held resources]], and in the context of private property, preventing [[theft]] of valuable plants, for example, [[ginseng]]. Four states and five national forests in [[America]] actively manage the wild harvesting of ginseng to ensure sustainability of wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitty|first=Haley|title=2013 Efforts to Improve Sustainable Management of Wild American Ginseng Harvest|url= http://cms.herbalgram.org/heg/volume10/10October/2013StateGinsengHarvests.html|work=American Botanical Council|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Europe]], non-wood forest products (e.g., forest fruits, mushroom, cork, pine kernels, acorns, medicinal herbs, essential oils, chestnuts etc.) can be significant in the bioeconomy, especially in regions where wood is not the most profitable product. These were examined during a four year study called The StarTree Project which assessed the wildcrafting of non-timber forest products across 14 regions of [[Europe]] to explore best practice and commercial opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Summary of the State of the European non-timber forest products (NWFP)|url=https://star-tree.eu/images/publications/project/Glossy%20SoSR_draft_final.pdf|work=The StarTree Project|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When wildcrafting is done [[sustainability|sustainably]] and with proper respect, generally only the fruit, flowers or branches from plants are taken and the living plant is left, or if it is necessary to take the whole plant, seeds of the plant are placed in the empty hole from which the plant was taken. Care is taken to remove only a few plants, flowers, or branches, so plenty remains to continue the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buren|first=Bruce|title=Wildcrafting: A "simple" life fraught with a host of complex ethical and practical considerations|url=http://www.newfarm.org/features/0304/wilds/wild_ethics.shtml|work=The Rodale Institute|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Foragers believes that [[foraging]] by people plays an increasingly important role supporting, promoting and defending the health of all plants, fungi, algae, animals (including humans) and the habitats/environments in which they exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Association of Foragers Principles and Practice|url=https://www.foragers-association.org.uk/index.php/principles-and-practice|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants for a Future database lists 7000 plants with edible, medicinal or other uses. In the USA, the mission of United Plant Savers is to protect native medicinal plants of the United States and Canada (such as [[Hydrastis canadensis|Goldenseal]]) and their native habitat while ensuring an abundant renewable supply of medicinal plants for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About United Plant Savers|url=http://www.unitedplantsavers.org/about-ups|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that foraging in small amounts for personal use by people and their families has any impact on populations of plants and fungi. However, once a species attracts widespread commercial interest it can quickly come under pressure if sustainable harvesting and management procedures are not followed. A case in point is [[Arnica montana|Arnica]], a medicinal species made into homeopathic remedies and highly popular first aid creams for bumps and bruises. It is now under strict protection and is included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species&lt;ref&gt;A. Falniowski, I. Bazos, I. Hodálová, R. Lansdown, and A. Petrova, “Arnica montana,” in IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, version 2012.2, IUCN, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Red Data Books and Red Data Lists of many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;D. Korneck, M. Schnittler, and I. Vollmer, “Red list of Pteridophyta and Spermatophyta in Germany,” in Red List of Endangered Plants in Germany, G. Ludwig and M. Schnittler, Eds., vol. 28 of Schriftenreihe für Vegetationskunde, pp. 21–187, Bundesamt für Naturschutz, Bonn, Germany, 1996 (German).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Zarzycki and Z. Szeląg, “Red list of the vascular plants in Poland,” in Red List of the Plants and Fungi in Poland, Z. Mirek, K. Zarzycki, W. Wojewoda, and Z. Szeląg, Eds., pp. 11–20, W. Szafer Institute of Botany, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków, Poland, 2006 (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss of habitats, Arnica is mainly harvested from the wild. Dried flowers traded annually in Europe are estimated to be around 50 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;T. Burfield, “Updated list of threatened aromatic plants used in the aroma &amp; cosmetic industries,” 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2018}} The collection of Arnica for medicinal purposes has also caused disappearance or reduction in the size of several European populations.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lange, Europe's Medicinal and Aromatic Plants: Their Use, Trade and Conservation, TRAFFIC International, Cambridge, UK, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure on natural sources of this plant is alleviated by a suitable use of ''Arnica'' supply in the European region, where flower heads are harvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michler|first=Barbara|title=“Conservation of eastern European medicinal plants Arnica montana in Romania,” Case study Gârda de Sus, Management Plan, 2007.|url=http://ifanos.de/landschaftsoekologie/wwf_ro/_Managenmentplan%20Arnica%20montana%20Apuseni%20Romania.pdf|work=The World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=12 September 2017}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Zimbabwe]]''' competed in the '''[[2008 Summer Paralympics]]''' in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The country's delegation consisted of two [[Track and field|track and field athletes]], [[Elliot Mujaji]] and Molene Muza. Mujaji is a two-time Paralympic gold medalist, having won the 100 metre T46 event in [[Athletics at the 2000 Summer Paralympics|2000]] and [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics|2004]], while Muza competed in the Paralympic Games for the first time. In the days leading up to the games, the pair trained at the [[NUST (Zimbabwe)|National University of Science and Technology]] in [[Bulawayo]] under coach Remigio Mumbire, however a lack of money threatened to cut the training camp short. The group planned to leave for Beijing on 28 August and arrive two days later.&lt;ref name=sundaytimes&gt;{{cite web |title=Paralympics team faces problems |work=Sunday News |date=2008-08-24 |url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=1569&amp;cat=5 |accessdate=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujaji competed in the men's 100 and 200 metre races, and Muza in the women's [[Javelin throw|javelin]] and [[shot put]].
