      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">[[File:Inchaffray Abbey.jpg|thumb|'''Adam Abell''' entered [[Inchaffray Abbey]] as an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk]]
'''Adam Abell''' (ca. 1480{{spaced ndash}}ca. 1540) was a Scottish [[Friar]] at [[Jedburgh Abbey]]. He wrote a [[chronicle]] in the 1530s that gives an insight into contemporary thought and contains anecdotes that appear in later writings. The manuscript of the '''Roit or Quheil of Tyme''' is kept at the [[National Library of Scotland]], Ms. 1746. It was donated by Lt.-Colonel W. W. Cunninghame of Caprington.&lt;ref&gt;Asdair M. Stewart, Alasdair, (1996), 230 note 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Abell was born at [[Prestonpans]] around 1480. He was related to the Bellenden family; Robert Bellenden, [[Abbot of Holyrood]] was his great-uncle. Abell became a monk at [[Inchaffray Abbey]] in 1495, then moved to be an Observantine [[Franciscan]] Friar at [[Jedburgh]]. His chronicle, the ''Roit or Quheil of Tyme'' ends in 1537. Possibly Abell died soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Alasdair M., (1996), 227-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript survived in the family of Sinclair of [[Roslin Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair M. Stewart, (1996), 229-230 note 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Roit or Quheil of Tyme''==
[[File:A spiral stair at Jedburgh Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 795473.jpg|thumb|'''Adam Abell''' composed the ''Wheel of Time'' at [[Jedburgh Abbey]]]]
Abell recounts much legendary history including the story of [[Leir of Britain|King Lear]] and his daughters, and [[Macbeth]] and the witches.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Alasdair M., (1996), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle ends in 1537 mentioning a process of divorce between [[Margaret Tudor]], and [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven|Harry Stewart, Lord Methven]]. [[Norman Macdougall]] thought the three pages of the ''Quheil of Tyme'' that refer to [[James III of Scotland]] significant enough to print in his study of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'', (1982), 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Abell said of the death of James III in 1488:&lt;blockquote&gt;"thai conspirit againis the king and gaif him batell beside [[Stirling|striwiling]] and thare he wes slane. He wes confessit before with [[John of Ireland|maistir Johne Yrland proffessor of theologie]]., ... thai slew him in the mill of [[Battle of Sauchieburn|bannoburne.]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Macdougal, ''James III'' (1982), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Macdougall found nothing strikingly original in Abell's account of James III, which depends in part on [[Hector Boece]], but was able to infer that his other sources for the reign were sympathetic to James III and [[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany]], and to Abell's contemporary, [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'', (1982), 280-282.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1537 of events in the previous year, Abell tells the story of the visit of [[James V of Scotland]] to [[Mary of Bourbon]], with the interesting suggestion that there had been an exchange of portraits;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In ane dissimilit vestement he com to the [[Charles, Duke of Vendôme|duik of Vendôme]] fathir of the lady that he suld haif marreit. He wes knawin thare be his picture."&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Jamie, ''James V, the personal rule, 1528-1542.'', Tuckwell (1998), 152-153, note 6: Alasdair M. Stewart, (1996), 252, quoting National Library of Scotland Ms 1746, folio 125v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alasdair Stewart contends that Abell's moralising handling of his subject matter and the examples he offers show his own strong character, contemporary attitudes and a unique view of international events from the cloister at Jedburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair M. Stewart, (1996), 230-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are estimated to be only approximately a dozen full-blooded Kaweskars still living following Achacaz's death in 2008.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; However, there are no Kaweskar women of fertile age remaining, so the tribe appears to be headed for extinction.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

Achacaz lived in a modest home, which lacked a modern drainage system.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; He had lived alone since his wife died in 1999. He earned a living by crafting small [[canoes]] out of [[sea lion]] skins and [[weaving]] traditional [[baskets]].&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; 

Achacaz had been hospitalized since in [[Punta Arenas, Chile]], since late June 2008.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; Achacaz had arrived at the hospital [[malnourished]], [[dehydrated]] and weighing less than 130 pounds.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; He was admitted to the [[intensive care]] unit of the Hospital Naval.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; Additionally, Achacaz was found to be suffering from [[septic shock]] which affected his [[gall bladder]] and [[lungs]].&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

Alberto Achacaz Walakial died of [[blood poisoning]] at the hospital in Punta Arenas on Monday, August 4, 2008, according to reports by the local Chilean newspaper, ''[[La Prensa Austral]]''.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; Official Chilean government documents listed Achacaz's age at 79 years old.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; However, some believed that Achacaz was closer to 90 years of age.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

== Background of the Kaweskar ==
{{further|Kaweskar}}
The Kaweskars were known as the "Nomads of the Sea." They are also known as the Alacaluf. Traditionally, the Kaweskar lived aboard their canoes within the [[Channel (geography)|channels]] of southern [[Patagonia]].&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; They were nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]] whose diet consisted of [[sea birds]] and [[seafood]].&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; It is believed that their nomadic way of life may have stretched back 6,000 years.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

The Kaweskars did not establish semi-permanent settlements on dry land until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; They settled in and around the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Villa Puerto Edén]] on [[Wellington Island]].&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

The Kaweskars are facing cultural extinction as a distinct group as their surviving, full-blooded members grow older.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; Since the arrival of Europeans, Chile has lost five of its original fourteen indigenous tribes.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

[[File:Vannevar Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|Vannevar Bush]]

"'''As We May Think'''" is a 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]] which has been described as visionary and influential, anticipating many aspects of [[information society]]. It was first published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945&amp;mdash;before and after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of [[collective memory]] machine with his concept of the [[memex]] that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.&lt;ref name="Wardrip"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.newmediareader.com/ | title=The New Media Reader | publisher=The MIT Press |author1=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah  |author2=Montfort, Nick | year=2003 | isbn=9780262232272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept creation==
The article was a reworked and expanded version of Bush's essay "Mechanization and the Record" (1939). Here, he described a machine that would combine lower level technologies to achieve a higher level of organized knowledge (like human [[memory]] processes). Shortly after the publication of this essay, Bush coined the term "[[memex]]" in a letter written to the editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Memex to Hypertext - Vannevar Bush and the Mind's Machine | publisher=Academic Press |author1=Nyce, James M.  |author2=Kahn, Paul W. | year=1991 | isbn=9781493301713}}&lt;/ref&gt; That letter became the body of "As We May Think", which added only an introduction and conclusion. As described, Bush's memex was based on what was thought, at the time, to be advanced technology of the future: ultra high resolution [[microfilm]] reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by [[electromechanical]] controls. The memex, in essence, reflects a library of collective knowledge stored in a piece of machinery described in his essay as "a piece of furniture".&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|authorlink=Vannevar Bush|date=July 1945|title=As We May Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/|journal=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=176|issue=1|pages=101-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Atlantic'' publication of Bush's article was followed, in the September 10, 1945 issue of [[Life magazine|''Life'']] magazine, by a reprint that showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter. (Coincidentally, the same issue of ''Life'' contained aerial photos of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb, a [[Manhattan Project|project]] Bush was instrumental in starting). Bush also discussed other technologies such as [[Dry-plate photography|dry photography]] and [[microphotography]] where he elaborates on the potentialities of their future use. For example, Bush states in his essay that: {{Quote | The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. |author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}

==Concept realization==
"As We May Think" predicted (to some extent) many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including [[hypertext]], [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]]: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified."&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt; Bush envisioned the ability to retrieve several articles or pictures on one screen, with the possibility of writing comments that could be stored and recalled together. He believed people would create links between related articles, thus mapping the thought process and path of each user and saving it for others to experience. Wikipedia is one example of how this vision has in part been realized, allowing elements of an article to reference other related topics. A user's browser history maps the trails of possible paths of interaction, although this is typically available only to the user that created it.
Bush's article also laid the foundation for new media. [[Doug Engelbart]] came across the essay shortly after its publication, and keeping the memex in mind, he began work that would eventually result in the invention of the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], the [[word processor]], the [[hyperlink]] and concepts of new media for which these groundbreaking inventions were merely enabling technologies.&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt;

Today, storage has greatly surpassed the level imagined by Vannevar Bush, {{Quote | The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. | author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}} On the other hand, it still uses methods of indexing of information which Bush described as artificial: {{Quote|When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used.|author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}This description resembles popular [[file systems]] of modern computer operating systems ([[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[NTFS]], [[ext3]] when used without hard links and symlinks, etc.), which do not easily enable associative indexing as imagined by Bush.

==Outlook in the use of science==
Bush urges that scientists should turn to the massive task of creating more efficient accessibility to our fluctuating [[knowledge base|store of knowledge]]. For years inventions have extended people's physical powers rather than the powers of their mind. He argues that the instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments, he suggests, should be the first objective of our scientists.&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;

Through this process, society would be able to focus and evolve past the existing knowledge rather than looping through infinite calculations. We should be able to pass the tedious [[number crunching|work of numbers]] to machines and work on the intricate theory which puts them best to use. If humanity were able to obtain the "privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if proven important" only then "will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the [[Knowledge|growing knowledge]] of atomistic to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology".&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; To exemplify the importance of this concept, consider the process involved in 'simple' shopping: "Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and most important, the customer needs to be charged."&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Due to the convenience of the store's central device which rapidly manage thousands of these transactions, the employees may focus on the essential aspects of the department such as sales and advertising.

Indeed, as of today, "science has provided the swiftest [[telecommunication|communication]] between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than of an individual".&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Improved technology has become an extension of our capabilities, much as how external hard drives function for computers so it may reserve more memory for more practical tasks.

Another significant role of practicality in technology is the method of [[association (psychology)|association]] and selection. "There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his synthesis are not likely to keep up with the current scene."&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Bush believes that the tools available in his time lacked this feature, but noted the emergence and development of such ideas such as the Memex, a cross referencing system.

Bush concludes his essay by stating that: {{Quote | The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome. | author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}

==Outline==
Many scientists, especially physicists, get new duties during the War. Now, after the war, they need new duties.

''Section 1:'' The use of Science has improved tremendously in many ways for humans. The knowledge of science has grown considerably. However, the way we manage it still remains the same for centuries. We are no longer able to use what Science finds out. Alternatively, the technology has matured greatly and allows us to now produce complicated, yet cheap and dependable machines.

''Section 2:'' Science is really useful. However, in order to have it to be very efficient and useful it should not only be stored but also be frequently consulted and enhanced. In the future we would probably be able to store human writings in a small room with the use of photography.

''Section 3:'' Using the latest advances of [[Sound recording and reproduction|speech recording]] and [[stenography]], we will soon be able to make printing immediate. The advancement of photography is not going to stop. The thought process of repetition could be in relation to machine. Electrical machines will be the advancement of [[arithmetic]]al computation.

''Section 4:'' There is more to the scientific reasoning than just arithmetic. There are a few machines that are not used for arithmetic, partly due to the market’s needs. Solving [[higher mathematics]] require other repetitive processes of thought to be mechanized.

''Section 5:'' A machine could be used anywhere where there is logical [[thought process]]. At this moment we do not have the necessary tools for the selection (the key to utilize science) of knowledge. One of the best forms of selection is illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.

''Section 6:'' There is a problem with selection. The main problem of it is the deficiency of the [[Lookup table|indexing]] systems. When data is recorded and put into storage, it is usually [[collation|filed alphabetically or numerically]]. The human mind works differently. It works according to [[association (psychology)|association]]. Instead of using selection by indexing, selection by association may be mechanized. Thus, improving the permanence and clarity of the items stored. The memex is a device that could store information and communication (large memory). Some things that can be entered are, newspaper and books. The user is also able to find a particular book as he or she taps on its code on the keyboard. The codes that are frequently used to call forth pages are [[mnemonic]] and its possible to browse these pages at different speeds.

''Section 7:'' The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to another memex.

''Section 8:'' The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an [[encyclopedia]] (many more new forms are to appear). Soon we will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually. It would be great for humans to be able analyze present issues. As of now, science has been applied to live better, as well as for destruction. Possibly we may be able to apply the record to become wiser.

==Critical opinion==
"As We May Think" has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay. In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline, Johnston and Webber write {{Quote | Bush's paper might be regarded as describing a microcosm of the information society, with the boundaries tightly drawn by the interests and experiences of a major scientist of the time, rather than the more open knowledge spaces of the 21st century. Bush provides a core vision of the importance of information to industrial/scientific society, using the image of an "information explosion" arising from the unprecedented demands on scientific production and technological application of World War II. He outlines a version of information science as a key discipline within the practice of scientific and technical knowledge domains. His view encompasses the problems of information overload and the need to devise efficient mechanisms to control and channel information for use.|author=''Johnston and Webber''&lt;ref name="JoWe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = | last2 = Webber | first2 = | year = 2006 | title = As We May Think: Information literacy as a discipline for the information age | url = | journal = Research Strategies | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 108–121 | doi = 10.1016/j.resstr.2006.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, Bush was very concerned with information overload inhibiting the research efforts of scientists. His scientist, operating under conditions of "information explosion" and requiring respite from the tide of scientific documents could be construed as a nascent image of the "Information Literate Person" in an information saturated society. {{Quote|text=There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers.|author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}
{{Quote | Schools, colleges, health care, government, etc., are all implicated in the distribution and use of information, under similar conditions of "information explosion" as Bush's post-war scientists. All these people arguably need some sort of personal "information control" in order to function. |author=''Bill Johnston, Sheila Webber''&lt;ref name="JoWe" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">'''Balconing''' is the act of jumping into a swimming pool from a balcony or falling from height while climbing from one balcony to another, performed by foreign tourists during holidays.&lt;ref name=Segura2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segura-Sampedro|first=Juan José|last2=Pineño-Flores|first2=Cristina|last3=García-Pérez|first3=Jose María|last4=Jiménez-Morillas|first4=Patricia|last5=Morales-Soriano|first5=Rafael|last6=González-Argente|first6=Xavier|date=2017-03-28|title=Balconing: An alcohol-induced craze that injures tourists. Characterization of the phenomenon|journal=Injury|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2017.03.037|issn=1879-0267|pmid=28377264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was formed through a combination of the Spanish word "balcón" (balcony) and the English suffix "ing", a suffix that most Spanish associate with English culture and English people, in reference the origin of most practitioners.

In 2010 and 2011, a spate of injuries attributed to "balconing" by the Spanish press occurred among tourists in the [[Balearic Islands]] of [[Ibiza]] and [[Majorca]] in [[Spain]]. Videos of people jumping into pools from balconies were posted on video sharing web sites such as [[YouTube]], which were alleged to have played a role in the spread of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/11/spanish-authorities-balconies-holidaymakers-warning |title=Spanish authorities warn holidaymakers of 'balconing' dangers &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-08-11|accessdate=2010-09-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100815121029/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/11/spanish-authorities-balconies-holidaymakers-warning| archivedate= 15 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries and deaths==
In 2010 in Spain, there were six deaths and 11 injuries in falls from balconies which were identified as relating to "balconing" in the Spanish press. Most of the casualties were young British and German tourists with traces of alcohol in their blood, and the incidents occurred between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/09/12/baleares/1284291403.html |title=La siniestra lista del balconing suma y sigue &amp;#124; Baleares |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, hotels were reported to have raised the height of hotel railings from 1.05 to 1.20 metres to reduce these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/08/19/baleares/1282227507.html El 'balconing' como fenómeno social de drogas, alcohol y juventud] in elmundo.es&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mallorca]] 3 tourists died in 2017 in falls from balconies identified as "balconing" incidents in the Spanish press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ultimahora.es/sucesos/ultimas/2017/06/04/271612/tres-muertos-por-balconing-menos-mes-mallorca.html Tres muertos por ‘balconing’ en menos de un mes en Mallorca] in ultimahora.es&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010 and 2015 it has been described up to 46 injured to this practice.&lt;ref name=Segura2017 /&gt;

==Statistics==
According to  Juan José Segura, doctor at Son Espases´s hospital, 85% of the victims fall accidentally, usually while trying to jump from one balcony to the next or do some reckless movement near the edge, while the rest actively jump off the balcony. He estimates an average of 10 to 15 cases each year since 2011, with an increase since more of these jumps have been posted on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;http://cadenaser.com/programa/2018/07/20/la_ventana/1532099949_081845.html/Ser Radio/Entrevista con el Doctor Segura
&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Segura and the British Foreign Office established the profile of the "average practitioner" as a 24 year old British male. 
97% of people involved in balconing are men, 61% are British. German and other nationalities are less numerous.&lt;ref name=Planchard2018&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/2311279-20180721-espagne-baleares-balconing-fait-nouveau-victimes-parmi-touristes |title=Espagne: Aux Baléares le 'balconing' fait de nouveau des victimes parmi les touristes |last=Planchard |first=Claire |date=21 July 2018 |website=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical assistance of the tourists injured in this practice costs an average of 32000 euros per case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.diariodeibiza.es/pitiuses-balears/2015/02/17/balconing-30000-euros/750012.html |title=Un 'balconing': 30.000 euros |author=Marta Torres Molina |date=17 February 2015 |work=Diario de Ibiza |access-date=2018-07-23 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The balcon is a median height of eight meter, and the people have a median age of 24 years.&lt;ref name=Planchard2018 /&gt;

== Preventive measures ==
In 2018, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] teamed up with [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[surgeon]], [[Juan José Segura-Sampedro]] to run a campaign of video messages to British tourists heading to the [[Balearic Islands]] during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/spanish-surgeon-warns-holiday-britons-off-fatal-balcony-stunts-5pm9g9z0d|title=Spanish surgeon warns holiday Britons off fatal balcony stunts|last=Madrid|first=Graham Keeley|date=2018-05-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RTÉ]] also made a special program where the doctor participated from [[Mallorca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Watch Prime Time  online|url=https://www.rte.ie/player/es/show/prime-time-30003251/10899066/|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite of the previous campaigns "balconing" is still a problem and various hotels in the Balearic Islands have been forced to implement measurements against it, like closing their balconies or building taller walls around them.
[[Magaluf]], a very touristic city in the East coast of Spain, has been forced to regulate drinking in an attempt to control tourist behaviour, including but not limited to balconing. It has also introduced heavy fines for the practice of balconing - 750 to 1500 [[Euro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.es/sociedad/20150521/abci-calvia-alcohol-calle-201505211719.html |title=Ley seca en Magaluf: prohibido beber alcohol en la calle a partir de las 22:00 horas |date=22 May 2015 |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |access-date=2018-07-23 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018==

In 2018, six victims have had ''balconing'' accidents (British, Irish, and one French). Three of them were killed by falling. This is more than during the years 2016 and 2017. Nonetheless, some cases might not be due to the practice of ''balconing'', but might have other causes like accidental fall due to excessive alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name=Planchard2018 /&gt;

'''Bartholomew Roberts''' (17 May 1682 – 10 February 1722), born '''John Roberts''', was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[pirate]] who raided ships off the [[Americas]] and [[West Africa]] between 1719 and 1722. He was the most successful pirate of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] as measured by vessels captured,&lt;ref&gt;Rediker p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; taking over 400 [[Prize (law)|prizes]] in his career.{{sfn|Conlin|2009|p=32}} He is also known as '''Black Bart''' ({{lang-cy|Barti Ddu}}), but this name was never used in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 18. "Black Bart" was coined as the title of a 20th-century poem by Welsh poet [[Isaac Daniel Hooson|I. D. Hooson]], who apparently picked that name because Johnson described Roberts as having a "black" complexion.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[Image:Bart Roberts.jpg|thumb|left|Bart Roberts' memorial stone in Casnewydd Bach]]

He was born John Roberts in 1682 in Casnewydd-Bach,&lt;ref&gt;Yount p.74&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Fishguard]] and [[Haverfordwest]] in [[Pembrokeshire]], Wales. His father was most likely George Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Burl p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; It's not clear why Roberts changed his name from John to Bartholomew,&lt;ref&gt;Yount p.64&lt;/ref&gt; but pirates often adopted aliases. He may have chosen his first name after the well-known [[buccaneer]] [[Bartholomew Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is thought to have gone to sea when he was 13 in 1695, but there is no further record of him until 1718, when he was mate of a [[Barbados]] [[sloop]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1719, Roberts was [[second mate]] on the [[slave ship]] ''Princess'' under Captain Abraham Plumb. In early June that year, the ''Princess'' was anchored at [[Anomabu]] (then spelled Annamaboa, which is situated along the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] of West Africa, present-day [[Ghana]]) when she was captured by pirates. The pirates were in two vessels, ''Royal Rover'' and ''Royal James,'' and were led by captain [[Howell Davis]]. Davis, like Roberts, was a Welshman, originally from [[Milford Haven]] in [[Pembrokeshire]]. Roberts and several other of the crew of the ''Princess'' were forced to join the pirates.

Davis quickly discovered Roberts' abilities as a [[navigator]] and took to consulting him.&lt;ref&gt;Burl p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to confide information to Roberts in Welsh, thereby keeping it hidden from the rest of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famouswelsh.com/07_adventurers/profiles/Pirate_Black_Bart_01.php Famous Welsh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222104534/http://www.famouswelsh.com/07_adventurers/profiles/Pirate_Black_Bart_01.php |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts is said to have been reluctant to become a pirate at first, but soon came to see the advantages of this new lifestyle. Captain Charles Johnson reports him as saying:
{{quote|In an honest service there is thin commons, low wages, and hard labour. In this, plenty and satiety, pleasure and ease, liberty and power; and who would not balance creditor on this side, when all the hazard that is run for it, at worst is only a sour look or two at choking? No, a merry life and a short one shall be my motto.|''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates'' (1724), p.213–214&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 213-4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life as a pirate==

===Commander or commoner?===
[[File:HowelDav.jpg|thumb|200px|The death of Captain Howell Davis in an ambush on Príncipe]]
In the merchant navy, Roberts' wage was less than £4 per month and he had no chance of promotion to captaincy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A few weeks after Roberts' capture, ''Royal James'' had to be abandoned because of [[Teredo navalis|worm]] damage. ''Royal Rover'' headed for the island of [[Príncipe]]. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and he was invited to call at the fort for a glass of wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party on its way to the fort, shooting Davis dead.&lt;ref&gt;Burl p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

A new captain had to be elected. Davis' crew was divided into "Lords" and "Commons", and it was the "Lords" who had the right to propose a name to the remainder of the crew. Within six weeks of his capture, Roberts was elected captain. This was unusual, especially as he had objected to serving on the vessel. Historians believe he was elected for his navigational abilities and his personality, which history reflects was outspoken and opinionated.
{{quote|He accepted of the Honour, saying, that since he had dipp'd his Hands in Muddy Water, and must be a Pyrate, it was better being a Commander than a common Man.|''A General History of the ... Pyrates'' (1724), p.162&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roberts' first act as captain was to lead the crew back to Príncipe to avenge the death of Captain Davis. Roberts and his crew landed on the island in the darkness of night, killed a large portion of the male population, and stole all items of value that they could carry away. Soon afterwards, he captured a Dutch [[Guineaman]], then two days later a British ship called ''Experiment''. The pirate ship took on water and provisions at Anamboe, where a vote was taken on whether the next voyage should be to the [[East Indies]] or to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. The vote was for Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of bravery and success that marked this adventure cemented most of the crew's loyalty to Roberts. They concluded that he was "pistol proof" and that they had much to gain by staying with him.&lt;ref&gt;Yount p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bartholomew Roberts Flag.svg|thumb|200px|left|Roberts' first flag shows himself and [[Death (personification)|Death]] holding an [[hourglass]].]]

===Brazil and the Caribbean July 1719 – May 1720===
Roberts and his crew crossed the Atlantic and watered and boot-topped&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Boot-topping" was similar to careening, except that only the upper part of the hull was cleaned.&lt;/ref&gt; their ship on the uninhabited island of Ferdinando. They spent about nine weeks off the Brazilian coast but saw no ships. They were about to leave for the [[West Indies]] when they encountered a fleet of 42 Portuguese ships in the [[Baía de Todos os Santos|Todos os Santos' Bay]], waiting for two men-of-war of 70 guns each to escort them to [[Lisbon]]. Roberts took one of the vessels and ordered her master to point out the richest ship in the fleet. He pointed out ''Sagrada Familia,'' a ship of 40 guns and a crew of 170, which Roberts and his men boarded and captured. ''Sagrada Familia'' contained 40,000 gold [[moidore]]s and jewellery designed for the King of Portugal, including a cross set with diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson pp. 172–3&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rover'' next headed for [[Devil's Island]] off the coast of Guiana to spend the booty. A few weeks later, they headed for the River Surinam where they captured a sloop. After they sighted a [[brigantine]], Roberts took 40 men to pursue it in the sloop, leaving [[Walter Kennedy (pirate)|Walter Kennedy]] in command of ''Rover.'' The sloop became wind-bound for eight days, and when Roberts and his crew finally returned to their ship, they discovered that Kennedy had sailed off with ''Rover'' and what remained of the loot.&lt;ref&gt;Richards pp. 31–2&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts and his crew renamed their sloop ''Fortune'' and agreed on new articles, now known as a [[pirate code]], which they swore on a Bible to uphold:&lt;ref&gt;Yount p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bartholomew Roberts Flag1.svg|thumb|200px|left|Black Bart's new flag showed him standing on two skulls, representing the heads of a Barbadian and a Martiniquian]]
In late February 1720, they were joined by French pirate [[Montigny la Palisse]] in another sloop, ''Sea King''. The inhabitants of [[Barbados]] equipped two well-armed ships, ''Summerset'' and ''Philipa'', to try to put an end to the pirate menace. On 26 February, they encountered the two pirate sloops. ''Sea King'' quickly fled, and ''Fortune'' broke off the engagement after sustaining considerable damage and was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 122–6&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts headed for [[Dominica]] to repair the sloop, with twenty of his crew dying of their wounds on the voyage. There were also two sloops from [[Martinique]] out searching for the pirates, and Roberts swore vengeance against the inhabitants of Barbados and Martinique. He had a new flag made with a drawing of himself standing upon 2 skulls, one labelled ABH (A Barbadian's Head) and the other AMH (A Martiniquian's Head).

===Newfoundland and the Caribbean June 1720 – April 1721===
''Fortune'' next headed northwards towards [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], raiding [[Canso, Nova Scotia]],{{sfn|Conlin|2009|p=28}} and capturing a number of ships around [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and the Newfoundland banks. Roberts raided the harbour of Ferryland, capturing a dozen vessels. On 21 June, he attacked the larger harbour of [[Trepassey, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trepassey]], sailing in with black flags flying. In the harbour he discovered 22 merchant ships and 150 fishing ships, all of which were abandoned by their panic-stricken captains and crews, and the pirates were masters of Trepassey without any resistance being offered. Roberts had captured all 22 merchant ships, but was angered by the cowardice of the captains who had fled their ships. Every morning he had a gun fired and the captains were forced to attend Roberts on board his ship; they were told that anyone who was absent would have his ship burnt. One [[brig]] from [[Bristol]] was taken over by the pirates to replace the sloop ''Fortune'' and fitted out with 16 guns. When the pirates left in late June, all the other vessels in the harbour were set on fire. During July, Roberts captured nine or ten French ships and commandeered one of them, fitting her with 26 cannons and changing her name to ''Good Fortune''. With this more powerful ship, the pirates captured many more vessels before heading south for the West Indies, accompanied by Montigny la Palisse's sloop, which had rejoined them.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 133–143&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1720, ''Good Fortune'' was [[Careening|careened]] and repaired at the island of [[Carriacou]] before being renamed ''Royal Fortune'', the first of several ships to be given this name by Roberts. In late September, ''Royal Fortune'' and ''Fortune'' headed for the island of [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher's]] and entered Basse Terra Road, flying black flags and with their drummers and trumpeters playing. They sailed in among the ships in the Road, all of which promptly struck their flags.&lt;ref&gt;Richards pp. 47–8&lt;/ref&gt; The next landfall was at the island of [[Saint Barthélemy|St. Bartholomew]], where the French governor allowed the pirates to remain for several weeks to carouse. By 25 October, they were at sea again off [[St. Lucia]], where they captured up to 15 French and English ships in the next three days.&lt;ref&gt;Richards p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the captured ships was ''Greyhound'', whose chief mate [[James Skyrme]] joined the pirates. He later became captain of Roberts' consort, ''Ranger''.

During this time, Roberts reportedly caught the [[Governor of Martinique]], who was sailing aboard a 52-gun French [[warship]]. The Governor was caught and promptly hanged on the yardarm of his own ship, which the pirates converted into the new ''Royal Fortune''.{{sfn|Konstam|Kean|2007|p=174}} According to Konstam and Rickman, this reported capture was an embellishment by Captain Charles Johnson in his ''A General History of the Pyrates''.{{sfn|Konstam|Rickman|2011|p=54}}

By the spring of 1721, Roberts' depredations had almost brought seaborne trade to a standstill in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Richards p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Royal Fortune'' and ''Good Fortune'' therefore set sail for West Africa. On 18 April, [[Thomas Anstis]], the commander of ''Good Fortune'', left Roberts in the night and continued to raid shipping in the Caribbean, with future captains [[John Fenn (pirate)|John Fenn]] and [[Brigstock Weaver]] aboard.&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who" /&gt; ''Royal Fortune'' continued towards Africa.

[[File:Bartholomew Roberts.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bartholomew Roberts at Ouidah with his ship and captured merchantmen in the background.]]

===West Africa April 1721 – January 1722===
By late April, Roberts was at the [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] islands. ''Royal Fortune'' was found to be leaky, and was abandoned there. The pirates transferred to ''Sea King'', which was renamed ''Royal Fortune''. The new ''Royal Fortune'' made landfall off the Guinea coast in early June, near the mouth of the Senegal River. Two French ships, one of 10 guns and one of 16 guns, gave chase, but were captured by Roberts. Both ships were commandeered. One, ''Comte de Toulouse'', was renamed ''Ranger'', while the other was named ''Little Ranger'' and used as a storeship. [[Thomas Sutton (pirate)|Thomas Sutton]] was made captain of ''Ranger'' and James Skyrme captain of ''Little Ranger''.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts next headed for [[Sierra Leone]], arriving on 12 June. Here he was told by retired pirate [[John Leadstone|John "Old Crackers" Leadstone]] that two [[Royal Navy]] ships, {{HMS|Swallow|1703|6}} and {{HMS|Weymouth|1693|6}}, had left at the end of April, planning to return before Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August, he captured two large ships at Point Cestos, now [[River Cess]] in [[Liberia]]. One of these was the frigate ''Onslow'', transporting soldiers bound for [[Cape Coast Castle|Cape Coast]] (Cabo Corso) Castle. A number of the soldiers wished to join the pirates, and they were eventually accepted, however they only received a quarter of a pirates pay because they were not sailors most of their lives. ''Onslow'' was converted to become the fourth ''Royal Fortune''.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 211–13&lt;/ref&gt; In November and December, the pirates careened their ships and relaxed at Cape Lopez and the island of [[Annobon]].&lt;ref&gt;Burl p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton was replaced by Skyrme as captain of ''Ranger''.

They captured several vessels in January 1722, then sailed into [[Ouidah]] (Whydah) harbour with black flags flying. Ten of the eleven ships at anchor there immediately struck their colours, but were restored to their owners after a ransom of eight pounds of gold dust per ship was paid.&lt;ref name="Edwards(Captain.)2007" /&gt; The refusal of the eleventh vessel to surrender so enraged Roberts' crew that, under cover of night, they climbed aboard and set her on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 218–9&lt;/ref&gt; The captured vessels were slave ships, and the one set on fire had around eighty enslaved Africans on board. They perished either as a result of the fire or by drowning or shark attack after jumping overboard.&lt;ref name="Edwards(Captain.)2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernard Edwards|author2=Bernard Edwards (Captain.)|title=Royal Navy Versus the Slave Traders: Enforcing Abolition at Sea 1808-1898|year=2007|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Books|isbn=978-1-84415-633-7|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death in battle===
[[File:BartRobCrew.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Bartholomew Roberts's crew carousing at the [[Calabar River]]. Most of the crew were drunk when ''Swallow'' appeared.]]
On 5 February 1722,  Captain [[Chaloner Ogle]] of HMS ''Swallow'' came upon the pirate ships ''Royal Fortune'', ''Ranger'', and ''Little Ranger'' careening at [[Cape Lopez]]. ''Swallow'' veered away to avoid a [[shoal]], making the pirates think that she was a fleeing merchant ship; some sources claim Ogle spotted Roberts' ships and turned ''Swallow'' as a ruse.&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gosse|first1=Philip|title=The Pirates' Who's Who by Philip Gosse|date=1924|publisher=Burt Franklin|location=New York|page=265|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ranger'' departed in pursuit, commanded by James Skyrme. Once out of earshot of the other pirates, ''Swallow'' opened her gun ports and opened fire. Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, but he refused to leave the deck. Eventually, ''Ranger'' was forced to [[Striking the colors|strike her colors]] and the surviving crew were captured.

On 10 February, ''Swallow'' returned to Cape Lopez and found ''Royal Fortune'' still there. On the previous day, Roberts had captured ''Neptune'', and many of his crew were drunk and unfit for duty just when he needed them most.&lt;ref&gt;Yount pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the pirates thought that the approaching ship was ''Ranger'' returning, but a deserter from ''Swallow'' recognized her and informed Roberts while he was breakfasting with Captain Hill, the master of ''Neptune''. As he usually did before action, he dressed himself in his finest clothes:
{{quote|Roberts himself made a gallant figure, at the time of the [[Battle of Cape Lopez|engagement]], being dressed in a rich crimson damask waistcoat and breeches, a red feather in his hat, a gold chain round his neck, with a diamond cross hanging to it, a sword in his hand, and two pairs of pistols slung over his shoulders ...|''A General History of the ... Pyrates'' (1724), p. 212&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pirates' plan was to sail past ''Swallow'', which meant exposing themselves to one broadside. Once past, they would have a good chance of escaping. However, the helmsman failed to keep ''Royal Fortune'' on the right course, and ''Swallow'' was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by [[grapeshot]], which struck him in the throat while he stood on the deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts's wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship's sail. It was never found.

Roberts's death shocked the pirate world, as well as the Royal Navy. The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible, and some considered him a hero.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Aftermath==
{{wikisource|Death sentence for Roberts' crew}}
The battle continued for another two hours until ''Royal Fortune''{{'}}s mainmast fell and the pirates signaled for quarter. One member of the crew, John Philips, tried to reach the magazine with a lighted match to blow up the ship, but was prevented by two men. Only three pirates had been killed in the battle, including Roberts. A total of 272 men had been captured by the Royal Navy. Of these, 65 were black, and they were sold into slavery. The remainder were taken to [[Cape Coast Castle]], apart from those who died on the voyage back. 54 were condemned to death, of whom 52 were hanged and two reprieved. Another twenty were allowed to sign indentures with the [[Royal African Company]]; Burl comments that they "exchanged an immediate death for a lingering one".&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 254–5&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen men were sent to the Marshalsea prison in London for trial, where some were acquitted and released.

Of the captured pirates who told their place of birth, 42% were from [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Somerset]], and another 19% from London. There were smaller numbers from northern England and from Wales, and another quarter from a variety of countries including Ireland, Scotland, the West Indies, the Netherlands, and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Burl pp. 263–4&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts experienced problems with mutinous Irishmen early in his pirate career and was known to generally avoid recruiting Irishmen, to the extent that captured merchant sailors would sometimes affect an Irish accent to discourage Roberts from forcing them into his pirate crew.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Captain [[Chaloner Ogle]] was rewarded with a knighthood, the only British naval officer to be honoured specifically for his actions against pirates.&lt;ref name=Cawthornep135&gt;Cawthorne p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; He also profited financially, taking gold dust from Roberts' cabin, and he eventually became an admiral.&lt;ref name=Cawthornep135/&gt;

This battle proved a turning point in the war against the pirates,&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and many consider the death of Roberts to mark the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.&lt;ref name=Cawthornep135/&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
Most of the information on Roberts comes from the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', published a few years after Roberts' death. The original 1724 title page credits one [[Captain Charles Johnson]] as the author. (The book is often printed under the byline of [[Daniel Defoe]] on the assumption that "Charles Johnson" is a [[pseudonym]], but there is no proof that Defoe is the author, and the matter remains in dispute.) Johnson devotes more space to Roberts than to any of the other pirates in his book, describing him as:
{{quote|... a tall black [i.e. dark complexioned] Man, near forty Years of Age ... of good natural Parts, and personal Bravery, tho' he apply'd them to such wicked Purposes, as made them of no Commendation, frequently drinking 'Damn to him who ever lived to wear a Halter'.|''A General History of the ... Pyrates'' (1724), p.213&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p.213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After his exploits in Newfoundland, a state Governor from [[New England]]&lt;!-- Sentence originally stated "the governor of New England," which never existed. --&gt; commented that "one cannot with-hold admiration for his bravery and courage".{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He hated cowardice, and when the crews of 22 ships in Trepassey harbour fled without firing a shot he was angry at their failure to defend their ships.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Roberts was the archetypal pirate captain in his love of fine clothing and jewelry, but he had some traits unusual in a pirate, notably a preference for drinking tea rather than rum. He is often described as a [[teetotaler]] and a [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]], but there is no proof of this. He certainly disliked drunkenness while at sea, yet it appears that he drank beer.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Roberts' final defeat was facilitated by the drunkenness of his crew. The Sabbatarian claim arises from the fact that musicians were not obliged to play on the Sabbath – this may merely have been intended to ensure the musicians a day's rest, as they were otherwise obliged to play whenever the crew demanded. &lt;!-- This unreferenced sentence was removed from this article's lead section, not sure whether it is notable:   He also had "Sunday services" on his first vessel. --&gt;

Black Bart was not as cruel to prisoners as some pirates such as [[Edward Low]], but did not treat them as well as did [[Samuel Bellamy]], [[Howell Davis]], or [[Edward England]]. Roberts sometimes gave gifts to cooperative captains and crews of captured ships, such as pieces of jewelry or items of captured cargo.  He would sometimes ill-use prisoners if he felt that the crew demanded it, but:
{{quote|When he found that rigour was not expected from his people (for he often practised it to appease them), then he would give strangers to understand that it was pure inclination that induced him to a good treatment of them, and not any love or partiality to their persons; "For", says he, "there is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can clinch me within your power."|''A General History of the ... Pyrates'' (1724), p.183&lt;ref&gt;Johnson p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1997, a book was published that theorized Bartholomew Roberts was a woman [[transvestite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Pirates and the Politics of the Jolly Roger| editor=Gabriel Kuhn &amp; Tyler Austin|year=1997|pages=178–188|chapter=Sea Princess Bartholomew Roberts: Was "the Most Successful Pirate" a Woman?|publisher=Black Rose Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that Roberts' corpse was thrown overboard to conceal this fact.

==Popular culture==
*Bartholomew Roberts is one of four pirate captains mentioned in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. In it, [[Long John Silver]] says that the surgeon who amputated his leg was one of Roberts' men:

{{quote|"It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me – out of college and all – Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names of their ships – ''Royal Fortune'' and so on."|Robert Louis Stevenson, ''Treasure Island''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 "What I Heard in the Apple Barrel"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*Several historical novels feature Roberts as the protagonist, including ''The Devil's Captain'' (1992) by Philip Shea, ''The Requiem Shark'' (1999) by [[Nicholas Griffin]], and ''The Devil's Captain'' (2000) by Frank Sherry. Roberts' 1720 kidnapping of navigator Harry Glasby and Glasby's ultimate escape is the basis for the novel, "Glasby's Fortune" (2017) by James H. Drescher.
*A number of novels and poems have been published in Welsh featuring Bartholomew Roberts, notably a ballad by [[Isaac Daniel Hooson|I. D. Hooson]], for which a vocal score was later composed by [[Alun Hoddinott]], and a novel by [[T. Llew Jones]].
*In the novel ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' and its [[The Princess Bride (film)|film adaptation]],&lt;ref&gt;The Everything Pirates Book: A Swashbuckling History of Adventure, Page 228, Barbara Karg, Arjean Spaite, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; protagonist Westley dons the mantle of the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]], a mythical figure inspired by Bartholomew Roberts.
*In the manga series ''[[One Piece]]'', a character named Bartholomew Kuma is named for Roberts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The king of the pirates in the series, Gol D. Roger, also resembles Roberts in a number of ways.
*In an [[Casa Bonita (South Park)|episode]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', the [[Casa Bonita]] restaurant in [[Lakewood, Colorado]], features an attraction called "Black Bart's Cave", named for Roberts.
*Roberts may be the inspiration for the "Lord Bartholomew" in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.
*Roberts appears as a [[non-player character]] in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' video game]], voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].
*A fictionalised version of Roberts appears as the primary antagonist of the 2013 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', voiced by [[Oliver Milburn]]. In the game, Roberts is reimagined as a "sage", a human reincarnation of the Precursor scientist, Aita.

'''Bislim Kadri Bajgora''' (c. 1900 - 1947) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] nationalist and [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Yugoslavia|collaborator]], [[Adjutant]] for the [[Balli Kombetar]] forces of [[Kosovo]] during [[World War II]].

== Early life ==
Born in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] sometime around the 1900s to an Albanian patriotic family, he grew up with guns and tales of Albanian heroism. He was from the [[Shala tribe|Shala]] tribe of Mitrovica. When the Axis powers occupied Kosovo in the 1940s, [[Kosovar-Albanian]]s saw the chance to free themselves from Serb rule and collaborated with the Germans. [[Chetnik]] forces had been expelling and killing Albanians and the family of Bislim Bajgora had fled to [[Gjirokaster]]. When the Germans occupied Kosovo, the Albanians freely chose to serve in the German Army which surprised the Germans. Bislim Bajgora was offered by the DDR,to join the German military police and get a plot in Hamburg, and Bislim rejected it, and said that he will not accept it and he will fight for his country.

The Germans had for a long time been very interested in working the [[Trepca mines]] and when they seized it, they started producing [[zinc]] and [[lead]] for the army. When the German forces occupied Mitrovica, they were not attacked as the Albanians saw it as liberation fromm the chetnik-Serbian forces. The city was handed over to influential leaders such as Bislim Bajgora, Ahmet Selaci, Ukshin Kovaqica, etc. Bislim Bajgora had a good reputation among the [[Shala tribe|Shala]] tribe and the region had a good, strategic location enabling a good defence. When the Germans occupied the city they asked for an authoritative character and the Albanians picked Bislim Bajgora to lead the liberation forces of Mitrovica thus the Germans, in need of an ally against the Serb, gave Albanians arms and training. 
Immediately, the [[Shala tribe|Shala-tribe]] and the Germans began cooperating and they received help from one of the most educated Albanians named [[Xhafer Deva]] who ran the German-Albanian politics in the city. Bislim Bajgora and Xhafer Deva got along well and showed mutual respect. 
On 21 April 1941, there was a gathering of the Albanian forces and the Germans at the "Jadran" hotel, where Xhafer Deva sought to station his political activities and the Germans approved of his request. Bislim Bajgora had now won full support from the Germans and was considered a good ally of Germany. He became an adjutant for [[Gunther Hausding]], head of [[Gestapo]], the German secret police. After the 21st of April the Germans opened up schools for Albanian language for the first time in 40 years Albanians were able to educate themselves. The tribes of Shala and [[Bajgora]] was given arms and they were enforced further by more recruits led by commander Ahmet Selaci and Pajazit Boletini (nephew of [[Isa Boletini]]).
The forces of the Balli Kombetar were mainly stationed in Mitrovica, but also among regions which were under control of Bislim Bajgora, Ukshin Kovaqica, Mehmet Gradica, Shaban Polluzha, Sylejman Viquterna, etc. The Balli Kombetar patrolled the city, keeping order but they mainly focused on guarding the borders of Greater Albania which the Germans had created for the first time since 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| language=Albanian|url=http://www.ballikombit.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=161&amp;Itemid=9| author=Gazmend Islami| publisher=Parti Balli Kombetar| title=Bunjaket e Samadrexhes Cerdhe Nacionalistesh |accessdate=2016-01-06|date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novi Pazar ==
{{details|Battle for Novi Pazar}}
In 1941, chetnik forces began burning houses and killing civilians in the Albanian village of in which Bislim Bajgora and his forces headed for the village in order to save Albanians. When they arrived, the Chetniks fled and the village was saved from further attacks. In 1943, during the chetnik occupation of [[Novi Pazar]], Serbs killed Albanian and [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] civilians. The chetnik leaders were [[Žika Marković]] and [[Kosta Pećanac]] who encouraged the Serbian forces to burn houses, massacre civilians and plunder. Bislim Bajgora arrived in [[Novi Pazar]] with 200 fighters, along with [[Shaban Polluzha]], who also had 200 fighters and many others. The list of commanders involved in the fighting was Mulla Iljas Broja, Miftar and Cen Bajraktari, Col Bajraktari, Ymer Fazlija, Isuf Gradica, Imer Selaci, Pajazit Boletini, Sadik Lutani, etc. The first commander to reach the town was Hysen Llakiqi from Polaci, [[Drenica]]. During the fight with the chetniks there were numerous casualties among the Albanian forces. The Balli Kombetar killed 163 Chetniks and captured the town of Novi Pazar.

== Peć ==
In 1943 the Serb forces of [[Peć]] began committing war crimes against civilians to which the Albanians responded by sending their forces. The Serb casualties numbered 130 that day. The Serbian population of Kosovo, fearing revenge from the Albanian forces after the Chetnik war crimes against Albanians, began fleeing Kosovo. 40,000 Serbs fled to Italy, 30,000 to Germany and 25,000 to a Bulgarian peace-zone. The total amount of Serbs who fled Kosovo was 100,000. During the war, Albanians were given jobs, arms and schools were opened for the first time in several decades. Albanians were free from Serbian fascist rule and Kosovo was united with Albania as it was planned in 1912.

Bajgora was one of the leaders of the ONDSH (Albanian National Democratic Organization), an anti-communist and nationalist league founded in 1945 to oppose Kosovo returning under Yugoslav rule.&lt;ref name="Dedijer1981"&gt;{{cite book|page=910| author=Vladimir Dedijer|title=Novi prilozi za biografiju Josipa Broza Tita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7EfAQAAMAAJ|year=1981|publisher=Liburnija}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/news/id_5127/Emil-Kastrati:-Epopeja-e-Bes%C3%ABlidhjes-komb%C3%ABtare-Demokratike-Shqiptare-%28B-K-D-SH%29.html| language=Albanian| publisher=ZemraShqiptare.com| author=Emil Kastrati| title=Epopeja e Besëlidhjes kombëtare Demokratike Shqiptare (B.K.D.SH)| date=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After guerrilla fights against chetnik forces, winter came and Bislim Bajgora and his men were forced to find shelter. Some of the fighters chose the village of Lupq in [[Llap]] where they hid in a bunker. They were discovered by spies who reported them to the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav forces]]. On 1 March 1947, they were surrounded. The Yugoslav forces consisted of Albanians and they did not want to open fire against the Balli Kombetar and one commander approached them and asked if they would surrender their weapons in peace. Bislim Bajgora and his friends answered "Back away from the frontline because we did not gather arms only to surrender them!". After the fighting the Yugoslav casualties numbered 350. The surviving friends of Bislim Bajgora took his body away and buried it nearby. His grave remains unknown to this very day.

== Afterwards ==
After the war, Albanians from Kosovo and Mitrovica were expelled to [[Turkey]]. The family of Rashit Bajgora, relative of Bislim Bajgora, had fled to Turkey in 1914. The family of Nuh Bajgora, also relative, had fled to Turkey in 1921. The only remaining relative of Bislim Bajgora was Sar Bajgora. After 100 years, in 2014, a forgotten relative of the family, Tuncay Baygora from [[Istanbul]], returned to Kosovo to visit the remaining places of his family. Tuncay also met up with Miradije Bajgora Shala, the daughter of Bislim Bajgora.

== Legend ==
Bislim Bajgora is said to have been one of the greatest Albanian riflemen. He was tall, well-built and often wore his [[Traditional Albanian clothing|Albanian national costume]]. 
Today he is a [[venerated]] symbol of Albanians in Mitrovica and a he is celebrated as a hero. Recently, there was a book published by the Albanian author and professor Asllan Istrefi about the life of Bislim Bajgora.

A '''burial vault''' is a structural underground [[tomb]].{{commonscat|Burial vaults}}

It is a stone or brick-lined underground space or 'burial' chamber for the interment of a [[death|dead]] body or bodies. These burial tombs were originally and are still often [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and usually have stone slab entrances. They are often privately owned and used for specific family or other groups, but usually stand beneath a public religious building, such as a [[church architecture|church]], or in a [[churchyard]] or [[cemetery]]. A [[crypt]] may be used as a burial vault.

'''CTQ trees''' ([[critical-to-quality]] trees) are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met in order to satisfy the customer. They align improvement or design efforts with customer requirements.

CTQs are used to decompose broad [[customer]] [[requirement]]s into more easily quantified elements. CTQ trees are often used as part of [[six sigma]] methodology to help prioritize such requirements. 

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics as defined by the customer/user. Customers may be surveyed to elicit quality, service and performance data. They may include upper and lower specification limits or any other factors. A CTQ must be an actionable, quantitative business specification.

CTQs reflect the expressed needs of the customer. The CTQ practitioner converts them to measurable terms using tools such as [[DFMEA]]. Services and products are typically not monolithic. They must be decomposed into constituent elements (tasks in the cases of services).

'''Charles Melville Hays''' (May 16, 1856 – April 15, 1912) was the president of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]]. He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the [[Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway]].  He became Vice-President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.

Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.

Hays is credited with the formation of the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada.&lt;ref name=CNHR&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Melville Hays: Daring to Dream|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_RB_text_Hays.html|work=Canadian National History Railblazers|publisher=Canadian National Railway|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP.  He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt; Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster.&lt;ref name= Lord&gt;{{cite book|last=Lord|first=Walter|title=A Night To Remember|year=1955|publisher=Holt|location=New York|isbn=0805077642|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His body was recovered, and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.

==Early life==
Charles Melville Hays was born in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], on May 16, 1856.&lt;ref name= Vermonter&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vermonter, Volumes 4–5|year=1898|publisher=Charles S.|pages=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8eAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], when he was a child.

==Career==
In 1873, at the age of 17, he began his career in the railroad business working for the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=Atherton&gt;{{cite book|last=Atherton|first=William Henry|title=Montreal, 1535–1914: Volume 3|year=1914|publisher=S. J. Clarke|pages=44–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDBXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1877 to 1884, Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]]. Beginning in 1884, he held the same position with the [[Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway]] until 1886, when he became that company's General Manager. In 1889, he became Vice-President of the Wasbash Railroad and remained as such until 1896, when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.&lt;ref name=Vermonter /&gt;

In 1901, Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railway Company]] but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice-President and General Manager. In October 1909, he was appointed president of GTR, which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Melville Hays|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/charles-melville-hays-1.html|publisher=The New York Times (as re-printed on Encyclopedia Titanica)|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Central Vermont Railway]], the [[Grand Trunk Western Railway]], the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad, the [[Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway]], the Southern New England Railway Company, the Canadian Express Company, and several others.&lt;ref name=Atherton /&gt;&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Melville Hays|url=http://www.railfame.ca/sec_ind/leaders/en_2002_CharlesHays.asp|work=railfame.ca|publisher=Canadian Railway Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies. He was Governor of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal]], [[Montreal General Hospital]] and [[McGill University]]. He received the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways.&lt;ref name=Atherton /&gt;

When Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896, it was near bankruptcy and under-performing its rival, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]](CPR). On the advice of American financier [[J. Pierpont Morgan]],&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt; the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive, "American" business practices to the company. He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated [[running rights]] with CPR. He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts, built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives. These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad.&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt;&lt;ref name=DicBio&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Hays, Charles Melville |first=Theodore D. |last=Regehr |volume=14 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hays_charles_melville_14E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcontinental Railway==
[[Image:Portrait of Charles Melville Hays.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Charles Melville Hays.]]
At the time, the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad, within the borders of Canada, to run 3,600 miles from [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1900, he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to [[Winnipeg]], "and thence to the Pacific." However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific, but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir [[Charles Rivers Wilson]], had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile, the government, under Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]], had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902.&lt;ref name=DicBio /&gt;

Hays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] (NTR).&lt;ref name=DicBio /&gt;

There were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP. 
*Firstly, he had planned to buy out the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR), but the company resisted and instead provided competition. 
*Secondly, Hays lacked support from the Board of Directors in London; he wanted to link the GTR with the GTP, but the board would not back this plan. He thus proceeded on his own authority, making commitments that would ultimately ruin both the GTP and the GTR. 
*Thirdly, Hays faced opposition to his choice of Prince Rupert, on [[Kaien Island]], B.C., for the western terminal, because there was not much traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.&lt;ref name=DicBio /&gt;

Hays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic.&lt;ref name=DicBio /&gt; The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one.&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt; This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.&lt;ref name=DicBio /&gt;

After construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including [[Melville, Saskatchewan]], which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hacking /&gt; He hired the famed architect [[Francis Rattenbury]] from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Château Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly, despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910.&lt;ref name=Hacking /&gt;

After Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands but failed to re-hire 250 previously-fired strikers despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as "heartless, cruel, and tyrannical."&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt;

By 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on "building to the very highest standards". Meanwhile, CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency.&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt;

==''Titanic''==
In April 1912, Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP. He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the [[Château Laurier]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], named after Prime Minister Laurier. The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25, 1912.&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt; Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy.

Additionally, he might have had business with [[J. Bruce Ismay]], chairman of the [[White Star Line]]; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS ''Titanic''. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson (son of [[Charles Peers Davidson]]), his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on B Deck, also known as the Bridge Deck.&lt;ref name=Hacking&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacking|first=Norman R.|title=Prince Ships of Northern British Columbia: Ships of the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian National Railways|year=1995|publisher=Heritage House Publishing|isbn=1895811287|pages=30–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9nDjLpnsd8C&amp;pg=PA35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ET2&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Charles Melville Hays|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melville-hays.html|work=encyclopedia-titanica.org|publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:40&amp;nbsp;pm on April 14, 1912, ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg. Hays helped the women in his party into one of [[lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|the ship's 20 lifeboats]],&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite book|title=Railway and locomotive engineering: a practical journal of motive power, rolling stock and appliances, Volume 24, Issue 1 – Volume 25, Issue 12: Obituary; Charles M. Hays|year=1912|publisher=Angus Sinclair co|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_osMiSB9CUC&amp;pg=PA186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he, his son-in-law, and his secretary remained and perished when [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|the ship sank]],&lt;ref name=Hacking /&gt; along with 1,500 other ''Titanic'' passengers and crew.&lt;ref name= Lord /&gt; Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, "The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster."&lt;ref name=CNHR /&gt;

One source, Hacking, names the daughter with Hays on the ''Titanic'' as "Margaret,"&lt;ref name=Hacking /&gt; but it was his daughter, Orian, who was traveling with her husband, Thorton Davidson.&lt;ref name="ET-TD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr Thornton Davidson|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/thornton-davidson.html|work=encyclopedia-titanica.org|publisher=Encyclopdia Titanica|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That source does not mention Orian as a passenger on the ship.

===Death===
Hays' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the ''Minia'', and he was buried at [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] in Montreal. Two funerals were held for him on May 8, one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, the other in London at the Church of [[St Edmund, King and Martyr]]

==Legacy==
Hays died before he could see the GTP completed. He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. The period in which Hays led the GTR was its most prosperous era.

However, his policies led to the GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP to which they did not agree. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.&lt;ref name=DicBio/&gt;

The railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the [[Canadian Railway Museum]], near [[Delson, Quebec]]. There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert, and the city of [[Melville, Saskatchewan]], is named after him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Dr. Charles A. Ofria''' is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [[Michigan State University]], the director of the [[Digital organism simulators|Digital Evolution (DEvo) Lab]] there, and a co-founder of the [[BEACON Center]] for the Study of Evolution in Action. He is the son of the late Charles Ofria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familycar.com/Bios/CharlesOfria.htm|title=Charles Ofria (senior)|author=|date=|work=|publisher=FamilyCar.com|accessdate=11 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130208065438/http://www.familycar.com/Bios/CharlesOfria.htm|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the first fully integrated [[Automobile repair shop|shop]] management program for the automotive repair industry. Ofria attended [[Stuyvesant High School]] and graduated from [[Ward Melville High School]] in 1991. He obtained a B.S. in Computer Science, Pure Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics from [[Stony Brook University]] in 1994, and a Ph.D. in Computation and Neural Systems from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1999. Ofria's research focuses on the interplay between [[computer science]] and Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ofria/ Computer Science] Michigan state University&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofria is one of the designers of [[Avida]], an [[artificial life]] software platform to study the [[evolutionary biology]] of self-replicating and evolving computer programs ([[digital organism]]s, see also [[Digital organism simulators]]). Avida has been used extensively to study the basic processes that underlie Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/cover/?searchterm=testing%20darwin | title =Testing Darwin | publisher=[[Discover Magazine]] | date =February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avida is under active development in Ofria's Digital Evolution Lab at [[Michigan State University]] and was originally designed by Ofria, [[Chris Adami]] and C. Titus Brown at [[Caltech]] in 1993.

The transition between the end of the [[Eocene]] (33.9 [[mega-annum|Ma]]) and the beginning of the [[Oligocene]] is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the [[Extinction event|largest mass extinctions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivany|first=Linda C.|last2=Patterson|first2=William P.|last3=Lohmann|first3=Kyger C.|title=Cooler winters as a possible cause of mass extinctions at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35038044|journal=Nature|volume=407|issue=6806|pages=887–890|doi=10.1038/35038044|pmid=11057663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient [[cetaceans]], the [[Archaeoceti]].

This was a time of major [[Climate change|climatic change]], especially cooling, not obviously linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic [[volcanic]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=Eustoquio|last2=Gonzalvo|first2=Concepción|last3=Ortiz|first3=Silvia|last4=Cruz|first4=Luis E.|date=2006-02-28|title=Foraminiferal turnover across the Eocene–Oligocene transition at Fuente Caldera, southern Spain: No cause–effect relationship between meteorite impacts and extinctions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377839805001404|journal=Marine Micropaleontology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=270–286|doi=10.1016/j.marmicro.2005.11.006|bibcode=2006MarMP..58..270M}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause of the extinction event is speculated to be extended volcanic activity. Another speculation is that the extinctions are related to several large [[meteorite]] impacts that occurred about this time. One such event caused the [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]] (40&amp;nbsp;km), and another at the [[Popigai crater]] (100&amp;nbsp;km) of central [[Siberia]], scattering debris perhaps as far as Europe. New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's Popigai Meteor Crash Linked to Mass Extinction|url=https://news.yahoo.com/russias-popigai-meteor-crash-linked-mass-extinction-113359696.html|date=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time predicts a decrease in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold approximately 34 million years ago. This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event, an [[oxygen isotope]] excursion that marks the beginning of [[ice sheet]] coverage on Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zachos|first=James C.|last2=Quinn|first2=Terrence M.|last3=Salamy|first3=Karen A.|date=1996-06-01|title=High-resolution (104 years) deep-sea foraminiferal stable isotope records of the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/96PA00571/abstract|journal=Paleoceanography|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=251–266|doi=10.1029/96PA00571|issn=1944-9186|bibcode=1996PalOc..11..251Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shackleton|first=N.

==Grande Coupure==
The ''Grande Coupure'', or "great break" in continuity,&lt;ref&gt;also termed the MP 21 event.&lt;/ref&gt; with a major European turnover in mammalian fauna about 33.5 Ma, marks the end of the last phase of Eocene assemblages, the [[Priabonian]], and the arrival in Europe of Asian species. The Grande Coupure is characterized by widespread extinctions and [[allopatric speciation]] in small isolated [[Relict (biology)|relict population]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Called "dispersal-generated origination" in Hooker et al. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was given its name in 1910 by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] palaeontologist [[Hans Georg Stehlin]],&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Stehlen, 1910. "Remarques sur les faunules de Mammifères des couches eocenes et oligocenes du Bassin de Paris," in ''Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France,'' '''4''''.9, pp 488-520.&lt;/ref&gt; to characterise the dramatic turnover of European mammalian fauna, which he placed at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A comparable turnover in Asian fauna has since been called the "Mongolian Remodelling".

The Grande Coupure marks a break between [[endemic]] European faunas before the break and mixed faunas with a strong Asian component afterwards. [[J. J. Hooker]] and his team summarized the break:&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1144/0016-764903-091 |title=Eocene-Oligocene mammalian faunal turnover in the Hampshire Basin, UK: calibration to the global time scale and the major cooling event |year=2004 |author=Hooker, J.J. |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=161 |pages=161 |last2=Collinson |first2=M.E. |last3=Sille |first3=N.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Pre-Grande Coupure faunas are dominated by the perissodact family [[Palaeotheriidae]] (distant [[horse]] relatives), six families of artiodactyls (cloven-hoofed mammals) ([[Anoplotheriidae]], [[Xiphodontidae]], [[Choeropotamidae]], [[Cebochoeridae]], [[Dichobunidae]] and [[Amphimerycidae]]), the rodent family [[Pseudosciuridae]], the primate families [[Omomyidae]] and [[Adapiformes|Adapidae]], and the [[archonta]]n family [[Nyctitheriidae]].

:"Post-Grande Coupure faunas include the true rhinoceros (family [[Rhinocerotidae]]), three artiodactyl families ([[Entelodontidae]], [[Anthracotheriidae]] and [[Gelocidae]]) related respectively to [[Suidae|pig]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s and [[ruminant]]s, the [[rodent]] families [[Eomyidae]], [[Cricetidae]] ([[hamster]]s) and [[Castoridae]] ([[beaver]]s), and the lipotyphlan family [[Erinaceidae]] ([[hedgehog]]s). The speciose genus [[Palaeotherium]] plus ''[[Anoplotherium]]'' and the families Xiphodontidae and Amphimerycidae were observed to disappear completely.

:"Only the [[marsupial]] family [[Herpetotheriidae]], the artiodactyl family [[Cainotheriidae]], and the rodent families [[Theridomyidae]] and Gliridae ([[dormice]]) crossed the faunal divide undiminished."

It has been suggested that this was caused by [[climate change]] associated with the earliest polar glaciations&lt;ref&gt;A major cooling event preceded the Grande Coupure, based on pollen studies in the Paris Basin conducted by Chateauneuf ([[J.J. Chateauneuf]], 1980. "Palynostratigraphie et paleoclimatologie de l'Éocene superieur et de l'Oligocene du Bassin de [[Paris]] ([[France]])" in ''Mémoires du Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières'', '''116''' 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and a major fall in sea levels, or by competition with taxa dispersing from Asia. However, few argue for an [[Oligocene#Climate|isolated single cause]]. Other possible causes are related to the impact of one or more large bolides in northern hemisphere at [[Popigai crater|Popigai]], [[Toms Canyon impact crater|Toms Canyon]] and [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater|Chesapeake Bay]]. Improved correlation of [[northwest Europe]]an successions to global events&lt;ref name=Hooker/&gt; confirms the Grande Coupure as occurring in the earliest Oligocene, with a hiatus of about 350 [[millennia]] prior to the first record of post-Grande Coupure Asian immigrant taxa.

An element of the paradigm of the Grande Coupure was the apparent [[extinction]] of all European primates at the Coupure: the 1999 discovery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10588762 |date=December 1999 |author1=Köhler, M |author2=Moyà-Solà, S |title=A finding of oligocene primates on the European continent |volume=96 |issue=25 |pages=14664–7 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=24493 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10588762 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.25.14664|bibcode = 1999PNAS...9614664K }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[mouse]]-sized early Oligocene [[omomyid]], reflecting the better survival chances of small mammals, further undercut the Grand Coupure [[paradigm]].

Evidence in the world’s ocean current system indicates an abrupt cooling from 34.1 to 33.6 Ma across the Eocene–Oligocene boundary at 33.9 Ma. The remarkable cooling period in the ocean is correlated with pronounced mammalian faunal replacement within continental Asia as well. The Asian biotic reorganization events are comparable to the Grande Coupure in Europe and the Mongolian Remodeling of mammalian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = R. | last2 = Kravchinsky | first2 = V.A. | last3 = Yue | first3 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Link between Global Cooling and Mammalian Transformation across the Eocene-Oligocene Boundary in the Continental Interior of Asia] | url = | journal = International Journal of Earth Sciences | volume =  101| issue = | pages =  2193–2200| doi = 10.1007/s00531-012-0776-1 | bibcode = 2012IJEaS.101.2193Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global cooling is also correlated with marked drying conditions in low-latitudes Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Y.

'''Eomeropidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of aberrant, flattened [[scorpionflies]] represented today  by [[extant taxon|only a single living species]], '''''Notiothauma reedi''''', known from the ''[[Nothofagus]]'' forests in southern [[Chile]], while all other recognized genera in the family are known only as fossils, with the earliest from Triassic-aged strata,&lt;ref name=TsuTyp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang Junxia |year=2011 |title=A new fossil eomeropid (Insecta, Mecoptera) from the Jiulongshan Formation, Inner Mongolia, China |journal=Zoosystema |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=443–450|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the youngest from Paleogene-aged strata.&lt;ref name=TsuTyp /&gt;&lt;ref name=Archibald&gt;Archibald, S.

==Genera==
* {{extinct}}''[[Eomerope]]''. This genus is known from [[Paleogene]] fossils from [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] strata of  [[North America]], and Paleocene to Oligocene strata of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=Archibald /&gt;  Because ''N. reedi'' is not known in the fossil record, ''Eomerope'' is the youngest of the fossil genera, and has the widest range.
* {{extinct}}''[[Jurachorista]]''.  Known from the early Jurassic, Sinemurian, of Dorset England.
* {{extinct}}''[[Jurathauma]]''. ''J. simplex'' is one of three species of eomeropid scorpionflies from the Middle Jurassic of China.  Its wing veins are distinct from all other eomeropids.&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;
* ''Notiothauma''. ''N. reedi'' is a remarkable species, flattened and extremely [[cockroach]]-like in appearance and habits. It is nocturnal, and scuttles on the forest floor, where it can be collected by laying trails of oatmeal.  The larvae are still unknown.  Because this is the last extant species of Eomeropidae, ''N. reedi'' can be characterized as a [[living fossil]] taxon.&lt;ref name=Archibald /&gt;
* {{extinct}}''[[Thaumatomerope]]''. This genus is known from the Triassic-aged Madygen [[Lagerstätte]], of Ladinian to Carnian [[Kyrgyzstan]].  ''Thaumatomerope''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s placement is subjective, as it has also been placed within [[Meropeidae]], and in its own monotypic family, "Thaumatomeropidae."
* {{extinct}}''[[Tsuchingothauma]]''. ''T. shihi'' is one of three species of eomeropid scorpionflies from the Middle Jurassic of China.  Its fossils are found in two formations, one with ''Typhothauma'', and another with ''Jurathauma''
* {{extinct}}''[[Typhothauma]]''. ''T. yixianensis'' is one of three species of eomeropid scorpionflies from the Middle Jurassic of China.

'''Gun-related violence''' is violence committed with the use of a gun ([[firearm]] or [[small arm]]). Gun-related violence may or may not be considered criminal. Criminal violence includes [[homicide]] (except when and where ruled [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justifiable]]), [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and [[suicide]], or [[attempted suicide]], depending on [[jurisdiction]]. Non-criminal violence includes accidental or unintentional injury and death (except perhaps in cases of criminal negligence). Also generally included in gun violence statistics are military or para-military activities.[[File:Gun Deaths by Year, Australia, America.pdf|thumb|400px|alt=Graph showing the rate of gun deaths per capita in the United States and Australia.|Time series showing rates of gun-related deaths per capita (all sources) in the US and Australia]]

According to GunPolicy.org, 75 percent of the world's 875 million guns are civilian controlled.&lt;ref name=GIGV2013/&gt; Roughly half of these guns (48 percent) are in the United States, which has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/americas/us-gun-statistics/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, millions are wounded and killed by the use of guns.&lt;ref name=GIGV2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region |title=Global Impact of Gun Violence |last1=Alpers |first1=Philip |last2=Wilson |first2=Marcus |year=2013 |website=gunpolicy.org |publisher=Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths in 2013 up from 128,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were additionally 47,000 unintentional firearm-related deaths in 2013.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

A number of ideas have been proposed on how to lessen the incidence of gun-related violence.

Some propose keeping a gun at home to keep one safer. Studies show that guns in the home is associated with an increased risk of violent death in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dahlberg et al.|first1=Linda L.|title=Guns in the Home and Risk of a Violent Death in the Home: Findings from a National Study|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=November 15, 2004|volume= 160|issue= 10|pages=929–936|doi=10.1093/aje/kwh309|url=https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI, gun-related violence is linked to gun ownership and is not a function or byproduct of crime.  Their study indicates that more than 90% of gun-related deaths were not part of a commission of a crime, rather they were directly related to gun ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezashr/|title=Easy Access to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports|last=Justice|first=National Center for Juvenile|website=www.ojjdp.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-weisser/nra-gun-deaths_b_6506884.html|title=The Gun Violence Stats the NRA Doesn't Want You to Consider|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mother Jones'' reports that "[a] Philadelphia study found that the odds of an assault victim being shot were 4.5 times greater if he carried a gun" and that "[h]is odds of being killed were 4.2 times greater" when armed.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check|title=10 Pro-Gun Myths, Shot Down|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;Others propose arming civilians to counter mass shootings.

===Intentional homicide===

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines intentional homicide as "acts in which the perpetrator intended to cause death or serious injury by his or her actions." This excludes deaths: related to conflicts (war); caused by recklessness or negligence; or justifiable, such as in self-defense or by law enforcement in the line of duty.&lt;ref name=UNGSH2011 /&gt; A 2009 report by the Geneva Declaration using UNODC data showed that worldwide firearms were used in an average of 60 percent of all homicides.&lt;ref name="GBAV2008-CH4"&gt;{{cite book |date=September 2008  |chapter=Lethal Encounters: Non-conflict Armed Violence |chapterurl=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV/GBAV08-CH4.pdf |title=Global Burden of Armed Violence 2008 |url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/nc/en/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2008.html |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |location=Geneva, Switzerland |publisher=Geneva Declaration Secretariat |pages=67–88 |isbn=978-2-8288-0101-4 |accessdate= }} by Geneva Declaration editors using UNODC data.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} In the U.S. in 2011, 67 percent of homicide victims were killed by a firearm: 66 percent of single-victim homicides and 79 percent of multiple-victim homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4863 |title=Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement, 2011 |last1=Cooper |first1=Alexia |last2=Smith |first2=Erica L. |date=December 30, 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the United States' homicide rate was reported to be 5.0 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Study on Homicide |date=2011 |website=Unodc.org |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 Harvard study claims that in 2010 the homicide rate was about 7 times higher than that of other high-income countries, and that the US gun homicide rate was 25.2 times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinshteyn|first1=E|last2=Hemenway|first2=D|title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=March 2016|volume=129|issue=3|pages=266–73|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025|pmid=26551975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Harvard study found that higher gun availability was strongly correlated with higher homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|last2=Miller|first2=M|title=Firearm availability and homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.|journal=[[The Journal of Trauma]]|date=December 2000|volume=49|issue=6|pages=985–8|pmid=11130511|doi=10.1097/00005373-200012000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to guns is associated with an increased risk of being the victim of homicide.&lt;ref name=annals/&gt; Access to firearms is not the sole contributor to increased homicide rates, however, as one study by the Southern Criminal Justice Association in 2011 found.

===Domestic violence===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
Some gun control advocates say that the strongest evidence linking availability of guns to death and injury is found in [[domestic violence]] studies, often referring to those by public health policy analyst [[Arthur Kellermann]]. In response to suggestions by some that homeowners would be wise to acquire firearms for protection from home invasions, Kellermann investigated in-home homicides in three cities over five years. He found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present. The data showed that the risk of a [[crime of passion]] or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was higher when a gun was readily available (essentially loaded and unlocked) compared to when no gun was readily available. Kellerman said this increase in mortality overshadowed any protection a gun might have deterring or defending against burglaries or invasions. He also concluded that further research of domestic violence causes and prevention are needed.&lt;ref name=NEJM329&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellerman |first=Arthur L. |last2=Rivara |first2=Frederick P. |date=October 7, 1993 |title=Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=329 |issue=15 |pages=1084–1091 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |pmid=8371731 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Kellermann's study say that it is more directly a study of domestic violence than of gun ownership. Gary Kleck and others dispute the work.&lt;ref name=Suter1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suter |first=Edgar A. |date=March 1994  |title=Guns in the medical literature—a failure of peer review |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=162372 |journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia |publisher= |volume=83 |issue=13 |pages=133–148 |pmid=8201280 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kates |first=Don B. |last2=Schaffer |first2=Henry E. |last3=Lattimer |first3=John K. |last4=Murray |first4=George B. |last5=Cassem |first5=Edwin H. |year=1995 |editor-last=Kopel |editor-first=David B. |title=Guns: Who Should Have Them? |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guns-who-should-have-them/oclc/32393136 |location=New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |pages=233–308 |isbn=9780879759582 |accessdate= }} in chapter "Bad Medicine: Doctors and Guns." Orig. pub. 1994 in ''Tennessee Law Review'' as "Guns and Public Health: Epidemic of Violence or Pandemic of Propaganda?"&lt;/ref&gt; Kleck says that few of the homicides that Kellermann studied were committed with guns belonging to the victim or members of his or her household, and that it was implausible that victim household gun ownership contributed to their homicide. Instead, according to Kleck, the association that Kellermann found between gun ownership and victimization reflected that people who live in more dangerous circumstances are more likely to be murdered, but also were more likely to have acquired guns for self-protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleck |first=Gary |date=February 2001  |title=Can Owning a Gun Really Triple the Owner's Chances of being Murdered? |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=187212 |journal=Homicide Studies |publisher=SAGE |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=64–77 |doi=10.1177/1088767901005001005 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robbery and assault===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] defines robbery as the theft of property by force or threat of force.  Assault is defined as a physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury.  In the case of gun-related violence, the definitions become more specific and include only robbery and assault committed with the use of a firearm.&lt;ref name=UNODCCrimeData&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html |title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Data |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 29, 2013 |website=unodc.org |publisher=UNODC |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms are used in this threatening capacity four to six times more than firearms used as a means of protection in fighting crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Hemenway|author2=Deborah Azrael|title=The Relative Frequency of Offensive and Defensive Gun Uses: Results from a National Survey|journal=Violence and Victims|year=2000|volume=15|issue=3|pages=257–272|pmid=11200101|author3=D Hemenway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemenway |first=David |last2=Azrael |first2=Deborah |last3=Miller |first3=Matthew |date=2000 |title=Gun use in the United States: results from two national surveys |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263.full |journal=Injury Prevention |publisher= |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=263–267 |doi=10.1136/ip.6.4.263 |pmid=11144624 |accessdate= |pmc=1730664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemenway's figures are disputed by other academics, who assert there are many more defensive uses of firearms than criminal uses. See John Lott's "More Guns, Less Crime".

===Accidental firearm deaths===
From 1979 to 1997, almost 30,000 people in the United States alone died from accidental firearm injuries. A disproportionately high number of these deaths occurred in parts of the United States where firearms are more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M|last2=Azrael|first2=D|last3=Hemenway|first3=D|title=Firearm availability and unintentional firearm deaths.|journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention|date=July 2001|volume=33|issue=4|pages=477–84|pmid=11426678|doi=10.1016/s0001-4575(00)00061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs of gun-related violence ==
Violence committed with guns leads to significant [[public health]], [[psychological]], and [[economic]] costs.

=== Economic costs ===
The economic cost of gun-related violence in the United States is $229 billion a year,&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;(A. Peters. (2015) ''The Staggering Costs Of Gun Violence In The U.S. Every Year'' retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fastcoexist.com/3047682/the-staggering-costs-of-gun-violence-in-the-us-every-year&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;{{qualify evidence}} &lt;!-- How was this number constructed?

=== Public health ===
Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths worldwide in 2013, up from 128,000 deaths worldwide in 1990.&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt;  There were 47,000 [[gun safety|unintentional firearm deaths]] worldwide in 2013.&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt;

[[Emergency medicine|Emergency medical care]] is a major contributor to the monetary costs of such violence. It was determined in a study that for every firearm death in the United States for the year beginning 1 June 1992, an average of three firearm-related injuries were treated in hospital [[emergency department]]s.&lt;ref name="JAMA1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Annest |first=Joseph L. |last2=Mercy |first2=James A. |last3=Gibson |first3=Delinda R. |last4=Ryan |first4=George W. |date=June 14, 1995 |title=National Estimates of Nonfatal Firearm-Related Injuries: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg |journal=JAMA |publisher=American Medical Association |volume=273 |issue=22 |pages=1749–54 |doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520460031030 |pmid=7769767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological ===
Children exposed to gun-related violence, whether they are victims, perpetrators, or witnesses, can experience negative psychological effects over the short and long terms. Psychological trauma also is common among children who are exposed to high levels of violence in their communities or through the media.&lt;ref&gt;(Kathleen R. Patti L. Richard E.B.

Legislation at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], state, and local levels has attempted to address gun violence through a variety of methods, including restricting firearms purchases by youths and other "at-risk" populations, setting waiting periods for firearm purchases, establishing [[gun buyback program]]s, law enforcement and policing strategies, stiff sentencing of gun law violators, education programs for parents and children, and community-outreach programs. Despite widespread concern about the impacts of gun violence on public health, Congress has prohibited the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) from conducting research that advocates in favor of gun control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zwillich|first1=Todd|title=Quietly, Congress extends a ban on CDC research on gun violence|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-02/quietly-congress-extends-ban-cdc-research-gun-violence|accessdate=12 September 2015|agency=Public Radio International (PRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC has interpreted this ban to extend to all research on gun violence prevention, and so has not funded any research on this subject since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Rita|title=Tale of 2 Agencies: CDC Avoids Gun Violence Research But NIH Funds It|journal=JAMA|date=26 April 2016|volume=315|issue=16|pages=1689–91|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.1707|pmid=27050067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gun-related violence in Australia ==

=== Port Arthur ===
[[File:Stop Gun Violence Sad Face Sign (4573522770).jpg|thumb]]
The Port Arthur massacre of 1996 horrified the Australian public. The gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists, killing 35 people and wounding 23. This massacre, kick started Australia’s laws against guns. The Prime Minister at that time, John Howard, proposed a gun law that prevented the public from having all semi-automatic rifles, all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, in addition to a tightly restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls.

The government also bought back guns from people. In 1996–2003 it was estimated they bought back and destroyed nearly 1 million firearms. By the end of 1996, whilst Australia was still reeling from the Port Arthur massacre, the gun law was fully in place. Since then, the number of deaths related to gun-related violence dwindled almost every year. In 1979 six hundred and eighty-five people&lt;ref&gt;Kreisfeld, Renate. 2006. ‘Australia Revised Firearm Deaths 1979–2003.’ ''National Injury Surveillance Unit / NISU''. Adelaide: Research Centre for Injury Studies, Flinders University of South Australia. 1 March&lt;/ref&gt; died due to gun violence, and in 1996 it was five hundred and sixteen. The numbers continue to drop, however they were declining also before the gun law was in place.&lt;ref&gt;GunPolicy.org. 2016. ‘Calculated Numbers of Gun Deaths - Australia.’ ''Causes of Death, Australia, 2014''; 3303.0, Table 1.2 (Chapter XX). Canberra: Australian Bureau of Statistics. 14 March.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney Siege ===
On the Australia's most mediated gun violence-related incident since Port Arthur, was the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis|2014 Sydney Hostage Crisis]]. On 15–16 December 2014, a lone gunman, [[Man Haron Monis]], held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café. The perpetrator was on bail at the time, and had previously been convicted of a range of offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-15/sydney-siege-what-we-know/5967610|title=Sydney siege: What we do and don't know|date=2014-12-15|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11295658/Victims-of-Sydney-siege-hailed-as-heroes-after-they-die-protecting-hostages.html|title=Victims of Sydney siege hailed as heroes after they die protecting hostages|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year in August, the New South Wales Government tightened the laws of bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/firearms_and_prohibited_weapons_offences.html|title=Firearms and prohibited weapons offences|website=www.judcom.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Affray''''', a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Amphion class submarine|''Amphion''-class]] [[submarine]], was the last [[Royal Navy]] submarine to be lost at sea, on 16 April 1951, with the loss of 75 lives.  All vessels of her class were given names beginning with the letter A; she was the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named after a [[Affray|particularly noisy and disorderly fight]].

''Affray'' was built in the closing stages of the [[Second World War]]. She was one of 16 submarines of her class which were originally designed for use in the [[Pacific Ocean]] against [[Japan]].

==History==

===Early history===
She was laid down at the [[Cammell Laird]] yard in [[Birkenhead]] on 16 January 1944, launched on 12 April and commissioned on 25 November 1945. ''Affray'' and her sisters were state-of-the-art submarines at the time of their launching. They were the culmination of a rapid submarine development driven by the Second World War. Some elements of her design were taken from captured [[Nazi German]] [[U-boat]]s. Her modular style of manufacture and all-welded hull were unique at the time. For work in the [[Far East]] she was equipped with refrigeration and two huge [[Air-conditioning system|air conditioners]], and all her accommodation was placed as far away from the engine room as possible. She also had ten [[torpedo tube]]s which made her and her class some of the most formidable submarines in the world at that time.

She was sent to the submarine tender [[HMS Montclare (F85)|HMS ''Montclare'']] at [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]], as part of the [[List of squadrons and flotillas of the Royal Navy|3rd Submarine Flotilla]], before joining her sisters [[HMS Amphion (P439)|HMS ''Amphion'']], [[HMS Astute (P447)|''Astute'']], [[HMS Auriga|''Auriga'']], [[HMS Aurochs|''Aurochs'']] and the submarine tender [[HMS Adamant (1940)|HMS ''Adamant'']] in the [[British Pacific Fleet]]. The following four years ''Affray'' was on travel and took part in exercises all over the globe, visiting such places as [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Morocco]], [[South Africa]], [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].

===Modification===
On 11 March 1949 she was transferred to the [[List of squadrons and flotillas of the Royal Navy|5th Submarine Flotilla]] reserve and entered [[drydock]] to be retrofitted with a [[Submarine snorkel|snort mast]] (snorkel device)—a [[pneumatic]]ally raised and lowered steel tube which, when in the vertical position, worked as an air induction/exhaust emission device. Once vertical it was self-locking and drew air into the submarine at [[periscope depth]], permitting the submarine to charge batteries and run diesels for propulsion below the surface, allowing the sub to remain underwater. At the point where the air intake entered the pressure hull of the submarine there was a bulbous casting—set about half a metre above the hull, this housed the main induction valve. This very important casing was totally concealed and protected by the free flooding hull. The snort mast on the ''Affray'' was designed for both air intake and exhaust venting; this was later changed so the snort mast was an air intake only and the exhaust was moved to the rear of the conning tower. The snort mast had a float valve that would close automatically if the submarine dropped below periscope depth. In December of that same year ''Affray'' was sent to the [[Mediterranean]]; it was recorded during deep dives in this sea that she began "leaking like a sieve" and that the Admiralty class diesels started leaking oil.

In January 1951 ''Affray'' was transferred to [[Portsmouth]] Naval base to join Reserve group "G". In March she was brought out of reserve and Lieutenant John Blackburn [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] was appointed CO and given the task of bringing her and the new crew up to operational status.

===Loss===
On 16 April 1951, ''Affray'' set out on a simulated war mission called Exercise ''Spring Train'' with a reduced crew of 50 from 61. They were joined by one [[sergeant]], one [[corporal]], and two marines from the [[Special Boat Service]]; a commander (Engineer), a naval instructor, seven lieutenants in the engineering branch, and 13 sub-lieutenants. The last two groups were undergoing essential submarine officer training. This made her complement 75 in total. Her captain's orders were unusually flexible: the Marines were to be dropped off somewhere along the south west coast of England—the captain told the [[Admiralty]] he had chosen an isolated [[beach]] in [[Cornwall]]—come ashore and return under the cover of darkness. The exercise was expected to continue until ''Affray'' was due to return to base on 23 April for essential defect repairs including a leak in a battery tank. ''Affray'' left her home base at about 1600 hrs, and made normal contact to confirm position, course, speed etc at 2100 hrs, and indicated she was preparing to dive. The last ship to see her on the surface was the 'Co' Class destroyer [[HMS Contest (R12)|HMS ''Contest'']] returning to Portsmouth that evening. As they passed each other, both vessels [[Boatswain's call|piped the side]]. When she missed her 0800 report due the next day she was declared missing and an immediate search began.

===The search===
Shore stations called ''Affray'' all day and [[HMS Agincourt (D86)|HMS ''Agincourt'']] led a fleet of search vessels which eventually totalled 24 ships from four nations. The [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] 2nd Training Flotilla which included [[Castle-class corvette|HMS ''Tintagel Castle'']], [[HMS Flint Castle|''Flint Castle'']], {{HMS|Hedingham Castle|K529|2}}, and ASDIC ([[sonar]]) trials vessel ''Helmsdale,'' left Portland. Also out of Portland, they were joined by the submarines [[HMS Scorcher (P258)|HMS ''Scorcher'']], [[HMS Scythian (P237)|''Scythian'']], and [[HMS Sirdar (P226)|''Sirdar'']] all flying large white flags to distinguish them from the missing ''Affray''. ''Sirdar'' later sat on the bottom for six hours while the ASDIC boats familiarised themselves with the identification of a submarine sitting on the bottom. The codeword 'SUBMISS' was sent to all ships in the [[NATO]] navies to notify them of the fact the ''Affray'' was missing and all other ''Amphion''-class boats were confined to port pending investigation as to what happened to their missing sister. At the time ''Affray'' went missing it was such big news in Britain it relegated the first events that culminated in the [[Suez Crisis]] to page two of the national newspapers. There was some urgency in the initial 48 hours of the search as it was estimated the crew would not survive much longer than this if they had survived whatever had sunk the submarine in the first place. During the search a [[Morse code]] signal (via tapping on the submarine hull) had been received by two of the searching ships, reading "We are trapped on the bottom", but this did not help in locating the sub.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} After three days the search was slowed down and fewer ships were used to locate ''Affray''. In Britain, the missing submarine was getting a lot of publicity. Rumours abounded of [[mutiny]], and even seizure by the Russians. Meanwhile the Royal Navy continued its search. During the search many strange things happened. The strangest was a massive object found on the bottom by sonar; the search vessel, realising it could not have been ''Affray'' owing to its size, continued on—when it returned several days later to establish what it was, it had gone.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Another strange event was that the wife of a skipper of one of ''Affray'''s sister submarines claiming to have seen a [[ghost]] in a dripping wet submarine officer's uniform telling her the location of the sunken sub (this position later turned out to be correct)&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton-Paterson, James (1992).''Seven-tenths: the sea and its thresholds''. Hutchinson, p. 122. {{ISBN|0571229387}}&lt;/ref&gt;— she recognised him as an officer who had died during the Second World War, not a crew member of ''Affray''. As there were so many shipwrecks littering the [[English Channel]] (161 were found, most of them sunk during the Second World War), it was almost two months before ''Affray'' was located.

===Discovery===
On 14 June the primary search vessel [[HMS Loch Insh|HMS ''Loch Insh'']] made a sonar contact near [[Hurds Deep]], a deep underwater valley in the English Channel. It was the same location where an oil slick had been sighted at the same time ''Affray'' vanished and was in an area that had been searched before. [[HMS Reclaim|HMS ''Reclaim'']] arrived several hours later after an excited call from the Captain of ''Loch Insh'' who, as an ex-submariner, was convinced this was ''Affray''. A dive was made down to the contact and the diver reported seeing a long white handrail before being dragged along with the flow of the current. Due to the weather being worse than usual the crew decided to use the underwater camera that they had previously been skeptical of.  As soon as it was sent down the very first thing the camera picked up were the letters "YARFFA"—''Affray'' backwards. At last she had been found. She was {{convert|17|mi|km}} northwest of [[Alderney]], a lot closer to [[France]] than [[England]]. She lay slightly to port facing northeast in 86&amp;nbsp;metres of water, and during the next few months she slid a little more to port where she appears to have rested on a roughly 50 degree angle. Divers could find no evidence of collision or damage to the hull, [[Casing (submarine)|casing]] or bridge and it was noted that the search [[periscope]] and ANF radar mast were extended, indicating she had been at periscope depth when she foundered. However the snort mast had been broken and lay next to the sub attached by only a thin shred of metal. The hatches and [[torpedo]] doors were all shut and the two [[rescue buoy (submarine)|emergency buoy]]s were still located within the casing, although the after one could not have been released as the hinged wooden gratings retaining it had been wired shut (sadly, it was later discovered that it had been wired shut because it often broke free whilst the sub was underway). It was obvious that no attempt to escape had been made. The only external clue that the crew had done anything to rectify their dilemma was the bow hydroplanes being set to hard arise; the bridge telegraphs also were in the stop position. The snort mast was the only part of the submarine that was recovered, and it was later found to be of faulty manufacture. This may have contributed to the sinking of ''Affray'' (see below).

===Cause of loss===
There have been many reasons put forward as to what caused the submarine to sink. The snort mast was broken and lay next to the hull so initially it was thought that this had broken and flooded the submarine. After a detailed inspection of the snort mast itself, which showed no sign of being struck, it was thought that it was more likely that it had been broken when the sub hit the bottom (the snort mast was later tested and although it was found to be of faulty manufacture, tests indicated it should still have stood up to normal use). A [[battery (electricity)|battery]] explosion has also been suggested as a possibility. The Royal Navy had tried to scan the interior when ''Affray'' was first discovered using a primitive radioactive device. This yielded minimal information about the internal condition of the submarine, but it did seem to show that the internal valve for the snort mast was in the open position, which would indicate that at least one compartment flooded and some of the crew had drowned when she first hit the bottom (see [[USS Squalus|USS ''Squalus'']] for a similar situation). During this attempt one of the (pea-sized) X-ray pods was accidentally lost near the sub and the Admiralty decided against further attempts to establish why ''Affray'' sank, mostly due to the various dangers to any divers (one Royal Navy diver lost his life attempting to identify another sunken submarine during the search). A more recent theory put forward by a few experts is that the snort mast dropped below the surface and the float valve (described above) jammed or somehow failed to stop the water entering the sub. With up to 13&amp;nbsp;tons of water per minute entering the submarine this could have caused her to drop rapidly to the bottom. With a reduced crew and the trainees in the way hampering activities, there would have been a delay in stopping the inflow of water. By the time the valve was shut or the flooding compartment that contained the valve sealed off, there would have been so much water aboard that even blowing all her [[Ballast tanks|ballast]] would not have been sufficient to get her to the surface. Or if the flooded compartment/s included the control room, there would have been no one alive to blow ballast. It is also possible, with trainees on board possibly operating systems, that a problem with the clutch caused the ''Affray'' to accelerate into the sea bottom disabling some parts of the submarine that would have helped her rise to the surface.

===Re-visited===
Almost half a century after the loss, [[Innes McCartney]], an experienced [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] diver with a passion for sunken submarines, obtained the position of ''Affray'' from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and dived to the sunken submarine. He reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we descended down the shotline, a large dark shape emerged from the gloom. Little ambient light penetrates to 83&amp;nbsp;metres even on a good day on the edge of Hurd Deep and it was a while before we recognised the unmistakable shape of a submarine. She is a hugely impressive sight, sitting almost totally clear of a hard seabed, offering in excess of 10&amp;nbsp;metres of relief in places. Our lighting showed that she is now covered with [[Sea sponge|sponges]] and [[Sea anemone|anemones]], offering some welcome colour in the darkness. The first thing that struck me about the wreck was her sheer size. She is one of the largest submarine wrecks in the Channel and a diver is hard pushed to swim all the way around her on a single dive. She lies slightly over on her port side, with her bows pointing Northeast. She is not very heavily [[Fishing net|netted]] with only a few [[Lobster trap|craypots]] caught up around the hull. The wreck is in a very good state of preservation considering the 47 years she has been on the seabed. Her bridge is completely intact with speaking tubes, the projector binnacle and radio aerials all in evidence. On the side of the conning tower her navigation lights are present and the conning tower ladder is still in place. Her periscope shafts stand proudly upright and even the cables that ran between them are still there. Forward of the tower the foredeck is intact with the gun layers hatch clearly visible. I was keen to find the cradle in which the snort mast was located when in use. This was on the port side, aft of the tower and on our second dive on the wreck I found it. The base of the snort mast was still in place, with the area where the mast broke off clearly visible. On a later visit to the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]], I saw the base of the section of the mast that was raised. They would still fit together perfectly. The fore and aft hydroplanes are still in position and the external torpedo tubes on the bow are a very impressive sight. Aft of the conning tower, there is evidence of the salvage attempts made by the Royal Navy in 1951. The diving team discovered no other damage to the wreck apart from the missing snort mast. This is in accordance with the findings of the Royal Navy's investigation. She remains a significant and salutary reminder of our naval heritage. Very few divers in the UK have the experience and capability to undertake such a dive. This should ensure that the ''Affray'' remains undisturbed for posterity. She is a war grave and the final resting place of 75 naval personnel and this should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author=Innes McCartney|title=Lost Patrols: Submarine Wrecks of the English Channel|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this day,{{when|date=July 2017}} the crew are entombed in the submarine on the northern edge of Hurd's Deep. As of 2001, under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]], ''Affray'' was made a controlled site,&lt;ref name="SI2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2008 | work=Office of Public Sector Information | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080950_en_1 | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it illegal to dive her without a permit from the Ministry of Defence.

'''Henry Justin Allen'''  (September 11, 1868 – January 17, 1950) was the [[List of Governors of Kansas|21st]] [[Governor of Kansas]] (1919–1923) and [[U.S. Senator]] from [[Kansas]] (1929–30).&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/allen4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Allen was born in [[Warren County, Pennsylvania]], to John and Rebecca Elizabeth (Goodwin) Allen.  In 1870, his family moved to Kansas, where it settled in [[Clay County, Kansas|Clay County]].

Before becoming active in politics, Allen acquired ownership of newspapers throughout Kansas, beginning in 1894 with the ''Manhattan Nationalist'' in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]. He owned the ''Topeka State Journal'' with [[Arthur J. Carruth Jr.]] and William P. Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;"Topeka Journal is Sold; Stauffer Buys Paper Owned by Henry Allen and Partners," New York Times, January 12, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally forward-looking in his outlook, he hired [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] to design his home in [[Wichita, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="USA06072015"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bleiberg |first=Larry |date=June 7, 2015 |title=10 Great: Frand Lloyd Wright Homes |magazine=[[USA Today]] |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allen–Lambe House|Allen's home]] is the only residence designed by Wright in Kansas.

Allen was in [[France]] with [[William Allen White]] inspecting the facilities provided to Kansas soldiers of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] during [[World War I]] when his party nominated him for the office of governor.  During the campaign in 1918, Allen never spent any of his own money and learned about his nomination from a [[Paris, France|Paris]] newspaper.  He served from 1919 to 1923.

Allen expressed some admiration for [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini's]] policies in the 1920s and pushed through a similar industrial court provision.  When publisher [[William Allen White]] objected, he was arrested in a free speech battle.  White won the [[1923 Pulitzer Prize]] for his editorial "To an Anxious Friend," published July 27, 1922, opposing the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=William Allen White |publisher=Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame |url=http://www.kspress.com/view_hof_member.asp?ID=168 |accessdate=January 1, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the governorship, Allen was U.S. Special Commissioner for Near East Relief in [[Armenia]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and Southern [[Russia]].  In 1928, he was Director of Publicity for the Republican National Committee.

In April 1929, he was appointed to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the vacancy caused when [[Charles Curtis]] resigned to become [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Allen served from April 1, 1929 to November 30, 1930.  He ran unsuccessfully for the remainder of Curtis' term, and was succeeded by [[George McGill]].

Allen died in 1950 following a cerebral thrombosis in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery in Wichita.  Allen was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously inducted]] into the Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Henry J.

''For the animated series of the same name, see [[Horseland (TV series)]]''

'''Horseland''' is an [[online community]] and [[browser game]] where members took care of, breed, train and show [[horse]]s and [[dog]]s. Begun in 1994&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssLeisureProducts/idUSN0133295520081003 Hand Over The Controller, Girl Gamers Say]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], Horseland had grown to have more than 8 million&lt;ref name="corporate"&gt;[http://www.horseland.com/corporate.asp Horseland Corporate Information]&lt;/ref&gt; users who play from all over the world. Most of the players are females from age 10 to 22, although a number of adults play the game. In September 2006, [[Horseland (TV series)|an animated cartoon series based on the web site]] was launched in the United States. The cartoon is now distributed around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[DHX MEDIA SIGNS KEY SALES]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Horseland, a [[sim horse game]], grew out of a webpage dedicated to horses that launched in 1994. The original website featured bulletin boards and forums where members discussed their love of horses and participated in horse-themed role playing games. A system of gameplay soon developed, and Horseland LLC launched the Horseland game shortly afterwards. The Horseland game features the ability to create, own and train virtual horses that players can care for and compete in online shows. As the popularity of the game grew, the interest in Horseland spawned a new Junior Version, and later, a series of cartoons and short novels. In 2006, Horseland LLC partnered with [[DIC Entertainment]] to produce a [[Horseland (TV Series)|cartoon]] [[TG4]] based on the website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dicentertainment.com/press/details.php?90 DIC ENTERTAINMENT DEBUTS BRAND NEW ANIMATED TELEVISION SERIES, HORSELAND&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715224904/http://www.dicentertainment.com/press/details.php?90 |date=2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2008 Horseland released a revamped website that includes an interactive 3D world with customizable horses and avatars. A new store sells clothing and tack for the avatars. A 3D interactive world was introduced that allows players to ride their horses and chat with other people. There are new interactive 3D jumping shows. Alongside these changes, Horseland introduced micro-transaction pay model through Horseland "Coins" which they sell through a variety of pay options. Horseland also offers a "Premium Membership" which unlocks exclusive features in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/01/prweb1842424.htm Horseland Offers New Virtual World Experience]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horseland Junior Game==
[[Image:HorsleandJr MyHorse.png|right|thumb|150px|"My Horse" Horseland Jr.]]
The Horseland Jr. game was launched on September 1, 2006. This game featured characters from the Horseland cartoon. It was a very simplified version of Horseland World and suitable for kids younger than 13 years old. Graphics were simple and colorful, appealing to the younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/website-reviews/Horseland_2.html Horseland.com – Website Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Junior game was a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] based game similar to the World game in that players could create and interact with a virtual horse. Horseland Jr. let you select a horse (choosing from characters you'd also find in the Horseland cartoon series), pick the horse's name and the player name. Players could visit their horse in its stall, and care for it in a variety of ways (''shown in the image on the right''). The horse needed to be fed daily, exercised regularly, seen by a veterinarian and farrier, and fitted with tack.

There were simple jumping shows that players could enter for fun. During the holidays, Horseland released themed shows (e.g. Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc.). There was a leaderboard showing the scores of the last 10 people who entered the show.

In December 2008 the "Trail Ride" was introduced. This gave players the ability to actually ride their horse around scenes from the Horseland cartoon and interact with other players, including making friends and chatting restricted to an option of phrases. (''shown in the image on the right''). Horseland Jr. players could upgrade to the Horseland World game with parental permission.

The Horseland Jr. game was closed in February 2009. Players under 13 are now given a "Junior" account in the main Horseland game. Junior accounts are COPPA Compliant. They can't send or receive private messages, and can't chat freely.

== Horseland Game ==
The original game on the Horseland website was renamed from "Horseland" to "Horseland World" on September 1, 2006 when the Jr. game was launched. It was renamed "Horseland" in February 2009 when the Jr. game was closed. In the Horseland game, players buy and sell horses, find good stables to board their horses at, find a fair trainer, chat with friends, and participate in horse shows and have a homepage.

There was some controversy among the players after the October 28, 2008 changes. The change in currency from HLD to HLC was one of them. The value of 1 HLC is different from the value of one old HLD, so prices across the game were changed to reflect the new value. Horseland also removed the ability for Basic Players (free-accounts) to get free money. Players now earn money by playing games.

=== Mods ===
The game also consists of a group of people who "moderate" the website and take action against players who act inappropriately or are cyber bullying other players. These players will have a badge beside their name. Whether they are active or not, you will have to see their status updates. If anyone has any concerns or even questions pertaining to the game, they can reach a mod, who then in turn can attempt to contact Horseland themselves.

=== World ===
The world is a place where players can meet, chat and roleplay in a virtual world. The world has several different servers to accommodate many players, with a variety of places to explore. It is monitored by "moderators" who are there to prevent harassment, vulgar language, etc. There are groups of players who have formed a roleplaying subgame within Horseland, creating their own characters and acting as their said characters either in the world or through messages with other players. Roleplayers usually act out the role of a wolf, cat or horse, with many being inspired by the Warriors book series by Erin Hunter. Roleplaying in the world is often illiterate, however through messages players tend to be more detailed and literate. 
Everyone is represented in the world by an avatar that's created when one signs up. These avatars can be modified somewhat to resemble the player. For example, you can change the hair, eye and skin color.However,you can't change your avatar's gender. If a player has the right amount of money, they can customize their horses and avatar with a variety of clothing and tack, which can be purchased from the store. (''Picture of The World is shown on right.'')

=== Shop ===
The "Horseland Outfitters" shop sells tack and clothing to customize player and horse avatars. Tack can cost from 800 to 3750 coins, and clothing ranges from 530 to 4000 coins. Players may add multiple items to their cart and buy them all at once. They also sell horses and dogs for stables and kennels. All animals purchased at the shop are 3 years old. The price range is generally from 200 to about 350 coins. Players may buy crates and stalls for them. Also, shops sell food for players' animals, at a cost of 95 coins per bag of feed, which contains 100 daily servings for animals.  
[[Image:Horseland shop oct08.png|right|thumb|200px|Screenshot of the "Shop" section in Horseland]]

=== Points ===
Horseland is an escalating system of gameplay, where players strive to earn as many points as possible, both for their player account as well as their individual horses. Players earn points through the training of their horses or dogs. A single player can own many animals of varying breeds and descriptions. While there is no single point goal for their animals, the players are restricted by the trainable lifespan of their horses and dogs. While a horse or a dog can only participate in show training for a period of time, it can participate in ticket training its whole life. When an animal becomes too old for show training, it is offered the option of retirement. Most players do not retire their animals, as it creates "broken lines" where the horses' or dogs' records are wiped off the Horseland database and cannot be found again. However, horses can pass a portion of their earned points to their offspring if they breed before reaching retirement age, and thus an evolving system of gameplay continues through the lineage of the animals that players foster and maintain.
[[Image:Horseland jumping oct08.png|right|thumb|200px|Screenshot of the "Jumping Show" in Horseland]]
Points usually take time, depending on the points. The horse or dog must have all their checkups completed before they show.

=== Shows ===
There are 2 types of shows: Jumping Shows and Automatic Shows. Jumping Shows were added to the game in October 2008. Every player can start one show a week. The Jumping shows are flash based and interactive. A player literally maneuvers the horse around a jumping course using the arrow keys and space bar. The player receives the points immediately after he/she finishes the course. The owner of a jumping show designs the courses using different jumps and obstacles to design the classes in her show. The Automatic Shows are not interactive. In Automatic Shows, a player puts her horse on the list for a particular show then, over night, the winners of the show are randomly picked and points awarded.

=== Training ===
Horseland players can train their animals by "Show Training" or "Ticket Training." Show Training involves players entering their horses or dogs in shows where points are awarded the next day. As their animals gain points, the user will also gain "Player Points," which are equal to the number of points the animal gains. However, with every show, the animal's health bar decreases, limiting the number of shows a horse or dog can enter.

The other method, Ticket Training, is through the use of tickets that Premium players can purchase at the online store. One training ticket gives a horse or dog 30 points, without it affecting the animal's health. These tickets may be used on a player's own animals, or the player may choose to sell it as a service to other players. As it is a player-operated service, ticket prices can fluctuate depending on the seller. Horse tickets were removed from the game in October 2008, and re-introduced in January 2009.

Some players offer a service referred to as "point training". What they will do is train a horse/dog using one of the above methods to "x" amount of points for "x" amount of money. Generally, hiring other players to do such a thing will be more expensive than doing so personally.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding is an important part of the Horseland World game, through which a player can extend the capability of an animal to earn more points by passing a portion of the points earned by ancestors on to their offspring, giving that foal a higher starting point level.

Players can choose to breed among their own horses or with horses owned by others. The owners of the [[stallions]] control the breeding by having the option to accept or reject a "breed request" by another player. Mares can be bred once every 21 days, and [[stallions]] every 2 days (both from the age of 3 until the age of 21).

Breeding is tracked by the game, listing all ancestors of a horse still in play. Once retired, however, the information for that horse (name, age, points etc.) is lost and the offspring of that horse will lose that portion of their lineage and have what is referred to as a "broken line". Most players become very attentive to the tracking of blood-lines, so they often choose to not retire their horses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horselandhelp.co.uk/breeding.html Horselandhelp.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529092432/http://www.horselandhelp.co.uk/breeding.html |date=2006-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Different Types of Bloodlines and breeds ====

Crossbreeds (aka CB) are two different breeds that were bred together.

Overbred (aka OB) means that the horse/dog has a large number of offspring.

Inbred (aka IB) means that one horse/dog is in the pedigree more than once.

Broken-Lined (aka BL) means that the horse/dog's parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc.,cannot be found.

A horse that is either inbred, overbred, or both, is generally frowned upon. A horse or dog is less likely to be bought if this applies to it.

=== Graphics ===
Graphics are modified pictures and "layouts" designed by graphic makers. A layout is usually a manipulated image with the player's name and ID number on it, with text boxes for writing any information about the player and their services. Layouts require knowledge of HTML and photo-manipulation, often resulting in large sums of money being paid to the graphic maker. They are a popular and satisfying way of keeping homepages neat and interesting. These can be simple or complex, depending on the player's budget and needs. Graphic makers range from beginners who are experimenting with novice programs, to more experienced people using programs such as Gimp or Photoshop. People often have layout contests in which they offer a large sum of money to the winners. They choose the layout they like best and pay that person. They can also buy other layouts they like and award other prizes.

=== Economy ===
The economic system in Horseland evolved into a free, open market by players, originally beginning with the buying and selling of horses and items included by the Horseland game system, and eventually including services offered by the players themselves, such as home page design and artwork.

Players use "Coins" to buy most things in the game. Coins can be earned by playing mini-games, or purchased for real money. Horseland also offers a "Premium Membership". Premium Players are given a weekly income of 3,500 Coins and access to exclusive features like forum avatars &amp; signatures, featured listing in search results, dog training tickets, themed jumping shows, and the previously standard 100 classes/show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseland.com/help_hlw.asp#helptopic5 Premium Membership Details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the game itself requires players to purchase automated services, such as veterinary visits to maintain the health of their animals, elective services, such as the boarding of animals in privately owned stables and kennels, are handled by the players themselves.

Horseland allows players to dictate the price of their services and creates a natural division of labor, as some players elect to specialize their gameplay, by being "trainers" or "boarders", for example. The ability of open discussion on the Horseland Forum pages lends itself to players looking for and advertising services offered for players by players, and fosters a fluctuating open market.

==Horseland as a social network==

In addition to being a simulation game, Horseland also has many attributes of a [[social network]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/10/digitalmedia.web20 Social Networking Social Networking Sites for Young Children]&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of Horseland's social network centers around [[user-generated content]]. Each player has a homepage that s/he can alter with HTML or CSS. Players often create and "sell" design codes for homepages, turning the code over to other players in exchange for coins. "Professional" (a.k.a. "pro") photographs and illustrations for horses and dogs are also exchanged between players.
	  	
Players can communicate with each other through flash-based chat rooms, in-game messages, personal blogs, forums and the flash-based 3D world. An additional feature of the game are lists of "Friends" which highlight each friend's last status or activity in the game. Players can send digital cards (sometimes called "Love/Luff Cards") to their friends (the occasion for this can vary, from birthdays to holidays).
	  	
Unofficial clubs are popular. Players create their own clubs through creating a new account. (Note: this is different from the official Horseland Clubs.) These clubs are run in a similar way to a "official" Horseland Club: they hold contests, gather members, create logos (called "club cards"), and propagate campaigns.
	 	
Players can also run in Horseland "Official" sponsored clubs. Becoming the "President" of a club allows a players to control animals that are accepted and rejected from the club. The "President" sets their own registry for the club for their term, each term lasts for one month. Players campaign to become "President" by TV'ing (trading votes) with other premium players. Often players hold voting contests in hopes of luring other players to help them gain enough votes to win in the club. Players can also "buy" votes off of other players who do not want to trade their votes. This is sometimes a controversial topic, as players can become presidents simply by "bribing" other players with a lot of money, instead of voting for a more ideal president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">'''Jay H. Gordon''' (October 10, 1930 &amp;ndash; December 4, 2007) was a [[Vermont]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician who served as [[Vermont Auditor of Accounts|Auditor of Accounts]] from 1965 until 1969.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071211/OBITUARIES/712110332 Jay H. Gordon (Obituary)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231141736/http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071211%2FOBITUARIES%2F712110332 |date=2007-12-31 }}; ''[[The Barre Montpelier Times Argus]]'', December 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon was born in 1930 in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]]. He attended the Dean Academy in Massachusetts and later graduated from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1953. He subsequently earned his master's degree from [[New York University]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

While studying for his master's degree, Gordon worked as an auditor at Peat, Marwick Mitchell and Company. He was later a partner with Bliss, Lawlor and Company from 1959 to 1965.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In 1964, he married his wife, Joan, in Massachusetts. They had two sons.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Gordon then served as Vermont's Auditor from 1965 until 1969 under the administration of [[Governor of Vermont|Governor]] [[Philip Hoff]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Following his service as state auditor, Gordon served as a partner with the Jay H. Gordon accounting firm from 1970 until 1987. In 1987, he joined Smith, Batchelder and Rugg. In 1990, he became a professor of Accounting at [[Norwich University]] until his retirement in 2001.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

'''Laddie Boy''' (July 26, 1920 &amp;ndash; January 23, 1929) was an [[Airedale Terrier]] owned by U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]]. He was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. His father was Champion Tintern Tip Top.&lt;ref name="Fancy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toledogazette.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/famous-and-forgotten-toledos-laddie-boy-the-first-presidential-pet/ |date=August 6, 2012 |title=Famous and Forgotten, Toledo’s Laddie Boy, The First Presidential Pet |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814043256/http://toledogazette.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/famous-and-forgotten-toledos-laddie-boy-the-first-presidential-pet/ |archivedate=August 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented to US President [[Warren G. Harding]] by Charles Quetschke of Caswell Kennels and  became a celebrity during the Harding administration.&lt;ref name="Fancy"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dog Fancier|journal=The Dog Fancier|date=September 1922|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laddie Boy was a faithful dog. When the president played [[golf]] and hit a tree, Laddie Boy would run up to the tree and retrieve the ball. Laddie Boy had his own hand carved chair to sit in during [[U.S. Cabinet|Cabinet]] meetings. The [[White House]] held birthday parties for the dog, invited other neighborhood dogs to join, and served them [[dog biscuit]] cake. Newspapers published mock interviews with the dog. Laddie Boy was so famous, he even had a caretaker.

He was the first "First Dog" to be regularly covered in the national press.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_features/features_media/whha_history-background-topdogs.pdf |publisher=[[White House Historical Association]] |title=Top Dogs: Canines in the White House |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103000251/http://whitehousehistory.org/whha_features/features_media/whha_history-background-topdogs.pdf |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harding and his wife Florence shared a love of animals and the First Lady, also an advocate for the care of abused and neglected animals, soon began employing this handsome dog as a [[poster child]] for the national promotion of animal rights issues.&lt;ref name="Gazette" /&gt;

Purportedly, the dog howled constantly for three days prior to President Harding's death in August 1923 at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] in [[San Francisco]], knowing of his master's imminent demise. In memory of President Harding and honoring his former employment as a [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]], newsboys collected 19,134 [[penny|pennies]] to be remelted and sculpted into a statue of Laddie Boy. Harding's widow died before the statue was completed in 1927 and the statue was presented to the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="Tedeschi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-White-Houses-First-Celebrity-Canine.html |title=The White House's First Celebrity Canine |first1=Diane |last1=Tedeschi |publisher=[[Smithsonian.com]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110428144725/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-White-Houses-First-Celebrity-Canine.html |archivedate=April 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722297,00.html#ixzz2QsGGR8W |title=National Affairs: Again, Laddie Boy |newspaper=[[TIME Magazine]] |date=August 16, 1926 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding's death and the dog were commemorated in song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Laddie Boy, He's Gone |first1=Edna Bell (poem) |last1=Seward |last2=Seward |first2=George M.

After the president’s death in 1923, Florence Harding gave the Airedale to Harry Barker, her favorite [[U.S. Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent. She knew her poor health wouldn’t allow her to look after the dog properly. Harry took Laddie home to his family in [[Boston]], and the dog lived a very normal life and was much loved by the Barker family. Laddie’s death in 1929 was proclaimed in newspaper headlines across the country.&lt;ref name="Home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact vs. Fiction|url=http://www.hardinghome.org/fact-vs-fiction/|website=President Harding Home|publisher=President Harding Home|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life After Life''''' is a 1975 book written by [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]]. It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone [[near-death experience]]s (NDEs). The book presents the author's composite account of what it is like to die.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifton D. Bryant]] (2003).

[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3560722 Review: Beyond Death: The Rebirth of Immortality] ''The Hastings Center Report'', Vol. 7, No. 5 (Oct., 1977), pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of his collection of cases, Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs:&lt;ref name=hji/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*(a) an overwhelming feeling of peace and well-being, including freedom from pain.
*(b) the impression of being located outside one's physical body.
*(c) floating or drifting through darkness, sometimes described as a tunnel.
*(d) becoming aware of a golden light.
*(e) encountering and perhaps communicating with a "being of light".
*(f) having a rapid succession of visual images of one's past.
*(g) experiencing another world of much beauty.&lt;ref name=hji&gt;Harvey J. Irwin and Caroline Watt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E3EzxyOufbgC&amp;dq=attacks+on+parapsychology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s An introduction to parapsychology] McFarland, 2007, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Life After Life'' sold more than 13 million copies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/22/1079939578423.html Towards the light] ''The Age'', March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into a dozen foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Louis E.

==Reception==
Moody expected to be criticized, and of course he was. Some scientists have written that Moody's alleged evidence for an [[afterlife]] is flawed, logically and empirically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Beyerstein]]. (1990). ''Evaluating the Anomalous Experience''. In [[Kendrick Frazier]]. ''The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 43–53. {{ISBN|0-87975-655-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[James Alcock]] has noted that "[Moody] appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]]. (1981). ''Psychology and Near-Death Experiences''. In [[Kendrick Frazier]]. ''Paranormal Borderlands of Science''. Prometheus Books. pp. 153–169. {{ISBN|0-87975-148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] has written that Moody's evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analyses of his data. According to Kurtz "there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1991). ''Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz''. Transaction Publishers. p. 349. {{ISBN|1-56000-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever?

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M.

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

==Strategies ==
{{See also|Ageing#Prevention and reversal}}

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;...

Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011].

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]].

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

[[File:The LSTM cell.png|thumb|right|upright|The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell can process data sequentially and keep its hidden state through time.]]

'''Long short-term memory''' ('''LSTM''') units are units of a [[recurrent neural network]] (RNN). An RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an ''LSTM network''. A common LSTM unit is composed of a '''cell''', an '''input gate''', an '''output gate''' and a '''forget gate'''. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three ''gates'' regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

LSTM networks are well-suited to [[Classification in machine learning|classifying]], [[computer data processing|processing]] and [[predict|making predictions]] based on [[time series|time series]] data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and [[Vanishing gradient problem|vanishing]] gradient problems that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, [[hidden Markov models]] and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Among other successes, LSTM achieved record results in natural language text compression,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html#1218|title=The Large Text Compression Benchmark|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; unsegmented connected [[handwriting recognition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=A.|last2=Liwicki|first2=M.|last3=Fernández|first3=S.|last4=Bertolami|first4=R.|last5=Bunke|first5=H.|last6=Schmidhuber|first6=J.|date=May 2009|title=A Novel Connectionist System for Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4531750/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|volume=31|issue=5|pages=855–868|doi=10.1109/tpami.2008.137|issn=0162-8828}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[ICDAR]] handwriting competition (2009). LSTM networks were a major component of a network that achieved a record 17.7% [[phoneme]] error rate on the classic [[TIMIT]] natural speech dataset (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Graves|first=Alex|last2=Mohamed|first2=Abdel-rahman|last3=Hinton|first3=Geoffrey|date=2013-03-22|title=Speech Recognition with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks|eprint=1303.5778|class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 researchers from [[Michigan State University]], [[IBM Research]], and [[Cornell University]] published a study in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/MachineLearning/Baytasetal_PatientSubtypingViaTimeAwareLSTMNetworks.pdf | title= Patient Subtyping via Time-Aware LSTM Networks |website= msu.edu |accessdate= 21 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/patient-subtyping-via-time-aware-lstm-networks |title= Patient Subtyping via Time-Aware LSTM Networks |website= Kdd.org |accessdate= 24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kdd.org |title=SIGKDD |website= Kdd.org |accessdate= 24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study describes a novel neural network that performs better than the widely used long short-term memory neural network.

Further in 2017 Microsoft reported reaching 95.1% recognition accuracy on the [[Switchboard corpus]], incorporating a vocabulary of 165,000 words. The approach used "dialog session-based long-short-term memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/microsoft-speech-recognition-equals-humans/50999|title=Microsoft's speech recognition system is now as good as a human|last=Haridy|first=Rich|date=August 21, 2017|website=newatlas.com|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectures ==

There are several architectures of LSTM units. A common architecture is composed of a memory ''cell'', an ''input gate'', an ''output gate'' and a ''forget gate''.

An LSTM ''cell'' takes an input and stores it for some period of time. This is equivalent to applying the [[identity function]] (&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x)&lt;/math&gt; to the input. Because the [[derivative]] of the identity function is constant, when an LSTM network is trained with [[backpropagation through time]], the [[Vanishing gradient problem|gradient does not vanish]].

The activation function of the LSTM ''gates'' is often the [[logistic function]]. Intuitively, the ''input gate'' controls the extent to which a new value flows into the cell, the ''forget gate'' controls the extent to which a value remains in the cell and the ''output gate'' controls the extent to which the value in the cell is used to compute the output activation of the LSTM unit.

There are connections into and out of the LSTM ''gates'', a few of which are recurrent. The weights of these connections, which need to be learned during [[Supervised learning|training]], determine how the gates operate.

=== Peephole LSTM ===

[[File:Peephole_Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg|300px|thumbnail|A [[#Peephole_LSTM|peephole LSTM]] unit with input (i.e. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;), output (i.e. &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;), and forget (i.e. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) gates. Each of these gates can be thought as a "standard" neuron in a feed-forward (or multi-layer) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. &lt;math&gt;i_t,  o_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; represent the activations of respectively the input, output and forget gates, at time step &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

The 3 exit arrows from the memory cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to the 3 gates &lt;math&gt;i,  o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; represent the ''peephole'' connections. These peephole connections actually denote the contributions of the activation of the memory cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; at time step &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the contribution of &lt;math&gt;c_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; (and not &lt;math&gt;c_{t}&lt;/math&gt;, as the picture may suggest). In other words, the gates &lt;math&gt;i,  o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; calculate their activations at time step &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., respectively, &lt;math&gt;i_t,  o_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt;) also considering the activation of the memory cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; at time step &lt;math&gt;t - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;c_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The single left-to-right arrow exiting the memory cell is ''not'' a peephole connection and denotes &lt;math&gt;c_{t}&lt;/math&gt;.

The little circles containing a &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; symbol represent an element-wise multiplication between its inputs. The big circles containing an ''S''-like curve represent the application of a differentiable function (like the sigmoid function) to a weighted sum.

There are many other kinds of LSTMs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Klaus Greff |author2=Rupesh Kumar Srivastava |author3=Jan Koutník |author4=Bas R.

== Training ==
To minimize LSTM's total error on a set of training sequences, iterative [[gradient descent]] such as [[backpropagation through time]] can be used to change each weight in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to it. A problem with using [[gradient descent]] for standard RNNs is that error gradients [[Vanishing gradient problem|vanish]] exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. This is due to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}W^n = 0&lt;/math&gt; if the [[spectral radius]] of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than 1.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hochreiter.

Munich, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gradf&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2839938_Gradient_Flow_in_Recurrent_Nets_the_Difficulty_of_Learning_Long-Term_Dependencies|chapter=Gradient Flow in Recurrent Nets: the Difficulty of Learning Long-Term Dependencies (PDF Download Available)|last=Hochreiter|first=S.|first2=Y. |last2=Bengio|first3=P. |last3=Frasconi |first4=J. |last4=Schmidhuber|editor-first1=S.

This "error carousel" continuously feeds error back to each of the gates until they learn to cut off the value. Thus, regular backpropagation is effective at training an LSTM unit to remember values for long durations.

LSTM can also be trained by a combination of [[artificial evolution]] for weights to the hidden units, and [[pseudo-inverse]] or [[support vector machine]]s for weights to the output units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. | last2 = Wierstra | first2 = D. | last3 = Gagliolo | first3 = M. | last4 = Gomez | first4 = F. | year = 2007 | title = Training Recurrent Networks by Evolino | url = | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 757–779 | doi=10.1162/neco.2007.19.3.757}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[reinforcement learning]] applications LSTM can be trained by [[Reinforcement learning#Direct policy search|policy gradient methods]], [[evolution strategies]] or [[genetic algorithms]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

'''Mathghamhain''' (also spelled ''Mathgamain'' or ''Mathúin'' and anglicised Mahon) was an Irishman of the early 11th century. He was the son of [[Cian mac Máelmuaid]] and his wife Sadhbh, who was daughter of the [[High Kings of Ireland|High King]] [[Brian Boru]]. Through Brian Boru, Mathghamhain was a member of the [[Eóganacht Raithlind]], a dynastic line claiming descent from [[Eoghan Mor]], a 2nd-century King of [[Munster]].  Mathghamhain (whose name means ''bear-calf'') was killed at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014.

Mathghamhain's descendants eventually became sovereigns over territory in west [[County Cork|Cork]], notably around the [[Iveragh Peninsula]] and the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]]. Today, his descendants use the surname [[McMahon]],&lt;ref&gt;[1] http://www.mcmahonsofmonaghan.org/the_mcmahon_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahoney]], O'Mahoney, [[Mahony]], Maughon, Mahaney or O'Mahony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5058">'''Metapsychiatry''' is a [[Spiritual but not religious|spiritual]] teaching and form of [[psychotherapy]] developed by psychiatrist [[Thomas Hora]] in the second half of the 20th century. Hora described it as "a scientific method of healing and education based on metaphysical concepts of man and the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Hora, Dialogues in Metapsychiatry, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Metapsychiatry was inspired by Hora's dissatisfaction with what he believed was psychoanalysis's failure to account for human spirituality,&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell, page 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; and his observation that psychiatric healing was often temporary.&lt;ref&gt;Chervenkova, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a [[hermeneutic]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hora, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; with precise definitions of psychological terms and conditions, and what it calls “spiritual reality.”

Metapsychiatry borrows from [[Judeo-Christian]], [[Zen Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] religious traditions, along with theistic [[existentialist]] philosophy and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]];&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; similarities to [[Morita therapy]] have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Chervenkova, pages 70-72&lt;/ref&gt; While the teachings of Christ are central, metapsychiatry is not aligned with a Christian denomination, refrains from valuing historical and sacramental teachings, and makes a distinction between religious practice and spiritual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell, pages 77-82&lt;/ref&gt; God is perceived as "limitless, infinite and non-material."&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Its style originates with the assertion that “the meaning and purpose of life are to come to know reality,”&lt;ref&gt;Leach&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as “God”, “Love-Intelligence” or “Infinite Mind.”&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell, pages 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Study of metapsychiatry includes implementation of “the two intelligent questions”, which seek to distinguish between experiential and spiritual existence. The first question is "What is the meaning of what seems to be?" The second question asks "What is what really is?" The aim is a reorientation from a preoccupation with material appearances toward the apprehension of spiritual reality.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Metapsychiatry maintains that the problems of humankind are based in ignorance, and may be overcome through "Knowledge of the truth of what really is."&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell, page 80&lt;/ref&gt; Problems are viewed as psychological; answers are spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Menahem&lt;/ref&gt; Metapsychiatry holds that suffering is the product of self-confirmatory thought, the insistence on affirming one's existence, and that relief from suffering is realized through enlightened transcendence of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

The qualities of peace, assurance, gratitude and love (PAGL) are cited as indicating a state of spiritual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hora, pages 8, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''monito del monte''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "little monkey of the bush") or '''colocolo opossum''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinez|first=D. R.|year=1993|title=Food habits of the rufous-legged owl (''Strix rufipes'') in temperate rainforests of southern Chile |journal=Journal of Raptor Research|volume=27|issue=4|pages=214–216: 214|quote=The colocolo opossum (''Dromiciops australis'') was better represented during spring and summer than during autumn and winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dromiciops gliroides'', also called ''chumaihuén'' in [[Mapudungun]], is a diminutive marsupial native only to southwestern [[South America]] ([[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]). It is the only extant species in the ancient order [[Microbiotheria]], and the sole New World representative of the superorder [[Australidelphia]] (all other New World marsupials are members of the [[paraphyletic]] "[[Ameridelphia]]"). The species is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] and [[arboreal]], and lives in thickets of [[Chusquea|South American mountain bamboo]] in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] of the southern [[Andes]],{{sfn|Martin|Flores|Teta|2015}} aided by its partially [[prehensile tail]].{{sfn|Edge|2006}} It eats primarily [[insect]]s and other small invertebrates, supplemented with [[fruit]].{{sfn|Edge|2006}}

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The monito del monte is the sole extant member of the order [[Microbiotheria]].&lt;ref name=msw3 /&gt; It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by English zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1894. The [[Generic name (biology)|generic name]] ''Dromiciops'' is based on the resemblance of the monito del monte to the [[eastern pygmy possum]] (''Cercartetus nanus''), one of the synonyms of which is ''Dromicia nana''. The specific name ''gliroides'' is a combination of the Latin ''gliris'' ("dormouse", more generally "rodent") and Greek ''oides'' ("similar to"). The name ''australis'' in a synonym (''D. australis'') refers to the southern distribution of the animal.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=L.G.|title=''Dromiciops australis''|journal=[[Mammalian Species]]|date=1978|issue=99|pages=1–5|jstor=3504051|url=https://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-099-01-0001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1943 ''Mammals of Chile'', American zoologist [[Wilfred Hudson Osgood]] identified two [[subspecies]] of the monito del monte:&lt;ref name="osgood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osgood|first1=W.H.|title=The Mammals of Chile|date=1943|publisher=Field Museum of Natural History|location=Chicago, US|pages=48–50|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/21027#page/60/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''D. a. australis'' &lt;small&gt;F. Philippi, 1893&lt;/small&gt;: It occurs in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forest]] in southcentral [[Chile]].
*''D. a. gliroides'' &lt;small&gt;Thomas, 1894&lt;/small&gt;: It occurs in the northeastern [[Chiloé Island]].

==Phylogeny and biogeography==
[[File:Phylogenetic tree of marsupials derived from retroposon data - journal.pbio.1000436.g002.png|thumb|Phylogenetic and biogeographic position of the monito del monte relative to other extant marsupials]]
South American marsupials have long been suspected to be ancestral to those of [[Australia]], consistent with the fact that the two continents were connected via [[Antarctica]] in the early [[Cenozoic]]. Australia’s earliest known marsupial is ''[[Djarthia]]'', a primitive [[mouse]]-like animal that lived in the early [[Eocene]] about 55 million years ago (mya). ''Djarthia'' had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian, and this research suggested that the monito del monte was the last of a [[clade]] that included ''Djarthia''.{{sfn|Beck|Godthelp|Weisbecker|Archer|2008}} This relationship suggests that the ancestors of the monito del monte might have reached South America by back-migration from Australia. The time of divergence between the monito del monte and Australian marsupials was estimated to have been 46 mya.{{sfn|Edge|2006}}

However, in 2010, analysis of [[retrotransposon]] insertion sites in the [[nuclear DNA]] of a variety of marsupials, while confirming the placement of the monito del monte in Australidelphia, also clarified that its [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] is the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of that superorder. The study further confirmed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American lineages ([[Didelphimorphia]] and [[Paucituberculata]], with the former probably branching first). This conclusion indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America (along with the ancestors of all other living marsupials), and probably reached Australia in a single [[Biological dispersal|dispersal event]] after [[Microbiotheria]] split off.{{sfn|Schiewe|2010}}{{sfn|Inman|2010}}{{sfn|Nilsson|Churakov|Sommer|Van Tran|2010}} Fossils of another Eocene australidelphian, the microbiotherian ''[[Woodburnodon]] casei'', have been described from the [[Antarctic peninsula]],&lt;ref name = "Goin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goin | first1 = F.

==Habitat==
Monitos del monte live in the dense, humid forests of highland Argentina and Chile,{{sfn|Mcdonald|1995}}{{sfn|Nowak|Dickman|2005}}{{sfn|Lord|2007}} mainly in trees, where they construct spherical nests of water resistant [[Chusquea culeou|colihue]] leaves. These leaves are then lined with moss or grass, and placed in well-protected areas of the tree, such as underbrush, tree cavities, or fallen timber.{{sfn|Feldhamer|2007}} The nests are sometimes covered with grey moss as a form of [[camouflage]]. These nests provide the monito del monte with some protection from the cold, both when it is active and when it [[hibernation|hibernates]].

==Morphology==
Monitos del monte are small marsupials that look like mice. ''Dromiciops'' have the same dental formula as [[Opossum|''Didelphids'']]: {{DentalFormula|upper=5.1.3.4|lower=4.1.3.4}}, a total of 50 teeth.{{sfn|Feldhamer|2007}} Their size ranges from {{convert|16|-|42| g|abbr=on}}. They have short and dense fur that is primarily brown-gray with patches of white at their shoulders and back, and their underside is more of a cream or light gray color. Monitos del monte also have distinct black rings around their eyes. Their small furred ears are well-rounded and their rostrums are short. The head to body length is around {{convert|8|-|13| cm|abbr=on}}, and their tail length is between {{convert|9|and|13 |cm|abbr=on}}. Their tails are somewhat prehensile and mostly furred with the exception of {{convert|25|-|30| mm|abbr=on}} of the underside.{{sfn|Chick|2013}} The naked underside of their tails may contribute to increasing friction when the mammal is on a tree. The base of their tails also functions as a fat storage organ which they use during winter [[hibernation]].{{sfn|Chester|2008}} In a week, monitos del monte can store enough fat to double their body size.{{sfn|Feldhamer|2007}}

;Sexual dimorphism

At the end of the summer, female Monitos del monte tend to be larger and heavier than males. The tails of the sexes also vary in size during this time; females have a thicker tail, which is where they store fat; the difference suggests that females need more energy than males during hibernation. The sexual dimorphism is only seen during this time and not year-round.{{sfn|Chick|2013}}

==Reproduction==
Monitos del monte have a monogamous mating system. The females have well-formed, fur-lined [[pouch (marsupial)|marsupium]] containing four mammae. They normally reproduce in the spring once a year and can have a litter size varying from one to five. They can feed a maximum of four offspring, so if there are five young, one will not survive.{{sfn|Chick|2013}} When the young are mature enough to leave the pouch, approximately five months, they are nursed in a distinctive [[nest]]. They are then carried on the mother's back. The young remain in association with the mother after weaning. Males and females both reach sexual maturity after two years.&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;{{sfn|Spotorno|Marin|Tevenes|Walker|1997}}{{sfn|Brugni|Flores|2007}}{{sfn|Lidicker|Ghiselin|1996}}

==Habits==
[[File:Monito_del_monte_en_estado_de_sopor_invernal._(36391982075).jpg|thumb|right|A monito del monte in state of torpor.]]
The monito del monte is adapted to [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] life; its tail and paws are [[Prehensility|prehensile]]. It is largely [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] and, depending on the ambient and internal temperature, and on the availability of food, it spends much of the day in a state of [[torpor]]. Such behaviour enables it to survive periods of extreme weather and food shortage, conserving energy instead of foraging to no effect.

The animal covers its nest with moss for concealment, and for insulation and protection from bad weather.{{sfn|Chick|2013}}&lt;ref name="amm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monito del Monte|url=http://www.arkive.org/monito-del-monte/dromiciops-gliroides/|website=Widescreen Arkive|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Monitos del monte are primarily insectivores. They eat insects and other invertebrates they find on the branches of trees and cracks in bark, but during the summer they eat large quantities of fruit, especially mistletoe fruit.{{sfn|Chick|2013}}

;Seed-dispersing role

A study performed in the temperate forests of southern Argentina showed a mutualistic seed dispersal relationship between ''D. gliroides'' and ''[[Tristerix]] corymbosus'', also known as the loranthacous [[mistletoe]]. The monito del monte is the sole dispersal agent for this plant, and without it the plant would likely become extinct. The monito del monte eats the fruit of ''T. corymbosus'', and germination takes place in the gut. Scientists speculate that the coevolution of these two species could have begun 60–70 million years ago.{{sfn|Garcia|Rodríguez-Cabal|Amico|2009}}{{sfn|Amico| Rodriguez-Cabal|Aizen|2009}}

==Conservation==
For the past few years the number of ''Dromiciops'' has declined, and the species is now classified as 'near threatened'. Many factors contribute to the decline:{{bulleted list|its already limited habitat is constantly faced with deforestation and fragmentation;|the introduction of the [[domestic cat]], ''Felis catus'', is correlated with decrease in numbers of ''Dromiciops''| the creature is considered bad luck by natives – houses have been burned down after monitos del monte were seen inside;|  other people believe this marsupial is venomous or causes disease, though in reality they do not affect humans negatively.{{sfn|Feldhamer|2007}}{{sfn|Chick|2013}}}}

The monito del monte is not the only organism which will be affected if it becomes endangered. ''Dromiciops'' illustrate parasite-host specificity with the tick ''[[Ixodes neuquenensis]]''. This tick can only be found on the monito del monte, so it depends on the survival of this nearly endangered mammal.{{sfn|Feldhamer|2007}}{{sfn|Guglielmone|Venzal|Amico|Mangold|2004}} ''[[Tristerix|T. corymbosus]]'' also depends on the survival of this species, because without the seed dispersal agency of the monito del monte, it would not be able to reproduce.

Little conservation effort is being undertaken at the moment, but there are ecological studies being conducted in the [[Chiloé Island]] that might help future conservation efforts. ''Dromiciops'' has been found in the [[Los Ruiles National Reserve]] and the [[Valdivian Coastal Reserve]], which are protected areas in Chile.&lt;ref name=amm /&gt;

The '''Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology''', ('''POST''') is the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s in-house source of independent, balanced and accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/ |title=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST (rather distinctively) serves BOTH Houses of Parliament (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and equally the [[House of Lords]]) as a joint establishment, through output that is apolitical and of widely acclaimed value to Parliamentarians of all parties. Thorough quality-control ensures that [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Peerage|Peers]] can have confidence in its analyses should they wish to cite them in debate. These principles are reflected in the structure of [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#The POST Board|POST’s Board]] with members from the Commons and Lords together with distinguished scientists and engineers from the wider world.


==History==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year !! Event
|-
| 1980s || Office first suggested
|-
| 1989 || POST launched (with charitable funding). Among other support, the UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development raised funds to provide POST with its first in-house environmental specialist adviser.
|-
| 1992 || POST was adopted as Parliamentary body by both Houses of the UK Parliament and subjected to five year reviews.

The UK Parliament made POST a permanent institution in 2001, after Dr Ian Gibson MP, POST's Chairman, Lord Flowers - vice-Chairman and Professor David Cope, Director, presented evidence to the then House of Commons Administration Committee to support the decision, which was endorsed later by the House of Lords.
|}

Since 1939, a group of MPs and peers interested in science and technology, through the first parliamentary "All Party Group",   the UK Parliamentary and Scientific Committee&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceinparliament.org.uk/ |title=Parliamentary and Scientific Committee |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (P&amp;S), had encouraged UK Parliamentarians to explore the implications of scientific developments for society and public policy. As the UK economy became more dependent on technological progress, and the varied effects of technology (especially on the environment) became more apparent, it was felt that UK Parliament needed its own resources on such issues. Parliamentarians not only required access to knowledge and insights into the implications of technology for their constituents and society, but also needed to exercise their scrutiny functions over UK government legislation and administration. This thinking was also influenced by the fact that specialised parliamentary science and technology organisations already existed overseas.

P&amp;S members ([[Ian Lloyd (UK politician)|Sir Ian Lloyd MP]], [[Trevor Skeet|Sir Trevor Skeet MP]], [[Gerard Vaughan (British politician)|Sir Gerry Vaughan MP]], Lords [[Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet|Kennet]], Gregson and [[Brian Flowers, Baron Flowers|Flowers]] among others) visited already established organisations in the US, Germany and France, and this reinforced their view that modern Parliaments needed their own ‘intelligence’ on science and technology-related issues. Initially they asked the then [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] to fund such services at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but were asked first to demonstrate a real need. This led to the P&amp;S creating a charitable foundation to raise funds from P&amp;S members.

The parliamentary reaction was positive and led to the appointment of a first Director, Dr Michael Norton.  In 1989, POST was formally established as a charitable foundation, though not an internal part of Parliament.

POST had attracted more resources by 1992 and then recruited 3 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Permanent staff|specialist science advisers]] and began its [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Fellows|fellowship]] programme with the [[UK research councils]].

In 1992 the House of Commons Information Committee, supported by the House of Lords, recommended that Parliament should itself fund POST for 3 years, and a subsequent review in 1995 extended this for a further 5 years. This was the result of POST demonstrating real interest and demand from MPs and peers.

POST's financial reliance on donations from bodies external to Parliament, even those as prestigious as the Royal Society, had always slightly compromised the perceived independence of the office.

From 1997 the chair of the POST board was appointed by government Whips. Since then, chairs have been [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Dr Ian Gibson MP]] 1997-2001, [[Phyllis Starkey|Dr Phyllis Starkey MP]] 2001-2005, and [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Dr Ashok Kumar MP]] 2005-2010. Dr Kumar died shortly before the UK 2010 General Election.  Since then, subject to parliamentary approval, the Chair of POST has been Adam Afiyie, MP.

In 1998 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Professor David Cope]] took over as Director of POST. He guided the Office towards the goal of establishing POST as a permanent office of the UK Parliament - and dramatically expanded its staffing, wider links and more general recognition of its role as a special, distinctive, institution that the UK Parliament had agreed, enthusiastically, to endorse.

In 2001, both Houses decided that POST should indeed be established as a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution, funded exclusively by Parliament itself, through the two Houses, in a ratio of 70%/30%, Commons/Lords.

In 2009, POST celebrated its 20th anniversary with, among other events, a special conference, arranged by the Director, Prof Cope, on "Images of the Future".  The keynote participants were the Hon. Bart Gordon, Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology and Dr Jim Dator of the University of Hawaii Futures Research Centre, along with many other Members and staff of Parliaments across the world.

Because of the enthusiasm of Members of both Houses, POST had enjoyed a unique status within Parliament. It was from its inception attached administratively to the House of Commons COMMISSION (though always with its link to the House of Lords.)

This arrangement was intended specifically to distinguish the office and its functions from the Libraries of either House.  These conduct non peer-reviewed "studies", of varying quality.  POST - on the other hand - was expected to provide proactive analysis and options, freed from the immediate pressure of political or administrative expectations, trying to embrace futures thinking, and above all, to subject all its work to the most critical peer review analysis.

POST'S Director, Prof David Cope, returned to Cambridge University in 2012 and Dr. Chris Tyler was appointed by parliamentary authorities to a reduced role, which saw the fundamental rationale of POST as a "science and technology assessment" institution increasingly changed to one which more engaged with the ongoing debate on "science policy".

POST, from its foundation, had always been an institution "of", rather than "for" - science and technology -in other words - it did not in any way lobby for more public funds for scientific or technological research.  Dr Tyler, however, was closely involved with the "Campaign for Science and Engineering" - a UK body which does so lobby.  On appointment, he did not immediately resign his role in any lobbying body, and this continued seriously to undermine his perceived independence while head of POST.

Dr. Tyler left POST in 2017 for a secondary position at University College London.

The Acting Directorship of POST was taken over by a longstanding staff member, Dr Chandrika Nath, who was totally immune from any such lobbying role. In 2018, in a reconfirmed acknowledgement of POST's immutable science and technology assessment role, she was appointed Executive Director of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the highly prestigious intergovernmental organisation.

Dr. Grant Hill-Cawthorne (University of Sydney) became Head of POST from May 2018.  

==Activities==

===Science and Technology in Parliament===
Most parliamentarians do not have a scientific or technological background but science and technology issues are increasingly integral to public policy. Parliamentarians are bombarded daily with lobbying, public enquiries and media stories about science and technology. These cover diverse areas such as medical advances, environmental issues and global communications. POST helps parliamentarians examine such issues effectively by providing information resources, in depth analysis and impartial advice. POST works closely with a wide range of organisations involved in science and technology, including [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committees]], [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|all-party parliamentary groups]], [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], scientific societies, [[Think tank|policy think tanks]], business, academia and research funders.

===POST's aim===
POST's aim is to inform parliamentary debate through:
*Publishing POSTnotes (short briefing notes) and longer reports. POSTnotes can be downloaded from the publications section of the POST website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/publications/ POST Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Both focus on current science and technology issues and aim to anticipate policy implications for parliamentarians.
*Supporting select committees, with informal advice, oral briefings, data analyses, background papers or follow-up research. Committees may approach POST for such advice at any stage in an inquiry.
*Informing both Houses on public dialogue activities in science and technology.
*Organising discussions to stimulate debate on a wide range of topical issues, from small working groups to large lectures.&lt;ref name="Seminars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/ |title=POST Events |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Horizon-scanning to anticipate issues of science and technology that are likely to impact on policy

===How POST works===
A parliamentary board guides POST's choice of subjects. A team of advisers conduct analyses, drawing on a wide range of external expertise. All reports and POSTnotes are externally peer reviewed, and scrutinised by the board before publication.

POST's work falls into four topical areas:
*Biological Sciences and Health
*Physical Sciences and ICT
*Environment and Energy
*Social Sciences

===International activities===
POST is a member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] network, which brings together parliamentary organisations throughout Europe sharing information and working on joint projects.&lt;ref name="EPTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eptanetwork.org/|title=European Parliamentary Technology Assessment |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST also liaises with science and technology organisations across the world.

Between November 2005 to 2009, POST, collaborating with four of its sister organisations - at the [[Folketing|Danish]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish]] and [[Bundestag|German]] Parliaments - provided [[technology assessment]] services to the [[Science and Technology Options Assessment]] unit of the [[European Parliament]], in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]].

====POST Africa Programme====
From 2001 POST received a growing number of requests for advice from parliamentarians in developing countries. It became clear that a real need existed to strengthen capacity in developing country parliaments. In 2005, POST held discussions on this issue with the Gatsby Foundation,&lt;ref name="Gatsby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsby.org.uk/ |title=The Gatsby Charitable Foundation |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a special initiative to assist African Parliaments, and other organisations in their countries, in building parliamentary capacity to handle policy issues related to science and technology. At a time when there is growing awareness of the importance of science and technology in decision making, as demonstrated by, for example, the focus on science, technology and innovation at the [[African Union]] summit meeting in January 2007, this programme continues to contribute towards the overall objective of ensuring that parliaments have the capacity to scrutinise decision making processes and act as the national fora for discussion and debate on the broad implications of issues with a basis in science and technology. By sharing information and best practice with overseas parliaments and assemblies, the programme supports one of the primary objectives of the House: to promote public knowledge and understanding of the work and role of Parliament through the provision of information and access.

==The POST Board==
(Appointed 2010)

The POST Board oversees POST's objectives, outputs and future work programme. It meets quarterly. The Board comprises:
* 14 parliamentarians drawn from the House of Commons (10) and the House of Lords (4), roughly reflecting the balance of parties in Parliament.

* Representatives of the House of Lords and the Department of Information Services of the House of Commons.

===Officers===
*Chairman: [[Adam Afriyie|Adam Afriyie MP]]
*Vice-Chairman: [[Robert Winston|Professor the Lord Winston]]
*Head: Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne

===House of Lords===
*Lord Oxburgh, KBE, PhD, FRS
*[[Simon Haskel, Baron Haskel|Lord Haskel]]
*Lord Patel, KT, FMedSci, FRSE

=== Externals ===
*Professor Frances R. Balkwill, OBE
*Professor Sarah Whatmore, FBA
*Paul Martynenko, FBCS
*Professor Sir Bernard Silverman, FRS, FAcSS

'''Phenomenological life''' ({{lang-fr|vie phénoménologique}}) is life considered from a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and rigorously [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] point of view. The relevant philosophical project is called "'''radical  phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie radicale de la vie'') or "'''material phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie matérielle de la vie'').

== Definition ==

The philosopher [[Michel Henry]] defines life from a phenomenological point of view as that which possesses the faculty and the power "of feeling and experiencing oneself in each point of its being".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15, 23 et 80&lt;/ref&gt;

For Michel Henry, life is essentially subjective force and [[affectivity]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, cover page&lt;/ref&gt; — it consists of a pure subjective experience of oneself which perpetually oscillates between [[suffering]] and [[joy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; A "subjective force" is not an impersonal, blind and insensitive [[force]] like the objective forces we meet in nature, but a living and sensible force experienced from within and resulting from an inner desire and a subjective effort of the will to satisfy it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 138 et 218&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this phenomenological approach to life, in ''Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)''&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body, which is in principle insensible.

The word "phenomenological" refers to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which is the study of phenomena and a philosophical method which fundamentally concerns the study of phenomena as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; What Henry calls "absolute phenomenological life" is the subjective life of individuals reduced to its pure inner manifestation, as we perpetually live it and feel it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 46-70&lt;/ref&gt; It is life as it reveals itself and appears inwardly, its self-revelation: life is both what reveals and what is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

Life is by nature invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of a look; it reveals itself in itself without gap or distance. The fact of seeing does in effect presuppose the existence of a distance and of a separation between what is seen and the one who sees, between the object that is perceived and the subject who perceives it. A feeling, for example, can never be seen from the exterior, it never appears in the "horizon of visibility" of the world; it feels itself and experiences itself from within in the radical immanence of life. Love cannot see itself, any more than hatred; feelings are felt in the secrecy of our hearts, where no look can penetrate. 

Life is constituted of sensitivity and affectivity — it is the unity of their manifestation, affectivity being however the essence of sensibility (as Henry shows in ''The Essence of Manifestation'') which means that every sensation is affective by nature. Phenomenological life is the foundation of all our subjective experiences (like the subjective experience of a sorrow, of seeing a color or the pleasure of drinking fresh water in summer) and of each of our subjective powers (the subjective power of moving the hand or the eyes, for example).

In ''Incarnation, a philosophy of the flesh'', Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body which is as a matter of principle insensitive.

== Phenomenological vs. biological ==

This phenomenological definition of life is founded, then, in the concrete subjective experience we have of life in our own existence. It thus corresponds to human life. In ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Michel Henry writes about the other forms of life studied by biology and from which [[Heidegger]] derives his own philosophical conception of life: "Is it not paradoxical for anyone who wants to know what life is to go and ask protozoa or, in the best case, honeybees? As if our only relation with life was a wholly external and fragile relation with beings about whom we know nothing – or so very little! As if we ourselves were not living beings!"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'' (§ 3, p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition, however, fails to include living organisms that cannot experience themselves, such as plant life — unless one can find evidence of the existence of a certain kind of sensibility in them, as Professor A. Tronchet appears to suggest in his book ''La sensibilité des plantes (Plant Sensibility)'': "The protoplasm of plant cells, like that of animal cells, is endowed with irritability, i.e. a particular form of sensibility, thanks to which it is capable of being affected by excitations originating externally or internally".&lt;ref&gt;A. Tronchet, La sensibilité des plantes, Masson, 1977, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Truth of Life ==

Michel Henry explains in ''C’est Moi la Vérité. Pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity)'' what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls "the Truth of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth, which originates in Greek thought and which he calls "the truth of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 21-31&lt;/ref&gt; But what is truth? Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; 

The truth of the world designates an external and objective truth, a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us, i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows:&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 25-31.&lt;/ref&gt; when we look at an apple, it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way, when we look at a person's face, it is not the person in herself that we see, but only an image of her face, her visible appearance in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; According to this way of conceiving truth, life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised (for example) by the need to feed oneself or one's aptitude for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 58-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian thought==

In Christianity, Life is reduced to its internal reality, which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Considered in its phenomenological reality, Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations, small pleasures or great hurts, to experience desires and feelings, to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort, or even to think.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves, with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze, but only in us: we coincide with each of these abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation, and what it manifests is itself, in its feeling self-revelation&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 36-37 et 73&lt;/ref&gt; — it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is ''absolutely'' subjective — that is, it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain, for example, is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the ''absolute'' subjectivity of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true, it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation, and Life is what Christianity calls God.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another, but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities, and which illuminates the least of our impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary, it is that which is most essential for man, as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God, rather than losing himself in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon Gold Version''''' and '''''Silver Version'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Pokémon Gold Version'' and ''Silver Version''|ポケットモンスター 金・銀|Poketto Monsutā Kin Gin|"Pocket Monsters: Gold &amp; Silver"}}}} are [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Color]]. They are the first installments in the second generation of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' series]]. They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', a special edition, was released roughly a year later in each region. In 2009, Game Freak [[video game remake|remade]] ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] as [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']].

The games introduce 100 new species of Pokémon, and follow the progress of the central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master [[Pokémon game mechanics#Pokémon battles|Pokémon battling]]. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them and their [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] predecessors in order to fully complete the games' [[Pokédex]]es. The Johto Saga of the [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]] is based on the new region introduced in the games.

''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' were critically acclaimed upon release and they are considered by many to be the best games in the entire series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/27/ranking-six-generations-of-pokemon-games-from-worst-to-best/|title=Ranking six generations of Pokémon games from worst to best|date=2016-02-27|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gamerant.com/best-pokemon-games-rank/2/|title=Every Pokemon Generation Ranked|date=2016-06-10|work=Game Rant|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some of the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|fifth generation console gaming]]'s most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of [[Pokémon Red and Blue|their predecessors]] as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were at 23 million units.

On June 6, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] announced via a Pokémon Direct broadcast that the games would be re-released via the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] on September 22 that year in all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gold-and-silver-coming-to-3ds-virtual-cons/1100-6450589/|title=Pokemon Gold And Silver Coming To 3DS Virtual Console This Fall|last=Knezevic|first=Kevin|date=2017-06-06|website=GameSpot|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{main article|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Croconaw screen.png|left|thumb|The player's level 18 [[Croconaw]] battles a level 13 [[Snubbull]] in Crystal version.|{{Deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 30 November 2016}}]] --&gt;
Like ''Pokémon Red'', ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'', ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' are played from a top-down perspective, or third-person, with players directly navigating the [[protagonist]] around the [[fictional universe]], interacting with objects and people. As the player explores this world, he or she will encounter different [[terrain]]s, such as grassy fields, forests, caves, and seas in which different Pokémon species reside. As the player randomly encounters one of these creatures, the field switches to a [[turn-based]] "battle scene", where the Pokémon will fight.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162865p1.html|title=Pokemon Gold Version Review|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2000-10-16|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main goals within the games: following through the main storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Pokémon Master Lance to become the new Champion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/10.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide (page 10)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and completing the [[Pokédex]] by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pokémon by battling other Pokémon, which can be found in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating [[experience point]]s (EXP) and leveling up, characteristic and integral to all [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video games]], controls the physical properties of the Pokémon, such as the [[Pokemon statistics|battle statistics]] acquired, and the [[Pokémon moves|moves]] learned.&lt;ref name="IGNBasics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/basics.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide basics|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New features===
While ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' retain the basic mechanics of capturing, battling, and evolving introduced in ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'', new features were added. A time system was introduced using a real-time internal clock that keeps track of the current time and day of the week. Certain events, including Pokémon appearances, are influenced by this feature.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; New items were added, with some designed to exploit a new mechanic: Pokémon being able to [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Holding items|hold items]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/items.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide items|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new type of item able to be held was the [[List of Pokemon items|berry]], which comes in varieties and can restore health or cure status effects. Other held items can give boosts to the Pokémon during battle. More specialized [[Poké Ball]]s were introduced, which make Pokémon catching easier in certain situations.&lt;ref name="IGN3"/&gt; A new item called the {{nihongo4|Pokégear|ポケギア|Pokegia}} was introduced, functioning as a watch, map, radio, and phone, allowing the player to call other characters who offer their phone number. Trainers will call for a rematch and others will call about rare Pokémon that can be caught in a certain area.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt;

The games introduce [[Raikou (Pokémon)|Raikou]], [[Entei (Pokémon)|Entei]], and [[Suicune]], some new types of [[legendary Pokémon]] that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/5.html|title=Pokemon Old and Silver Strategy Guide (page 5)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be tracked by the [[Pokédex]] once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain [[Pokemon statistics|HP]] loss. In addition there is the possibility of encountering a [[shiny Pokémon]], which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ds/pokemon-diamond-pearl/news/shiny-pokemon-guide/a-2007091912145600054/g-2006100415372930075|title=Shiny Pokemon Guide|publisher=GamesRadar|first=Carolyn|last=Gudmundson|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new [[Pokémon types]] were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type.&lt;ref name="GameSpot1"/&gt; Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon (which provides an offensive strategy, formerly absent against Psychic-types), as well as having few weaknesses.&lt;ref name="IGNBasics"/&gt; In ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', new [[Pokémon moves|moves]] were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|first generation games]]. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the ''Special'' [[Pokemon statistics|stat]] into ''Special Attack'' and ''Special Defense'', which increased aspects of strategy.&lt;ref name="IGNBasics"/&gt;

With the introduction of [[Pokémon breeding]], Pokémon are assigned to one or two breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon.&lt;ref name="GameSpot2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemongold/review.html?page=2 |title=Pokemon Gold for Game Boy Color Review (page 2) |publisher=GameSpot |first=Frank |last=Povo |date=2000-02-03 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512191144/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemongold/review.html?page=2 |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/breeding.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide breeding|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
[[File:Horyu-ji60n4350.jpg|thumb|The older architectures (pictured is [[Hōryū-ji]] in [[Nara Prefecture]]) of Japan's [[Kansai region|Kansai]] and [[Tōkai region]]s inspired the setting of the Johto Region.]]
''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' are set in the region of '''Johto''', situated to the west of the Kanto region from the previous ''Red'' and ''Blue'' games, and three years after the conclusion of the previous games. The design of Johto was inspired by Japan's [[Kansai region|Kansai]] and [[Tōkai region]]s, with many of the region's temples and more traditional Japanese aesthetics finding their way into Johto.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As with the previous games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between [[Chikorita]], [[Cyndaquil]], and [[Totodile]], from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master.&lt;ref name="GameSpot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemongold/review.html |title=Pokemon Gold for Game Boy Color Review (page 1) |publisher=GameSpot |first=Frank |last=Povo |date=2000-02-03 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211234305/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemongold/review.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole one of the other Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths.&lt;ref name="ign1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/1.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide (page 1)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player also encounters the villainous [[Team Rocket]], having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory.&lt;ref name="IGN3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/3.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide (page 3)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much has changed in the three years following the events of ''Red'' and ''Blue''. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of ''Red'' and ''Blue'', who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/14.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide (page 14)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were first publicly showcased at the 1997 [[Nintendo Space World]] Expo in Japan, becoming the most popular exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, ''[[Pokémon High Voltage|Pokémon Yellow]]'', the new titles were announced to be more than a small upgrade to [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']]. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were designed for the [[Game Boy Color]], allowing them full color support and more detailed [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Holding items|held items]], an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time internal clock, and [[backward compatibility]] with the previous games in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/069/069956p1.html|title=Eye on Pokemon Gold and Silver|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-08-27|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an ''[[ABC News]]'' interview, president of [[Creatures Inc.]] Tsunekazu Ishihara gave insight into the brainstorming process for developing new Pokémon species. He explained, "The ideas for each of these monsters came from the imagination of the software developers at Game Freak who get these ideas from their childhood experiences, including from reading Manga, the name for Japanese comic books. Ideas come from scary experiences they had as kids, catching insects, and so forth. So from these experiences in childhood, these ideas for Pokemon came out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/074/074973p1.html|title=ABC News Pokémon Chat Transcript|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-02-09|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein as the Pokémon [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] of the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Red'' and ''Blue'']] versions, the exclusive Pokémon [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]] was implemented in the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' games but is only accessible after attending a Nintendo promotional event. The first official event offering Celebi was [[Nintendo Space World]] 2000 in Japan, in which 100,000 attendees would be awarded the rare Pokémon. In order to be selected, players had to send in a postcard to enter a lottery for one of 100,000 certificates of Celebi, allowing them to enter the event and obtain it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/081/081008p1.html|title=Serebii, I Choose You!|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-06-16|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]], Ishihara stated that ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' started development right after ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue#Development|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Green'']]'' were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime's]] [[Pokémon: Indigo League|first season]]. Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate was taken over by ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]''. Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took three and a half years was due to being a small team of only four programmers. 

===Audio===

[[Junichi Masuda]] composed his music on an [[Amiga]] computer,
presumably in a [[music tracker]] format, converted to MIDI data and converted again to the Game Boy Color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

The games were announced for release in Japan in November 1999 and at the same time a U.S. release date was estimated for September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/070/070278p1.html|title=Gold and Silver Get a Date|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-09-10|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo announced the release of the [[Pokémon Pikachu|Pocket Pikachu Color]], a full-color portable [[digital pet]] similar to the one released the year before. The unit was made compatible with ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', allowing the transfer of in-game currency known as "watt points". Pocket Pikachu Color was slated for release in Japan on November 21, 1999, the same day as the release of ''Gold'' and ''Silver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/071/071278p1.html|title=The Pocket Pikachu Color|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-10-15|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an officially licensed [[Pikachu]]-themed [[Game Link Cable]] developed by [[Kemco]] was set for release in Japan on November 18, 1999. The product functions like a normal Game Link Cable and consists of a yellow cable with a figure of Pikachu on one end, and a [[Poké Ball]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/071/071554p1.html|title=The Pikachu Link|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-10-26|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set its first production shipment for the games in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/070/070982p1.html|title=Prepping the Pokémon|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-10-04|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in [[Taiwan]], which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an excuse to limit shipment and keep the demand high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/071/071643p1.html|title=Quake Causes Pokémon Shortage|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=1999-10-28|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a precursor to the North American release, ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/075/075010p1.html|title=Pokémon 2000 at the Toy Fair|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-02-09|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]]s to resemble the new Pokémon [[Lugia]] and had them driven around the U.S.A. The vehicles had fins and tails attached to them and were painted with logos and images of the Pokémon franchise. In addition, they were equipped with a television set hooked up to game consoles which allowed spectators to play ''[[Pokémon Puzzle League]]'', ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', and ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/085/085323p1.html|title=Lugia Visits IGNpocket|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-09-21|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television series ''Pokémon GS'', based on the games, was announced to be a part of the fall lineup on [[Kids' WB]]. The show would feature the same protagonist [[Ash Ketchum]] in a new region with different Pokémon species from the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/077/077598p1.html|title=Pokémon GS to hit Kids' WB|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americanized names of the 100 new Pokémon were kept confidential by Nintendo, with the company releasing names periodically. The domain names 'pokemongold.com' and 'pokemonsilver.com' were registered for this very purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/085/085267p1.html|title=Pokémon Gold and Silver Sites Live|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-09-20|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such names released included [[Chikorita]], [[Lugia]], [[Ho-Oh]], [[Togepi]], [[Hoothoot]], and [[Marill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/079/079356p1.html|title=Pokémon Names Will Come|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-05-11|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000 Nintendo announced the official North American release date of ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' to be on October 16 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/079/079053p1.html|title=Pokémon Gold and Silver Release Date|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-05-08|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo started accepting [[pre-order]]s for the games in August,&lt;ref name="preorder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/085/085733p1.html|title=Huge Pokémon Numbers|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-08-29|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced that consumers who pre-ordered one of the games would receive a free [[CD-ROM]] with a Pokémon-themed [[web browser]] developed by [[MediaBrowser]] which featured floating Pokémon species and [[hyperlink|links]] to Pokémon sites. The application was available for download on the official Pokémon website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/085/085734p1.html|title=Pokémon Desktop Available|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-09-28|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games broke record sales as approximately 600,000 copies of them were pre-ordered in just two months, compared to ''Pokémon Yellow'''s number of 150,000.&lt;ref name="preorder"/&gt; As the release date neared, retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]] reported receiving shipments of games earlier than October 16, and opted to sell them immediately; first giving them to pre-orderers and then selling the leftover copies. The games were obtainable as early as October 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/086/086220p1.html|title=Pokémon Gold/Silver Out Early|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-10-11|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' continued the enormous success of [[Pokémon Red and Blue|its predecessors]], beginning the formation of Pokémon into a multi-billion dollar franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pokemon Franchise Approaches 150 Million Games Sold|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pokemon-franchise-approaches-150-million-games-sold-54940152.html|agency=PR Newswire|publisher=Nintendo|date=4 October 2005|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2000 roughly 6.5 million copies of the games had been sold in Japan.

We project sales of 10 million units total of these two games in less than six months time".&lt;ref name="bNET"/&gt; By 2010, the recorded sales of ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were at 23 million units sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5245005/pokemon-gold-and-silver-getting-ds-remakes |title=Pokemon Gold And Silver Getting DS Remakes |publisher=Kotaku |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' was met with critical acclaim, with many saying that the extended length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of [[IGN]] gave the games a "masterful" 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of [[GameSpot]], noting: "The first major addition to Pokémon GS is the presence of a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a "great" 8.8 rating.&lt;ref name="GameSpot2"/&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' listed the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of it combined as the sixth best [[Game Boy]]/[[Game Boy Color]] video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2008|title=Nintendo Power – The 20th Anniversary Issue!|volume=231|series=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=231|page=72|pages=|publisher=[[Future US]]|location=[[San Francisco]], [[California]]|type=Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were stated to be solid gaming additions that would please a large audience. "After playing the game dozens of hours, I really can't think of a bad point to make about ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver''. Nintendo and Game Freak have tweaked the original and built a sequel that's long, challenging and tremendous fun to play. There's a reason why Pokémon is so popular, and ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' is going to help the series move further into the 21st century", said Harris.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

===''Pokémon Crystal''===
{{main article|Pokémon Crystal}}
{{nihongo4|'''''Pokémon Crystal Version'''''|ポケットモンスター クリスタル|Poketto Monsutā Kurisutaru|"Pocket Monsters: Crystal"}} is an enhanced version of ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'', developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Color]]. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, North America on July 29, 2001 and in Europe on November 2, 2001.&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165402p1.html|title=Pokemon Crystal Version Review|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2001-07-30|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The plot and gameplay of ''Pokémon Crystal'' is largely the same as in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', although it holds new features. It is the first game to allow players to choose the &lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS--&gt;sex&lt;!--[[GENDER]]IS NOT THE SAME AS [[SEX]]--&gt; of their character, while previously the character was always male. Pokémon have animated sprites; for example, when a [[Cyndaquil]] enters battle, the flames on its back flicker. This feature was absent in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], but has appeared in all subsequent games starting with ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]''. In addition, a couple of subplots were added, one involving the [[legendary Pokémon]] [[Suicune]], featured on the front cover of the game,&lt;ref name="GameSpot Crystal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemoncrystal/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Breview&amp;page=2 |title=Pokemon Crystal for Game Boy Color Review |publisher=GameSpot |first=Frank |last=Povo |date=2001-07-30 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512190746/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemoncrystal/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Breview&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other involving the [[Unown]]. The game's biggest addition was the Battle Tower, a new building which allows players to participate in ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]''-like fights.&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"/&gt; The Japanese edition of the game was exclusively bundled with the {{nihongo4|Mobile Adapter GB|モバイルアダプタGB|Mobairu Adaputa Jī Bī}}, a device that allowed for connecting with other players via [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/135/135402p1.html|title=Pokemon Crystal Version Preview|publisher=IGN|first=Marc|last=Nix|date=2000-12-11|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Crystal'' was received well by critics, although many commented that there were just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver''. Craig Harris of [[IGN]] gave the game an "outstanding" 9 out of 10 stating, "The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to get if you aren't already one of the upteenth{{sic}} billion owners of the previous games, with ''Crystal''{{'}}s slight updates to the design and graphics. But there's not much in this edition that makes it a "must buy" for folks who already own a copy or two of the previous editions".&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"/&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the game a 34 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|script-title=ja:ゲームボーイ – ポケットモンスター クリスタルバージョン|language=Japanese|work=[[Weekly Famitsu]]|issue= 915 Pt.2 |page=109 |date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2018, ''Pokémon Crystal'' was released worldwide for the [[Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-crystal-virtual-console/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Quasi-identifiers''' are pieces of information that are not of themselves [[unique identifier]]s, but are sufficiently well correlated with an entity that they can be combined with other quasi-identifiers to create a unique identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6961|title=Glossary of Statistical Terms: Quasi-identifier|publisher=OECD|date=November 10, 2005|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quasi-identifiers can thus, when combined, become [[personally identifying information]]. This process is called [[re-identification]]. As an example, [[Latanya Sweeney]] has shown that even though neither [[gender]], [[birth date]]s nor [[postal code]]s uniquely identify an individual, the combination of all three is sufficient to identify 87% of individuals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Latanya. ''Simple demographics often identify people uniquely''. Carnegie Mellon University, 2000. http://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was introduced by Tore Dalenius in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dalenius, Tore. ''Finding a Needle In a Haystack or Identifying Anonymous Census Records''. Journal of Official Statistics, Vol.2, No.3, 1986. pp. 329–336. http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=23329&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, quasi-identifiers have been the basis of several attacks on released data. For instance, Sweeney linked health records to publicly available information to locate the then-governor of Massachusetts' hospital records using uniquely identifying quasi-identifiers,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23147">In [[physics]], '''quasiparticles''' and '''collective excitations''' (which are closely related) are [[emergent phenomena]] that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a [[solid]] behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting [[particle]]s in [[free space]]. For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]]. This "electron with a different mass" is called an "electron quasiparticle".&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]] or a hole band in a metal&lt;ref name="ashcroftandmermin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=978-0030839931|pages=299–302|edition=1st|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called [[electron hole]]s. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.

These particles are typically called "quasiparticles" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called "collective excitations" if they are related to [[boson]]s,&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name=Mattuck&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&amp;pg=PA10 	''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. "As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, electrons and [[electron hole]]s are typically called "quasiparticles", while phonons and plasmons are typically called "collective excitations".

The quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].

==Overview==

===General introduction===
[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).

Motion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''real'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.

In summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.

===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]
The principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei and 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In principle, the [[Schrödinger equation]] predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schrödinger equation in this case is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional vector space—one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.

One simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the "low-lying" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.

Quasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Nanophotonics'' by Motoichi Ohtsu, p205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&amp;pg=PA205 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material is characterized as having "several elementary excitations", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as "phonon-phonon [[scattering]]".

Therefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.

===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===
Usually, an elementary excitation is called a "quasiparticle" if it is a [[fermion]] and a "collective excitation" if it is a [[boson]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras" /&gt; However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name="Mattuck" /&gt;

There is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.&lt;ref name=Mattuck/&gt; A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: It is built around a real particle at its "core", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the "electron quasiparticle": A real electron particle, in a crystal, behaves as if it had a [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|different mass]]. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its "core". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.

However, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.

The problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered "real" by the standards of, for example, [[entity realism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gelfert, 'Manipulative Success and the Unreal', ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 17, 2003, 245–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Falkenburg, ''Particle Metaphysics'' (The Frontiers Collection), Berlin: Springer 2007, esp. pp. 243–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on bulk properties===

By investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the [[quantum fluid|flow properties]] and [[heat capacity]].

In the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming [[phonon]]s, and/or forming [[exciton]]s, and/or forming [[plasmon]]s, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.

===History===

The idea of quasiparticles originated in [[Lev Davidovich Landau|Lev Landau's]] theory of [[Fermi liquid]]s, which was originally invented for studying liquid [[helium-3]]. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and [[dressed particle]]s in [[quantum field theory]]. The dynamics of Landau's theory is defined by a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic equation]] of the [[Mean field theory|mean-field type]]. A similar equation, the [[Vlasov equation]], is valid for a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the so-called [[plasma approximation]]. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard [[collision]]s between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the [[entropy]] production, and generally take the form of a [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann]]-type collision term, in which figure only "far collisions" between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every [[mean-field theory]], involves a quasiparticle concept.

==Examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations==
This section contains examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. The first subsection below contains common ones that occur in a wide variety of materials under ordinary conditions; the second subsection contains examples that arise only in special contexts.

===More common examples===
{{see also|List of quasiparticles}}
*In solids, an '''electron quasiparticle''' is an [[electron]] as affected by the other forces and interactions in the solid. The electron quasiparticle has the same [[electric charge|charge]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] as a "normal" ([[elementary particle]]) electron, and like a normal electron, it is a [[fermion]]. However, its mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron; see the article [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"&gt;E. Kaxiras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ULXZwEJeElYC ''Atomic and Electronic Structure of Solids''], {{ISBN|0-521-52339-7}}, pages 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Its electric field is also modified, as a result of [[electric field screening]]. In many other respects, especially in metals under ordinary conditions, these so-called Landau quasiparticles{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} closely resemble familiar electrons; as [[Michael F. Crommie|Crommie's]] "[[quantum corral]]" showed, an [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] can clearly image their [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] upon scattering.
*A '''[[electron hole|hole]]''' is a quasiparticle consisting of the lack of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"/&gt; A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
*A '''[[phonon]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the vibration of atoms in a rigid [[crystal structure]]. It is a [[quantum]] of a [[sound wave]].
*A '''[[magnon]]''' is a collective excitation&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; associated with the electrons' spin structure in a crystal lattice. It is a quantum of a [[spin wave]].
*In materials, a '''photon''' quasiparticle is a [[photon]] as affected by its interactions with the material. In particular, the photon quasiparticle has a modified relation between wavelength and energy ([[dispersion relation]]), as described by the material's [[index of refraction]]. It may also be termed a '''[[polariton]]''', especially near a resonance of the material. For example, an '''exciton-polariton''' is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a '''phonon-polariton''' is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.
*A '''[[plasmon]]''' is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of [[plasma oscillation]]s (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).
*A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of its surrounding ions.
*An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole bound together.
*A '''plasmariton''' is a coupled optical phonon and dressed photon consisting of a plasmon and photon.

===More specialized examples===
*A '''[[roton]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the rotation of a fluid (often a [[superfluid]]). It is a quantum of a [[vortex]].
*'''[[Composite fermion]]s''' arise in a two-dimensional system subject to a large magnetic field, most famously those systems that exhibit the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptonline.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000053000004000039000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;bypassSSO=1 Physics Today Article]&lt;/ref&gt; These quasiparticles are quite unlike normal particles in two ways. First, their charge can be less than the [[elementary charge|electron charge]] ''e''. In fact, they have been observed with charges of e/3, e/4, e/5, and e/7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron Cosmos magazine June 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609005023/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they can be [[anyon]]s, an exotic type of particle that is neither a [[fermion]] nor [[boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys681 | title = Fractional quantum Hall effect: A game of five halves  | journal = Nature Physics | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | page = 517| bibcode = 2007NatPh...3..517G| last1 = Goldman  | first1 = Vladimir J  | year = 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Stoner excitation]]s''' in ferromagnetic metals
*'''[[Bogoliubov quasiparticle]]s''' in superconductors. [[Superconductivity]] is carried by [[Cooper pairs]]—usually described as pairs of electrons—that move through the crystal lattice without resistance. A broken Cooper pair is called a Bogoliubov quasiparticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Labov.html|title=Josephson Junctions|website=Science and Technology Review|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the conventional quasiparticle in metal because it combines the properties of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole (an electron void). Physical objects like impurity atoms, from which quasiparticles scatter in an ordinary metal, only weakly affect the energy of a Cooper pair in a conventional superconductor. In conventional superconductors, interference between Bogoliubov quasiparticles is tough for an STM to see. Because of their complex global electronic structures, however, high-Tc cuprate superconductors are another matter. Thus Davis and his colleagues were able to resolve distinctive patterns of quasiparticle interference in Bi-2212.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. E.

*'''[[Magnetic monopole]]s''' arise in condensed matter systems such as [[spin ice]] and carry an effective magnetic charge as well as being endowed with other typical quasiparticle properties such as an effective mass. They may be formed through spin flips in frustrated pyrochlore ferromagnets and interact through a Coulomb potential.
*'''[[Skyrmion]]s'''
*'''[[Spinon]]''' is represented by quasiparticle produced as a result of electron [[spin-charge separation]], and can form both [[quantum spin liquid]] and [[strongly correlated quantum spin liquid]] in some [[minerals]] like  [[Herbertsmithite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaginyan |first=V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41578">'''Secular morality''' is the aspect of philosophy that deals with [[morality]] outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include [[humanism]], [[freethinking]], and most versions of [[consequentialism]]. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as [[skepticism]] and [[virtue ethics]]. [[Greg M. Epstein]] also states that, "much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010&gt;

A variety of positions are apparent regarding the relationship between [[religion and morality]]. Some believe that religion is necessary as a guide to a moral life. According to some, this idea has been with us for nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|5}} Others suggest this idea goes back at least 2,600 years as exemplified in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gunkel, ''Die Psalmen'' (61986), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; According to others, the idea goes back as far as 4,000 years, with the ancient Egyptians' [[Maat#42 Negative Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|42 Principles of Ma'at]].&lt;ref name=42prinmaat&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior. The ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' however states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other".&lt;ref name=Childress/&gt;{{rp|401}} Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as [[Richard Dawkins]] (''[[The God Delusion]]''), [[Sam Harris]] (''[[The End of Faith]]'') and [[Christopher Hitchens]] (''[[God Is Not Great]]'') are among those who have asserted this view.

== Secular moral frameworks ==

=== Consequentialism ===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Utilitarianism}}
"Consequentialists", as described by [[Peter Singer]], "start not with moral rules, but with goals. They assess actions by the extent to which they further those goals."&lt;ref name=Singer2010&gt;
{{cite book 
  |title= Practical Ethics
  |edition= Second
  |last= Singer|first= Peter
  |year= 2010
  |publisher= Cambridge University Press
  |location= New York
  |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Singer also notes that [[utilitarianism]] is "the best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory."&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{rp|3}} Consequentialism is the class of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] holding that the [[wikt:consequence|consequences]] of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] describes a utilitarian [[science of morality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] viewpoint that holds that [[opinion]]s should be formed on the basis of [[science]], [[logic]], and [[reason]], and should not be influenced by [[authority]], [[tradition]], or other [[dogma]]s. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of [[authority]], [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sectarianism]], [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s.

=== Secular humanism ===
{{Main|Secular humanism}}
Secular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead [[Happiness|happy]] and functional lives.   It posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or [[God]], it neither assumes humans to be inherently [[Good and evil|evil]] or innately [[Good and evil|good]], nor presents humans as "above nature" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions.  Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

==Positions on religion and morality==
{{See also|Ethics in religion|Secular ethics}}
The subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based [[atheism|atheist]] and [[antireligion|anti-religious]] writers. These include [[Paul Chamberlain]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' (1996), [[Richard Holloway]]'s '' Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics'' (1999), [[Robert Buckman]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' (2002), [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[The Science of Good and Evil]]'' (2004), [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), [[Christopher Hitchens]]'s ''[[God Is Not Great]]'' (2007), [[Greg Epstein|Greg Epstein's]] ''Good Without God: What A Billion Nonreligious People ''Do'' Believe'' (2010), and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris's]] ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'' (2011).

=== "Morality does not require religious tenets" ===
According to Greg Epstein, "the idea that we can't be 'good without God'&amp;thinsp;" has been with us for nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|5}} Others suggest this idea goes back further; for example in [[Psalm 14]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] which according to [[Hermann Gunkel]] date to the exile period of approximately 580 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gunkel, ''Die Psalmen'' (61986), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; It states, "The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+14/|title= Psalm 14 - ESVBible.org|author= ESVBible.org|work= |publisher= Crossway|accessdate= 4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] famously declared [[God is Dead]] but also warned "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer|date=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This idea is still present today. "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name=Dixon2008&gt;
{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} For example, Christian writer and [[medievalism|medievalist]] [[C. S. Lewis]] made the argument in his popular book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that if a supernatural, objective standard of right and wrong does not exist outside of the natural world, then right and wrong becomes mired in the [[is-ought problem]]. Thus, he wrote, preferences for one moral standard over another become as inherently indefensible and arbitrary as preferring a certain flavor of food over another or choosing to drive on a certain side of a road.&lt;ref name=Lewis2001&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Lewis|first=C.S.|authorlink=C. S. Lewis
  |title=[[Mere Christianity]]
  |publisher=HarperCollins
  |year=2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–28}} In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Singer]] states that, "Traditionally, the more important link between religion and ethics was that religion was thought to provide a reason for doing what is right, the reason being that those who are virtuous will be rewarded by an eternity of bliss while the rest roast in hell."&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Proponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to ''justify'' moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in ''Mere Christianity''. [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], a political author and commentator with [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s [[Hoover Institution]], has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;
According to Thomas Dixon, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name=Dixon2008/&gt;

=== "Morality does not rely on religion" ===
{{Quote|"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death."| [[Albert Einstein]], "Religion and Science," New York Times Magazine, 1930}}

Various commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' states that, "it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=Childress&gt;
{{cite book

  | year = 1986
  | location = Philadelphia
  | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|400}} [[Bernard Williams]], an English philosopher, stated that the secular "[[utilitarian]] outlook"—a popular ethical position wherein the morally right action is defined as that action which effects the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people—is "non-transcendental, and makes no appeal outside human life, in particular not to religious considerations."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;
{{cite book 
  |title= Morality
  |authorlink1=Bernard Williams
  |last= Williams|first= Bernard
  |year= 1972
  |publisher= Cambridge University Press
  |location= Cambridge
  |isbn= 0-521-45729-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} Williams also argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|64–65}}

[[Socrates]]' "[[Euthyphro dilemma]]" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:

{{quote|"Some theists say that ethics cannot do without religion because the very meaning of 'good' is nothing other than 'what God approves'. Plato refuted a similar claim more than two thousand years ago by arguing that if the gods approve of some actions it must be because those actions are good, in which case it cannot be the gods' approval that makes them good. The alternative view makes divine approval entirely arbitrary: if the gods had happened to approve of torture and disapprove of helping our neighbors, torture would have been good and helping our neighbors bad. Some modern theists have attempted to extricate themselves from this type of dilemma by maintaining that God is good and so could not possibly approve of torture; but these theists are caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{rp|3–4}}}}

[[Greg Epstein]], a [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[chaplain]] at [[Harvard University]], dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good "because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright," adding, "To suggest that one ''can't'' be good without belief in God is not just an opinion&amp;nbsp;... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|ix}} This is in line with the ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' which states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref name=Childress/&gt;{{rp|401}} Others share this view. Singer states that morality "is not something intelligible only in the context of religion".&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Atheistic philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] stated that "there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief."&lt;ref name=Baggini&gt;{{cite book |title= Atheism: A Very Short Introduction|last= Baggini|first= Julian|year= 2003|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280424-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} He also states that "Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him.&lt;!-- "Him" is not capitalized in Baggini's work --&gt; That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse [[Divine command theory|divine law]] and punishment with right and wrong.&lt;ref name=Baggini/&gt;{{rp|37}}

Popular atheist author and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] remarked on the program ''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'':
{{quote|"I think our knowledge of right and wrong is innate in us. Religion gets its morality from humans. We know that we can't get along if we permit perjury, theft, murder, rape, all societies at all times, well before the advent of monarchies and certainly, have forbidden it... [[Socrates]] called his daemon, it was an inner voice that stopped him when he was trying to take advantage of someone... Why don't we just assume that we do have some internal compass?"&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/9692512.html|title=Hitchens—The Morals of an Atheist|publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]''|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Cambridge Humanists, July 2010.JPG|thumb|right|190px|Daniel Dennett says it is a "pernicious" myth that religion or God are needed for people to fulfill their desires to be good. However, he offers that secular and humanist groups are still learning how to organize effectively.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI/&gt;]] 
Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] says that secular organizations need to learn more 'marketing' lessons from religion—and from effective secular organizations like [[TED (conference)|the TED conferences]]. This is partly because Dennett says that the idea that people need God to be morally good is an extremely harmful, yet popular myth. He believes it is a falsehood that persists because churches are currently much better at organizing people to do morally good work.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI/&gt;  In Dennett's words: 
{{quote|"What is particularly pernicious about it [the myth] is that it exploits a wonderful human trait; people want to be good. They want to lead good lives... So then along come religions that say '' 'Well you can't be good without God' '' to convince people that they have to do this. That may be the main motivation for people to take religions seriously—to try to take religions seriously, to try and establish an allegiance to the church—because they want to lead good lives."&lt;ref name=DennettPOI&gt;

=== "Religion is a poor moral guide" ===
Popular atheist author and biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] state that those who work on the Sabbath&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/exodus/31-15.htm|title= Exodus 31:15|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|work= |publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}} Exodus 35:2 is similarly worded.&lt;/ref&gt; and those caught performing acts of homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/leviticus/20-13.htm|title= Leviticus 20:13|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|work= |publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing "right" from "wrong."&lt;ref&gt;

The well-known passage from [[Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', "If God is dead, all is permitted,"&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|63}} suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. [[Greg M. Epstein]] notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have "sinned" (such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Swaggart]]) "must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|115–116}} Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

=== Other views ===

Some non-religious [[nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[existentialism|existentialist]] thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and [[Absurdism|Absurdist]] philosopher [[Albert Camus]] discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which the [[protagonist]] accepts [[capital punishment|death via execution]] without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The atheistic existentialist philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] proposed that the individual must create his own [[existence precedes essence|essence]] and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.

Cases can also be seen in nature of animals exhibiting behavior we might classify as "moral" without religious directives to guide them. These include "detailed studies of the complex systems of altruism and cooperation that operate among social insects" and "the posting of altruistic sentinels by some species of bird and mammal, who risk their own lives to warn the rest of the group of imminent danger."&lt;ref name=Dixon2008/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Greg Epstein states that "sociologists have recently begun to pay more attention to the fact that some of the world's most secular countries, such as those in Scandinavia, are among the least violent, best educated, and most likely to care for the poor".&lt;ref name=Zuckerman&gt;

On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments were published in the [[Social Psychological and Personality Science]] journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spp.sagepub.com"&gt;Laura R.

'''Stephen J. Flesch''' (born May 23, 1967) is an American professional [[golf]]er and TV golf analyst.

Flesch was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and attended [[Covington Catholic High School]] in [[Park Hills, Kentucky]]. After graduation, he played golf at the [[University of Kentucky]] and turned professional in 1990.

Flesch finished in the top ten on the [[Asian Tour]] Order of Merit in 1993, 1994 and 1996. He won the 1997 [[NIKE Tour Championship]] to earn a [[PGA Tour]] card for the following season, only the second left-hander to win on what is now the [[Web.com Tour]]. His first win on the PGA Tour was the 2003 [[HP Classic of New Orleans]], but is probably best known for his come-from-behind victory at the 2004 [[Bank of America Colonial]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. He has been featured in the top 50 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], reaching a career high of 24th in 2004.

Entering the [[2008 Masters Tournament]], Flesch was ranked number 107 in the [[Official World Golf Rankings|world rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625195301/http://dps.twiihosting.net/wgr/doc/content/archive/2008/owgr14f2008.pdf Official World Golf Rankings] Week 14, 6 Apr 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After three rounds, he was in third place at eight-under, three strokes behind leader and eventual champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Playing in the penultimate pairing on breezy Sunday, Flesch posted a 78 to finish six strokes back, tied for fifth. This strong showing in a major tournament strengthened his world ranking by 28 slots, improving it to number 79.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625195303/http://dps.twiihosting.net/wgr/doc/content/archive/2008/owgr15f2008.pdf Official World Golf Rankings] Week 15, 13 Apr 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Flesch last played a full season in 2011, then missed the cut in the 12 events he played during the 2012 season. In 2015, he finished T7 at the [[Barracuda Championship]], his first top ten in four years.

Starting in 2015, Flesch became an analyst for [[Fox Sports]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">[[Image:Statistically Uniform.png|thumb|270px|SUS example]]
'''Stochastic universal sampling''' ('''SUS''') is a technique used in [[genetic algorithm]]s for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination. It was introduced by James Baker.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;
{{Cite journal | last = Baker | first = James E. | title = Reducing Bias and Inefficiency in the Selection Algorithm | journal = Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Application | pages = 14–21 | publisher = L. Erlbaum Associates | location = Hillsdale, New Jersey | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUS is a development of [[fitness proportionate selection]] (FPS) which exhibits no bias and minimal spread. Where FPS chooses several solutions from the population by repeated random sampling, SUS uses a single random value to sample all of the solutions by choosing them at '''evenly spaced intervals'''. This gives weaker members of the population (according to their fitness) a chance to be chosen and thus reduces the unfair nature of fitness-proportional selection methods. 

FPS can have bad performance when a member of the population has a really large fitness in comparison with other members. Using a comb-like ruler, SUS starts from a small random number, and chooses the next candidates from the rest of population remaining, not allowing the fittest members to saturate the candidate space.

Described as an algorithm, pseudocode for SUS looks like:

&lt;code&gt;
 SUS('''Population''', '''N''')
     '''F''' := total fitness of '''Population'''
     '''N''' := number of offspring to keep
     '''P''' := distance between the pointers ('''F'''/'''N''')
     '''Start''' := random number between 0 and '''P'''
     '''Pointers''' := ['''Start''' + '''i'''*'''P''' | '''i''' in [0..('''N'''-1)]]
     return RWS('''Population''','''Pointers''')

 RWS('''Population''', '''Points''')
     '''Keep''' = []
     '''for P''' in '''Points'''
         '''i''' := 0
         '''while''' fitness sum of '''Population['''0..'''i]''' &lt; '''P'''
             '''i'''++
         add '''Population[i]''' to '''Keep'''
     return '''Keep'''
&lt;/code&gt;

Where '''Population[0'''..'''i]''' is the set of individuals with array-index 0 to (and including) i.

Here RWS() describes the bulk of fitness proportionate selection (also known as "roulette wheel selection") – in true fitness proportional selection the parameter '''Points''' is always a (sorted) list of random numbers from 0 to '''F'''. The algorithm above is intended to be illustrative rather than canonical.

[[File:Heterochronism of adaptation.svg|thumb|400px|'''Heterochronism of supercompensation''': Different parameters require different amounts of time to recover after strain. [[Tendon]]s and [[bone tissue]] require considerably longer to adapt than muscle tissue.]]
In [[sports science]] theory, '''supercompensation''' is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/defining-supercompensation-training&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Supercompensation.svg|thumb|right|400px|Initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation]]
The [[physical fitness|fitness]] level of a [[human]] body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, parietal fitness  [[training]], recovery, and '''supercompensation'''.  During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph).  After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph).  Because the human body is an adjustable [[organism]], it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level.  Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph).  If there are no further workouts, this fitness level will slowly decline back towards the initial fitness level (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist [[Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911–1992)]] in 1949-1959,&lt;ref&gt;http://jap.physiology.org/content/jap/92/4/1378.full.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; this theory is a basic principle of athletic training.

If the next workout takes place during the recovery period, [[overtraining]] may occur. If the next workout takes place during the supercompensation period, the body will advance to a higher level of fitness. If the next workout takes place after the supercompensation period, the body will remain at the base level.

More complex variations are possible; for instance, sometimes a few workouts are intentionally made in the recovery period to achieve greater supercompensation effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrier|first=Bruno|last2=Robineau|first2=Julien|last3=Piscione|first3=Julien|last4=Lacome|first4=Mathieu|last5=Peeters|first5=Alexis|last6=Hausswirth|first6=Christophe|last7=Morin|first7=Jean-Benoît|last8=Meur|first8=Yann Le|date=2017-01-25|title=Supercompensation Kinetics of Physical Qualities During a Taper in Team Sport Athletes|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/ijspp.2016-0607|journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance|pages=1–24|doi=10.1123/ijspp.2016-0607|issn=1555-0265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relation between supercompensation and training programs ==
At a first glance, creating effective training programs might look simple. All you need is to determine the intensity level and how long it takes you to get to the supercompensation period. Afterwards, continue training with the intensity level that was determined previously and keep the necessary intervals between workouts required for supercompensation. However, things become more complex because training affects many different bodily functions and parameters.  Each bodily function or parameter has a different recovery time, a different amount of time needed to reach peak supercompensation, a different amount of time between supercompensation peak and return to base fitness.

The aforementioned functions and parameters are basic ones. [[Muscle strength]] and mass are complex parameters. For instance, [[muscle mass]] is a function of many different simple parameters.  For example, amount of glycogen in muscles is a basic parameter that influences muscle mass.

== Use of supercompensation in practice ==
In classical [[sport science]], the yearly (sometimes multi-yearly) period is divided to micro and macro cycles, where each microcycle is responsible for the development of a specific (sometimes several) basic training function and parameter, whereas macrocycles are responsible for the development of complex parameters/functions (such as muscle strength). During each microcycle, the resting period is the same as the amount of time needed for reaching the supercompensation stage of the current training parameter/function (also during such a micro cycle there shouldn't be any negative influence on the recovery of the main function). Such a training method will work only when the developed functions/parameters are non-related. Unfortunately, for muscle strength and mass this is not the case (functions/parameters are related). Therefore, for muscle strength and mass different approaches are needed. During a training cycle the intensity and volume of training varies, waves of different functions are overlaid so that until the end of the microcycle supercompensation of the main required functions is achieved.

'''Tache noire de la sclerotique''' ([[French language|French]] for ''Black spot of the sclera'') is one of the ocular signs of [[death]] in which a reddish-brown discoloration is transversely arranged across the [[sclera]]. It occurs when the eyes are not completely closed so that the sclera is exposed to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF1WTiX0nHEC&amp;pg=PA168 |title=Forensic Pathology for Police, Death Investigators, Attorneys, and Forensic ... - Joseph A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9183">''TechnoSphere'' was an online digital environment launched on September 1, 1995 and [[Server (computing)|hosted]] on a computer at a [[United Kingdom|UK]] university.  TechnoSphere, created by [http://www.janeprophet.com Jane Prophet] and Dr Gordon Selley, was a place where users from around the globe could create creatures and release them into the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, described by the creators as a "digital ecology."  Earlier incarnations of TechnoSphere didn't have the advantage of web-accessible 3D graphics, but was still governed by [[chaos theory]] and similar [[algorithm]]s that determined each creature's unique behavior based on their components and interactions with each other and their environment.  This online program was one of many digital [[artificial life]] simulations that evolved as the [[World Wide Web]] began to grow.  Many museums and classrooms found the tool to be a valuable complement to learning material on [[natural selection]] and [[ecosystem]]s.  The experiment operated online until 2002 and was unavailable until January 15, 2007 when it was launched again but as of November 2012 is again off-line.
[[Image:Technosphere4.jpg|thumb|right|361px|Part of the [[fractal landscape]] of TechnoSphere.  The trees were positioned with a seeding algorithm created by Gordon Selley.]]

== Description ==
TechnoSphere was a real-time, 3D simulation of an environment that was populated by virtual creatures.  Users across the globe had the capability to create their own creatures through a website.  TechnoSphere III, one of many incarnations of the original design, used an artificial life program and [[fractal landscape]]s, which were governed by a complex set of rules and algorithms that determined how the virtual ecosystem reacted.  The program was capable of modeling such concepts as simple [[evolution]] and [[carrying capacity]].  Despite limited available creature designs, no two would ever behave in the same way, due to chance interactions with its environment and other creatures.&lt;ref name="Prophet1"&gt;Prophet, Jane. (1996). Sublime ecologies and artistic endeavors: Artificial life and interactivity in the online project "TechnoSphere". ''Leonardo'', 29(5): 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, the virtual landscape of TechnoSphere consisted of 16&amp;nbsp;km² of terrain.  It was capable of supporting approximately 4,000 creatures,&lt;ref name="Leonardo"&gt;Leonardo. (2000). TechnoSphere III. ''L E O N A R D O'', 33(2).

(n.d.). TechnoSphere website. Available online: [https://web.archive.org/web/20041226133956/http://www.janeprophet.com/technoweb.html HTML].&lt;/ref&gt;  After the relaunch, it was explicitly stated that the software limited the number of creatures at 200,000.&lt;ref name="Technosphere website"&gt;[http://www.technosphere.game-host.org/info.htm The Information page on the Technosphere website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516114119/http://www.technosphere.game-host.org/info.htm |date=2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each creature's behavior was unique, no single event could have been predicted, though some significant patterns developed.  For example, even though there was no explicit [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] algorithm written into the program, creatures could be found organizing themselves into groups, most likely impelled by urges to mate and eat.  The programs that supported the website were scalable, and could be modified to support a larger or smaller community of creatures.&lt;ref name="Prophet1" /&gt;

=== Creatures ===
Users accessing the site were able to create their own artificial life forms, building [[carnivore]]s or [[herbivore]]s from a select few component parts (heads, bodies, eyes, and wheels).  Their "digital [[DNA]]" was linked to each component and the completed creature's attributes (speed, visual perception, rate of digestion, etc.) was determined by the combination of each feature's strengths and weaknesses—their "fitness for survival."  Once a creature design was finished, users would name their digital creature, tag it with their [[e-mail address]], and enter it into the digital environment.

There they chased or evaded each other, ate, grew, and mated.  They also produced [[offspring]], which were variants of the parents, sometimes incorporating aspects of both parents and other times favoring one parent creature's attributes over the others.  General behavior patterns had emerged, but it was difficult to predict what was going to happen based solely on a creature's design.  The one thing all TechnoSphere creatures did have in common was that they would all eventually die.

There was only one gender in TechnoSphere, so the creature that initiated mating was the parent that ended up carrying and caring for the offspring.  Creature behavior was directed by a set of algorithms called Creature Comforts, designed by Julian Saunderson.  It dictated, for example, that mating behavior ([[genetic recombination|recombination]] of digital DNA) could only be initiated if both creatures' hunger was at least 50% satiated.

When significant events occurred in the TechnoSphere, a user's creature would send brief email messages "home."  Users were also able to visit the website and view [[2D computer graphics|2D]] snapshots of their creature, check family trees, "world" statistics, and search for other creatures and their users.&lt;ref name="Prophet1" /&gt;

== Popularity ==
One report described the project's popularity by citing that the online version had attracted over a 100,000 users who had created 3,286,148 and growing creatures.  Over the years in which the website was operating, the growing popularity facilitated necessary updates to the server software and hardware, causing website downtime and often slow response times.

=== Museums and education ===
Many museums and educators found the digital ecology interesting and some teachers even used TechnoSphere as a teaching tool.  The technological innovations and digital images produced by the project were of such interest that temporary installations were put in at several museums, including the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (now the [[National Media Museum]]) ([[Bradford|Bradford, UK]]), [[Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre]] ([[Sydney]], [[Australia]]), and the Donald R. and Joan F. Beall Center for Art and Technology at the [[University of California, Irvine]] ([[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[California]], [[United States|US]]).  Museum visitors created creatures using [[touchscreen]] terminals and then released them immediately into the TechnoSphere. Once in the digital environment, the creatures could be observed within the world on a series of large projection screens, further expanding the popularity of the project.

'''The Monument to the Unknown Soldier''' ([[Arabic]]: '''نصب الجندي المجهول''') is a monument in central [[Baghdad]] built by Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo, based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, [[Khaled al-Rahal]], and constructed between 1979 and 1982. It was dedicated to the martyrs of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In 1986 the national square of Iraq, [[Great Celebrations square]], was built near the monument, and two other monuments were built close to the square in memory of the matyrs. In 1983, the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] on the River, was opened and in 1989 the newly built [[Victory Arch]] became the entrances to the square. The ''Unknown Soldier's Monument'' represents a traditional shield (dira¹a) dropping from the dying grasp of an Iraqi warrior. The monument also houses an underground museum.

==Background==

The ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was commissioned in 1979 and completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to build a number of public works that would help instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise [[Saddam Hussein]]'s reputation as a powerful leader. Saddam turned to  his favourite artist, Khaled al-Rahal, who did more than any other Iraqi artist to incorporate ancient motifs in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.xix&lt;/ref&gt; to devise the concept for the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251; Baghdad Writers Group, ''Baghdad and Beyond,'' Middle East Editorial Associates, 1985, p. 43; Borden, I. and Hall, R., ''The City Cultures Reader,''Psychology Press, 2000, p. 104; Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the construction of the ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,''  another colossal structure, the ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' (1983) was opened in the same area, and Saddam commissioned a third monument, the ''[[Victory Arch]],'' another concept, also by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity (commenced in 1983 and completed in 1989 after the sculptor's death). The three monuments form a visual and psychological unit, and all represent the pain and suffering of the eight-year war.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,''  p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The original concept was the work of Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal,&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art and Vulgarity in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. x and p. 74; Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010  p.120; King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; with the architectural designs developed by the Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo.&lt;ref&gt;"Marcello D'Olivo (1921 - 1991)," in ''Dizionario Bigrafico dei Friulani,'' [http://www.dizionariobiograficodeifriulani.it/dolivo-marcello/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument sits on top of an artificial hill, shaped like a low, truncated cone of 250&amp;nbsp;m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/unknown-soldier-dg.htm GlobalSecurity.org "Monument to the Unknown Soldier, Baghdad, Iraq"]&lt;/ref&gt; The monument itself consists of several elements grouped on the hilltop. The centrepiece is a cantilevered dome, 42&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, with an inclination of 12 degrees and made of reinforced concrete. The dome represents a ''dira'a'' (Iraqi shield) falling from the grasp of a dying warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., " Modernity and its Posts in constructing an Arab capital: Baghdad’s urban space and architecture, context and questions," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin,'' The Middle East Studies Association of North America, 2009, Vol. 42, No. 1-2, p.4; Simonowitz, D,., "Head Trips: An Intertextual Analysis of Later Architecture and Sculpture Under Saddam Hussein," ''International Journal of Islamic Architecture,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2012, pp. 61-81, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1386/ijia.1.1.61_1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the side of the dome, is a spiral tower, which is reminiscent of the minaret at [[Samarra]]. Its external surface is clad with copper, while its inner surface features a [[soffit]] finished with pyramidal modules alternating steel and copper. The promenade is covered by a semi-circular, flat roof supported on a triangular steel bracing. The roof is covered with a copper sheet and the soffit displays V-shaped panels of stainless steel and Murano glass.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded by slanting girders of triangular section that are covered with marble. Red granite, stepped platforms of elliptical form lead to the dome and cubic sculpture. The steel flagpole is entirely covered with [[Murano glass]] panels fixed on stainless steel arms and displaying the national flag colours.

Beneath the shield is a cube, made of seven layers of metal, said to represent the seven levels of [[Heaven|Jannah]] in the Islamic faith.  Inside the layers of metal are sheets of red acrylic, said to represent the blood of the slain Iraqi soldiers.  The cube itself is connected to the underground museum by a long shaft with windows that allow light to shine in from above. Inside the museum, visitors can look up at the ceiling and see through the openings leading to the cube above.

The monument appeared on the [[Iraqi dinar]] bank-note in the 1990-2003 series (pictured).

The 1982 ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was not the first of such monuments to be constructed in Baghdad. In 1959, an arched monument to the Unknown Soldier was erected in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. It was designed by Iraqi architect, [[Rifat Chadirji]], and was a modern adaption of the [[Taq Kasra|arch of Ctesiphon]] in the ancient capital of the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century," University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sketches of the design found at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, reveal the inspiration for the design which represents a mother bending over to pick up her martyred child.&lt;ref&gt;Younis, A., "Monuments (by) Architects (for) Governments," ''Di'van,'' December, 2016, pp 78-87; "Before Monument to the Unknown Soldier (1980-) there was the Unknown Soldier Monument (1961-1982)," ''Isqeena Magazine,'' 25 August, 2013, [http://isqineeha.tumblr.com/post/59363871467/before-monument-to-the-unknown-soldier Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a simple, symbolic, modernist structure, a comparison between the original and its later replacement illustrates the increasing level of abstraction and sophistication in Iraqi art during the period. 

The original was removed from al-Fardous Square to make way for a statue of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s. The replacement statue was destroyed by the American forces after they captured Baghdad in 2003 while the world watched via television.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reports that Chadirji had been invited to rebuild the monument circulated for many years, but no progress has been evident, and the elderly Chadirji has since emigrated to England, where he lives with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/05/03/71903.html "Famed Iraqi architect rebuilds Baghdad landmark"] Al Arabiya News, November 2, 2010, retrieved September 20 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living''''' is an artwork created in 1991 by [[Damien Hirst]], an English artist and a leading member of the "[[Young British Artists]]" (or YBA). It consists of a [[tiger shark]] preserved in [[formaldehyde]] in a [[Display case|vitrine]]. It was originally commissioned in 1991 by [[Charles Saatchi]], who sold it in 2004, to [[Steven A. Cohen]] for an undisclosed amount, widely reported to have been at least $8 million. However, the title of Don Thompson's book, ''The $12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art'', suggests a higher figure.

Owing to deterioration of the original {{convert|14|ft|adj=on}} [[tiger shark]], it was replaced with a new specimen in 2006. It was on loan to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite news|first=Roberta|last=Smith|title=Just When You Thought It Was Safe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/arts/design/16muse.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered the iconic work of British art in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;Brooks, Richard.

Retrieved 27 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and concept==
The work was funded by [[Charles Saatchi]], who in 1991 had offered to pay for whatever artwork Hirst wanted to create. The shark itself cost Hirst [[Pound sterling|£]]6,000&lt;ref name=oz&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/the-great-white-art-hunter/story-e6frg8h6-1226324791182|title=The great white art hunter|first=Kerrie|last=Davies|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the total cost of the work was £50,000.&lt;ref name=mulls&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4120893.stm "Saatchi mulls £6.25m shark offer"], BBC.

{{Multiple image|footer=''Death Denied'' (2008) part of a later artwork, exhibited in Kiev|footer_align=center|align=right|image1=Shark84.JPG|image2=Shark83.JPG}}
It was first exhibited in 1992 in the first of a series of ''Young British Artists'' shows at the [[Saatchi Gallery]], then at its premises in [[St John's Wood]], north London. The British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran a story titled "£50,000 for fish without chips."&lt;ref name=swim&gt;Vogel, Carol [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/arts/design/01voge.html?ex=1317355200&amp;en=6fcefeb8359f9748&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Swimming with famous dead sharks,2] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 October 2006. Retrieved 23 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The show also included Hirst's artwork ''A Thousand Years''. He was then nominated for the [[Turner Prize]], but it was awarded to [[Grenville Davey]]. Saatchi sold the work in 2004 to [[Steven A. Cohen]] for an estimated $8 million.&lt;ref name=swim/&gt;

Its technical specifications are: "Tiger shark, glass, steel, 5% formaldehyde solution, 213 × 518 × 213&amp;nbsp;cm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/h/hirst/hirst_impossibility.jpg.html "Damien Hirst"], The Artchive. Retrieved 23 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2007 gave the following description of the artwork:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Hirst often aims to fry the mind (and misses more than he hits), but he does so by setting up direct, often visceral experiences, of which the shark remains the most outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;

In keeping with the piece's title, the shark is simultaneously life and death incarnate in a way you don't quite grasp until you see it, suspended and silent, in its tank. It gives the innately demonic urge to live a demonic, deathlike form.&lt;ref name=RS /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decay and replacement==
Because the shark was initially preserved poorly, it began to deteriorate and the surrounding liquid grew murky. Hirst attributes some of the decay to the fact that the [[Saatchi Gallery]] had added bleach to it.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; In 1993 the gallery gutted the shark and stretched its skin over a fiberglass mold, and Hirst commented, "It didn't look as frightening ... You could tell it wasn't real. It had no weight."&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; When Hirst learned of Saatchi's impending sale of the work to Cohen, he offered to replace the shark, an operation which Cohen then funded, calling the expense "inconsequential" (the formaldehyde process alone cost around $100,000).&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; Another shark was caught off Queensland (a female aged about 25&amp;ndash;30 years, equivalent to middle age) and shipped to Hirst in a 2-month journey.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; Oliver Crimmen, a scientist and fish curator at London's [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], assisted with the preservation of the new specimen in 2006.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; This involved injecting [[formaldehyde]] into the body, as well as soaking it for two weeks in a bath of 7% formalin solution.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt; The original 1991 vitrine was then used to house it.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt;

A [[Ship of Theseus|philosophical question]] was acknowledged by Hirst, as to whether the replacement shark meant that the result could still be considered the same artwork. He observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a big dilemma. Artists and conservators have different opinions about what's important: the original artwork or the original intention. I come from a [[conceptual art]] background, so I think it should be the intention. It's the same piece. But the jury will be out for a long time to come.&lt;ref name=swim /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Variants==

Hirst has made other works subsequently which also feature a preserved shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

In a speech at the [[Royal Academy]] in 2004, art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] used ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' as a prime example of how the international art market at the time was a "cultural obscenity". Without naming the artwork or the artist, he stated that brush marks in the lace collar of a painting by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] could be more radical than a shark "murkily disintegrating in its tank on the other side of the Thames".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1230221,00.html "Art market a 'cultural obscenity'"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 June 2004.

'''''Time Indefinite''''' is an autobiographical 1993 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Ross McElwee]]. It explores themes of [[grief]], mortality, and the convenient disconnection of watching life through a camera lens.

The title comes from a passage from the [[Bible]] mentioned by a visiting [[Jehovah's Witness]]. McElwee is filming the interaction and focused on adjusting the exposure to try to catch the play of light over the man's face; distracted, he "hears" the phrase about 30 seconds after the man says it and understands it to refer to the unpredictable imminence of death.

==Plot==

In the film, director Ross McElwee gets married, finally putting an end to his family's worrying; his grandmother dies; his wife Marilyn has a miscarriage; and his father, a medical doctor, dies suddenly within a week of McElwee's wife's miscarriage. His mother had died of [[cancer]] ten years earlier and so McElwee returns to his father's house, where his father's housekeeper ministers to him about [[Christianity]] and [[faith]].

McElwee goes to visit his friend Charleen, who is now living alone in a new apartment. She had lived on an island in an old two-story house abandoned by the [[U.S. Army]]; she and her husband worked to restore it and lived together there for years before becoming estranged. Charleen then lived there alone, but on returning home from a trip she finds that her husband has set fire to the house and died downstairs at the grand [[piano]] in an [[arson]]/[[suicide]]. Charleen has her husband's [[cremation|cremated]] remains in a bag inside a box and tries to get rid of them but can't bring herself to do it.

McElwee's brother is a successful doctor; on a visit to his brother's practice, Ross talks with his brother about their father's death, which took them both by surprise. Ross's brother receives a patient who has a large malignant tumor on her breast; the woman has had the tumor for years without seeking medical help. Ross's brother takes a slide of the tumor for his files; it has spread across much of her chest and is both multifaceted and multicolored. Ross incorporates his brother's interview with the woman—and the slide his brother takes—into his film, musing in [[voiceover]] about motivation and fatality and marvelling at the power of denial.

Eventually Ross abandons the film, only to continue it later: his wife is pregnant. The pregnancy comes to term and Ross and Marilyn go with their baby son to visit Charleen, who criticizes them for bringing children into such a hostile and unpredictable world but speaks to the passion that drives life and procreation. Ross and Marilyn dote on their son and seem largely unbothered by the criticism.

Having been bullied as a student, he had died but was turned into a [[revenant]], a powerful vengeful spirit, by his friend, a necromancer named Sayoko. Assisted by Tōta and his friends, Santa stops Sayoko's plan and restores her to her original self, but she passes away soon after. Santa then joins UQ Holder as member number 12.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 43-56}}

: Tōta's grandfather. After his adventures in ''Negima'', Negi helped his former teacher, Yukihime, form UQ Holder and made a name for himself in the magical world where he is known as "The Greatest Mage."

Unlike his former master and grandson, Negi possesses a complete version of Magia Erebea. He is eventually revealed to have been possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who is slowly locking away his soul and gaining control of his body. It is also revealed in a video recording by Chamo that Negi confessed his love to Chisame who initially rejected him. Dana, however, shows Tōta and his group a picture of Negi and Chisame during their wedding and explains that they were married 7 years after Negi's victory over Ialda and after a lot of "twists and turns".

It's said that she is currently possessing Negi's body, just like she once possessed Nagi's body before he was destroyed by his son, and thus Fate looks desperately for a way to remove her from his body without killing him since then, while Yukihime seeks to uphold her promise to kill him should she ever obtain control of his body.

[[File:Full of fresh vitality (2864879525).jpg|thumb|right|Vitality means Life]]
'''Vitality''' is [[life]], life force, [[health]], [[youth]], or ability to live or exist. The word vitality is derived from the Latin word ''vita'', which means "life."

== Jainism ==
According to [[Jain philosophy]], there are ten vitalities or life-principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pujyapada (Shri.)|editor=S. A. Jain|title=Reality|date=1960|publisher=Vira Sasana Sangha|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uRIaAAAAMAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT|archive-date=2015|quote=Not in Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;-
*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind

'''World Day Against the Death Penalty''' (10 October) is a day to advocate for the [[Capital punishment#Abolition of capital punishment|abolition]] of the [[death penalty]] and to raise awareness of the conditions and the circumstances which affect prisonners with death sentences. The day was first organised by the [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcoalition.org/History.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has since taken place annually on 10 October.

The day is supported by numerous NGOs and world governments, including [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/world-day-against-death-penalty-powerful-video-shows-horror-families&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/10/09/joint-declaration-by-the-eu-high-representative-for-foreign-affairs-and-security-policy-and-the-secretary-general-of-the-council-of-europe-on-the-european-and-world-day-against-the-death-penalty/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2018-10-10/statement-un-secretary-general-16th-world-day-against-death-penalty&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2007, the [[Council of Europe]] also declared 10 October to be the European Day Against the Death Penalty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/10-october-against-death-penalty&lt;/ref&gt;

Each World Day Against the Death Penalty focuses on a particular theme, to highlight certain issues surrounding capital punishment. In 2018, the theme was the living conditions on [[death row]]. Previous themes include [[poverty]], [[terrorism]], [[Drug-related crime|drug crimes]] and [[mental health]].

==Early life==

In 1916, Leopold Levy took over the lease for the failed Louisiana State Bank in New Orleans and renamed the building as The Antique Dome, selling old furniture and antiques.&lt;ref&gt;''Old New Orleans: A History of the Vieux Carre, Its Ancient and Historical Buildings'' by Stanley Clisby Arthur, 2007; accessed April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, he moved his family to [[Washington, D. C.]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Yvonne and her sister both attended [[Cardozo Senior High School|Central High School]], where Yvonne was captain of the debating team&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post,'' May 6, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; and performed in school plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Here's to old Central, 1882-1950'', Central High School (Washington, D.C.).

She served as [[Hadassah]]’s first representative in the city. During World War II, she lobbied relentlessly to save hundreds of Polish orphans, known as the [[Children of Zion|"Tehran Children"]], who were stranded in Iran after fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe. Her efforts bore fruit when the Allies dispatched British war ships to transport the children to the relative safety of British Palestine.
