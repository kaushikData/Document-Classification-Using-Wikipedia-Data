'''''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai''''' ({{zh|犹太女孩在上海}}) is a 2010 Chinese animated family film written by Wu Lin and based on his [[graphic novel]] of the same name. It is directed by Wang Genfa and Zhang Zhenhui, and [[Voice acting|voiced]] by Cui Jie, Zhao Jing and Ma Shaohua.&lt;ref name="Official website1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgirlinsh.com/page/html/index.php |title=The Story and Movie |author= |date= |work=A Jewish Girl in Shanghai Official Website |publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103915/http://www.jewishgirlinsh.com/page/html/index.php |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set mainly in and around the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] in [[History of Shanghai#World War II and the Japanese Occupation|Japanese-occupied]] [[Shanghai]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], the film tells the story of three children. Rina and her younger brother Mishalli are Jewish refugees who escaped Europe but are without their parents. A-Gen is a Chinese orphan boy who meets Rina and helps her and her brother to survive. The children form strong friendships and have adventures as they try and fend off the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] occupying the city, and their allies, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. In the background, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] takes place, while the children must face the uncertainty that concerns the fate of Rina and Mishalli's parents in Europe.

Well received in [[China]] and internationally, ''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'' has been heralded as the first animated Chinese film to address [[the Holocaust]], and has been described as "China's first homegrown Jewish film".&lt;ref name="The Jewish-Chinese connection on screen at the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/play/jewish-film-festival-2010-257467 |title=The Jewish-Chinese connection on screen at the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival 2010 |author= |date=11 November 2010 |work=CNN |publisher= |accessdate=23 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125144221/http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/play/jewish-film-festival-2010-257467 |archivedate=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been nominated for awards in China and [[Israel]], and has been considered an important step towards improving [[People's Republic of China – Israel relations|China's relations with Israel]] and [[intercultural relations]] between the Chinese and Jewish peoples.

==Plot==
Modern day Shanghai, an old lady with blue eyes arrived in the city, while holding an old locket that belongs to her.

Rina and Mishalli, European Jews luckily escaped before they were caught by Nazis on their homeland, sought refuge within [[Shanghai Ghetto]]. A-Gen, a Chinese orphan sells bread for a living. Rina gave her locket in exchange of food. A-Gen tries to find Rina to return her locket.

She was welcomed upon by A-Gen to his home, as he was raised by his father's friend, who was once alongside his father, fought the Japanese, in which A-Gen's father died.

Together, they make their lives upon Shanghai normal, until a collaborator blows their locations to the local Japanese Army. A-Gen's guardian held and allowed himself to be caught by the soldiers.

1945, the Japanese surrendered. A-Gen sees his friend Rina one last time as she was taken to the ship back to Europe.

Rina is the old woman from the beginning, trying to search for A-Gen, who came as an old man.

==Historical background==
{{main article|Shanghai Ghetto}}
{{further|History of the Jews in China|History of Shanghai}}
[[File:Girls of the Shanghai Ghetto.png|thumb|A real Jewish girl in Shanghai with her Chinese friends, from the collection of the [[Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum]]]]
[[File:Shanghai ghetto in 1943.jpg|thumb|The Shanghai Ghetto in 1943]]

During the Second World War, approximately 20,000 Jewish refugees fleeing [[German-occupied Europe]] were given an area of approximately one square mile in the [[Hongkou District]] of Shanghai by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], designated the [[Shanghai Ghetto|Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees]], one of the poorest and most overcrowded areas of the city. Shanghai had previously had a small population of [[Baghdadi Jews]] and [[Russian Jews]], the latter mostly having fled the [[Russian Empire]] as a result of [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]].

The new [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that immigrated to Shanghai began arriving from 1933, firstly [[German Jews]] following the [[Nazi Party]]'s rise to power. Despite the cultural differences they faced, and restrictions imposed by the Japanese under Nazi pressure, the Jews of Shanghai survived the war unharmed, as the Japanese refused to hand them over to the Germans.

Following the end of the Second World War, many Jews who had sought refuge in Shanghai returned to Europe or decided to settle in countries with much larger Jewish populations, such as the [[United States]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Most of the Jews that chose to stay in Shanghai left shortly afterwards as a result of the resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]], and by the late 1950s very few Jews remained in Shanghai. As a result of [[Economy of China|Chinese economic growth]] in recent years, however, the city's Jewish population has grown to around 1,500 in 2010. This compares to a Jewish population of fewer than 100 around 20 years before.&lt;ref name="12-year-old girl makes Jewish history in Shanghai"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/10362459/article-12-year-old-girl-makes-Jewish-history-in-Shanghai-?instance=home_news_1st_left|title= 12-year-old girl makes Jewish history in Shanghai |author= Toby Tabachnick|date= 18 November  2010|work= The Jewish Chronicle|publisher= |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Jewish-girl-in-shanghai-web.jpg|thumb|left|A widely used promotional still from the film depicting Rina and A-Gen. Note the [[Star of David]] that appears on the [[pocket watch]].]]
Wu, a former history teacher, first become interested in the history of Shanghai's Jews, obscure to both Jews and Chinese alike, in 2005, when many newspapers and magazines in Shanghai published the stories of Jewish refugees to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, seeing parallels between the Jewish and Chinese peoples' oppression by the Germans and Japanese respectively, and their struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://asianjewishlife.org/pages/articles/summer2010/AJL_CoverStory_AnimatingRelationships.html|title= Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations: A Story of Lasting Friendship |author= Erica Lyons|date= Summer 2010|work= Asian Jewish Life|publisher= Asian Jewish Life Ltd.|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu had previously lived in [[Los Angeles]], and he based the character of Mishalli on Jerry Moses, a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] friend who was originally from [[Wrocław|Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) who, like the characters of Rina and Mishalli, was offered a safe haven in Shanghai. Moses and other Jewish friends helped Wu to learn about [[Judaism|Jewish religious practices]].&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt; Wu has stated that his main reason for making the film was to let children know about what really happened, and to promote the story and the history so that people all over the world can learn from it.&lt;ref name="Interview with Wu Lin - Writer of 'A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISc24niCNp4|title= Interview with Wu Lin - Writer of 'A Jewish Girl in Shanghai' |author= |date= 25 August 2010|work= Israel-Asia Center|publisher= YouTube|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was originally conceived for adults, but Wu decided to aim the film at children in the hope that the film could influence the future generation.&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt; Glenn Timmermans, the organiser of the Macau Jewish Film Festival, has stated that he believes the film's intended age group is between around eight and fourteen years, though he notes its wider appeal.&lt;ref name="Macau Daily Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/interview/18818-Glenn-Timmermans-Organiser-Macau-Jewish-Film-Festival-This-year-well-have-the-Holocaust-theme.html |title=Glenn Timmermans, Organiser of Macau Jewish Film Festival: ‘This year we’ll have the Holocaust theme’ |author=Luciana Leitão |date=8 November 2010 |work=Macau Daily Times |publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035420/http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/interview/18818-Glenn-Timmermans-Organiser-Macau-Jewish-Film-Festival-This-year-well-have-the-Holocaust-theme.html |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the film's characters, a [[Talking animal|talking]] [[monkey]], has been noted as one of the more child-orientated features of the film.&lt;ref name="The Jewish-Chinese connection on screen at the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival 2010"/&gt;

Wu first created a ''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'' as a graphic novel, published in 2008 by [[East China Normal University Press]]. The graphic novel has been described as a "great success" by Wu, selling 4,000 copies in the first six months since its release, though, as it was only published in [[English language|English]], its Chinese market was naturally limited. Wu has stated that a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version of the graphic novel is under consideration.&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

In 2009, Wu began work on a film adaptation to bring the work to a broader audience in China. The film, produced using [[35 mm film]],&lt;ref name="Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hkjff.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89&amp;Itemid=80|title=Films &amp; Synopses |author= |date=|work= Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, unlike the graphic novel, in [[Mandarin Chinese]],&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt; and was developed by the [[Shanghai Film Group Corporation]] and the [[Shanghai Animation Film Studio]].&lt;ref name="Official website1"/&gt; The [[film score]] was composed by Shi Jiayang.&lt;ref name="Official website1"/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Tricycle Theatre Kilburn.jpg|thumb|The [[Tricycle Theatre]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], [[London]], the site of the film's UK premiere.]]
''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'' made its world premiere in Shanghai in May 2010. The film began showing across China from 28 May.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-05/21/content_9875865.htm|title=What's on |author= |date=21 May 2010|work= Expo Arts|publisher= China Daily|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a month following the film's general release, it was being shown in 200 Chinese cinemas. When it was first shown in China, it was in front of 700 school pupils, who, according to Wu, "laughed and cried several times". He described the emotional impact of the film as "very rare for an animated film".&lt;ref name="Interview with Wu Lin - Writer of 'A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'"/&gt;

The film subsequently made its premiere in [[Macau]] on 14 November 2010 at the Cultural Centre of the [[University of Macau]], as part of the 1st Macau Jewish Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Macau Daily Times"/&gt; The [[Hong Kong]] premiere took place a week later, on 21 November, at the Jewish Community Centre on [[Robinson Road, Hong Kong|Robinson Road]], as part of the 11th Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hkjff.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=81|title= Schedule |author= |date= |work= Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's Israeli premiere took place in July 2010,&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt; when it was shown as part of the 27th [[Jerusalem Film Festival]] on 13 and 14 July.&lt;ref name="JFF"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jff.org.il/?CategoryID=757&amp;ArticleID=958|title= A Jewish Girl in Shanghai |author= |date=|work= Jerusalem Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well received by the Israeli audience.&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|British]] premiere took place in November 2010, when it was shown at the [[Tricycle Theatre]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], [[London]]. The film was first shown on 20 November as part of the 14th [[UK Jewish Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="UK Jewish Film Festival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk/Films/A-Jewish-Girl-in-Shanghai~3817.html|title= A Jewish Girl in Shanghai |author= Jonathan Walton|date= |work= UK Jewish Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021004359/http://www.ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk/Films/A-Jewish-Girl-in-Shanghai~3817.html| archivedate= 21 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's subtitles in English were noted as containing a few mistranslations and mistakes, including the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] use of the word "badass".&lt;ref name="JFF2"/&gt;

===Reception===
The critical reception to ''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'' has been generally positive. The film was nominated for the Jewish Experience Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival,&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Film Festival2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jff.org.il/?CategoryID=757|title= The Jewish Experience |author= |date= |work= Jerusalem Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first Chinese film nominated for that award. At the China International Animation and Digital Arts Festival in [[Changzhou]], [[Jiangsu]], China, the film received the Golden Cartoon Award Best Chinese Film Prize.&lt;ref name="Official website2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgirlinsh.com/index.php |title=About the Film |author= |date= |work=A Jewish Girl in Shanghai Official Website |publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713104517/http://www.jewishgirlinsh.com/index.php |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's animation has been widely praised, being described as "beautifully drawn" with "breathtaking traditional animation"&lt;ref name="UK Jewish Film Festival"/&gt; and as being "artfully created with traditional animated imagery".&lt;ref name="JFF"/&gt;

The sensitive treatment of the Holocaust has also been commended: "The fresh perspective of the main characters means that the events of the times are freed from cliched depictions of the Holocaust and the viewer is able to draw their own conclusions."&lt;ref name="JFF2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bestforfilm.com/film-blog/the-14th-uk-jewish-film-festival/|title= The 14th UK Jewish Film Festival|author= Becky Sear|date= |work= UK Jewish Film Festival|publisher= |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticism has been directed towards the historical grounding of the film. One [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene of the film, set in 1936, sees Rina and Michaili, in what appears to be an [[Alps|alpine]] setting in Europe, escaping being bombed by [[Luftwaffe|Nazi planes]], despite the date preceding the [[aerial warfare]] of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="The Jewish-Chinese connection on screen at the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival 2010"/&gt; Wu himself has said that the film is "both true and untrue" in that it is a composition of fiction and history; "the main characters were all based on real prototypes…I can’t promise it's 100% accurate, but I think it fits the background of the time."&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

The clothing of the Jews was notably inaccurate, especially in Europe, where the orthodox Jewish mother is wearing slacks and a T-shirt.  The film also minimizes the Japanese role in saving most of these Jews.  Most famously, 6,000 Jews  Lithuanian Jews were saved by Japanese Vice-Consul [[Chiune Sugihara]] in Vilna, many of whom live through the war in Shanghai.

===Intercultural relations===
{{further|People's Republic of China – Israel relations}}
''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'' has been praised by commentators for being a positive step towards improving Chinese&amp;ndash;Jewish and Chinese&amp;ndash;Israeli relations at a time where there is growing interest in China about Jewish life.&lt;ref name="The Jewish-Chinese connection on screen at the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

Wu has stated that only by remembering the past can friendship for the future be built,&lt;ref name="Interview with Wu Lin - Writer of 'A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'"/&gt; declaring that while "the friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people is only a spray in the long river of world history",  it is "extremely meaningful because it took place in the hard times of [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascism]]."&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

==Sequel==
In an interview with ''Asian Jewish Life'', Wu revealed he was planning to write a sequel to ''A Jewish Girl in Shanghai'', stating his intentions that the second animated work would tell the as-yet unseen story of Rina and Mishalli's father. Wu explained the reason for this on the basis that he wrote "the front of the face and now need to write from the back."&lt;ref name="Animating Jewish-Chinese Relations"/&gt;

== Origin ==
The Ad-dharmi movement was started in 1920's, for the purpose of getting a distinct religious identity.

The traditional occupation of the Ad-Dharmis was [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanning]] although a majority were agricultural labourers. There has greater upward mobility among groups in Punjab then other parts of India. As such, many Ad-Dharmis have started to migrate to towns and cities, where they have taken on a number of blue and white collar professions. A small but significant minority have also taken to education. Like other [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], the Ad-Dharmis have participated in the overseas migration of the ethnic group. There are now fairly large Ad-Dharmis communities in Europe and North America, in particular the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;People of India Punjab Volume XXXVII edited by I.J.S Bansal and Swaran Singh pages 20 to 25 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chakras''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चक्र, [[IAST]]: cakra, [[Pali]]: cakka, lit. ''wheel, circle'') are the various focal points in the [[Subtle Body|subtle body]] used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as [[Tantra]], or the esoteric or inner traditions of [[Indian religion]], Chinese Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, and in postmodernity, in [[New Age medicine]], and originally psychologically adopted to the western mind through the assistance of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref name=britchakra&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/chakra Chakra: Religion], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

The concept is found in the early traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

==Etymology==
{{see also| Yantra | Mandala}}
The very concept of the so-called chakra, etymologically originates directly from the [[Sanskrit]] root चक्र. The "tsschakra" remained in virtual linguistic conformity throughout possible adaptations throughout the relative temporal and linguist adversity of two thousand years. At heart, the chakra denotes a "wheel", a "circle", and a "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J.P|last2=Adams|first2=D.Q.|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture|date=1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-884964-98-5|page=640|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt; One of the Hindu scriptures ''[[Rigveda]]'' mentions ''Chakra'' with the meaning of "wheel", with ''ara'' (spokes). According to [[Frits Staal]], ''Chakra'' has Indo-European roots, is "related to Greek ''Kuklos'' (from which comes English ''cycle''), Latin ''circus'', Anglo-Saxon ''hveohl'' and English ''wheel''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|authorlink=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Vedic period texts use the same word as a [[simile]] in other contexts, such as the "wheel of time" or "wheel of dharma", such as in ''Rigveda'' hymn verse 1.164.11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|authorlink=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|pages=333–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१६४ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १.१६४], verse ॥११॥, Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]] generally and Theravada specifically, the [[Pali]] noun ''cakka'' connotes "wheel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the central "Tripitaka", the Buddha variously references the "dhammacakka", or "wheel of dharma", connoting that his dharma, universal in its advocacy, should bear the marks which bear the very characteristic of any temporal dispensation. While further, it should be added that the Buddha himself insinuated freedom from cycles in and of themselves - [[sui generis]] - be they karmic, reincarnative, liberative, cognitive or emotional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edgerton|first1=Franklin|title=Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary|date=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-0999-8|page=221|edition=Repr}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, the term ''Chakra'' also means "wheel" and appears in various context in its ancient literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA427|year=1925|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1376-2|pages=280–283, 427–428, 476–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Indian religions, ''Chakra'' in esoteric theories in Jainism such as those by [[Buddhisagarsuri]] means yogic-energy centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|pages=426–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also| Yoga|Nadi (yoga)}}
The term ''Chakra'' appears to first emerge within the Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu text, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as ''chakravartin'' or the king who "turns the wheel of his empire" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography popular in representing the ''Chakras'', states White, trace back to the five symbols of [[yajna]], the Vedic fire altar: "square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn 10.136 of the ''Rigveda'' mentions a renunciate [[yogi]] with a female named ''kunamnama''. Literally, it means "she who is bent, coiled", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the ''Rigveda''. Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein interpret this might be related to [[kundalini]] shakti, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Kiss of the Yogini: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian Contexts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5RwARVMg2_4C |year=2006| publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02783-8|pages=33, 130, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Georg Feuerstein |title=Tantra: Path of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O6_AwAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2545-1|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D.

Breath channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nāḍi]]) of [[Yoga]] practices are mentioned in the classical [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism dated to 1st millennium BCE,&lt;ref name="YIP14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trish O’Sullivan (2010), ''Chakras''. In: D.A. Leeming, K. Madden, S. Marlan (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'', Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; but not psychic-energy Chakra theories. The latter, states White, were introduced about 8th-century CE in Buddhist texts as hierarchies of inner energy centers, such as in the ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' and ''Caryāgiti''.&lt;ref name="YIP14"&gt;White, David Gordon. ''[https://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i9565.pdf Yoga in Practice]''. Princeton University Press 2012, pages 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are called by various terms such as ''cakka'', ''padma'' (lotus) or ''pitha'' (mound).&lt;ref name="YIP14"/&gt; These medieval Buddhist texts mention only four chakras, while later Hindu texts such as the ''Kubjikāmata'' and ''Kaulajñānanirnaya'' expanded the list to many more.&lt;ref name="YIP14"/&gt;

In contrast to White, according to Feuerstein, early Upanishads of Hinduism do mention ''cakra'' in the sense of "psychospiritual vortices", along with other terms found in tantra: ''[[prana]]'' or ''vayu'' (life energy) along with ''nadi'' (energy carrying arteries).&lt;ref name="Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17"/&gt; According to Galvin Flood, the ancient texts do not present ''chakra'' and kundalini-style yoga theories although these words appear in the earliest Vedic literature in many contexts. The ''chakra'' in the sense of four or more vital energy centers appear in the medieval era Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D.

Chakra is a part of the esoteric medieval era theories about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions.&lt;ref name="YIP14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Basant Pradhan|title=Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy: A Clinical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maUxBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-09105-1|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory posited that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one "physical body" (''sthula sarira'') and other "psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical" it is called the "subtle body" (''suksma sarira'').&lt;ref name="Sharma2006p193"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Primal Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiO8lKUs9-YC |year=2006|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-5014-5|pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The roots to this theory are found in [[Samkhya]] and [[Vedanta]] which attempt to conceptualize the permanent soul and impermanent body as interacting in three overlapping states: the gross body (sthula sarira), the subtle body (suksma sarira), and causal body (karana sarira). These ideas emerged to address questions relating to the nature of body and soul, how and why they interact while one is awake, one is asleep and over the conception-birth-growth-decay-death-rebirth cycle.&lt;ref name="Sharma2006p193"/&gt;&lt;ref name=muller227&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOzHazE_nQcC |year=1899|publisher=Longmans |pages=227–236, 393–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass. The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the theory posits that the body and the mind mutually affect each other.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt; The subtle body consists of nadi (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy it called ''chakra''.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; The theory grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body. The chakra it considered most important varied between various traditions, but they typically ranged between four and seven.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;

[[File:Chakras_map.svg|thumb|left|The seven Chakras are arranged along the spinal cord, from bottom to top: 1. Muladhara 2. Svadhisthana 3. Nabhi-Manipura 4. Anahata 5. Vishuddhi 6. Ajna 7. Sahasrara.&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;]]
The important chakras are stated in Buddhist and Hindu texts to be arranged in a column along the spinal cord, from its base to the top of the head, connected by vertical channels.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt; The tantric traditions sought to master them, awaken and energize them through various breathing exercises or with assistance of a teacher. These chakras were also symbolically mapped to specific human physiological capacity, seed syllables (bija), sounds, subtle elements (tanmatra), in some cases deities, colors and other motifs.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

The chakra theories of Buddhism and Hinduism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt; Unlike the latter, the ''chakra'' relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as a continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy. It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy (''prana'' flows) and mind-body connections.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=190–191, 353–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meditation is aided by extensive symbology, mantras, diagrams, models (deity and mandala). The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E.A.

An important subset of subtle-body practices, found particularly in Indian and Tibetan Tantric traditions, and in similar Chinese practices, involves the idea of an internal 'subtle physiology' of the body (or rather of the body-mind complex) made up of channels through which substances of some kind flow, and points of intersection at which these channels come together. In the Indian tradition the channels are known as ''nadi'' and the points of intersection as ''cakra''.|Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, ''Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contrast with classical yoga===
Chakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream [[yoga]]. According to Edwin Bryant and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, moksha) is "attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the ''cakra / nadi / kundalini'' physiology is completely peripheral to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Francis Bryant|title=The Yoga sūtras of Patañjali: a new edition, translation, and commentary with insights from the traditional commentators |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHYxAQAAIAAJ |year=2009|publisher=North Point Press|isbn=978-0-86547-736-0|pages=358–364, 229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefanie Syman|title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFYFEmSVtQAC|year=2010|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-3307-0|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical traditions==
[[File:Lotus flower (978659).jpg|thumb| Chakras (as well as [[Yantras]] and [[Mandalas]]) are visualised as lotus with different number of petals representing each chakra.]]
The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe ''nadi'' and ''cakra'' in a "subtle body" context.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; To them, they are the parallel dimension of psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real. In the ''nadi'' and ''cakra'' flow the ''prana'' (breath, life energy).&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Adrian Snodgrass]]|title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5|pages=317–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "life energy" varies between the texts, ranging from simple inhalation-exhalation to far more complex association with breath-mind-emotions-sexual energy.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; This essence is what vanishes when a person dies, leaving a gross body. Some of it, states this subtle body theory, is what withdraws within when one sleeps. All of it is believed to be reachable, awake-able and important for an individual's body-mind health, and how one relates to other people in one's life.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; This subtle body network of ''nadi'' and ''chakra'' is, according to some later Indian theories and many new age speculations, closely associated with emotions.&lt;ref name=samuel5&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=5–8, 38–45, 187–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harish Johari|title=Chakras: Energy Centers of Transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99thvrs56AMC |year=2000|publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-1-59477-909-1|pages=21–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu Tantra===
{{Main article|Kundalini energy}}
Different esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt; This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature. These texts teach many different Chakra theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called [[Shaktism]]. It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an "energy center" within, as well as being a term of group rituals such as in ''chakra-puja'' (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=June McDaniel|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=96–97, 101–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cakra-based system is one part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as [[laya yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philipp H.

Beyond its original [[Shakta]] milieu, various sub-traditions within the [[Shaiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Certain modern Hindu groups also utilize a technique of circular energy work based on the chakras known as ''kriya yoga''. Followers of this practice include the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] and [[Self Realization Fellowship]], and practitioners are known as ''kriyaban''. Although [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by [[Patañjali]] in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] and by [[Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (as karma yoga), [[Swami Satyananda]] of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an [[avatar]] of god known as [[Mahavatar Babaji|Babaji]]. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.

===Buddhist Tantra===
{{Main article|Vajrayana}}
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]
The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach five chakras.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; It must be noted, that is possible that a system of Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha and the Usnisa Kamala chakras was absorbed into Tibetan thought, yet any source which alleges the employment of 3rd or manipura, chakra, within the context of thousand year history of broad Tantric monasticism, is here, not only conceptually inadequate, but technically misguided.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt; In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the ''Mantrayana'' of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely - yet by no means directly - corresponding to the categories within the [[Shaiva]] ''Mantramarga'' universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|page=40, Table 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt;

Chakras clearly play a key role in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking. And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the "organic harmony" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as "central to their [[soteriology|soteriological]] process".&lt;ref name=samuel38/&gt; The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called ''yantra yoga'' or '''phrul 'khor''. 

The Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Mackenzie|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an Understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or99AgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-13262-1|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=Historical Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwTnQcFjCQsC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6317-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakras, according to the [[Bon]] tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the [[six realms]] of woe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|page=84}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa lung]] practice embodied in the [[Trul khor]] lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. [[Yoga]] awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities. In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and a attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Tenzin Wangyal|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

===Qigong===
[[Qigong]] ({{linktext|氣功}}) also relies on a similar model of the human body as an [[Energy (esotericism)|esoteric energy system]], except that it involves the circulation of [[qì]] ({{linktext|氣}}, also ''ki'') or life-energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Luk]],  ''Taoist Yoga&amp;nbsp;– Alchemy and Immortality'', Rider and Company, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jīng]]'', or primordial essence, and ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', or spirit energy.

In the principle circuit of qì, called the [[microcosmic orbit]], energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]] (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal&lt;/ref&gt; These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into [[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], infinite space of void.&lt;ref&gt;Andy James. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silat===
Traditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to energy-healing, meditation, or martial arts. [[Silat]] practitioners learn to harmonise their movements with the chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.&lt;ref name="Tua"&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of each chakra==
{{Tantric chakras}}

[[File:BalineseChakraBanner.jpg|thumb|A Balinese chakra banner.]]
The more common and most studied esoteric system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|sushumna nadi]] in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by [[Sir John Woodroffe]] (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text ''The Serpent Power''. Avalon translated the Hindu text ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the six (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).&lt;ref name="White 2003 221"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent.&lt;ref name="Banerjea175"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akshaya Kumar Banerjea|title=Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljn1koKa0CQC&amp;pg=PA175|year=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0534-7|pages=175–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as [[Kundalini]], while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or [[Tummo]] (Tibetan: ''gtum mo'', "fierce one").&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

Below are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as sahasrara. This new age version incorporates the newtonian colors that were completely unknown when these systems were created.

In esoteric Hinduism and New Age western systems, it is generally considered to be the highest spiritual center and the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the feminine [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] Shakti rises to this point, it unites with the masculine [[Shiva]], the yogi or yogini achieves self-realization and a state of liberating [[samadhi]] is attained. The chakra is symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

It is symbolised by a lotus with two petals.&lt;ref name=grimes22/&gt; It is at this point that the two side nadi [[Ida (yoga)]] and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality, the characteristic of being dual (e.g. ''light'' and ''dark'', or ''male'' and ''female'').

In 1918, the translation of two Indian texts: the ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' and the ''Pādukā-Pañcaka'', by Sir [[John Woodroffe]], alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled ''The Serpent Power'' introduced the [[shakta]] theory of seven main chakras in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', Dover Publications, pp.317ff&lt;/ref&gt; This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob Böhme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gichtel directly refers to inner ''force centres'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304194144/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html|date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesychasm===

A completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.

===New Age===

In ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), [[Caroline Myss]] describes the function of chakras as follows: "Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myss.com/library/chakras/ |title=Myss Library &amp;#124; Chakras |publisher=Myss.com |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.

The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wiktionary:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]] (which New Age belief equates with ''[[shakti]]'', ''[[qi]]'' in Chinese, ''ki ''in Japanese, ''koach-ha-guf''&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrew, ''bios ''in Greek, and [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']]'' ''in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Rudolf Steiner]] considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_c01.html |title=GA010: Chapter I: The Astral Centers |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html |title=GA010: Initiation and Its Results|location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''How to Know Higher Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Florin Lowndes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowndes|first1=Florin|title=Enlivening the Chakra of the Heart: The Fundamental Spiritual Exercises of Rudolf Steiner|date=2000|publisher=Sophia Books|location=London|isbn=1-85584-053-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a "spiritual student" can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the "ancient path" of schooling to the "new path" represented by Steiner's ''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]''.{{refn|group=note|English translations include:

===Endocrine system===

Chakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sivananda|first1=Swami|title=Kundalini Yoga: illustrated|date=1991|publisher=Divine Life Society|location=Sivanandanagar, U.P.|isbn=81-7052-052-5|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] counterparts to the [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Philip|last2=Osborn|first2=Gary|title=The Shining Ones: the world's most powerful secret society revealed|date=2006|publisher=Watkins|location=London|isbn=1-84293-150-4|pages=44–45|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anodea Judith]] noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5n4dkTw7e0QC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Endocrine+chakra#v=onepage&amp;q=Endocrine%20chakra&amp;f=false |title=Wheels of Life: A User's Guide to the Chakra System - Anodea Judith - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgess|first1=Stephen|title=The Yoga Book: a practical guide to self-realization|date=1997|publisher=Element|location=Rockport, Mass.|isbn=1-85230-972-5|pages=19–21}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W.

There have been several '''controversies surrounding the Society of St. Pius X''', many of which concern political support for non-democratic regimes and alleged antisemitism. The [[Society of St. Pius X]] is an international organisation founded in 1970 by the French [[traditionalist Catholic]] [[archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]].

==Political controversies==

===France===
There is an overlap in French society between the SSPX's constituency of support and support for [[reactionary]] political positions. In the French context, such positions include:
* '''Condemnation of the 1789 French Revolution and of the [[French Republic]]''', accompanied by support for the restoration of the [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] [[House of Bourbon|French monarchy]]. Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] vocally condemned the [[French Revolution]], the ensuing [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|dechristianization of France]], and  [[Reign of Terror]] by the [[Jacobin Club]]. The Archbishop called the Revolution's principles "Masonic and Anti-Catholic." He expressed regret that the [[Classical Liberalism]] personified by the Revolution had entered "mitered heads," before, during, and after Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/OpenLetterToConfusedCatholics/Chapter-13.htm|title=SSPXAsia.com: Open Letter to Confused Catholics Chapter 13. Religious Liberty, Collegial Equality|website=www.sspxasia.com|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lefebvre's close associate Fr. Paul Aulagnier, who has since left the SSPX and been reconciled with the Church hierarchy, was quoted in an SSPX periodical in 2001 as saying, while serving in Belgium (a [[constitutional monarchy]]): "I am pleased to be in Brussels – I who detest the republic and hate democracy."&lt;ref&gt;"Je suis content d’être à Bruxelles, moi qui déteste la république et qui hais la démocratie" [http://www.resistances.be/fsspx06.html Les croisés de l’Occident chrétien].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Support for the Vichy government (1940–1944)'''. Lefebvre spoke approvingly of the "Catholic order of [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]]", referring to the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] Premier Marshal Philippe Pétain, who was later convicted of treason and collaboration with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Communicantes/Aug2001/French/Itineraire_spirituel.htm ''Spiritual Journey'' (in French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517064804/http://sspx.ca/Communicantes/Aug2001/French/Itineraire_spirituel.htm |date=2009-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society organises pilgrimages to Pétain's tomb,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.virgo-maria.org/D-FSSPX/D-Ralliement-FSSPX-Rome-Mgr-Fellay/index_ralliement_fsspx_rome_mgr_fellay.htm here] on the 2007 pilgrimage, with links to video footage.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1987 pilgrimage the Archbishop referred to him as having "restored [France] spiritually and morally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavie.fr/l-hebdo/une/article/0942-labecedaire-de-la-discorde/retour/11/hash/6ecb9eb2e1.html ''"...restaurée spirituellement et moralement..."'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's official journal in Belgium has denounced the [[Épuration légale|anti-Vichy trials]] conducted after World War II by the mainstream republican followers of [[Charles De Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;The journal is called ''Pour qu’Il Règne'', and is quoted [http://www.resistances.be/fsspx06.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The trials resulted in 791 executions and almost 50,000 forfeitures of civil rights. There have also been allegations that the SSPX had links with the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] functionary [[Paul Touvier]] and that Vichy songs were learned at a scout camp of the Society (see below).
* '''Support for the Front National political party and its former leader, Jean-Marie le Pen''', who is on the [[far right]] of the [[political spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, M. , 2006-08-11 "National Preference, Gender Complementarity, and the Family Policy of France’s ''Front National''" ''Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Montreal Convention Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Online'' &lt;PDF&gt;. 2008-10-09 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p104814_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080911-far-right-leader-le-pen-hints-retirement-france&amp;navi=FRANCE Far-right leader Le Pen hints at retirement], AFP report, 11 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Lefebvre was quoted in the French far-right periodical ''[[Présent]]'' as endorsing [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], though his endorsement was made on the basis that Le Pen was the only major French politician who unambiguously condemned abortion. In 1991, the then SSPX priest Fr. [[Philippe Laguérie]] called the [[Front national|Front National]] "the party least removed from the natural law".&lt;ref&gt;"Philippe Laguérie qui établissait dès 1991 que le Front National était «le parti le moins éloigné du droit naturel»" ([http://www.icare.to/icare-francais/actualite.html Internet Centre Anti-Racism Europe: Actualité 24/08/2005] ).&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop Lefebvre's first biographer, the English traditionalist writer [[Michael Davies (Catholic writer)|Michael Davies]], wrote in the first volume of his ''Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre'':

:In France political feeling tends to be more polarized, more extreme, and far more deeply felt than in England. ...Since the [Second World] war, and especially since Vatican II, the official French Church has veered sharply to the left. ...Thus, a large proportion of right-wing Catholics was predisposed to support any religious movement opposed to the policies of the French hierarchy. The political views of some of the French Catholics who support the Archbishop would certainly be odious to many English-speaking traditionalists – although such views are more understandable (if not acceptable) within the French context. However, if they wish to support the Archbishop (and not necessarily for the right reasons) there is nothing he can do about it. ...The French hierarchy has replaced [Catholic] social teaching with diluted [[Marxism]] to such an extent that anyone adopting the Catholic position is now automatically accused of fascism.

==Occupation of the church of St Nicolas du Chardonnet==
In 1977, a group of SSPX priests and laypeople led by [[Monsignor]] [[François Ducaud-Bourget]] entered the parish church of [[St Nicolas du Chardonnet]] in central [[Paris]] and celebrated Mass. They subsequently refused to leave, and the church remains in the possession of the SSPX to this day.

The various French municipal authorities have had ownership of the older churches in France since the enactment of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]], though the buildings are permitted to be used by the appropriate religious denominations. Ducaud-Bourget maintained that the [[Traditionalist Catholics]] represented by the SSPX were the true heirs of the Catholics of 1905. Although the occupation was declared illegal by the French courts,&lt;ref&gt;"Le Conseil de Paris ... Emet le vœu :- que le Maire de Paris et le Préfet de police mettent tout en œuvre pour faire cesser l'occupation illégale de l'église Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet par des personnes diffusant une propagande raciste, antisémite, sexiste et antidémocratique"[http://www.v1.paris.fr/BMO/delib/CMDELIB20020624/CMDELIB200206242002_V._83.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities reached the conclusion that, by comparison with forcibly evicting the SSPX, the continuing occupation would cause less disturbance to public order. An SSPX attempt in 1993 to occupy another church in Paris, that of [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]], was unsuccessful.



===Bishop Richard Williamson===
{{Main|Richard Williamson (bishop)}}
The views of Bishop Williamson have been a particular source of controversy. For example, the bishop has written:
:However, until they re-discover their true Messianic vocation, they may be expected to continue fanatically agitating, in accordance with their false messianic vocation of Jewish world-dominion, to prepare the Anti-Christ's throne in Jerusalem. So we may fear their continuing to play their major part in the agitation of the East and in the corruption of the West. Here the wise Catholic will remember that, again, the ex-Christian nations have only their own [[Liberalism]] to blame for allowing free circulation within [[Christendom]] to the enemies of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspxseminary.org/publications/letter/1991/February/February.shtml The Gulf War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131204720/http://www.sspxseminary.org/publications/letter/1991/February/February.shtml |date=2009-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Sveriges Television|Swedish Television]] in November 2008, whose broadcast on 21 January 2009, the date on which the Holy See lifted the excommunication of the four SSPX bishops, gained wide publicity, Williamson repeated his opinion that the generally accepted history of [[the Holocaust]] is wrong. He accepted an estimate of only 200,000-300,000 Jews who perished in Nazi concentration camps, and denied that any were killed in gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svtplay.se/v/1413831/webbextra_langre_intervju_med_williamson |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216084151/http://svtplay.se/v/1413831/webbextra_langre_intervju_med_williamson |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, former SSPX seminarians have come forward with additional information about Williamson's Jewish views.  One former seminarian characterized Williamson as "a sick man" with "a horrible attitude toward women and a horrible attitude toward Jews." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/02/20/bishops_vexing_beliefs_have_deep_roots/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Michael | last=Paulson | title=Bishop's vexing beliefs have deep roots | date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican has repudiated Williamson's views as "intolerable and altogether unacceptable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Catholic News Service |title=Pope says Holocaust denial is 'intolerable ... unacceptable'|date=2009-02-12 |author=Cindy Wooden |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900668.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson's views on this and other subjects are controversial even within traditionalist Catholicism. After his interview, broadcast by Swedish Television on 21 January 2009, both the Superior General of the SSPX, Bishop Fellay, and the District Superior of the SSPX in Germany, Fr. [[Franz Schmidberger]], stated that Williamson's views represented his own personal opinions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/2009-0123-bishop_fellay.htm Fellay's letter]; [http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/2009-williamson_to_be_charged.htm Schmidberger's statement]&lt;/ref&gt; and Bishop Fellay, as superior general of the Society, "prohibited him, pending any new orders, from taking any public positions on political or historical questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncronline3.org/drupal/?q=node/3182|title=Ncronline3.org|website=ncronline3.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the SSPX authorities have thus distinguished Williamson's views from those of the Society, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] has accused the Society of St. Pius X of being "mired in anti-Semitism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Interfaith/Society_Saint_Pius_X.htm The Society of St. Pius X: Mired in Anti-Semitism]&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], has said it would be misleading to consider Williamson an isolated case: Father [[Florian Abrahamowicz]], who after being the superior in Italy has since been expelled from the Society also said he was not sure the Nazis had used gas chambers for anything other than disinfection, seemed to cast doubt on the number of six million Jews killed, complained that the Jews had exalted the Holocaust above other genocides, and called the Jews first "the people of God" and then the "people of [[deicide]]", to be converted to [[Jesus Christ]] at the [[end times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncrcafe.org/node/2382 The Lefebvrite case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202092837/http://ncrcafe.org/node/2382 |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson was forced out of the SSPX on 23 October 2012 for the "common good of the society", following his refusal to submit to the group's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Paul Touvier===
On 24 May 1989 [[Paul Touvier]], a former [[secret police]] official for Petain's Government, was arrested in a Society [[priory]] in [[Nice]]. The SSPX stated at the time that Touvier had no link to the Society and had been allowed to stay at the Priory as "an act of charity to a homeless man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelusonline.org/print.php?sid=831 AngelusOnline Page 831] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040757/http://www.angelusonline.org/print.php?sid=831 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Touvier was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for the 1944 [[summary execution]] of seven Jews at [[Rillieux-la-Pape]]. The massacre was a  [[reprisal]] for the French [[Maquis (WWII)|Resistance]]'s killing of Petain's Propaganda minister [[Philippe Henriot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/touvier-obit.html|title=Paul Touvier, 81, French War Criminal|website=www.writing.upenn.edu|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his death in 1996, a [[Requiem Mass]] for the repose of Touvier's soul was offered by Father [[Philippe Laguérie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/portrait/010162986-vade-retro-soutanas|title=Vade retro soutanas|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2017-07-11|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; an SSPX priest who was then the Rector of the Parisian church of [[St Nicolas du Chardonnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncronline3.org/drupal/?q=node/3180|title=Ncronline3.org|website=ncronline3.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fr. Aulagnier, however, Fr. Laguerie subsequently left the Society and founded the [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]] with Papal approval.

===Southern Poverty Law Center report===
The SSPX was also accused of anti-Semitism in a 2006 report on [[Traditionalist Catholic]]ism published by the legal advocacy organization [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. Defenders of the SSPX have strongly criticised the report and accused the SPLC of using accusations of anti-Semitism as a means of "silencing opponents of [[liberalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive.2007-0228-liberal_inquisition.htm|title=The Liberal Inquisition|website=www.remnantnewspaper.com|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsletters and websites===
The society was reported to have perpetuated the [[Jewish deicide]] and [[List_of_conspiracy_theories#Jewish_world_domination|Jewish world domination plot]] [[Antisemitic canard|canards]] in its official newsletters and on several of its websites internationally (although the offending websites have been removed since the controversy surrounding the bishops' reinstatement).&lt;ref&gt;Liphshiz, Cnaan. [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1065467.html "Report: Vatican readmits society that propagates anti-Semitism."] ''[[Haaretz]]''. 29 May 2009. "The [web]site from Germany ... clarifies that 'contemporary Jews are for sure guilty of the murder of God, as long as they don't recognize Christ as God.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

The website of the SSPX in the United States carried a 1997 ''The Angelus'' article titled "The Mystery of the Jewish People in History"&lt;ref name="SSPX Crowdy Novak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sspx.org/against_the_sound_bites/mystery_of_the_jews.htm |title=The Mystery of the Jewish People in History |year=1997 |last1=Crowdy |first1=Michael |last2=Novak |first2=Kenneth |work=Against the Sound Bites |publisher=Society of Saint Pius X |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214005445/http://sspx.org/against_the_sound_bites/mystery_of_the_jews.htm |archivedate=14 February 2006 |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''Overland Express'' of Melbourne said "methodically repeats every slur of medieval anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/01/27/forget-backman-meet-the-popes-anti-semite/?wpmp_switcher=mobile&amp;wpmp_tp=1 |title=Forget Backman — meet the Pope’s anti-semite |work=Crikey |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was written by British priests Michael Crowdy and Kenneth Novak.&lt;ref name="SSPX Crowdy Novak"/&gt;

==Statements by SSPX clerics about the Church authorities==

One of the Society's four bishops, [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], has stated that Pope Benedict XVI "has professed heresies in the past!  He ... has never retracted his errors.  When he was a theologian, he professed heresies, he published a book full of heresies."&lt;ref name="truerestore"&gt;[http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive-2006-0430-tissier.htm Stephen L. M. Heiner's Interview with Bishop Bernard Tissier de Mallerais], of the Society of St. Pius X, for the print version of the ''Remnant'', Sunday, April 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same interview, Bishop Mallerais said of the Second Vatican Council: "You cannot read Vatican II as a Catholic work. It is based on the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]. ...I will say, one day the Church should erase this Council. She will not speak of it anymore. She must forget it. The Church will be wise if she forgets this Council."&lt;ref name="truerestore" /&gt;

Similarly, Bishop Richard Williamson has said of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: "His past writings are full of [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist]] errors. Now, Modernism is the synthesis of all heresies ([[Pascendi dominici gregis|''Pascendi'']], [[Pope St. Pius X]]). So Ratzinger as a heretic goes far beyond [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s Protestant errors, as Bishop Tissier de Mallerais said." Williamson added that the documents of the Second Vatican Council "are much too subtly and deeply poisoned to be reinterpreted. The whole of a partly poisoned cake goes to the trash can!"&lt;ref&gt;«Ses écrits passés sont pleins d'erreurs modernistes. Or, le modernisme est la synthèse de toutes les hérésies (''Pascendi'', saint Pie X). Donc, comme hérétique, Ratzinger dépasse de loin les erreurs protestantes de Luther comme l'a très bien dit Mgr Tissier de Mallerais.» Mgr Williamson estime encore que les actes du concile Vatican II «sont beaucoup trop subtilement et profondément empoisonnés pour qu'il faille les réinterpréter. Un gâteau en partie empoisonné va tout entier à la poubelle!».{{cite web |url=http://qien.free.fr/2007/200701/20070128_chiron.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003081932/http://qien.free.fr/2007/200701/20070128_chiron.htm |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SSPX and Scouting==
A number of groups whose following overlaps with that of the SSPX, such as the [[Scouts d'Europe]], have been accused of extremist leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Les Petits Soldats du Scoutisme, Le Monde, 2 septembre 1998, par Roland-Pierre Paringaux.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the ''Association Française de Scouts et Guides Catholiques'' faced international scrutiny following an accident at Perros-Guirec that claimed the lives of four [[Sea Scout|marine Scouts]] and of a sailor who died in an attempt to save them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/intcatho.htm |title=Le drame de Perros-Guirec, une fatalité ? |author=Mickael Tussier |date=6 August 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A media frenzy followed, and it was alleged that Fr. Cottard, the SSPX priest responsible for the children, had subjected them to a harsh disciplinary regimen, forcing them to spend the night before their deaths sleeping on a pebbled beach. Fr. Cottard had also failed to call the emergency services for almost 8 hours, and did not take basic safety precautions such as properly checking the weather forecast.

==Erich Priebke==
When former S.S. Captain [[Erich Priebke]] died in October 2013, the Diocese of Rome forbade a Requiem Mass for him. The reasons cited were Priebke's involvement in murdering 335 Italians in the 1944 [[Ardeatine Massacre]] and his subsequent lack of remorse. SSPX offered to hold a funeral and issued a statement on their website saying, "A Christian who was baptized and received the sacraments of confession and the Eucharist, no matter what his faults and sins were, to the extent that he dies reconciled with God and the church, has a right to the celebration of the holy Mass and a funeral." Nevertheless the ceremony was not held due to 500 protesters outside the SSPX headquarters in Albano. The lawyer, Paolo Giachini, told reporters outside the SSPX headquarters that the funeral Mass had not taken place, but that he had fulfilled his obligation to arrange a funeral. "Now it's up to the authorities to decide what to do with the body," since he was unable to find a city where Priebke could be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ncronline.org/news/global/nazi-war-criminals-sspx-funeral-stopped-protests|title=Nazi war criminal's SSPX funeral stopped by protests|date=2013-10-16|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of abuse cover-up==
On 5 April 2017 ''[[Uppdrag Granskning]]'', a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, reported that four different clerics of the SSPX – three priests and a former seminarian – had molested at least a dozen young people in several different countries.&lt;ref name="ipppavagh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=31222|title=SSPX accused of abuse cover-up : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/new-cover-ups-of-assaults-by-catholic-priests|accessdate=2018-10-16|date=2017-04-05|title=New cover-ups of assaults by Catholic priests|publisher=SVT Nyheter Gransking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sveriges Television|SVT Nyheter]]|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/pope-helped-sspx-after-scandal-with-holocaust-denying-bishop|accessdate=2018-10-16|date=2017-04-05|title=Pope helped SSPX after scandal with Holocaust-denying bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program also stated  that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry.&lt;ref name=ipppavagh /&gt;

==Other controversies==
In February 2008 [[St. Mary's College, Kansas|Saint Mary's Academy]], a school in [[Kansas]] affiliated with the SSPX, refused to allow a woman referee to officiate at a high-school basketball game in which St. Mary's was participating, reportedly on the grounds that it was not appropriate for a woman to be in a position of authority over male students. In response, the other referees refused to referee the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4305675|title=Female Ref Banned From Boys' Game|last=|first=|date=2008-02-18|work=[[Good Morning America]]|publisher=ABCNews|accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school issued a statement denying that the refusal was due to the reported reason. It stated instead that "[the] formation of adolescent boys is best accomplished by male role models," and that "teaching our boys to treat ladies with deference, we cannot place them in an aggressive athletic competition where they are forced to play inhibited by their concern about running into a female referee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smac.edu/?0208PressRelease|title=St. Mary's Academy &amp; College|website=www.smac.edu|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Our Lady of Sorrows Academy in Phoenix, Arizona, also affiliated with the SSPX, forfeited the Arizona Charter Athletic Association state baseball championship game rather than play against a team with a female player. The opposing team, from Mesa Preparatory Academy of Mesa, Arizona, included Paige Sultzbach, playing infield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/preps/articles/2012/05/09/20120509school-balks-over-having-face-girl-state-title-game.html|title=Phoenix high school baseball team balks over having to face team with a girl in title game|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials at Our Lady of Sorrows issued a statement saying that the decision to forfeit was consistent with a policy prohibiting co-ed sports. They stated that school teaches boys respect by not placing girls in athletic competition, where "proper boundaries can only be respected with difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/baseball/story/_/id/7918407/girl-baseball-player-15-cited-opponent-forfeit-phoenix|title=Team forfeits due to female opponent|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cyprus v. Turkey''''' (2001) (No. 25781/94) is a case raised by [[Cyprus]] against [[Turkey]] in 1994 and decided on merits by the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2001. It concerns the situation existing in [[northern Cyprus]] after 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] and the [[De facto]] separation of the [[Mediterranean]] island.

==Judgment==

On the accountability, the Court held, by sixteen votes to one, referring to its [[Loizidou v. Turkey]] judgment, that the facts complained of fell within the jurisdiction of Turkey and therefore entailed Turkey's responsibility.

On the merits, the Court held with differing divisions of votes (in most cases either unanimously or by 16 votes to 1):
* that there had been 14 violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by Turkey:
**Violations of Articles 3 and 5 concerning Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives;
**Violations of Articles 8, 13 and P1-1 concerning home and property of displaced Greek-Cypriots;
**Violations of Articles 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, P1-1 and P1-2 concerning living conditions of Greek Cypriots in [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpas region]] of northern Cyprus;
**Violation of Article 6, concerning rights of Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus;
* that there had been no violation concerning part of complaints, including all those raised under Articles 4, 11 and 14, and 
* that it was not necessary to consider some complaints, including those under Article P1-3.

Deciding on possible awarding compensation was postponed and the judgment on this issue was adopted on 12 May 2014, ordering Turkey to pay 90,000,000 euros to Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-144151] judgement on compensation (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separate opinions==
Judges Palm (Sweden), [[Jean-Paul Costa|Costa]] (France), [[Karel Jungwiert|Jungwiert]] (Czech Republic), Pantiru (Moldova), [[Egils Levits|Levits]] (Latvia), [[Anatoly Kovler|Kovler]] (Russia), Fuad (Turkey) and Marcus-Helmons (Cyprus) expressed partly dissenting opinions to the judgment on the merits.

15 judges have expressed five concurring or dissenting opinions on the judgment on just satisfaction.

'''Dan Katchongva''' (January 1, 1860 (Old Oraibi) - February 22, 1972 (Hotevilla)) was a [[Hopi]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] traditional leader. Son of Yukiuma, keeper of the Fire Clan tablets, who founded Hotevilla in 1906. He is one of four Hopis (including [[Thomas Banyacya]], [[David Monongye]], and [[Dan Evehema]]) who decided or were appointed to reveal Hopi traditional wisdom and teachings, including the Hopi prophecies for the future, to the general public in 1946, after the use of the first two nuclear weapons on Japan. Katchongva was the eldest of the group of four knowledgeable Hopis, and the first to die. Kachongva was a member of the Sun Clan.

The transcript of a talk by Katchongva recorded January 29, 1970 was published in the traditional Hopi newsletter [http://www.jnanadana.org/hopi/techqua_ikachi_i.html Techqua Ikachi] in 1972, and has been widely republished in books, journals, and on the Internet. 

According to the East West Journal (July 15, 1975) publication of this message, "Dan Katchongva, the Sun Clan leader in Hotevilla village, was told by his father, Yukiuma, that he would live to see the beginning of Purification Day. Dan died in 1972."

Katchongva's talk were also published as a booklet called [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0914838105 "Hopi: A Message for All People"] (White Roots of Peace, 1975).

'''Detchanam''' literally means ''[[south]]'' or ''the land of south''. It is also used to represent the [[Deccan Plateau]] and south [[India]]. In [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the word Detchanam represents the land of [[South India]] with [[Swamithoppe]] as its centre, and including a vast area of land, south-east to [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]].

'''''Di''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|地}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Dì'', &lt;small&gt;[[Wade-Giles|w]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Ti'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "earth") is one of the oldest Chinese terms for the [[earth]] and a key concept or figure in [[Chinese mythology]] and [[Chinese folk religion|religion]]. In [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], ''Di'' is often translated as "Earth" and is mentioned in relationship to its complementary aspect of [[Tian]], most often translated as "Heaven".

==Etymology==
''Dì'' is the modern [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation. The [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation has been reconstructed as ''*lˤej-s''.&lt;ref name="BaxSag"&gt;Baxter, Wm. H. &amp; Sagart, Laurent.

'''Dodona''' ({{IPAc-en|d|oʊ|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|ə}}; [[Doric Greek]]: Δωδώνα, ''Dōdṓna'', [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and [[Attic Greek]]: Δωδώνη,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1996}}, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2329769 "Dodone"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dōdṓnē'') in [[Epirus]] in northwestern [[Greece]] was the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating to the [[2nd millennium BC|second millennium BCE]] according to [[Herodotus]]. The earliest accounts in [[Homer]] describe Dodona as an oracle of Zeus. Situated in a remote region away from the main Greek [[polis|poleis]], it was considered second only to the oracle of [[Delphi]] in prestige.

Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]] and the region where the [[Hellenes]] originated.&lt;ref name="1.14"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1986|p=77}}; Aristotle. ''Meteorologica''. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html 1.14].&lt;/ref&gt; The oracle was first under the control of the [[Thesprotians]] before it passed into the hands of the [[Molossians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|1751|loc=Chapter VIII, "Of the Oracles of Jupiter", p. 265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It remained an important religious sanctuary until the rise of [[Christianity]] during the [[Late Antiquity|Late Roman era]].

==Description==
During classical antiquity, according to various accounts, priestesses and priests in the sacred grove interpreted the rustling of the oak (or beech) leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken. According to a new interpretation, the oracular sound originated from bronze objects hanging from oak branches and sounded with the wind blowing, similar to a [[wind chime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harissis|first=Haralambos|title=A Bronze Wheel from Dodona. The Iynx, the Cauldron and the Music of the Gods|url=https://www.academia.edu/2469561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[N. G. L. Hammond|Nicholas Hammond]], Dodona was an [[oracle]] devoted to a [[Mother Goddess]] (identified at other sites with [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] or [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], but here called [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]]) who was joined and partly supplanted in historical times by the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[God (male deity)|deity]] [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=Hammond39&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1986|p=39: "...Greek gods too, especially Zeus the sky-god, were at home on Mt. Olympus and in Pieria, and the Zeus of Dodona derived his importance from the Bronze Age when he displaced a Mother Goddess and assimilated her as Aphrodite."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Sacrificial hammer Dodona Louvre Br1183 n2.jpg|thumb|Sacrificial hammer from Dodona. Bronze, 7th century BC. Louvre Museum]]
Although the earliest inscriptions at the site date to c. 550–500 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lhôte|2006|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeological excavations conducted for more than a century have recovered artifacts as early as the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eidinow|2014|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Tandy|2001|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; many now at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]], and some in the archaeological museum at nearby [[Ioannina]]. There was an ancient tradition that Dodona was founded as a colony from the city, also named [[Dodona (Thessaly)|Dodona]], in [[ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''sub voce'' Δωδώνη}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cult activity at Dodona was already established in some form during the Late Bronze Age (or Mycenaean period).&lt;ref name=Eidinow/&gt; During the post-Mycenaean period (or "[[Greek Dark Ages]]"), evidence of activity at Dodona is scant, but there is a resumption of contact between Dodona and southern Greece during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] (8th century BCE) with the presence of bronze votive offerings (i.e. [[tripod]]s) from southern Greek cities.&lt;ref name=Eidinow&gt;{{harvnb|Eidinow|2014|pp=62–63: "There appears to be evidence for contact between Epirus and Mycenean culture from the early and middle Bronze Age (mostly ceramic), with most evidence dating to the late Bronze Age and including as well as pottery remains, weaponry (swords and double-axes), tools and jewellery, and imports from the Europe and the Near East. Objects and archaeological remains at the site of Dodona suggest that there was already some kind of cult activity there in the late Bronze Age. There is little evidence for the Dark Age period (1200/1100-730/700 BC), but contact between the area and cities in South Greece seems to resume in the eighth century (with the foundation of Kassopeia in 730-700 BC by Elis, and settlements by Corinth, including Ambracia, Anaktorion Epidamnus and Apollonia, 650/630 BC); and this is supported by the appearance at Dodona of bronze votive offerings from the south of Greece, dating to the end of the eighth century, and beginning with the pervasive tripod, but going on through the archaic period to encompass a variety of animal, human and divine imagery."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists also have found [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] dedications and objects that were received by the oracle during the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=653}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|1976|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 650 BCE, Dodona was a religious and oracular centre mainly for northern tribes: only after 650 BCE did it become important for the southern tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|pp=272–273}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zeus]] was worshipped at Dodona as "Zeus Naios" or "Naos" (god of the spring below the oak in the [[Temenos|''temenos'' or sanctuary]], cf. [[Naiad]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kristensen|1960|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Tarn|1913|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Zeus Bouleus" (Counsellor).&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]]: ''bouleus''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]], the worship of Jupiter (Zeus) at Dodona was set up by [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html Pyrrhus].&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mention of Dodona is in [[Homer]], and only Zeus is mentioned in this account. In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (circa 750 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''Iliad'', 16.233-16.235.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles prays to "High Zeus, Lord of Dodona, [[Pelasgian]], living afar off, brooding over wintry Dodona" (thus demonstrating that Zeus also could be invoked from a distance).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lattimore translation.&lt;/ref&gt; No buildings are mentioned, and the priests (called ''[[Selloi]]'') slept on the ground with unwashed feet.&lt;ref name="Bunson1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Sacks|Murray|Bunson|1997|loc="Dodona", p. 85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No priestesses are mentioned in Homer.

The oracle also features in another passage involving Odysseus, giving a story of his visit to Dodona. Odysseus's words "bespeak a familiarity with Dodona, a realization of its importance, and an understanding that it was normal to consult Zeus there on a problem of personal conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gwatkin, Jr.|1961|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of this story are as follows. Odysseus says to the swineherd Eumaeus&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''Odyssey'', 14.327-14.328.&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly giving him a fictive account) that he (Odysseus) was seen among the Thesprotians, having gone to inquire of the oracle at Dodona whether he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret (as the disguised Odysseus is doing). Odysseus later repeats the same tale to Penelope, who may not yet have seen through his disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''Odyssey'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, Dodona was originally an oracle of the [[Mother Goddess]] attended by priestesses. She was identified at other sites as [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] or [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. The oracle also was shared by [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] (whose name simply means "deity"). By classical times, Dione was relegated to a minor role elsewhere in classical Greece, being made into an aspect of Zeus's more usual consort, [[Hera]] — but never at Dodona.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenberg|2007|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many dedicatory inscriptions recovered from the site mention both "Dione" and "Zeus Naios".

According to some archaeologists, not until the 4th century BCE, was a small stone temple to Dione added to the site. By the time [[Euripides]] mentioned Dodona (fragmentary play ''Melanippe'') and Herodotus wrote about the oracle, the priestesses appeared at the site.

===Classical Greece===
[[File:Map greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|A map of the main sanctuaries in [[Classical Greece]].]]

Though it never eclipsed the Oracle of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], Dodona gained a reputation far beyond Greece. In the ''Argonautica'' of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] of [[Rhodes]], a retelling of an older story of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], Jason's ship, the "[[Argo]]", had the gift of prophecy, because it contained an oak timber spirited from Dodona.

In c. 290 BCE, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|King Pyrrhus]] made Dodona the religious capital of his domain and beautified it by implementing a series of construction projects (i.e. grandly rebuilt the Temple of Zeus, developed many other buildings, added a festival featuring athletic games, musical contests, and drama enacted in a theatre).&lt;ref name="Bunson1997" /&gt; A wall was built around the oracle itself and the holy tree, as well as temples to Dione and [[Heracles]].

In 219 BCE, the [[Aetolia]]ns, under the leadership of General Dorimachus, invaded and burned the temple to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakaris|1971|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|2006|p=240}}; {{harvnb|Sacks|Murray|Bunson|1997|loc="Dodona", p. 85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 3rd century BCE, King [[Philip V of Macedon]] (along with the Epirotes) reconstructed all the buildings at Dodona.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sacks|Murray|Bunson|1997|loc="Dodona", p. 85}}; {{harvnb|Dakaris|1971|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 167 BCE, Dodona was destroyed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sacks|Murray|Bunson|1997|loc="Dodona", p. 85}}; {{harvnb|Dakaris|1971|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (led by Aemilius Paulus&lt;ref name="Pentreath1964"&gt;{{harvnb|Pentreath|1964|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was later rebuilt by Emperor [[Augustus]] in 31 BCE. By the time the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] visited Dodona in the 2nd century CE, the sacred grove had been reduced to a single oak.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', 1.18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 241 CE, a priest named Poplius Memmius Leon organized the Naia festival of Dodona.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakaris|1971|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 362 CE, [[Emperor Julian]] consulted the oracle prior to his military campaigns against the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakaris|1971|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Fontenrose|1988|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrims still consulted the oracle until 391-392 CE when [[Emperor Theodosius]] closed all pagan temples, banned all pagan religious activities, and cut down the ancient oak tree at the sanctuary of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flüeler|Rohde|2009|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the surviving town was insignificant, the long-hallowed pagan site must have retained significance for Christians given that a Bishop Theodorus of [[Bodone|Dodona]] attended the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431 CE.&lt;ref name="Pentreath1964" /&gt;

==Herodotus==
[[File:Plan Dodona sanctuary-en.svg|thumb|Plan of the sanctuary, as it developed up to the Roman period. #16 on this map is the Christian Basilica that occupies the site of the former Zeus temple.]]

Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenberg|2007|pages=29–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Histories'' 2:54–57) was told by priests at Egyptian [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]] in the 5th century BCE "that two [[priest]]esses had been carried away from Thebes by [[Phoenicians]]; one, they said they had heard was taken away and sold in [[Libya]], the other in Hellas; these women, they said, were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries." The simplest analysis of the quote is: Egypt, for Greeks as well as for Egyptians, was a spring of human culture of all but immeasurable antiquity. This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by [[Phoenicia]]n culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say "[[sibyl]]s" – were women.

[[Herodotus]] follows with what he was told by the prophetesses, called ''[[peleiades]]'' ("doves") at Dodona:
{{quote|that two black doves had come flying from Thebes in [[Egypt]], one to Libya and one to Dodona; the latter settled on an oak tree, and there uttered human speech, declaring that a place of divination from Zeus must be made there; the people of Dodona understood that the message was divine, and therefore established the oracular shrine. The dove which came to Libya told the Libyans (they say) to make an oracle of Ammon; this also is sacred to Zeus. Such was the story told by the Dodonaean priestesses, the eldest of whom was Promeneia and the next Timarete and the youngest Nicandra; and the rest of the servants of the temple at Dodona similarly held it true.}}

In the simplest analysis, this was a confirmation of the [[oracle#Egypt|oracle]] tradition in Egypt. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. Was the ''pel-'' element in their name connected with "black" or "muddy" root elements in names like "Peleus" or "Pelops"? Is that why the doves were black?

Herodotus adds:

{{quote|But my own belief about it is this. If the Phoenicians did in fact carry away the sacred women and sell one in Libya and one in Hellas, then, in my opinion, the place where this woman was sold in what is now Hellas, but was formerly called [[Pelasgian|Pelasgia]], was [[Thesprotia]]; and then, being a slave there, she established a shrine of Zeus under an oak that was growing there; for it was reasonable that, as she had been a handmaid of the temple of Zeus at Thebes, she would remember that temple in the land to which she had come. After this, as soon as she understood the Greek language, she taught divination; and she said that her sister had been sold in Libya by the same Phoenicians who sold her.

I expect that these women were called 'doves' by the people of Dodona because they spoke a strange language, and the people thought it like the cries of birds; then the woman spoke what they could understand, and that is why they say that the dove uttered human speech; as long as she spoke in a foreign tongue, they thought her voice was like the voice of a bird. For how could a dove utter the speech of men? The tale that the dove was black signifies that the woman was Egyptian.}}

Thesprotia, on the coast west of Dodona, would have been available to the seagoing Phoenicians, whom readers of Herodotus would not have expected to have penetrated as far inland as Dodona.

==Strabo==
According to [[Strabo]], the oracle was founded by the Pelasgi:&lt;ref name="Strabo7.7"&gt;Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text%3Fdoc%3DStrab.%25207.7 7.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This oracle, according to Ephorus, was founded by the Pelasgi. And the Pelasgi are called the earliest of all peoples who have held dominion in Greece.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site of the oracle was dominated by Mount [[Tomaros]], the area being controlled by the [[Thesprotians]] and then the [[Molossians]]:&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://www.theoi.com/Cult/ZeusDodonaiosCult.html 7.7.9ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient times, then, Dodona was under the rule of the Thesprotians; and so was Mount Tomaros, or Tmaros (for it is called both ways), at the base of which the temple is situated. And both the tragic poets and [[Pindar]]os have called Dodona 'Thesprotian Dodona.' But later on it came under the rule of the Molossoi.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Pindar, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:&lt;ref name="Strabo7.7"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pindar also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in [[Thessaly]]:&lt;ref name="Strabo7.7"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about [[Scotussa]] (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called [[Thessalia]] [[Pelasgiotis]]), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a fragment of Pindar we find the following:&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''Fragments'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7Fragments*.html#ref476 Book VII].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called "peliai" and old men "pelioi," as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries "peligones" (compare the ''gerontes''&lt;ref&gt;This was the name of the senators at Sparta, meaning 'the elders'.&lt;/ref&gt; among the Laconians and the Massaliotes). And this, it is said, is the origin of the myth about the pigeons [peleiades] in the Dodonaean oak-tree.&lt;ref&gt;The similarity of these two words is pointed out here.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other commentaries==
According to [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb]], the epithet ''Neuos'' of Zeus at Dodona primarily designated "the god of streams, and, generally, of water". Jebb also points out that [[Achelous]], as a water deity, received special honours at Dodona.&lt;ref name=Jeb202&gt;{{harvnb|Jebb|1892|loc=Appendix, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=btdHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 p. 202, Note #4]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the oracle was quite swampy, with lakes in the area and reference to the "holy spring" of Dodona may be a later addition.

Jebb mostly follows Strabo in his analysis. Accordingly, he notes that the Selloi, the prophets of Zeus, were also called ''tomouroi'', which name derived from Mount Tomares. ''Tomouroi'' was also a variant reading found in the ''[[Odyssey]]''.

According to Jebb, the Peleiades at Dodona were very early, and preceded the appointment of [[Phemonoe]], the prophetess at Delphi.&lt;ref name=Jeb202/&gt; The introduction of female attendants probably took place in the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eidinow|2014|loc=p. 64: "But from the fifth century the sanctuary appears to have been managed by priestesses, and this may indicate some sort of reorganization in the intervening period."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of change is clearly prior to Herodotus (5th century BC), with his narrative about the doves and Egypt.

[[Aristotle]] (''[[Meteorologica]]'', 1.14) places 'Hellas' in the parts about Dodona and the Achelous and says it was inhabited by "the Selloi, who were formerly called Graikoi, but now Hellenes."&lt;ref name="1.14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guest272&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|1883|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510017026078;view=1up;seq=310 272]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative reading of ''Selloi'' is ''Helloi''. Aristotle clearly uses "Dodona" as the designation of the whole district in which the oracle was situated. Thus, according to some scholars, the origin of the words "Hellenes" and "Hellas" was from Dodona.&lt;ref name=Guest272/&gt; Also, the word "Greece" may have been derived from this area.

'''Dream Yoga''' or '''Milam'''&lt;ref&gt;Dream Yoga is also known as ''[[Jangwa]]'', ''[[Gyurwa]]'' and ''[[Pelwa]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Standard Tibetan language|Standard Tibetan]]: ''rmi-lam'' or ''nyilam''; {{lang-sa|स्वप्नदर्शन}}, ''svapnadarśana'')&lt;ref&gt;Svarpnadarshana may be [[parse]]d into [[svarpna]] and [[darshana]].&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[Yoga]] of the Dream State—is a suite of advanced tantric [[sadhana]] of the entwined [[Mantrayana]] lineages of [[Dzogchen]] ([[Nyingmapa]], [[Ngagpa]], [[Mahasiddha]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Bönpo]]).  Dream Yoga are tantric processes and techniques within the [[trance]] [[Bardo]]s of Dream and Sleep ({{lang-bo|script=latn|mi-lam bardo}}) [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].
In the tradition of the tantra, Dream Yoga method is usually passed on by a qualified teacher to his/her students after necessary initiation. Various Tibetan [[lama]]s are unanimous that it is more of a passing of an enlightened experience rather than any textual information.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In a footnote on '[[Zhitro]]' (Tibetan: ''zhi khro'') Namdak &amp; Dixey, ''et al.'' (2002: p.&amp;nbsp;124) identify that the 'dream body' and the 'bardo body' is the 'vision body' (Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/yid_lus yid lus]''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the bardo one has...the ''yilu'' (''yid lus''), the vision body (''yid'', consciousness; ''lus'', body). It is the same as the body of dreams, the mind body."&lt;ref&gt;Lopön Tenzin Namdak and Dixey, Richard (2002). ''Heart Drops of Dharmakaya:  Dzogchen Practice of the Bön Tradition''.

==Traditions, transmissions and lineages==

Shugchang, ''et al.'' (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;17) frames the importance of dreams and dream yoga in relation to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and [[gyulu]] of the Buddhist tradition originating from [[Buddha Shakyamuni]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Buddha Shakyamuni often told his disciples to regard all phenomena as dreams. He used many examples, like an echo, a city in the clouds or a rainbow to illustrate the illusory nature of the phenomenal world. Dreams represent just one type of illusion. The whole universe arises and dissolves like a mirage. Everything about us, even the most enlightened qualities, are also dreamlike phenomena. There's nothing that is not encompassed within the dream of illusory being; so in going to sleep, you're just passing from one dream state to another.&lt;ref&gt;Shugchang, Padma (editor); Sherab, Khenchen Palden &amp; Dongyal, Khenpo Tse Wang (2000). ''A Modern Commentary on Karma Lingpa's Zhi-Khro: teachings on the peaceful and wrathful deities''. Padma Gochen Ling. Source: [http://www.turtlehill.org/khen/zhikhro.pdf] (accessed: December 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Padmasambhava]] (c. 8th century) received the transmission he codified as The Yoga of the Dream State from the [[mindstream]] of the mysterious [[siddha]]-[[yogi]] [[Lawapa]] (c. 10th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plotinus.com/copyright_notice_copy.htm Ouzounian, Alice] (2003).

===Kagyu lineage===
In the [[Kagyu]] 'Lineage of the Four Commissioners' (Tibetan: ''Ka-bab-shi-gyu-pa''), the lineage stream of Dream Yoga is identified as originating from the [[Dharmakaya]] Buddha [[Vajradhara]]. The Dharmakaya, synonymous with Vajradhara Buddha, is the source of all the manifestations of enlightenment. From Caryapa, [[Tilopa]] (988 – 1069 CE) of the Dzogchen [[Kham]] lineage, "received the oral instructions on Dream yoga according to the method of the [[Mahamaya-tantra]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Fellowship (2008). ''Biographies: Mahasiddha Sri Tilopa''. Source: [http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/mahasiddha-sri-tilopa.htm] (accessed: January 31, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinpoche, S. (1992). ''Mahamaya Tantra (With Gunavati Commentary by Ratnakara Santi)''. The Rare Buddhist Texts Series No. 10. New Delhi, India: Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies. NB: Critically edited Sanskrit text with Tibetan; in English. "The original Sanskrit text on Mahamayatantra is restored with the help of its Tibetan version and the Sanskrit commentary Gunawati. This small text having three chapters deal with very important subjects such as S[i]ddhis''[sic]'', Classification of Hetu, Phala and Upayatantras, and manifestations of the deity." Source: [http://www.sundeepbooks.com/servlet/sugetbiblio?bno=004864] (accessed: January 31, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  From [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150 – 250 CE), Tilopa received the [[Ösel (yoga)|radiant light]] (Sanskrit: ''prabhasvara'') and [[gyulu|Illusory Body]] (Sanskrit: ''maya deha'') teachings. The Illusory Body, Clear Light and Dream Yoga sadhana are entwined.
[[Düsum Khyenpa]], the First [[Karmapa]], realised the 'absolute [[siddhi]]' of ''[[bodhi]]'' (Sanskrit: बोधि) at the age of 50 whilst engaged in Dream Yoga sadhana.&lt;ref&gt;Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Lineage History, The first Karmapa Düsum Khyenpa. Source: [http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/lineage/kag07.php] (accessed: February 20, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nyingma lineage===
The [[Nyingma]] lineage holds that there are 'Seven transmissions' (Tibetan: ''bka' babs bdun''&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Dictionary (2008). ''Seven transmissions''. Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/seven_transmissions] (accessed: January 31, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;), or 'sacred streams of blessing and empowerment' (Tibetan: ''dam pa'i byin rlabs'') that may iterate the [[mindstream]] of a [[tantrika]]. Transmission is a communion of mindstreams though at the substratum there is a mindstream 'singularity' or 'oneness' (Wylie: ''gcig''). Though the fortuitous [[emergence]] of these seven modalities or channels of transmission may occur in the waking state if the time, space, circumstance and karmic connection is opportune; they may similarly be initiated in a lucid, dream yoga state. One transmission type particularly emphasized in relation to Dream Yoga, symbolism and iconography, and [[trance]] states, is that of 'pure vision' (Tibetan: ''dag snang''&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Dictionary (2008). ''dag snang''. Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/dag_snang] (accessed: January 31, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;) and the perception of [[Sambhogakaya]] [[thoughtform]]s and [[yidam]] [[simulacrum]].

The Nyingma tradition views itself as the fruit of three streams of transmission, one of which is the 'pure vision' which includes Dream Yoga and trance visions within its auspice:
*the 'remote' canonical lineage, transmitted by an uninterrupted line of humans;
*the 'close' lineage of hidden spiritual treasures; and
*the 'profound' lineage of pure vision.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, by Ken (undated). ''Eight Chariots and Four Lineages''. Source: [http://www.stupa.org/buddhism/schools.htm] (accessed: January 31, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exegesis==
Shugchang, ''et al.'' (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;16) whilst explaining [[Zhitro]] discuss the primary importance of [[lucid dreaming]] to the practice of Dream Yoga and pinpoint its four stages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To make the time we spend dreaming more meaningful, we must first recognize that we are dreaming. That is the first exercise. The next step is called transforming the dream; the third is known as multiplying. The fourth practice is to unify the dream with the clear light. Recognizing, transforming, multiplying and unifying the dream with the luminosity of the true nature; these four outline the essential applications of dream yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Shugchang, Padma (editor); Sherab, Khenchen Palden &amp; Dongyal, Khenpo Tse Wang (2000). ''A Modern Commentary on Karma Lingpa's Zhi-Khro: teachings on the peaceful and wrathful deities''. Padma
Gochen Ling. Source: [http://www.turtlehill.org/khen/zhikhro.pdf] (accessed: December 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evans-Wentz describes Tibetan Dream Yoga in his book ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1935) as one of the six subtypes of yoga elaborated by the Tibetan guru [[Marpa Lotsawa|Marpa]] and passed down by his disciple [[Milarepa]]. The author describes six stages of dream yoga. In the first stage, the dreamer is told to become lucid in the dream. In the second stage, the dreamer is instructed to overcome all fear of the contents of the dream so there is the realization that nothing in the dream can cause harm. For instance, the lucid dreamer should put out the fire with his hands and realize fire cannot burn him in the dream. Next, the dreamer should contemplate how all phenomena both in the dream and in waking life are similar because they change, and that life is illusory in both states because of this constant change. Both the objects in the dream and objects in the world in the Buddhist worldview are therefore empty and have no substantial nature. This is the stage of contemplating the dream as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], and equating this sense of maya with everyday experience in the external world. Next, The dreamer should realize that he or she has control of the dream by changing big objects into small ones, heavy objects into light ones, and many objects into one object.

After gaining control over objects and their transformations, in the fifth stage, the dreamer should realize that the dreamer's dream body is as insubstantial as the other objects in the dream. The dreamer should realize that he or she is not the dream body. The dreamer who has gained complete control over dream objects could, for instance, alter the body's shape or make the dream body disappear altogether. Finally, in the sixth stage, the images of deities ([[Buddhas]], [[Bodhisattvas]], or [[Dakinis]]) should be visualized in the lucid dream state. These figures are frequently seen in Tibetan religious art ([[thangkas]]) and used in [[meditation]]. They are said to be linked to or resonate with the clear light of the Void. They can, therefore, serve as symbolic doorways to this mystical state of being (the Void or clear light). The dreamer is instructed to concentrate on these symbolic images without distraction or thinking about other things so that the revelatory side of these symbols will become manifest.

Yuthok ''et al.'' (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;229) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...if we do sadhanas regularly and faithfully we will begin to dream about doing them. In the same way, if we practise illusory body we will begin to dream about it, too. There is a great correspondence between dream yoga and illusory body. The more we think of illusory body, the more dreams we will have. We will see them as dreams, rather than mistaking them for real life. We can do many things in dreams which we are unable to do while awake.&lt;ref name="buddhanet.net"&gt;Yuthok, Choedak (1997).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yuthok ''et al.'' (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;230) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People who have practised dream yoga have been able to visit teachers they missed and travel to lands they never managed to get to in the waking state. The dream state is a very pure state of mind.&lt;ref name="buddhanet.net"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to contemporary Dzogchen teachers [[Namkhai Norbu]], [[Lopön Tenzin Namdak]] and [[Tenzin Wangyal]], the perceived reality and the phenomenal world are considered to be ultimately "unreal"—an "illusion" (refer [[Mahamaya]]):  a [[dream]], a [[phantasmagoria]], a [[thoughtform]]. All appearances and phenomena are a [[dream]] or thoughtform, inter- and intra- reflecting and refracting [[cintamani|jewels]] and [[melong|mirrors]] of possibility and potentiality, "arising in relationships" or "dependent co-arising". These lineages hold it and due to the realisations of the [[sadhana]], that the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not dissimilar, and that in their [[:wikt:quintessential|quintessential]] nature are [[non-dual]].  The non-essential difference between the general dreaming state and the general waking experience is that the latter is generally more concrete and linked with attachments, [[saṅkhāra]] and [[skandha]]; whereas, standard non-lucid dreaming is [[ephemeral]] and [[Passing with time|transient]], and generally culturally reinforced as baseless and empty.  In Dream Yoga, living may become the dream, and the dream may become the living.  Progressing the sadhana may be metaphorically likened to living the scientific hypothesis of a resolved [[Superposition principle|superposition]]. The resolved superposition being a [[mindstream]] conflation of [[Dharmakaya]] with [[Shunyata]] and [[Indra's net]].  The entwined Mantrayana lineages of Nyingmapa, Bonpo, [[Ngagpa]] and [[Mahasiddha]] are saturated with trance and dream transmissions of teachings, doctrine, etcetera that [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]] constructs of time, place and space, these are often called "whispered traditions" and [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]].   Refer [[Lucid living]].

Also according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiences of the intermediate state of [[bardo]] an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created, and another existence begins. Taking stock of [[store consciousness]] is the spontaneous perpetuant and fuel of the [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] process.

The primary aim and foundation of dream practice are to realize during a dream that one is dreaming. Once lucidity has been established the applications are limitless. One can then dream with [[lucid dreaming|lucidity]] and do all sorts of things, such as:  practice [[sadhana]]; receive [[initiation]]s, [[empowerments]] and [[Dharma transmission|transmissions]]; go to different places, [[plane (esotericism)|planes]] and [[loka]]s, communicate with [[yidam]]; dialogue with [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], creatures and people such as [[guru]]; fly; [[shapeshift]], etc. It is also possible to do different yogic practices while dreaming (usually such yogic practices one does in waking state through the product and fruit of sadhana is greatly accelerated due to the learning, play and practice context). In this way, the yogi can have a powerful experience and with this comes an understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions and objects are real and, as a consequence, important. Dream yoga mastery not only assists in the complete realisation of [[shunyata]], but also in the [[Lila (Hinduism)|lila]] of [[Mahamaya]]. When one realises and embodies the [[Shunyata]] Doctrine of [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] [[Shakyamuni]] and [[Nagarjuna]] amongst others forded by Dream Yoga and other advanced sadhana, a complete realisation is imminent and elementary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

[[Namkhai Norbu]] gives advice, that the realization that the life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of emotions, attachments, and ego and then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu (1992), pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judaism|law}}
'''''Halakha''''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɑː|ˈ|l|ɔː|x|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/halacha |work=Dictionary.com |title=Halacha |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|הֲלָכָה}}, {{small|[[Sephardic Hebrew|Sephardic]]:}} {{IPA-he|halaˈχa|}}; also [[Hebrew transliteration|transliterated]] as '''''halacha''''', '''''halakhah''''', '''''halachah''''' or '''''halocho''''') ({{small|[[Ashkenazic Hebrew|Ashkenazic]]:}} {{IPA-he|haˈloχo|}}) is the collective body of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[religious law]]s derived from the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]. Halakha is based on biblical laws or "commandments" (''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'') (traditionally numbered as [[613 commandments|613]]), subsequent [[Talmud]]ic and [[rabbinic law]], and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books, one of the most famous of which is the 16th-century ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (literally "Prepared Table").

''Halakha'' is often translated as "Jewish Law", although a more literal translation might be "the way to behave" or "the way of walking". The word derives from the [[Semitic root|root]] that means "to behave" (also "to go" or "to walk"). ''Halakha'' guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.

Historically, in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''halakha'' served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law – both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religious law|religious]], since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and [[Jewish emancipation]] many have come to view the ''halakha'' as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the pure, written words recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Under contemporary [[Israeli law]], certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to ''halakha''. Some differences in ''halakha'' itself are found among [[Ashkenazi]], [[Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities, such as in [[Beta Israel|Ethiopia]], reflecting the historic and geographic diversity of various Jewish communities within the Diaspora.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The word ''halakha'' is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''halakh'' – "to walk" or "to go".&lt;ref name="EncJudaica"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica |edition=2 |volume=0.8 |chapter=Halakhah |first=Louis |last=Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|252}} Taken literally, therefore, ''halakha'' translates as "the way to walk" rather than "law". The word ''halakha'' refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law.

The term may also be related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|ilku}}'', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ''{{lang|arc|halakh}}'', designating one or several obligations.&lt;ref name="EBR Schiffman"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.academia.edu/23518527/Halakhah_-_Modern_Judaism_from_the_Encyclopedia_of_the_Bible_and_its_Reception_English_ |title=Halakhah |section=Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism |first=Lawrence H. |last=Schiffman |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception |volume=11 |pages=2–8 |publisher=De Gruyter |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Halakha'' is often contrasted with ''[[aggadah]]'' ("the telling"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic [[Exegesis|exegetical]], narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other "non-legal" texts.&lt;ref name="EBR Schiffman"/&gt; At the same time, since writers of ''halakha'' may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. ''Halakha'' also does not include the parts of the [[Torah]] not related to commandments.

''Halakha'' constitutes the practical application of the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] ("commandments") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (the "[[Oral Torah]]") and as codified in the [[Mishneh Torah]] ("Repetition of the Torah") or ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' ("Code of Law").

Because ''halakha'' is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole "official voice", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the [[Jewish diaspora]], Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for ''halakha''.

''Halakha'' has been developed throughout the generations since before 500&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]], in a constantly expanding collection of rabbinic literature initially consolidated in the Talmud. First and foremost, it forms a body of intricate judicial (rabbinical) opinions, legislation, customs, and recommendations, many of them passed down over the centuries, and an assortment of ingrained behaviors, relayed to successive generations from the moment a child begins to speak. It is also the subject of intense [[Torah study|study]] in ''[[yeshiva]]s''.

== The 613 mitzvot ==
{{see also|Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law}}
Broadly, the ''halakha'' comprises the practical application of the 613 ''mitzvot'' in the Torah, as developed in subsequent rabbinic literature. According to the Talmud (''Tractate Makot''),  613 ''mitzvot'' are in the Torah, 248 positive ("thou shall") ''mitzvot'' and 365 negative ("thou shall not") ''mitzvot'', supplemented by seven ''mitzvot'' [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|legislated by the rabbis]] of antiquity.

=== Categories ===
{{Main|Oral Torah|Law given to Moses at Sinai}}
{{See also|Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot}}
Classical [[Rabbinic Judaism]] has two basic categories of laws:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* Laws which are believed to have been revealed by God to the Israelites at Mount Sinai e.g. the Written Torah, also called the [[Law of Moses]], and also elucidations therefrom, known as the [[Oral Torah]]
* Laws of human origin including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.

This division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation. Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.

A second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.

Commandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments ''require'' an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) ''forbid'' a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.

A further division is made between ''chukim'' ("decrees" – laws without obvious explanation, such as ''[[shatnez]]'', the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), ''mishpatim'' ("judgments" – laws with obvious social implications) and ''eduyot'' ("testimonies" or "commemorations", such as the [[Shabbat]] and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.

A different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* Laws in relation to God (''bein adam laMakom'', literally "between a person and the Place"), and
* Laws about relations with other people (''bein adam le-chavero'', literally "between a person and his friend").

Within Talmudic literature, Jewish law is divided into the six orders of the Mishnah, which are categories by proximate subject matter: ''[[Zeraim]]'' ("Seeds") for agricultural laws and prayer, ''[[Moed]]'' ("Festival"), for the Sabbath and the Festivals, ''[[Nashim]]'' ("Women"), dealing primarily with marriage and divorce,'' [[Nezikin]] ''("Damages"), for civil and criminal law,'' [[Kodashim]]'' ("Holy things"), for sacrifices and the [[kashrut|dietary laws]], and ''[[Tohorot]]'' ("Purities") for ritual purity. However, Talmudic texts often deal with laws outside these apparent subject categories. As a result, Jewish law came to be categorized in other ways in the post-Talmudic period.

In the major codes of Jewish law, two other main categorization schemes are found. [[Maimonides]]' ''Mishneh Torah'' divides the laws into 14 sections. The codification efforts that culminated in the ''Shulchan Aruch'' divide the law into four sections, including only laws that do not depend on being physically present in the [[Land of Israel]].

=== Sin ===
[[Judaism]] regards the violation of the commandments, the ''[[mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', to be a sin. The generic Hebrew word for any kind of sin is ''aveira'' ("transgression"). Based on the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) Judaism describes three levels of sin:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* ''Pesha'' – an "intentional sin"; an action committed in deliberate defiance of God's commandments
* ''Avon'' – a "sin of [[lust]] or uncontrollable emotion, committed against one's will, and is not in line with one's true inner desires". It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to defy God
* ''Chet'' – an "unintentional sin"

Relatedly, the three terms – ''chayyav, patur, mutar'' – in the [[Gemara]] (literally: "the finished [word]") and Halakhic codes classify the permissibility of an action or the severity of its prohibition and punishment.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* ''Chayyav'' (חייב), (literally "obligated" or "must") means the ones who transgress the prohibition are responsible for their own criminal actions, so ought to pay the price for them.
* ''Patur'' (פטור) means "exempt" of liability to punishment, but the action is forbidden.
* ''Mutar'' (מותר) means the action is permitted.

Judaism understands that the vast majority of people, aside from those who are termed ''[[Tzadikim]]'' and those termed ''[[Tzadik|Tzadikim gemurim]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: צדיק, "the righteous" and "the completely righteous"), will succumb to sin in their lives. A sin or a state of sin does not condemn a person to damnation;  a road of ''[[teshuva]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: תשובה; repentance, literally: "return") is always present. For some classes of people, this is exceedingly difficult, such as those who commit adultery, as well as those who slander others.

In earlier days, when ancient Jews had a functioning court system (the ''[[beth din]]'' and the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' high court), courts were empowered to administer physical punishments for various violations, upon conviction by [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism#Stringencies of evidence in capital cases|extremely high standards of evidence]], far stricter than those required in western courts today. These punishments included [[execution]], [[corporal punishment (Judaism)|corporal punishment]], [[incarceration]], and [[excommunication]]. However, since the fall of the [[Second Temple]], executions have been forbidden. Since the fall of the [[Jews and Judaism in Europe|autonomous Jewish communities of Europe]], most other punishments also have been discontinued.

Today, then, one's accounts are reckoned solely by [[God]]. The Talmud says that although courts capable of executing sinners no longer exist, the prescribed penalties continue to be applied by Providence. For instance, someone who has committed a sin punishable by stoning might fall off a roof, or someone who ought to be executed by strangulation might drown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.30b |title=Ketubot 30b |work=The William Davidson Talmud |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gentiles and Jewish law ===
The [[Seven Laws of Noah]], also referred to as the Noahide Laws or the Noachide Laws, are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a binding set of laws for the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity.

The development of ''halakha'' in the period before the Maccabees, which has been described as the formative period in the history of its development, is shrouded in obscurity. Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951–52), 1–55) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.&lt;ref name="EncJudaica" /&gt;{{rp|256}}

The boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of ''halakha'' as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of ''halakha'' consulted include:
* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the [[Mishna]] and the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]) with commentaries;
** [[Talmudic hermeneutics]]: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; includes also the rules by which the Halakhot are derived from and established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules by which early Jewish law was derived.
** ''[[Gemara]]'' – the Talmudic process of elucidating the ''halakha''
* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides's [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with its commentaries;
* Regulations and other "legislative" enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:
** ''Gezeirah'' (literally "declaration"): "preventative legislation" of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the [[mitzva|commandments]]
** ''Takkanah'' (literally "Repair", meaning also "Regulation"): "positive legislation", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the [[mitzva|commandments]]
* ''[[Minhag]]'': Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;
* The ''[[responsa|she'eloth u-teshuvoth]]'' (responsa, literally "questions and answers") literature.
* ''Dina d'malchuta dina'' (literally "the law of the king is law"): an additional aspect of ''halakha'', being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.

In antiquity, the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews—rulings of the Sanhedrin became ''halakha''; see [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]]. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow ''halakha'', lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.

Since the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, ''halakha'' has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic ''[[posek]]'' (literally "he who makes a statement", "decisor") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.

Under this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in ''halakha'' not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or [[vow]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Moshe Isserles|Rema]] [[Choshen Mishpat]] Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the ''posek'' handling a then-current question. In addition, the ''halakha'' embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).

Notwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in ''halakha''. Notably, ''poskim'' frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a "change" in ''halakha''. For example, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative ''poskim'' consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by ''halakha'') than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative [[Judaism]] in some cases explicitly interprets ''halakha'' to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see [[#How halakha is viewed today|How halakha is viewed today]] below).

Within certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]. Within [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] has an official [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].

Note that Takkanot, the plural form of ''Takkanah'' above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah ''mitzvot''. (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term ''takkanah'' to refer either ''gezeirot'' or ''takkanot''.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to "uproot matters from the Torah". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (''shev v'al ta'aseh'', literally ''thou shall stay seated and not do''). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e.g. blowing the ''[[shofar]]'' on Shabbat, or taking the ''[[Four Species|lulav and etrog]]'' on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath ''[[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|melakha]]''. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for [[Esther]]'s relationship with [[Ahasuerus]] (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article [[Takkanah]]. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism see [[Conservative halakha]].

=== Historical analysis ===
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally "repeater") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally "measurements", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.

The Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim ("Sages") regarded them as Sinaitic (given by God to the people of Israel at the time of the Sinai presence). Modern historians believe that it is decidedly erroneous to consider the middot as traditional from the time of Moses on Sinai.

The middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. Akiba and Ishmael and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Akiba devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiba, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.

Some scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's ''middot'' (e.g. ''kal vahomer'', literally a combination of the archaic form of the word for "straw" and the word for "clay" – "straw and clay", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those ''middot'' are not Greek in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=Rabbinic interpretation of scripture |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=The Hermeneutic Rules of the ''Aggadah'' |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23506588.pdf |title=Rabbinic methods of interpretation and Hellenistic rhetoric |first=David |last=Daube |journal=Hebrew Union College Annual |volume=22 |year=1949 |pages=239-264 |jstor=23506588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views today ==
{{See also|Talmud#Present day}}
[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is the [[divine law]] as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. The rabbis, who made many additions and interpretations of Jewish Law, did so only in accordance with regulations they believe were given for this purpose to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]], see Deuteronomy 17:11. See [[Orthodox Judaism#Beliefs|Orthodox Judaism, Beliefs about Jewish law and tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vail course explores origins of Judaism |url=https://www.vaildaily.com/news/announcements/vail-course-explores-origins-of-judaism/ |agency=Vail Daily |date=13 July 2015 |quote=“Just as science follows the scientific method, Judaism has its own system to ensure authenticity remains intact,” said Rabbi Zalman Abraham of JLI’s New York headquarters. |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is normative and binding, and is developed as a partnership between people and God based on Sinaitic Torah. While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that ''halakha'' is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See [[Conservative Judaism#Beliefs|Conservative Judaism, Beliefs]].

[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] both hold that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the traditionalist wing of these movements believe that the ''halakha'' represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person.

Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counterproductive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even [[heresy|heretical]], by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.

Humanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe "that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ/ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its internal rigidity, ''halakha'' has a degree of flexibility in finding solutions to modern problems that are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a "sense of continuity between past and present, a self evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VahYCwAAQBAJ |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |first1=John |last1=Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2=Denny |first3=Martin S. |last3=Jaffee |first4=Carlos |last4=Eire |isbn=9780205018253 |edition=2 |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger’s book ''Rabbinic Authority'', the authority that rabbis hold  “derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a ''communal'' decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubenstein |first=Jeffrey L. |title=Michael Berger. ''Rabbinic Authority.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Xii, 226 Pp. |journal=AJS Review |volume=26 |edition=2 |year=2002 |pages=356–359 |doi=10.1017/S0364009402250114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this covenental relationship, rabbis are charged with connecting their contemporary community with the traditions and precedents of the past.

When presented with contemporary issues, rabbis go through a halakhic process to find an answer. The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of [[electricity]] on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to "consult your local rabbi or [[posek]]". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a ''teshuvot'', which is a ''responsa'' that is binding.&lt;ref&gt;Satlow, Michael, and Daniel Picus. “Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.” Lecture. Providence, Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of ''halakha''. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life.  Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the "divine" authority of ''halakha'', traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.

=== Differences between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Orthodox Jews maintain ''halakha'' is derived from the divine law of the Torah (Bible), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. As such it should be adhered to as an unalterable authority. They also believe there are traditional formulas that date back to Moses on how the divine law may be interpreted – see above, "Rules by which early Jewish law was derived". Conservative Jews have varied views regarding the origin of the Torah and its authority today, and believe it can be continuously reinterpreted. Their view of ''halakha'' has given rise to substantial differences in approach as well as result.

==== Orthodox Judaism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Orthodox Jews believe that ''halakha'' is a religious system whose core represents the [[Revelation|revealed]] will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is non-specific, they did so only in accordance with regulations given to them by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]] (see Deuteronomy 5:8–13). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. They were then recorded in the [[Mishnah]], and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history, including today. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]. No rabbi has the right to change Jewish law unless he clearly understands how it coincides with the precepts of the Talmud and later codes of Jewish law. Later commentaries were accepted by many rabbis as final; however, other rabbis may disagree. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Orthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews generally hold that even ''minhagim'' (customs) must be retained and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. [[Modern Orthodox]] authorities are generally more inclined to permit limited changes in customs, and some reconsideration of precedent. All Orthodox authorities, however, agree that only later rabbinical interpretations are subject to reconsideration, and hold that core sources of Divine written and oral law, such as the [[Torah]] the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]], cannot be overridden.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==== Conservative Judaism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
{{Details|Conservative halakha}}
One view held by [[Conservative Judaism]] is that while God is real, the Torah is not the word of God in a literal sense. However, in this view the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. In this view, traditional Jewish law is still seen as binding. Jews who hold to this view generally try to use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are in some cases more willing to change Jewish law in the present.

A key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by ''takkanah'' (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the "driving teshuva", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on [[Mamzer]] status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot]]'' permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the [[the Bible and homosexuality|Bible]] and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the [[role of women in Judaism]], including counting women in the [[minyan]], permitting women to chant from the Torah, and ordaining women as [[rabbi]]s. The latter was accomplished by simple vote on the faculty of the JTS. Orthodox Judaism holds that ''takkanot'' (rabbinical decrees) can only supplement and can never nullify Biblical law, and significant decisions must be accompanied by scholarly responsa citing sources and halakhic precedent.

An example of how different views of the origin of Jewish law inform Conservative approaches to interpreting that law involves the CJLS's acceptance of rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz's responsum decreeing the Biblical category of ''mamzer'' as "inoperative", in which The CJLS adopted the Responsum's view that of how, in the Conservative view of ''halakha'', the "morality which we learn through the unfolding narrative of our tradition" informs the application of Mosaic law:

{{Quote|We cannot conceive of God sanctioning undeserved suffering ... When a law of Torah conflicts with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant,' we are committed to find a way to address the problem… We are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes when needed on moral grounds. It is our desire to strengthen Torah that forces us to recognize, explicitly the overriding importance of morality, a morality which we learn from the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition}}

The responsum cited several examples of how, in Spitz's view, the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the "trial of the accused adulteress (Sotah)", the "Law of the Breaking of the Neck of the Heifer" and the application of the death penalty for the "rebellious child". Spitz argues that the punishment of the Mamzer has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction (with a few rule-proving counterexamples, including the 18th century Orthodox rabbi Ismael ha-Kohen of Modena, who decreed that a child should have the word "mamzer" tattooed to his forehead). Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on "mamzerut". His motion was passed by the CJLS.

The decision represented a watershed for Conservative Judaism because it represented an explicit abrogation of a Biblical injunction on the grounds of contemporary morality, as distinct from exigency. The dissenters, who included rabbi [[Joel Roth]] as well as a partial concurrence by rabbi Daniel Nevins, argued for reaffirming the classical halakhic framework in which human decrees inform and often limit but never wholly abrogate law believed to be of Divine origin, stating that "we should acknowledge that God's law is beyond our authority to eliminate", but should continue the traditional approach of applying strict evidentiary rules and presumptions that tend to render enforcement unlikely. He also argued that the current framework is moral, both because proving mamzer status sufficiently beyond all doubt is already so difficult that it is rare, and because the mere existence and possibility of mamzerut status, even if rarely enforced, creates an important incentive for divorcing parties to obtain a [[get (divorce document)|get]] (Jewish religious divorce) to avoid the sin of adultery. He cited a responsum by prominent [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Orthodox]] rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]] as an example of how the traditional approach works. Rabbi Yosef was faced with the child of a woman who had left a religious marriage without religious divorce and had a child in the second marriage, seemingly an open-and-shut case of Mamzer status. Rabbi Yosef proceeded to systematically discredit the evidence that the former marriage had ever taken place. The [[Ketubah]] was mysteriously not found and hence disqualified, and the officiating rabbi's testimony was never sufficiently corroborated and hence not credible. Rabbi Yosef then found reason to doubt that the new husband was ever the father, finding that because the ex-husband occasionally delivered alimony personally, an ancient presumption (one of many) that any time a husband and wife are alone together the law presumes intercourse has taken place governed the case. He held that Jewish law could not disprove, and hence had to conclude, that the original husband really was the child's father and there was no case of Mamzer status.

== Codes of Jewish law ==
There are many formal codes of Jewish law that have developed over the past two thousand years. These codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced by, the ''[[responsa]]''; [[History of Responsa]] thus provides an informative complement to the survey below. The Torah and the Talmud are not formal [[code of law|codes of law]] - they are [[source of law|sources of law]].

The major codes of Jewish law:
* The Mishnah, composed by [[Judah haNasi|rabbi Judah the Prince]], in 200&amp;nbsp;CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud's [[dialectic]] analysis of the content of the Mishna (''[[gemara]]''; completed c.&amp;nbsp;500) became the basis for all later [[posek|halakhic decisions]] and subsequent [[codification (law)|codes]].
* [[Codification (law)|Codification]]s by the [[Geonim]] of the halakhic material in the Talmud. An early work, ''She'iltot'' ("Questions") by [[Achai of Shabcha]] (c.&amp;nbsp;752), discusses over 190 ''mitzvot'' – exploring and addressing various questions on these. The first legal [[codex]] proper, ''Halakhot Pesukot'' ("Decided Laws"), by [[Yehudai Gaon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in [[Aramaic language#Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic|vernacular Aramaic]], and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''Hilkhot Riu''). ''Halakhot Gedolot'' ("Great Law Book"), by R.&amp;nbsp;[[Simeon Kayyara]], published two generations later, contains extensive additional material, mainly from [[Responsa]] and [[Monograph]]s of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established [[Ashkenazi]] communities.) The ''She'iltot'' was influential on both subsequent works.
* The ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013–1103), summations of the legal material in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excludes all aggadic (non-legal, homiletic) matter. The ''Hilchot'' soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.
* The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides (1135–1204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system – in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters – with each ''halakha'' stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on [[Metaphysics]] and [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental beliefs]]. (Some claim this section draws heavily on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of [[Saadia Gaon]].) It is the main source of practical ''halakha'' for many [[Yemenite Jews]] – mainly [[Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] – as well as for a growing community referred to as ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|talmidei haRambam]]''.
* The work of ''the Rosh'', rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250?/1259?–1328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the [[Tosafists]]. This work superseded rabbi Alfasi's and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.
* The ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol]]'' (The "SeMaG") of rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (first half of the 13th century, [[Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique|Coucy]], Northern France). "SeMaG" is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and the [[Tosafot]]) and the other codes existent at the time. ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'' ("SeMaK") by [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]] is an abridgement of the ''SeMaG'', including additional practical ''halakha'', as well as agaddic and [[Musar literature|ethical]] material.
* "The Mordechai" – by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]], d.&amp;nbsp;[[Nuremberg]] 1298 – serves both as a source of analysis, as well of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] communities. Although organised around the ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.
* The [[Arba'ah Turim]] (''The Tur'', lit. "The Four Columns") by rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1270–1343, [[Toledo, Spain]]). This work traces the ''halakha'' from the Torah text and the Talmud through the [[Rishonim]], with the ''Hilchot'' of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides's precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the Tur covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author's time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the Tur's arrangement of material.
** [[Orach Chayim]]: "The Way of Life" worship and ritual observance in the home and [[synagogue]], through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.
** [[Yoreh De'ah]]: "Teach Knowledge" assorted ritual prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning [[menstruation|menstrual]] impurity.
** [[Even Ha'ezer]]: "The Rock of the Helpmate" [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and other issues in [[family]] law.
** [[Choshen Mishpat]]: "The Breastplate of Judgment" The administration and [[adjudication]] of civil law.
*The [[Shulchan Aruch|Beit Yosef, and the Shulchan Aruch]] of rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (1488–1575). The ''Beit Yosef'' is a huge commentary on the ''Tur'' in which rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining thirty-two [[posek|authorities]], beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of rabbi [[Israel Isserlein]]). The Shulchan Aruch is, in turn, a condensation of the ''Beit Yosef'' – stating each ruling simply (literally translated, ''Shulchan Aruch'' means "set table"); this work follows the chapter divisions of the Tur. The Shulchan Aruch, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of ''halakha'' since the Talmud. In writing the Shulchan Aruch, rabbi Karo based his [[posek|rulings]] on three authorities – Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered ''the Mordechai'' in inconclusive cases. [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]], generally, refer to the Shulchan Aruch as the basis for their daily practice.
* The works of rabbi [[Moshe Isserles]] ("Rema"; [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], 1525 to 1572). Rema noted that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' was based on the [[Sephardic laws and customs|Sephardic]] tradition, and he created a series of [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and [[Ashkenazi]] [[minhag|customs]] differed (based on the works of [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]], and [[Israel Bruna]]). The glosses are called ''Hamapah'', the "Tablecloth" for the "Set Table". His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the Shulchan Aruch, typeset in a different script; today, "Shulchan Aruch" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles' ''Darkhei Moshe'' is similarly a commentary on the Tur and the Beit Yosef.
* The ''Levush Malkhut'' ("Levush") of rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]] (c. 1530–1612). A ten volume work, five discussing ''halakha'' at a level "midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo's Shulchan Aruch together with the Mappah of Isserles, which is too brief", that particularly stresses the [[minhag|customs and practices]] of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain ''Halakhot'' from a Kabbalistic standpoint.
* The [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] of rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (c. 1800) was an attempt to recodify the law as it stood at that time– incorporating [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch]], and [[History of Responsa#Acharonim|subsequent responsa]] – and thus stating the [[posek|decided ''halakha'']], as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written, partly, so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic groups]], and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike. [[Nathan of Breslov#His own works|''Likutey Halakhot'']] (c. 1800; 'Collected Laws'), also a Hasidic work, follows the order of topics in the Shulchan Aruch, explaining them in the light of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslover]] teachings. It was written by [[Nathan of Breslov]] as based on the teachings of his ''[[rebbe]]'', [[Nachman of Breslov]].
* Works structured directly on the Shulchan Aruch, providing analysis in light of [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] material and codes. The [[Mishnah Berurah]] of rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen]], (the "Chofetz Chaim", Poland, 1838–1933) is a commentary on the "Orach Chayim" section of the Shulchan Aruch, discussing the application of each ''halakha'' in light of all subsequent [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period. [[Aruch HaShulchan]] by rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] (1829–1888) is a scholarly analysis of ''halakha'' through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as ''[[Aruch HaShulchan he'Atid]]''. [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]] on [[Orach Chayim]] and parts of [[Yoreh De'ah]], by the Sephardi sage [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] ([[Baghdad]] and [[Jerusalem]], 1870–1939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. [[Yalkut Yosef]], by rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of ''halakha'', based on the rulings of rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]].
* "[[Layman]] oriented" digests of ''halakha''. The ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' of Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] ([[Hungary]] 1804–1886), based on the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century, became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity. This work is not binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or the Shulchan Aruch. It is still popular in [[Orthodox Judaism]] as a framework for study, if not always for practice. [[Chayei Adam]] and [[Chochmat Adam]] by [[Avraham Danzig]] (Poland, 1748–1820) are similar Ashkenazi works, but are regarded as a more appropriate basis for practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The [[Ben Ish Chai]] by [[Ben Ish Hai|Yosef Chaim]] ([[Baghdad]], 1832–1909) is a corresponding Sephardi work. [[Eliezer Melamed#Published works|''Peninei Halachah'']] by Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]] (15 volumes thus far) covers a wide range of subjects, from shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law - reflecting the customs of various communities - also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot.
* ''Temimei Haderech'' ("A Guide To Jewish Religious Practice") by rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] with contributions from the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]. This scholarly work is based on the previous traditional law codes, but written from a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] point of view, and not accepted among Orthodox Jews.

{{Hinduism}}
{{Eschatology}}
'''Hindu eschatology''' is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], or the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] names of the [[Supreme Being]] in Hinduism and before the age draws to a close, and [[Harihara]] simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe.

The current period is [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen a progressive decline in morality, to the point that in Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]". Each kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by the vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavism. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [[yuga|ages]] continue in a religious [[fractal]] pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite book|last = Hooper| first= Rev.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

==The Four Yugas==
Within the current ''kalpa'', there are four ''yugas'', or epochs, that encompass the evolution of this specific cycle. These ages encompass a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total decay.

* [[Satya Yuga]] lasts 1.728 million years.
* [[Treta Yuga]] lasts 1.296 million years.
* [[Dvapara Yuga]] lasts 864,000 years.
* [[Kali Yuga]] lasts 432,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223140604/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kali Yuga===
[[Kali Yuga]], the last of the four ages, is the one in which we currently reside. This epoch has been foretold to be characterized by impiety, violence, and decay. As written in the [[Puranas|Vishnu Purana]] in 100 BCE:

{{quote|Social status depends not upon your accomplishments, but in the ownership of property; wealth is now the source of virtue; passion and luxury are the sole bonds between spouses; falsity and lying are the conditions of success in life; sexuality is the sole source of human enjoyment; religion, a superficial and empty ritual, is confused with spirituality|Vishnu Purana&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

The fourth age is ruled over by [[Kali (demon)|Kali]], not the goddess [[Kali]] but the [[Kali (demon)|demon Kali]].&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Puranas go on to write that kings in the fourth age will be godless, wanting in tranquility, quick to anger, and dishonest. They will inflict death on women, and children, and will rise and fall to power quickly. Undisciplined barbarians will receive the support of rulers.

From the four pillars of [[dharma]]—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity will be all that remains, although it too will decrease daily. People will commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities will appear. People will not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands of years in the Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Sannyasins will wear red. There will be many false religions, and many will profess false knowledge to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water will be the only definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear clothes of tree bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astrojyoti.com/vishnupurana.htm |title = Vishnu Purana |publisher = Astrojyoti.com |date = |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalki==
{{Main|Kalki}}
[[File:Kalki.jpg|thumb|left|Kalki leading his white horse]]At this time of evil, the final incarnation of Vishnu known as [[Kalki]] will appear on a white horse. He will amass an army of those few pious souls remaining. These, together with all the incarnations of the Godhead (avatars) which have appeared throughout human history, will destroy all demons and sins in the world.

As written in the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;:Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata
:Abhyuthaanam Adharmasya Tadaatmaanam Srjaamy Aham.

:Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha
:And a rise of unrighteousness then I manifest Myself!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m06/m06025.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book 6, Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV, Section 7|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 12 Nov 2012|date = 12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Aditi is the mother of the eight Adityas or solar deities. At the end of creation these eight suns will shine together in the skies. Kalki will amass an army to "establish righteousness upon the earth" and leave "the minds of the people as pure as crystal." Those left, transformed by virtue, will be the new seeds for a higher form of humanity, and humanity will begin again.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Puranas write: {{quote|When the sun and moon, the lunar constellation Tishya, and the planet Jupiter are all in one mansion, the Krita age shall return to the earth.|Hooper, 1508&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

At the completion of [[Kali Yuga]], the next epoch will begin, [[Satya Yuga]], in which everyone will be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma and piety. This, in turn, will be followed cyclically by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will repeat till the larger cycle of existence under [[Brahma]] returns to the singularity and a new universe is born.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last = Browne | first = Sylvia | authorlink = | title = End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World| publisher = | date = | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAOiMl1BIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eschatology |Hindu}}

===Brahma Kumaris===
Within Hinduism, there are more distinguishing scenarios in certain sects. [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] of the [[Brahma Kumari]] has written that their prediction of the imminent end of the world is hidden from non-members.&lt;ref name="Beit-hallahmi2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Beit-hallahmi, B. |date = 2004 |title = Death, Fantasy, and Religious Transformations |journal = The Psychology of Death in Fantasy and History |url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;id=SjIKL5q8HrEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=bkwsu&amp;ots=8JzjGa25Uy&amp;sig=4RWN7gdUstsYI5QCom8I175Nstk |quote = A case study of Brahma Kumaris, a contemporary group characterized by an apocalyptic vision (kept hidden from nonmembers). |accessdate = 2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within their tradition, the majority of the planet is predicted to become submerged beneath the ocean, similar to the [[Ragnarök]] of Nordic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Varughese |first = Suma |url = http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/spirit-centers/bramha-kumari.asp |title = An article on the sect of the Brahma Kumaris in Rajasthan, India |publisher = Lifepositive.com |date =  |accessdate = 2011-11-21 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111128221137/http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/spirit-centers/bramha-kumari.asp |archivedate = 28 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kalagnanam===
Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic tradition, Iblis is often identified with ''[[Shaitan|Al-Shaitan]]'' ("the Devil"). However, while ''Shaitan'' is used exclusively for an evil force, Iblis himself holds a more ambivalent role in Islamic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Campanini ''The Qur'an: The Basics'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9781317796909}} chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming and etymology==

The term ''Iblis'' ({{lang-ar|إِبْلِيس}}) may have been derived from the Arabic verbal root {{sc|bls}} {{lang|ar|ب-ل-س}} (with the broad meaning of "remain in grief")&lt;ref&gt;Ebrahim Kazim ''Scientific Commentary of Suratul Faateḥah'' Pharos Media &amp; Publishing 2010 {{ISBN|978-8-172-21037-3}} page 274&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|ar|بَلَسَ}} ''({{transl|ar|ALA|balasa}}'', "he despaired").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/i/iblis.html|title=Iblis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the name is related to ''talbis'' meaning confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson ''Studies In Islamic Mystic'' Routledge 2013 (first published 1998) {{ISBN|978-1-136-17178-9}} page 120&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|διάβολος}} ''({{transl|grc|diábolos}})'', which is also the source of the English word '[[devil]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/iblis-SIM_3021|title=Iblīs - BrillReference|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no general agreement on the root of the term. The name itself could not be found before the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages Cornell University Press 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49429-1}} page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Although Iblis is often compared to the [[devil]] in [[Christian]] theology, Islam rejects the idea that the devil is an opponent of God.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no mention of Iblis trying to take God's throne.&lt;ref&gt;Vicchio, Stephen J. ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith''. Wipf and Stock. 2008. {{ISBN|9781556353048}}, pages 175-185.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Quran he was banished due to his disdain towards humanity, a narrative already occurring in early [[New Testament apocrypha|apokrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberdina Houtman, Tamar Kadari, Marcel Poorthuis, Vered Tohar ''Religious Stories in Transformation: Conflict, Revision and Reception'' BRILL 2016 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33481-6}} page 66&lt;/ref&gt; As a mere creature, Iblis can not be the cause or creator of evil in the world, he is just a tempter who takes advantage of the inclination of humans to be self-centered and to lead them away from God's path.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mathewes ''Understanding Religious Ethics'' John Wiley &amp; Sons 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-405-13351-7}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quran===
Iblis is mentioned 11 times in the Quran by name, 9 times related to his rebellion against God's command to prostrate himself before Adam. The term [[Shaitan]] is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered across the Quran, in the aggregate the story can be summarized as follows &lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;:

Then God created Adam, He ordered all the [[angels in Islam|angels]] to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his haughtiness, he was banished from heaven and condemned to hell. Therefore, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God grants his request but also warned that he will have no power over God's servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|65|s=ns|q="As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===
[[Sufism]] developed an unusual perspective of Iblis' refusal by regarding [[Muhammed in Islam|Muhammed]] and Iblis as the two true monotheists. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was fully devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the satanic figure, dualism is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[Sufi_metaphysics#Waḥdat_al-Wujūd_(Unity_of_Existence)|unity of existence]] rejecting [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] tendecies. The belief in dualism or that ''Evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by some Sufis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the "Beloved" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].

A famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a [[shaitan|devil]]. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary and his love towards God remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gramlich ''Der eine Gott: Grundzüge der Mystik des islamischen Monotheismus'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 1998 {{ISBN|978-3-447-04025-9}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. B. Lumbard Ahmad al-Ghazali, Remembrance, and the Metaphysics of Love SUNY Press 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-438-45966-0}} page 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all Sufis are in agreement with a positive depiction of Iblis. [[Rumi]]'s viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the [[Seven deadly sins|great sins]] [[pride|haughtiness]] and [[envy]]. He states: "(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam."&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi Annemarie Schimmel SUNY Press 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-791-41635-8}} page 255&lt;/ref&gt; Iblis represents the principle of  "one-eyed" intellect; he only saw the outward earthly form of Adam, but was blind to the Divine spark hidden in him, using an illicit method of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Walī Allāh al-Dihlawī ''Shāh Walī Allāh of Delhi's Hujjat Allāh Al-bāligha'' BRILL 1996 {{ISBN|978-9-004-10298-9}} page 350&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasan of Basra]] holds that Iblis was the first who used "analogy", comparing himself to someone else, this causing his sin. Iblis therefore also represents humans' psyche moving towards sin or shows how love can cause envy and anxiety losing a beloved one.&lt;ref&gt;Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, Rumi ''Collected Poetical Works of Rumi (Delphi Classics)'' Delphi Classics 2015 story XI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam honored.jpg|thumb|upright|Angels bow before the newly created Adam, but Iblis (top right on the picture) refuses to prostrate]]
Islam differs in regard of Iblis' nature. Some scholars such as [[Tabari]], [[Ash'ari]],&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Asin Palacios ''Islam and the Divine Comedy'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-134-53643-6}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Baydawi]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 183&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mahmud al-Alusi]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/handle/123456789/32716/The_nature_of_Iblis_%20in_the_Quran_as_interpreted_by_the_commentators.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt; regard him as an angel. Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.

(. .)

But these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.
Likewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring , because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was &lt;one of the jinn&gt;, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the Quranic exegete [[Ibn Kathir]], preferred to regard him as a jinni, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud M. Ayoub ''Qur'an and Its Interpreters, The, Volume 1, Band 1'' SUNY Press {{ISBN|978-0-791-49546-9}} page 86&lt;/ref&gt;[[Al-Zamakhshari]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/handle/123456789/32716/The_nature_of_Iblis_%20in_the_Quran_as_interpreted_by_the_commentators.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)

(So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn;) meaning, his original nature betrayed him. He had been created from smokeless fire, whereas the angels had been created from light, (. . .)

When matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do. So Allah points out here that he was one of the Jinn, he was created from fire, as He says elsewhere."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theological viewpoints can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iblis is from a type of angel, who was created from fire.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 183&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iblis is a jinni differing from the angels, who are made out of light.
* Once an angel, Iblis turned into a jinn by his act of disobedience.

===As an angel===
{{See also|Azazel}}
As an angel, Iblis is described as an [[Archangel]], the leader and teacher of the other angels, and a keeper of heaven. At the same time, he was the closest to the [[Throne of God]]. God gave him authority over the lower heavens and the earth. Iblis is also considered as the leader of those angels who battled the earthly jinn. Therefore, Iblis and his army drove the jinn to the edge of the world, [[Mount Qaf]]. Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam. He assumed that the angels who ''praise God's glory day and night'' are superior in contrast to the mud-made human and their bodily flaws.&lt;ref&gt;James William Hampson Stobart ''Islam &amp; Its Founder'' Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge 1876 digitized 2006 original: Oxford University page 114&lt;/ref&gt; He even regarded himself superior in comparison to the other angels, since he was (one of those) created from fire. However, he was degraded by God for his arrogance. But Iblis made a request to prove that he is actually right, therefore God entrusted him as a tempter for humanity as long as his punishment endures, concurrently giving him a change to redeem himself.&lt;ref&gt;Jamal J. Elias ''Key Themes for the Study of Islam'' Oneworld Publications 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-780-74684-5}} chapter: Eschatology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel ''Gabriel's Wing: A Study Into the Religious Ideas of Sir Muhammad Iqbal'' Brill Archive 1963 page 212&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his abode in [[Jahannam|hell]] could be a merely temporary place, until the [[Islamic eschatology|Judgement Day]] and after his assignment as a tempter is over, he might return to God as one of the most cherished Angels,&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel ''Gabriel's Wing: A Study Into the Religious Ideas of Sir Muhammad Iqbal'' Brill Archive 1963 page 212&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not necessary.

Furthermore, the transformation of Iblis from angelic into demonic is a reminder of God's capacity to reverse injustice even on an [[ontology|ontological]] level.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a warning and a reminder because the special gifts given by God can also be taken away by him.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a Jinn===
On the other hand, as a jinni, Iblis is commonly placed as one of the jinn, who lived on earth during the battle of the angels. When the angels took prisoners, Iblis was one of them and carried to heaven. Since he, unlike the other jinn, was pious, the angels were impressed by his nobility and Iblis was allowed to join the company of angels and elevated to their rank. However, although he got the outer appeariance of an angel, he was still a jinn in essence, thus he was able to choose when the angels and Iblis were commanded to prostrate themselves before Adam. Iblis, abusing his free-will, disobeyed the command of God. Iblis considered himself superior because of his physical nature constituted of fire and not of clay.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Unal ''The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English'' Tughra Books 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-597-84144-3}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt; God sentenced Iblis to hell forever, but granted him a favor for his former worship, that is to take revenge on humans by attempting to mislead them until the Day of Judgment. Here, Iblis damnation is clear and he and his host are the first who enter hell to  dwell therein forever,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-316-41205-3}} page 141&lt;/ref&gt; when he is not killed in a battle by the [[Mahdi]], an interpretation especially prevalent among [[Shia]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Idelman Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''The Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' Oxford University Press 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-198-03552-7}} page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:Iblis_with_turban.jpg|thumb|right|Another painting of angels prostrating before Adam with Iblis refusing, here depicted with a headcover]]
Illustrations of Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any Satanic figure or heretic, and with a black body, to symbolize his corrupted nature. Another common depiction of Iblis shows him wearing special headcovering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban. In one painting however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic headcovering.&lt;ref&gt;Na'ama Brosh, Rachel Milstein, Muzeʼon Yiśraʼel (Jerusalem) ''Biblical stories in Islamic painting'' Israel Museum 1991 page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis' fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Thaʻlabī, William M. Brinner ''ʻArāʻis al-majālis fī qiṣaṣ al-anbiyā, or: Lives of the prophets, Band 24'' 2002 {{ISBN|978-9-004-12589-6}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputing his essence  ==
[[File:Iblis (The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp).png|thumb|upright|Depiction of Iblis in the [[epic poem]] ''[[Shahnameh]]'']]
Islamic traditions are undecided about the exact nature of Iblis. He may either be a [[fallen angel]] or a [[jinni]] or something entirely unique. These contradictions arise from the Quran itself&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 51 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;, while Iblis is included into the command addressed to the angels and apparently among them, he is identified as a ''jinni'' ('الجِنِّ') in Surah {{cite quran|18|50|s=ns|b=n}}. This combined with the fact, he himself boasts to be created from fire (nar), suggests that he is not an angel but a jinni, since according to ''[[hadith]]'' the angels are created from ''light'' (nur) and the jinn from ''fire'' (nar). But the term ''jinni'' itself is ambiguous. In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] the term denoted any type of invisible creature including angels known from [[Arab Christians]], [[Arab Jews]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zorastrians]].&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Quran does not mention ''light'' as a separate source from which the angels are supposed to be created. In [[Ancient Near East]]ern traditions, the nature of angels was associated with fire, therefore Iblis could indeed be intended to represent an angel, such as a [[Seraphim]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' BRILL 2003 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} Band 3 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; 

Otherwise, the nature of the jinn in later Islamic tradition is not always clear either. Some hold the jinn to be a sub-category of "fiery angels" who are guardians of ''[[Jannah|jannah]]'', differing from the earthly jinn, who are like monsters or demons. Accordingly they are named 'Jinni', because of their relation to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Allen ''Studying Modern Arabic Literature'' Edinburgh University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-474-40349-8}} Notes &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 135&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in another story, the earthen jinn themselves are related to angels. Therefore, they were angels sent down to earth to experience bodily pleasure and although they remained obedient towards God during the beginning, they later found themselves lost in wars, bloodshed, and other unjust deeds. Iblis, disgusted from his fellow beings, prayed for his return to heaven until his prayers were answered.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. KISTER ADAM: ''A STUDY OF SOME LEGENDS IN TAFSIR AND HADIT LITERATURE'' Approaches to the History 0f the Interpretation of The Qur'an, Oxford 1988 S. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming Iblis was one of the jinn, who differ from the angels, scholars tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary earthly creature, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousand of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. To reveal his haughtiness, God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam. But Iblis refused, thus his own nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman ''Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition'' MSA Publication Limited 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-861-79826-8}} page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels. In this case, his stay in heaven is self explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].

Those scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since, angels do not procreate in Islam, pointing at {{cite quran|18|51|s=ns|b=n}}. [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Islamic study scholar]] [[Fritz Meier]] also insist, that the Islamic Iblis can not be hold as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 54 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise [[Walther Eickmann]] argued that the ''progeny of Iblis'' does not correspond with "progeny" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Eickmann ''Die Angelologie und Dämonologie des Korans im Vergleich zu der Engel- und Geisterlehre der Heiligen Schrift'' Eger 1908 p. 27 (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, according to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is indeed an asexuel being just like the other angels.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelwahab Bouhdiba ''Sexuality in Islam'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-03037-7}} page 59&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he occurs as a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, for that he lays eggs, characteristical for [[Shayatin]] (demons).&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.53-54 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran exegete [[Tabari]] however, who defends Iblis' angelic origin,&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&amp;C Black, 18.06.2002 page 16 {{ISBN|978-0-826-44957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts, that Iblis did not procreate until he lost his angelic state and became a demon. Therefore, the fact Iblis has progeny could not exclude him from an angelic origin.

Another central argument to determine Iblis essence, also relating to his theological significance, deals with his disobedience. Since angels are, according to Islam, merely servants of God, Iblis' disobedience speaks against his angelic nature, as opponents of Iblis' angelic origin argue.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the angels, he was endowed with the ability to choose, but he decided to disobey due to his own arrogance. His nature to disregard God is thought of a part of the free-will given to jinn. On the otherhand, scholars who adhere to Iblis' angelic nature, do not regard him as ''free''. Actually Iblis is seen as just another instrument of God, a tester who acts within God's plan.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel ''Gabriel's Wing: A Study Into the Religious Ideas of Sir Muhammad Iqbal'' Brill Archive 1963 page 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Abicht ''Islam &amp; Europe: Challenges and Opportunities'' Leuven University Press 2008 {{ISBN|978-9-058-67672-6}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It would be impossible to act against God's will anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, his disobedience was in accordance with God's will. Several narratives attempt to explain the reason why he choose to refuse the command, unlike the other angels. According to one, Iblis, as the teachers of the angels, was more knowledgeable than the others and knew about a command, not to prostrate himself, when all the other angels do.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn Satan's ''Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Abicht ''Islam &amp; Europe: Challenges and Opportunities'' Leuven University Press 2008 {{ISBN|978-9-058-67672-6}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt; In another narrative, Iblis has stolen the secret writings of heaven, therefore he had insight into the future. Knowing about Adams future, he was no longer able to prostrate himself. However, this narrative is more unconvincing, since other angels protested alike, knowing about the corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt; In another explanation, Iblis is endowed with the task to seduce humans, comparable to other angels, such as [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] is endowed with the transmission of revelation,&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Keeper of Paradise ==
In some interpretations, Iblis is associated with ''light'' that misleads people. Hasan of Basra was quoted as saying: "If Iblis were to reveal his light to mankind, they would worship him as god."&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Ernst ''Words of Ecstasy in Sufism'' SUNY Press 1985 page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, based on Iblis' role as ''keeper of heaven'' and ''ruler of earth'', [[Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani]] stated, Iblis represents the "Dark light" that is the earthen world, standing in opposite to the [[Logos (Islam)|Muhammadan Light]] that represents the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Günther, Todd Lawson ''Roads to Paradise: Eschatology and Concepts of the Hereafter in Islam (2 vols): Volume 1: Foundations and the Formation of a Tradition. Reflections on the Hereafter in the Quran and Islamic Religious Thought'' / Volume 2: Continuity and Change. The Plurality of Eschatological Representations in the Islamicate World Thought (SET) BRILL 2016 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33315-4}} page 569 &lt;/ref&gt; Quzat Hamadani traces back his interpretation to [[Sahl al-Tustari]] and [[Shayban Ar-Ra'i]] who in return claim to derive their opinions from [[Khidr]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Günther, Todd Lawson ''Roads to Paradise: Eschatology and Concepts of the Hereafter in Islam (2 vols): Volume 1: Foundations and the Formation of a Tradition. Reflections on the Hereafter in the Quran and Islamic Religious Thought'' / Volume 2: Continuity and Change. The Plurality of Eschatological Representations in the Islamicate World Thought (SET) BRILL 2016 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33315-4}} page 569 &lt;/ref&gt; Quzat Hamadani relates his interpretation of ''Iblis' light'' to the ''[[shahada]]'': Accordingly, people whose service for God is just superficial, are trapped within the circle of ''la ilah'' (the first part of ''shahada'' meaning "there is no God") just worshipping their [[nafs]] rather than God. Only those who are worthy to leave this circle, can pass Iblis towards the circle of ''illa Allah'' the Divine presence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblis in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Serpents in the Bible|Serpent]] is not mentioned in the Quran, Quranic commentaries as well as the [[Qisas Al-Anbiya|Stories of the Prophets]] added the serpent borrowed from [[Gnostic]] and [[Jewish]] oral tradition circulating in the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Iblis tries to enter the abode of Adam, but the [[Ridwan (angel)|angelic guardian]] keeps him away. Then Iblis invents a plan to trick the guardian. He approaches a peacock and tells him that all creatures will die and the peacock's beauty will perish. But if he gets the fruit of eternity, every creature will last forever. Therefore, the peacock convinces the serpent to slip Iblis into the Garden, by carrying him in his mouth. In the Garden, Iblis speaks through the serpent to Adam and Eve, and tricks them into eating from the forbidden tree. Modern Muslims accuse the [[Yazidis]] of devil-worship for venerating the [[Melek Taus|peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;Birgül Açikyildiz ''The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion'' I.B.Tauris 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-857-72061-0}} page 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Umm al-Kitab (Ismaili book)|Umm al Kitab]], an [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] work offering an [[hermeneutic]] interpretation of the Quran, the ''peacock'' and the ''serpent'' were born after men mated with demonic women.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 738&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Buddhist Film Festival''' ('''BFF''') is a presenter of Buddhist-themed and Buddhist-inspired cinema. IBFF includes films of all kinds: features, documentaries, animation, experimental work, children’s films and television programs.

IBFF offers film as a way for general audiences to develop a wider appreciation and better understanding of [[Buddhism]]. Works to be exhibited are chosen through program committee invitations as well as through an international open call for filmmakers to submit their work for consideration. Films include English language or subtitled works from all over the world. Over twenty nations have been represented by films in IBFF events.

IBFF has been presented in host cities across the globe: Los Angeles 2003, Washington DC 2004, San Francisco 2005, Amsterdam 2006, Singapore 2007, Mexico City 2008, and London 2009.

Presenting partners have included [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA), [[Smithsonian Institution]] (Washington, DC), [[Barbican Centre]] (London), [[Samaya Foundation]] (Mexico City), [[Buddhist Film Festival Europe]] (BFFE) Amsterdam (Holland), [[UC Berkeley]] (California), and [[Asia Buddhist Film Festival]] Pvt. Ltd. (Singapore)

IBFF co-presents programs with other film festivals (Seattle International, SF International, SF Asian American, Asian American (NY), Human Rights Watch (NY/SF/London), I See Films (Milan), Indian Film Festival of LA, SF Latino and others), as well as with presenting institutions including Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (SF), Rubin Museum of Art (NY), Fowler Museum (LA), Rafael Film Center (San Rafael), Smithsonian Institution (DC) and others.

==History==
IBFF is the public program of Buddhist Film Foundation, Inc. (BFF), which was founded in 2000 (the Buddhist Film Society) with the aim of using modern media as a tool for exploring contemporary Buddhist issues and ideas. As Gaetano Maida, the Executive Director of the Foundation said in a 2000 interview (''Inquiring Mind Magazine''), "Since people do not read as much as they used to, transformative ideas need to be offered through the medium of film…
Film) can open the minds of people who would never cross the threshold of a Zen meditation hall, or even a public lecture…BFF’s main goal is to be a resource, serving filmmakers and educators as well as audiences."

BFF has presented or co-presented over 150 films to general audiences in over a dozen cities in eight countries on three continents, with total attendance in excess of 50,000. Associated public events have drawn over 100,000 visitors.

==Festival Media==
Festival Media is the distribution service of the Buddhist Film Foundation. Works from International Buddhist Film Festival presentations are marketed as DVDs through educational and consumer retailers in North America. Proceeds benefit the not-for-profit BFF, the filmmakers, and often, through them, the subjects of their films or other designated charities.

==Buddhist Film Archive==
The first independent Buddhist film archive (BFA) is being developed by BFF on the UC Berkeley campus with the Center for Buddhist Studies. A collection of film prints and master tapes assembled by BFF is the core of an effort to collect, preserve, restore and make available to the public and to researchers and educators the best of Buddhist cinema from the earliest days of motion pictures to the latest digital productions.

This article summarizes the different branches and schools in [[Islam]]. The best known split, into [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shia Islam]], and [[Khawarij|Kharijites]], was mainly political at first but eventually acquired theological and juridical dimensions. There are three traditional types of schools in Islam: [[madhhab|schools of jurisprudence]], [[Sufism|Sufi orders]] and [[Schools of Islamic theology|schools of theology]]. The article also summarizes major denominations and movements that have arisen in the modern era.

== Background ==
{{main|Succession to Muhammad}}
The traditional divisions between the branches of Islam can be traced back to disagreement over who would succeed Muhammad. A few months prior to his death, Muhammad [[The event of Ghadir Khumm|delivered a sermon at Ghadir Khumm]] where he announced that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] would be his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majd|first1=Vahid|title=The Sermon of Prophet Muhammad (saww) at Ghadir Khum}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sermon, Muhammad ordered the Muslims to [[The event of Ghadir Khumm#Oath of allegiance|pledge allegiance to Ali]]. Both [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] sources agree that [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] were among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team |website=Al-Islam.org |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Volume 4 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Razi |first1=Fakhr |title=Tafsir al-Kabir, Volume 12 |pages=49-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just after Muhammad died, a group of Muslims met at [[Saqifa]], where Umar pledged allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]]. Abu Bakr then assumed political power, and his supporters became known as the Sunnis. Despite that, a group of Muslims kept their allegiance to Ali. These people, who became known as Shias, held that while Ali's right to be the political leader may have been taken, he was still the religious and spiritual leader after Muhammad.

Eventually, after the deaths of Abu Bakr and two other Sunni leaders, Umar and Uthman, the Sunni Muslims went to Ali for political leadership. After Ali died, his son [[Hasan ibn Ali]] succeeded him, both politically and, according to Shias, religiously. However, after six months, he made [[Hasan-Muawiya treaty|a peace treaty]] with [[Muawiya I|Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan]], which stipulated that, among other conditions, Muawiya would have political power as long as he did not choose who would succeed him. Muawiya broke the treaty and named his son [[Yazid ibn Muawiya]] his successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nassir|first1=Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir|title=Yazid was Never Amirul Muminin|url=https://www.al-islam.org/yazid-was-never-amirul-muminin-sheikh-abdillahi-nassir|website=Al-Islam.org|publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus forming the [[Umayyad dynasty]]. While this was going on, Hasan and, after his death, his brother [[Husain ibn Ali]], remained the religious leaders, at least according to the Shia. Thus, according to Sunnis, whoever held political power was considered the successor to Muhammad, while according to Shias, [[The Twelve Imams|the twelve Imams]] (Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Husain's descendants) were the successors to Muhammad, even if they did not hold political power.

In addition to these two main branches, many other opinions also formed regarding succession to Muhammad.

== Overview ==
[[File:Islam branches and schools-ar.svg|alt=Ahamdiyya are not considered as Muslim. Major schools and branches of Islam (N.B.: Ja'fari and Twelver boxes are interchanged)|thumb|500x500px|Major schools and branches of Islam (N.B.: [[Ja'fari]] and [[Twelver]] boxes are interchanged)]]
{{further|History of Islam}}

The first centuries of Islam gave rise to three major [[Muslim sects|sects]]: [[Sunni]]s, [[Shia]]s, and [[Kharijites]]. The original difference between Sunnis and Shias is over who the true successor to Muhammad is. Shias believe [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is the true successor to Muhammad, while Sunnis consider [[Abu Bakr]] to hold that position. The Khawarij broke away from both the Shias and Sunnis during the [[First Fitna]] (the first Islamic Civil War) and subsequently opposed both the Shias and the Sunnis, often violently.

In addition, there are several differences within Sunni Islam and Shia Islam. Sunni Islam is separated into four main schools of jurisprudence, namely, [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]. These schools are named after [[Abu Hanifa]], [[Anas bin Malik]], [[al-Shafi'i]], and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schools of Islamic law and their differences |url=http://www.maslaha.org/untold-islam/depth/schools-of%20islamic%20law%20and%20their%20differences |website=Untold Islam |publisher=Maslaha |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia Islam, on the other hand, is separated into three major sects: [[Twelvers]], [[Ismailis]], and [[Zaydis]]. The vast majority of Shias are Twelvers (a 2012 estimate puts the figure as 94% of Shias being Twelvers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guidère|first=Mathieu|title=Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCvhzGiDMYsC&amp;pg=PA319|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7965-2|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that the term "Shia" frequently refers to Twelvers by default. The Twelver Shias are also notably the only sect of Muslims that complies with the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors|saying of Muhammad that he would have twelve successors]], a saying accepted by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.

All Twelver Shia Muslims follow the same school of thought, the [[Jafari]] school of thought (named after [[Jafar as-Sadiq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schools of Islamic law and their differences |url=http://www.maslaha.org/untold-islam/depth/schools-of%20islamic%20law%20and%20their%20differences |website=Untold Islam |publisher=Maslaha |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Twelve Imams|sixth Shia Imam]]). All four founders of the Sunni schools of thought gained knowledge, either directly or indirectly, through Jafar as-Sadiq.

Zaydis, also known as Fivers, do not follow the Jafari school of thought, but instead the Zayidi school of thought (named after [[Zayd ibn Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schools of Islamic law and their differences |url=http://www.maslaha.org/untold-islam/depth/schools-of%20islamic%20law%20and%20their%20differences |website=Untold Islam |publisher=Maslaha |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Ismailis are further divided into two groups, Tayyibi Ismailis and Nizari Ismailis. The term "Ismaili" frequently refers to Nizari Ismailis, while Tayyibi Ismailis are called Bohras and split between Da'udi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Branches of Shia Islam: Ismailis, Twelvers, and Bohras |url=https://ismailimail.blog/2017/08/23/branches-of-shia-islam-ismailis-twelvers-and-bohras/ |website=Ismailimail |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Kharijites]] were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadis]]. Of these, Ibadis are the only surviving branch of Kharijites.

In addition to the aforementioned sections, new schools of thought and movements like [[Quranist Muslims]], and [[African American Muslims]] later emerged independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message summary] – Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main traditional branches ==
=== Sunni Islam ===

{{Sunni Islam |width=22.0em|collapse}}
{{main|Sunni Islam}}

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are the largest [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of Islam and are known as ''Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l-Jamā'h'' or simply as ''Ahl as-Sunnah''. The word ''Sunni'' comes from the word ''[[sunnah]]'', which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Therefore, "Sunni" refers to those who follow or maintain the ''sunnah'' of Muhammad. In many countries, overwhelming majorities of Muslims are Sunnis, so that they simply refer to themselves as "Muslims" and do not use the Sunni label.

The Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not specifically appoint a successor to lead the Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' (community) before his death, and after an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent [[Sahabah|companions]] gathered and elected [[Abu Bakr]], Muhammad's close friend and a father-in-law, as the first ''[[caliph]]'' of Islam. Sunni Muslims regard the first four caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] and [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]]) as "[[Rashidun|al-Khulafā'ur-Rāshidūn]]" or "The Rightly Guided Caliphs." Sunnis also believe that the position of caliph may be attained [[democracy|democratically]], on gaining a majority of the votes, but after the Rashidun, the position turned into a hereditary [[dynasty|dynastic]] rule because of the divisions started by the [[Umayyads]] and others. After the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1923, there has never been another caliph as widely recognized in the [[Muslim world]].

In recent times, followers of the classical Sunni [[Madhhab|schools of jurisprudence]] and ''[[kalam]]'' (rationalistic theology) on one hand and [[Salafis]], who follow a literalist reading of early Islamic sources, on the other, have laid competing claims to represent orthodox Sunni Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan A.C. |last=Brown| year=2009 | title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|publisher=Oneworld Publications (Kindle edition)|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglophone Islamic currents of the former type are sometimes referred to as "traditional Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kasper Mathiesen|title=Anglo-American 'Traditional Islam' and Its Discourse of Orthodoxy|journal=Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies |volume=13|year=2013|pages= 191–219|url=https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/jais/volume/docs/vol13/v13_10_mathiesen_191-219.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themuslim500.com/downloads/The%20Muslim%20500%20-%202018%20Edition%20-%20Free%20eBook.pdf|title=The Muslim 500}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shia Islam ===

{{main|Shia Islam|Imamah (Shia doctrine)}}
[[Shia Islam]] ({{lang|ar|شيعة}} ''Shia'', sometimes ''Shi'a''; adjective "Shia"/''Shi'ite'') is the second-largest denomination of Islam, comprising 10–13%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBSH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540503/Shiite |title=Shīʿite |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/Muslim/Mapping-the-Global-Muslim-Population |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population |accessdate=2010-08-24 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total Muslim population in the world.&lt;ref name="PRCPDF"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Tracy |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia Muslims, though a minority in the Muslim world, constitute the majority of the Muslim populations in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540503/Shiite|title=Shi'ite – Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Azerbaijan]] as well as significant minorities in [[Kuwait]], [[Yemen]] and [[Lebanon]]. In addition to believing in the authority of the [[Qur'an]] and teachings of Muhammad, Shia believe that Muhammad's family, the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] (the "People of the House"), including his descendants known as [[Shi'a Imams|Imams]], have special spiritual and political authority over the community&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 45–51&lt;/ref&gt; and believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, was the first of these Imams and was the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor]] to Muhammad, and thus reject the legitimacy of the first three Rashidun caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Tabatabaei (1979), pp. 41–44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV section|date=July 2017}}

The Shia Islamic faith is broad and includes many different groups. There are various Shia theological beliefs, schools of jurisprudence, philosophical beliefs, and spiritual movements. The Shia identity emerged soon after the martyrdom{{dubious|date=July 2017}} of Hussain son of Ali (the grandson of Muhammad) and [[Imami|Shia theology]] developed as a result of a shift from the political to the ideological in second century Shi'ism&lt;ref&gt;Dakake (2008), pp.1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}} and like the Sunni (for example, [[Umayyad caliphate]]), the first Shia governments (for example, [[Idrisid dynasty]] in Morocco or [[Justanids]] in Iran) were established by the 7th and [[8th century]].

==== Major sub-denominations ====
* The [[Twelvers]] believe in [[twelve Imams]] and are the only school to comply with [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]], where Muhammad stated that he would have twelve successors.
* The [[Alawites]] are a distinct religion that developed in the 9th/10th century. Historically, Twelver Shia scholars (such as [[Shaykh Tusi]]) did not consider Alawites as Shia Muslims while condemning their heretical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-real-reason-why-iran-backs-syria-14999|title=The Real Reason Why Iran Backs Syria|first=Barak|last=Barfi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] also pointed out that Alawites were not Shi'ites.&lt;ref&gt;"The Nusayris are more infidel than Jews or Christians, even more infidel than many polytheists. They have done greater harm to the community of Muhammad than have the warring infidels such as the Franks, the Turks, and others. To ignorant Muslims they pretend to be Shi'is, though in reality they do not believe in God or His prophet or His book ... Whenever possible, they spill the blood of Muslims ... They are always the worst enemies of the Muslims ... war and punishment in accordance with Islamic law against them are among the greatest of pious deeds and the most important obligations." – Ibn Taymiyyah, as quoted by Daniel Pipes (1992). Greater Syria. Oxford University Press. p. 163. {{ISBN|9780195363043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ismailism]], including the [[Nizārī]], [[Sevener]], [[Mustaali]], [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Hebtiahs Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Alavi Bohra]] sub-denominations.
* The [[Druze]] are a distinct traditional religion that developed in the 11th century as an offshoot of Ismailism. 
* The [[Zaidiyyah]] historically come from the followers of [[Zayd ibn Ali]].

==== Ghulāt movements in history ====
{{main|Ghulāt||List of extinct Shia sects}}

Muslim groups who either ascribe divine characteristics to some figures of Islamic history (usually a member of [[Muhammad]]'s family, [[Ahl al-Bayt]]) or hold beliefs deemed deviant by mainstream Shi'i theology were called as ''Ghulāt''.

=== Kharijite Islam ===
{{main|Kharijite}}

[[Kharijite]] (literally, "those who seceded") is a general term embracing a variety of Muslim sects which, while originally supporting the Caliphate of Ali, later on fought against him and eventually succeeded in his martyrdom while he was praying in the mosque of Kufa. While there are few remaining Kharijite or Kharijite-related groups, the term is sometimes used to denote Muslims who refuse to compromise with those with whom they disagree.

The major Kharijite sub-sect today is the [[Ibadi]]. The sect developed out of the 7th century Islamic sect of the Kharijites. While Ibadi Muslims maintain most of the beliefs of the original Kharijites, they have rejected the more aggressive methods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

A number of Kharijite groups went extinct in the past:
* [[Sufri]]s were a sect of Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries, and a part of the Kharijites. Their most important branches were the:
** [[Abu Qurra|Qurrīyya]]
** [[Nukkari]]
* [[Harūrī]]s were an early Muslim sect from the period of the [[Rashidun|Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs]] (632–661 CE), named for their first leader, Habīb ibn-Yazīd al-Harūrī.
* [[Azariqa]]
* [[Najdat]]
* [[Adjarite]]s

== Sufi orders ==
{{Sufism|Orders}}
{{main|Sufism|list of Sufi orders}}

Sufism is Islam's [[mysticism|mystical]]-[[Asceticism|ascetic]] dimension and is represented by schools or orders known as ''[[Tasawwuf]]ī-[[Ṭarīqah]].'' It is seen as that aspect of Islamic teaching that deals with the purification of inner self. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham (1998), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list contains some notable Sufi orders:
* The [[Azeemia]] order was founded in 1960 by Islamic Saint Syed Muhammad Azeem Barkhiya aka Qalandar Baba Aulia, at Karachi, Pakistan.
* The [[Bektashi]] order was founded in the 13th century by the Islamic saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], and greatly influenced during its fomulative period by the [[Hurufism|Hurufi]] Ali al-'Ala in the 15th century and reorganized by [[Balım Sultan]] in the 16th century. Because of its adherence to [[the Twelve Imams]] it is classified under [[Twelver]] Shia Islam.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* The [[Chishti]] order ({{lang-fa|چشتیہ}}) was founded by ([[Khawaja]]) [[Abu Ishaq Shami]] ("the Syrian"; died 941) who brought Sufism to the town of [[Chisht]], some 95 miles east of [[Herat]] in present-day Afghanistan. Before returning to the Levant, Shami initiated, trained and deputized the son of the local [[Emir]] ''(Khwaja)'' Abu Ahmad Abdal (died 966). Under the leadership of Abu Ahmad's descendants, the ''Chishtiyya'' as they are also known, flourished as a regional mystical order. The founder of the [[Chishti Order]] in [[South Asia]] was [[Moinuddin Chishti]].
* The [[Kubrawiya]] order was founded in the 13th century by [[Najmuddin Kubra]] in [[Bukhara]] in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Saif_ed_Din_Bokharzi.htm|title=Saif ed-Din Bokharzi &amp; Bayan-Quli Khan Mausoleums|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mevlevi]] order is better known in the West as the "whirling dervishes".
* [[Mouride]] is most prominent in [[Senegal]] and [[The Gambia]], with headquarters in the holy city of [[Touba, Senegal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanmag.com/viewer/magazines/article.asd/id/504/vts/design001 "Mourides Celebrate 19 Years in North America"] by Ayesha Attah.

* The [[Naqshbandi]] order was founded in 1380 by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]]. It is considered by some to be a "sober" order known for its silent [[dhikr]] (remembrance of God) rather than the vocalized forms of dhikr common in other orders. The [[Süleymancılar|Süleymani]] and [[Khalidiyya]]  orders are offshoots of the Naqshbandi order.
* The [[Ni'matullahi]] order is the most widespread Sufi order of [[Persia]] today. It was founded by [[Shah Ni'matullah Wali]] (d. 1367), established and transformed from his inheritance of the [[Marufi|Ma'rufiyyah]] circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=The Garden of Truth|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-162599-2|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several suborders in existence today, the most known and influential in the West following the lineage of [[Javad Nurbakhsh]], who brought the order to the West following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]].

This order became known as Nurbakshi after [[Shah Syed Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani]], who was aligned to the [[Kubrawiya]] order.
* The [[Oveysi]] (or Uwaiysi) order claims to have been founded 1,400 years ago by [[Uwais al-Qarni]] from Yemen. 
* The [[Qadiri]] order is one of the oldest Sufi Orders. It derives its name from [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (1077–1166), a native of the Iranian province of [[Gīlān Province|Gīlān]]. The order is one of the most widespread of the Sufi orders in the Islamic world, and can be found in [[Central Asia]], Turkey, [[Balkans]] and much of East and [[West Africa]]. The Qadiriyyah have not developed any distinctive doctrines or teachings outside of mainstream Islam. They believe in the fundamental principles of Islam, but interpreted through mystical experience. The [[Ba 'Alawiyya|Ba'Alawi]] order is an offshoot of [[Qadiriyyah]].
* [[Senussi]] is a religious-political Sufi order established by [[Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi]]. As-Senussi founded this movement due to his criticism of the Egyptian [[ulema]].&lt;ref name=locsanusi&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=The Sanusi Order|url=http://countrystudies.us/libya/18.htm|work=Libya: A Country Study|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Shadhili]] order was founded by [[Abu-l-Hassan ash-Shadhili]].

* The [[Tijaniyyah]] order attach a large importance to culture and education, and emphasize the individual adhesion of the disciple (''[[murid]]'').

== Schools of jurisprudence ==
{{Fiqh |width=19.0em}}
{{main|Madh'hab|Fiqh}}

Islamic schools of jurisprudence, known as ''[[madhhabs]]'', differ in the [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodology]] they use to derive their [[Ahkam|rulings]] from the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]].

=== Sunni ===
In terms of religious jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]''), Sunnism contains several schools of thought (''[[madhhab]]'') such as:
* the [[Hanafi]] school, founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu'man]], including subgroups like [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]].
* the [[Maliki]] school, founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]].
* the [[Shafi'i]] school, founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]].
* the [[Hanbali]] school, founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.
* the [[Ẓāhirī]] school, founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]].

=== Shia ===

== Schools of Islamic theology ==
{{main|Aqidah|Schools of Islamic theology}}

''[[Aqidah]]'' is an Islamic term meaning "[[creed]]", doctrine, or article of faith.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hell. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "'Aḳīda", vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aqidah|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-176|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have existed many schools of Islamic theology, not all of which survive to the present day. Major themes of theological controversies in Islam have included [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]] and free will, the [[Quranic createdness|nature of the Quran]], the nature of the [[Names of God in Islam|divine attributes]], [[Zahir (Islam)|apparent]] and [[Batin (Islam)|esoteric]] meaning of scripture, and the role of [[Kalam|dialectical reasoning]] in the Islamic doctrine.

{{Muslim Beliefs|all}}

=== Kalām ===
''[[Kalām]]'' is the [[Islamic philosophy]] of seeking theological principles through [[dialectic]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word literally means "speech/words". A scholar of ''kalām'' is referred to as a ''mutakallim'' (Muslim theologian; plural ''mutakallimūn''). There are many schools of Kalam, the main ones being the [[Ash'ari]] and [[Maturidi]] schools in Sunni Islam.

==== Ash'ari ====
[[Ash'arism]] is a school of theology founded in the 10th century by [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]]. The Asharite view was that comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of [[God]] were beyond human capability.

==== Maturidi ====
[[Maturidism]] is a school of theology founded by [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]], which is a close variant of the Ash'ari school. Points which differ are the nature of belief and the place of human reason. The Maturidis state that belief (''iman'') does not increase nor decrease but remains static; it is piety (''[[taqwa]]'') which increases and decreases. The Ash'aris say that belief does in fact increase and decrease. The Maturidis say that the unaided human mind is able to find out that some of the more major sins such as alcohol or murder are evil without the help of revelation. The Ash'aris say that the unaided human mind is unable to know if something is good or evil, lawful or unlawful, without divine revelation.

=== Traditionalist theology ===
[[Traditionalist theology (Islam)|Traditionalist theology]], sometimes referred to as the [[Athari]] school, derives its name from the word "tradition" as a translation of the Arabic word ''[[hadith]]'' or from the Arabic word ''athar'', meaning "narrations". The traditionalist creed is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation. They rely on the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and sayings of the Sahaba, seeing this as the middle path where the attributes of Allah are accepted without questioning their nature (''[[Bi-la kaifa|bi la kayf]]''). [[Ahmad bin Hanbal]] is regarded as the leader of the traditionalist school of creed. The term ''athari'' has been historically synonymous with [[Salafi]]. The central aspect of traditionalist theology is its definition of [[Tawhid]], meaning literally unification or asserting the oneness of Allah.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Murji'ah ===
[[Murji'ah]] was a name for an early politico-religious movement which came to refer to all those who identified faith (''iman'') with belief to the exclusion of acts.&lt;ref&gt;W. Madelung. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Murdji'a", vol. 7, p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qadariyyah ===
[[Qadariyyah]] is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted that humans possess free will, whose exercise makes them responsible for their actions, justifying divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Qadariyyah|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-1901|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the [[Mu'tazili]]s and rejected by the [[Ash'ari]]s.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah/&gt;

=== Mu'tazili ===
[[Mu'tazili]] theology originated in the 8th century in [[Basra|al-Basrah]] when [[Wasil ibn Ata]] left the teaching lessons of [[Hasan al-Basri]] after a theological dispute. He and his followers expanded on the logic and rationalism of [[Greek philosophy]], seeking to combine them with Islamic doctrines and show that the two were inherently compatible. The Mu'tazili debated philosophical questions such as whether the Qur'an was created or eternal, whether [[evil]] was created by God, the issue of [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]] versus [[Free will in theology#In Islamic thought|free will]], whether God's attributes in the Qur'an were to be interpreted allegorically or literally, and whether sinning believers would have eternal punishment in [[hell]].

=== Jahmiyyah ===
[[Jahmi]]s were the alleged followers of the early Islamic theologian [[Jahm bin Safwan]] who associate himself with [[Al-Harith ibn Surayj]]. He was an exponent of extreme [[determinism]] according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun acts or does something when it sets.&lt;ref name=pest&gt;{{cite journal |first=W.

=== Bāṭeniyyah ===
The ''[[Batiniyyah]]'' is a name given to an allegoristic type of scriptural interpretation developed among some Shia groups, stressing the ''[[Batin (Islam)|bāṭin]]'' (inward, esoteric) meaning of texts. It has been retained by all branches of [[Isma'ilism]] and its [[Druze]] offshoot. The [[Alawites]] practice a similar system of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;M.G.S. Hodgson. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Bāṭiniyya", vol. 1, p. 1098.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later branches==
=== African-American movements ===

Many slaves brought from Africa to the Western hemisphere were Muslim. Although it is thought that the Islam of slaves did not survive past 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/868/servants-of-allah-african-muslims-enslaved-in-the-americas|title=Servants of Allah: African Muslims Enslaved in the Americas by Sylviane A.

They sought to ascribe Islamic heritage to African-Americans, thereby giving much emphasis on racial aspects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Herbert |last=Berg |title=Mythmaking in the African American Muslim Context: The Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, and the American Society of Muslims |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion |year=2005 |volume=73 |issue=3 |pp=685–703 |url=http://religion.ua.edu/pdf/bergjaar.pdf |format=pdf |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi075 |access-date=2016-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022141039/http://religion.ua.edu/pdf/bergjaar.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Black nationalism]]''). These [[Black Muslims (disambiguation)|Black Muslim]] movements often differed greatly in doctrine from mainstream. They included:
*[[Moorish Science Temple of America]], founded in 1913 by Noble Drew Ali (born Timothy Drew). He claimed it was a sect of Islam but he also drew inspiration from Buddhism, Christianity, [[Gnosticism]] and [[Taoism]]. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam and strong African-American ethnic character&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-aging-of-the-moors/Content?oid=999633|title=The Aging of the Moors|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion.
*[[Nation of Islam]], founded by [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]] in [[Detroit]] in 1930,&lt;ref name=aarh&gt;Milton C. Sernett (1999). ''African American religious history: a documentary witness''. Duke University Press. pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt; with a declared aim of "resurrecting" the spiritual, mental, social and economic condition of the [[African American|black man and woman of America]] and the world. The group believes Fard Muhammad was God on earth,&lt;ref name=aarh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Muhammad. ''History of the Nation of Islam''. BooksGuide (2008). pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; a belief viewed as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by mainstream Muslims. It does not see Muhammad as the final prophet, but [[Elijah Muhammad]] as the "Messenger of Truth" and only allows people of black ethnicity and believes they are the original race on earth.
**[[American Society of Muslims]]: in an attempt to bring the teachings of the Nation of Islam more in line with mainstream Sunni Islam, [[Warith Deen Mohammed]] established the American Society of Muslims in 1975. This offshoot wanted to bring its teachings more in line with mainstream Sunni Islam, establishing mosques instead of temples and promoting the Five pillars of Islam.&lt;ref name=evocom&gt;''Evolution of a Community'', WDM Publications, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, C.

=== Ahmadiyya movement ===
{{Ahmadiyya|collapsed=1}}

The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement was founded in India in 1889 by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], who claimed to be the promised [[Messiah]] ("[[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus|Christ]]"), the [[Mahdi]] awaited by the Muslims and a [[Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|"subordinate" prophet]] to Muhammad whose job was to restore the original Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted [[Ummah]] back to Islam and thwart attacks on [[Islam]] by its opponents. The followers are divided into two groups, the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] and the [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam]], the former believing that Ghulam Ahmad was a non-law bearing prophet and the latter believing that he was only a religious reformer though a prophet in an allegorical sense. Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims and claim to practice the pristine form of Islam as re-established with the teachings of Ghulam Ahmad.

In many Islamic countries the Ahmadis have been defined as heretics and non-Muslim and subjected to persecution and often systematic oppression.&lt;ref name="persecution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm |title=Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography |publisher=Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm |archivedate=2006-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamism ===
{{Islamism sidebar|collapsed=1}}
[[Islamism]] is a set of political [[Ideology|ideologies]], derived from various [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] views, which hold that Islam is not only a religion but a [[political system]] that should govern the legal, economic and social imperatives of the state. Many Islamists do not refer to themselves as such and it is not a single particular movement. Religious views and ideologies of its adherents vary, and they may be Sunni Islamists or Shia Islamists depending upon their beliefs. Islamist groups include groups such as [[Al-Qaeda]], the organizer of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and perhaps the most prominent; and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the largest and perhaps the oldest. Although violence is often employed by some organizations, most Islamist movements are nonviolent.

==== Muslim Brotherhood ====
The ''Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun'' (with [[Ikhwan]] {{Lang|ar|الإخوان}} brethren) or [[Muslim Brotherhood]], is an organisation that was founded by Egyptian scholar [[Hassan al-Banna]], a graduate of [[Dar al-Ulum]]. With its various branches, it is the largest Sunni movement in the Arab world, and an affiliate is often the largest opposition party in many Arab nations. The Muslim Brotherhood is not concerned with theological differences, accepting Muslims of any of the four Sunni schools of thought. It is the world's oldest and largest [[Islamist]] group. Its aims are to re-establish the [[Caliphate]] and in the mean time push for more Islamisation of society. The Brotherhood's stated goal is to instill the Qur'an and ''sunnah'' as the "sole reference point for... ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community... and state".{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==== Jamaat-e-Islami ====
[[File:Abul ala maududi.jpg|thumb|[[Abul Ala Maududi]] (with alternative spellings of last name Maudoodi), the founder of [[Jamaat-e-Islami]]]]

The ''[[Jamaat-e-Islami]]'' (or JI) is an Islamist political party in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was founded in Lahore, British India, by [[Abul A'la Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] (with alternative spellings of last name Maudoodi) in 1941 and is [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|the oldest religious party in Pakistan]] and India. Today, sister organizations with similar objectives and ideological approaches exist in [[India]] ([[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]]), [[Bangladesh]] ([[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir]]), and [[Sri Lanka]], and there are "close brotherly relations" with the Islamist movements and missions "working in different continents and countries", particularly those affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Akhwan-al-Muslimeen). The JI envisions an Islamic government in Pakistan and Bangladesh governing by Islamic law. It opposes Westernization—including secularization, capitalism, socialism, or such practices as interest based banking, and favours an Islamic economic order and [[Caliphate]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Liberal Muslims ===
{{main|Liberal Islam|Ijtihad}}
Liberal and progressive movements have in common a religious outlook which depends mainly on [[Ijtihad]] or re-interpretations of [[scripture]]s. [[Liberal Muslims]] at thought have led to the birth of certain small denominations from primarily unaffiliated followers who believe in greater autonomy of the individual in interpretation of scripture, a critical examination of [[religious text]]s, gender equality, human rights, LGBT rights and a modern view of culture, tradition, and other ritualistic practices in Islam.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Mahdavia ===
[[Mahdavia]], or Mahdavism, is a [[Mahdiist]] sect founded in late 15th century [[India]] by [[Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri]], who declared himself to be the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Hidden Twelfth Imam]] of the Twelver Shia tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|1973|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; They follow many aspects of the Sunni doctrine. Zikri Mahdavis, or [[Zikris]], are an offshoot of the Mahdavi movement.&lt;ref name="Gall"&gt;"Zikris (pronounced 'Zigris' in Baluchi) are estimated to number over 750,000 people. They live mostly in Makran and Las Bela in southern Pakistan, and are followers of a 15th-century mahdi, an Islamic messiah, called Nur Pak ('Pure Light'). Zikri practices and rituals differ from those of orthodox Islam... " Gall, Timothy L. (ed). Worldmark Encyclopedia of Culture &amp; Daily Life: Vol. 3 – Asia &amp; Oceania.

This is in contrast to orthodox Muslims, who consider hadiths essential to the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web |title=The Quranist Path |url=http://www.quranists.com/ |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quranistic movements include Abdullah Chakralawi's [[Ahle Qur'an]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albalagh.net/prophethood/response_rejecters.shtml|title=A Look at Hadith Rejecters' Claims|author=Khalid Baig|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutquran.com/ba/ba.htm|title= |publisher=Aboutquran.com|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rashad Khalifa]]'s [[United Submitters International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.128|title=Cmje|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128054809/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.128|archive-date=2008-11-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salafism and Wahhabism ===
==== Ahl-i Hadith ====

[[Ahl-i Hadith]] is a movement which emerged in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the mid-19th century.  Followers call themselves Ahl-i Hadith or [[Salafi]], while others consider them to be a branch of the Salafi or [[Wahhabi]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Strick Van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn, ''An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan'', p. 427.

==== Salafi movement ====
{{Salafi|collapsed=1}}

The [[Salafi movement]] is an ultra-conservative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Phillip|title=North Africa Revised|date=15 January 2015|publisher=University of Texas Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSUKBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT302#v=onepage&amp;q=salafi%20movement%20ultra-conservative|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esposito|first1=John|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; movement within [[Sunni Islam]] that emerged in the second half of the 19th century and advocated a return to the traditions of the "devout ancestors" (the [[salaf]]). The doctrine can be summed up as taking "a [[fundamentalist]] approach to [[Islam]], emulating the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his earliest followers—''al-salaf al-salih'', the 'pious forefathers'....They reject religious innovation, or [[bid'ah]], and support the implementation of [[sharia]] (Islamic law)."&lt;ref name=Economist27Jun15/&gt; The movement is often divided into three categories: the largest group are the purists (or [[Political quietism in Islam#Salafists|quietists]]), who avoid politics; the second largest group are the [[Islamism|activists]], who get involved in politics; the smallest group are the [[Salafi jihadism|jihadists]], who form a small (yet infamous) minority.&lt;ref name=Economist27Jun15&gt;{{cite news|title=Salafism: Politics and the puritanical|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21656189-islams-most-conservative-adherents-are-finding-politics-hard-it-beats|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the violent Islamist groups come from the Salafi movement and their subgroups. In recent years, the Salafi doctrine has often been correlated with the jihad of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and those groups in favor of killing innocent civilians.&lt;ref name="Sageman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marc Sageman|title=Understanding Terror Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCoYDUv63L8C&amp;pg=PA61|date=21 September 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0679-7|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;&lt;ref name="Oliveti2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincenzo Oliveti|title=Terror's Source: The Ideology of Wahhabi-Salafism and Its Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYFtQgAACAAJ|date=January 2002|publisher=Amadeus Books|isbn=978-0-9543729-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salafi movement is often described as being synonymous with [[Wahhabism]], but Salafists consider the term "Wahhabi" derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''Ahl-i Hadith'' which "have been active since the nineteenth century on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ... though designated as Wahhabis by their adversaries ... prefer to call themselves 'Salafis.'" (from ''The Failure of Political Islam'', by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 118–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wahhabism ====
The [[Wahhabi movement]] was created by [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]] in the Arabian peninsula, and was instrumental in the rise of the [[House of Saud]] to power. The terms [[Wahhabism]] and [[Salafism]] are often used interchangeably, although the word [[Wahhabi]] is specific for followers of Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab. Wahhabism has been accused of being "a source of global terrorism"&lt;ref name=Haider&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haider|first1=Murtaza|title=European Parliament identifies Wahabi and Salafi roots of global terrorism|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1029713|accessdate=3 August 2014|work=Dawn|location=Pakistan|date=Jul 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=senate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108shrg91326/pdf/CHRG-108shrg91326.pdf |title=Terrorism: Growing Wahhabi Influence in the United States |publisher=US GPO|date=June 26, 2003 |quote=Journalists and experts, as well as spokespeople of the world, have said that Wahhabism is the source of the overwhelming majority of terrorist atrocities in today's world, from Morocco to Indonesia, via Israel, Saudi Arabia, Chechnya.--[[Jon Kyl]], US Senator for Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; and causing disunity in Muslim communities, and criticized for its followers'  destruction of historic sites.&lt;ref name="Rabasa 2004 103, note 60"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Israel Epstein-Yannan01.jpg|thumbnail|Israel Epstein, 1936/1937, [[Yan'an]], then capital of [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]]]
'''Israel Epstein''' (20 April 1915 – 26 May 2005) was a [[:Category:Naturalized citizens of the People's Republic of China|naturalized]] Chinese journalist and author. He was one of the few foreign-born Chinese citizens of non-Chinese origin to become a member of the [[Communist Party of China]].

==Early life and education==
Israel Epstein was born on 20 April 1915 in [[Warsaw]] to Jewish parents;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1491973/Israel-Epstein.html Israel Epstein Obituary]. The Telegraph, Retrieved 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, [[Warsaw]] was under [[Imperial Russia]]n control (now the capital of [[Poland]]). His father had been imprisoned by the authorities of [[Russian Empire|czarist Russia]] for leading a [[labor rights|labor]] [[Rebellion|uprising]] and his mother had been [[exile]]d to [[Siberia]]. Epstein's father was sent by his company to [[Japan]] after the outbreak of the [[World War I]]; when the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] approached Warsaw, his mother and Epstein fled and joined him in Asia. With his family experiencing anti-Jewish sentiment in several places, in 1917, Epstein came to China with his parents at the age of two and they settled in [[Tianjin]] (formerly ''Tientsin'') in 1920.

==Journalism==
Israel Epstein began to work in journalism at age 15, when he wrote for the ''Peking and Tientsin Times'', an English-language newspaper based in Tianjin. He also covered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese Invasion of China]] for the [[United Press]] and other Western [[news agency|news agencies]]. In the autumn of 1938, he joined the China Defense League, which had been established by [[Soong Ching-ling]], [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s widow, for the purpose of publicizing and enlisting international support for the Chinese cause. In 1941, he faked news about his own death as a decoy for the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who were trying to arrest him. The misinformation even found its way into a short item printed in the ''[[New York Times]]''.

After being assigned to review one of the books of [[Edgar Snow]], Epstein and Snow came to know each other personally and Snow showed him his classic work ''[[Red Star Over China]]'' before it was published.

In 1934, Epstein married Edith Bihovsky Epstein, later Ballin, from whom he was divorced in the early 1940s. In 1944, Epstein first visited Britain and afterwards went to live in the United States with his second wife Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley for five years.

He worked for Allied Labor News and published his book ''The Unfinished Revolution in China'' in 1947. His book was enthusiastically reviewed in ''The New York Times'' by [[Owen Lattimore]] of Johns Hopkins University. In 1951 Communist defector [[Elizabeth Bentley]] testified to the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, "Israel Epstein had been a member of the Russian secret police for many years in China."&lt;ref&gt;Medford Evans, ''The Assassination of Joe McCarthy'', Western Islands Press, 1970, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, his wife, Fairfax-Cholmeley, would become known to a generation of Chinese-language students in China and around the world as a contributor to one of the most widely used Chinese-English dictionaries published in the PRC. After Fairfax-Cholmeley's death in 1984, Epstein married his third wife, Wan Bi.

==''China Today'' magazine==
In 1951, [[Soong Ching-ling]] invited him to return to China to edit the magazine ''China Reconstructs'', which was later renamed ''[[China Today]]''. He remained editor-in-chief of ''China Today'' until his retirement at age 70, and then editor [[emeritus]]. During his tenure at ''China Today'', he became a Chinese citizen in 1957 and a member of the Communist Party of China in 1964. In 1955, 1965 and 1976 Epstein visited [[Tibet]], and based on these three visits in 1983 published the book ''Tibet Transformed''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/tibetan/chediklaytsen/ukaylatsen/bodnaykheswang/2005/06/10/life-and-death-of-israel-epstein/ Israel Epstein, a famous apologist for the Chinese Communist regime]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], on charges of plotting against [[Zhou Enlai]], he was imprisoned in 1968 in the north of Beijing in [[Qincheng Prison]], where he was subjected to solitary confinement. In 1973, he was released, and Zhou apologized. His privileges were restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article530937.ece Israel Epstein. Emigre journalist whose devotion to Communist China withstood even imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution], 8 June 2005, [[The Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his 5 years imprisonment, he remained loyal to the ideals of Communism until his death. Israel Epstein was elected as a member of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], an advisory body, in 1983.

==Honours==
During his life, Israel Epstein was honored by [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Jiang Zemin]], and [[Hu Jintao]]. His funeral was held at the [[Babaoshan Cemetery for Revolutionaries]], in [[Shijingshan District]], Beijing on 3 June 2005 at 09:30. The ceremony was attended by many officials, among them President Hu Jintao, Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], as well as [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] members [[Jia Qinglin]] and [[Li Changchun]]. After the service, his body was [[cremation|cremated]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">[[File:James Brighouse (Latter Day Saint).jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Brighouse, ca 1890]]
'''James Brighouse''' was a late-nineteenth-century American leader of a splinter sect in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] called the ''Order of Enoch''. Brighouse was one of the first persons to claim to be the "[[One Mighty and Strong]]" that [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] had prophesied of in 1832.

==Order of Enoch==
On December 7, 1884, a few members of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] met in [[Independence, Missouri]] to organize what they called the ''Order of Enoch'' or the ''Church or Kingdom of Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'' '''4''':466.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of group were Brighouse and Lars Peterson. Brighouse was given the title "Emmanuel" and was later declared to be the 18th [[reincarnation]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. Later, Brighouse also claimed to be the reincarnation of [[Adam]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Moses]], [[David]], [[Ezekiel]], [[George Washington]], and [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]].

==Teachings==
Brighouse taught that [[Brigham Young]] had led the majority of Latter Day Saints astray by teaching [[plural marriage]]. Brighouse said that God had chosen [[Joseph Morris (Latter Day Saints)|Joseph Morris]] to set the Latter Day Saints in order, but that the wickedness of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had resulted in the [[Morrisite War]] and the scattering of the true Latter Day Saints.  Brighouse claimed that he was the "[[One Mighty and Strong]]" that Joseph Smith had prophesied would come to "set in order the house of God".

In 1891, Brighouse travelled to [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah Territory]]. It was believed by some Latter Day Saints that Joseph Smith had prophesied that Jesus Christ would return to earth in 1891; Brighouse went to the incomplete [[Salt Lake Temple]] and declared that he was Jesus, whose coming had been prophesied. Brighouse preached in Salt Lake City for a few days and converted a handful of followers.

In Utah Territory in 1892, Brighouse published a book of teachings called ''The Voice of the Seventh Angel, Proclaiming the End of Time! The Resurrection of the Dead! The Day of Final Judgment! and the Rule of Righteousness and Peace!''. In it, Brighouse set out his seven fundamental teachings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Brigham Young was chosen to lead them to Utah, but he has taught false doctrines and led the Saints astray. He sinned in appointing himself the Prophet in 1847, without a Revelation from the Lord.
#Negroes are not cursed nor the children of Cain as Brigham Young has taught them. They should be allowed inside the Temples and the priesthood.
#The Lost Tribes are not living at the North Pole.
#The Baby Resurrection [reincarnation] is not a doctrine of the devil, but a true doctrine.
#Joseph Smith sinned in regards to polygamy, and this is why the Lord allowed men to kill him in 1844.
#Joseph Morris was a true Prophet of God, and died a martyr.
#He was Jesus reincarnated, and He would come again in the year 1912; born in Jerusalem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Little is known of Brighouse's life after 1892, but his following remained small and it is believed Brighouse died in Utah.

'''John Dayal''' (born 2 October 1948) is an Indian human rights and political activist. He is a member of the [[National Integration Council]] (NIC) of India, Secretary-General of the [[All India Christian Council]] and a past president of the [[All India Catholic Union]]. He has taken ant-Indian Army stand time to time, and he is an Urban Naxalist. He has been outspoken in opposition to polarisation, in defence of church property and in support of churches.

==Biography==
John Dayal was born in New Delhi to Christian parents from South India.
He studied Physics at [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]] before deciding to become a journalist.&lt;ref name="ICEC"/&gt;
He served as War Correspondent or Foreign Correspondent in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=Minorities/&gt;
He became editor and CEO of the ''Delhi Mid Day'', a small afternoon newspaper, and treasurer of the Editors' Guild of India.&lt;ref name="ICEC"/&gt;
In June 1998 John Dayal was one of the signatories of a statement by a group of journalists calling on India to return to the global nuclear disarmament agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

John Dayal became a Christian activist in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minoritiesofindia.org/indian-journalist-warns-underground-church-in-india-at-par-with-china/|title=Indian Journalist Warns Underground Church in India “At Par” With China|author=|date=4 August 2015|website=MinoritiesOfIndia.org|access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role he has worked on such issues as displacement of tribal people, special quotas in jobs and college admissions for Christians, opposition to nuclear weapons, forced disappearances and impunity.&lt;ref name="Minorities"/&gt;
During more than forty years he has investigated a great many cases of human rights abuse aimed at minority group of Christians.

Dayal was one of the founders of the ecumenical [[All India Christian Council]] (AICC) and the [[United Christian Forum for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ICEC/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2005 Dayal was a member of a delegation led by [[Vincent Conçessao]] that presented a memorandum on minorities to the prime minister.  The delegation was assured that the government would issue a White Paper on minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY4qstA6JNQC&amp;pg=PA45 |page=45

Dayal has been appointed to many fact finding committees and tribunals.&lt;ref name=Minorities/&gt;
In December 2007 he was one of a five-member Fact Finding Team that went [[Phulbani]] area of [[Kandhamal district]] in Orissa to investigate recent violence against Christians. 
According to his account, he was forcibly expelled by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Hindutva===

In January 2002 the AICC issued a statement signed by [[Joseph D'souza]] and John Dayal asking State governments and the national government to prevent efforts by the [[Sangh Parivar]] to stir up communal violence in the Adivasi tribal belt in Northern India. It talked of a "vicious [[Hindutva]] communal rhetoric .. targeting Christians in the region". It said  RSS cadres were running schools that "follow a curricula and textual material, which is outside the pale of any academic and public scrutiny, blatantly rewrites history, and poisons young minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Government Printing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005 Dayal again expressed concern that [[Ekal Vidyalaya]] ("single teacher") schools run by the RSS Hindu nationalist organisation in tribal districts were spreading hatred towards members of the Christian minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dayal has made unsubstantiated claims that the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to convert tribal people in central India into Hindu nationalists.&lt;ref name=Baravalle/&gt; 
On 17 October 2004 a ceremony was organised by the [[World Hindu Council]] (Vishva Hindu Parishad – VHP) in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] at which about 300 tribal Christians were "reconverted" to Hinduism. Dayal said the event was part of a well-organized and respectful ghar vapasi program, that he wholeheartedly agrees with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a 2004 interview following the defeat of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and the return to power of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], Dayal said that the change was because "People have rejected the ideology of hate, consisting of xenophobia, narrow nationalism and a sustained persecution of Muslims and Christians".  He went on to compare Hindutva to [[neo-Nazism]] and [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |work=[[The Milli Gazette]]
 |date=1–15 June 2004
 |access-date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on other religions===

Dayal has said that militant groups exploit economically backward people in attacks on Christians and Muslims: "Dalits and tribals are used as instruments. He said, though the Irish and Scottish Missionaries introduced distilled alcohol (Indian-made foreign liquor or IMFL) the depiction of Anglo-Indians and Christians as alcoholics is real and threatens to consume Christianity. He also said Christians are paid, drugged, alcoholized, they are in a stupor. Even wine at communions should be banned".&lt;ref&gt;[http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2014/08/28/south-india-alcohol-ban-could-include-communion-wine/ EpiscopalDigitalNetwork.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Speaking after the Bharatiya Janata Party had made gains in riot-affected parts of [[Gujarat]], Dayal said "[Christians] have never been more afraid ... I have been expecting the very worst since the B.J.P. came to power, and the worst, I think, may still be in the future.&lt;ref name=Baravalle&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8J23G28RrwC&amp;pg=PT476 |pages=476–477

 |publisher=design.Method of Operation|year=2004 |isbn=0970576862}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With levels of violence in Gujarat rising, on 1 October 1998 Dayal remarked "The AICU is surprised that Union Government and members of the ruling coalition, including the BJP, have not come out categorically in denouncing the violence against Christians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In February 2002 after a renewed series of attacks on Christians Dayal said "Physically, many of the incidents are now less obvious, but there is a 24-hour reign of terror, which occasionally bursts into violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Church property===

Dayal represents the conservatives in the AICU.
At a seminar in Goa in  August 2009, former Union minister [[Eduardo Faleiro]] said that church property should be brought under the ambit of state laws, as was the case with other religions.  This was endorsed by Remy Denis and other liberals. 
However, Dayal opposed any change.
He said that the "Christian situation" was radically and materially different from that of the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh religions, and existing laws were sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 two [[Baptist]] churches in Imphal, Manipur were ordered to vacate within 15 days.
The authorities threatened to use force if the churches were not dismantled on schedule.
The All India Christian Council took up the issue with the national and state minority commissions.  According to Dayal "Christians in Manipur are facing increasing threats from the public as well as the state government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The same month, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia said that it is "necessary to destroy all the churches of the region".
As AICC Secretary General, John Dayal asked that India and other countries help assure the safety of churches in other countries of the Arabian peninsula.
The AICC pointed out that destruction of churches would be counter to the [[United Nations Charter]] and to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance And of Discrimination Based on Religion Or Belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Dalit rights===
A survey by the NGO Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan found that the "Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers" was being abused.
Apart from encouraging Dalits to remain in menial jobs, in many cases some or all of the money was embezzled.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
In March 2012 Dayal said "There is a massive scandal of graft between bank officials, politicians and middle men to fleece ignorant people who are given 50 per cent of the loan only but made liable for the full amount even as rest of the money is taken away by crooks. Collectors in villages must crack down on such miscreants and wherever such cases are found, government must waive off the loans or it would be condoning cheating and criminal actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A deeply religious person, Dayal has written "How a community treats its poor is, for the Bible, the acid test of its life.  And the way a community will be changed is through the poor".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Criticism==
[[Rediff.com]] columnist [[Varsha Bhosle]] wrote in 2002 that "John Dayal and his Catholic cohorts are the worst act I've ever seen... Christian activists ... aggressively seek to weaken Hindu society in terms of numbers as well as space". Noting that Dayal had objected that on the 2001 census form a scheduled caste, or Dalit, could choose only among the Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths, she said "If conversion to Christianity certifies social equality, why would there be a 'Dalit Christian'? As for guaranteeing economic freedom, don't make me laugh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Discussing Dayal's 2005 letter to the [[Manmohan Singh|prime minister]] about attacks on Christians including the rape of nuns, murder of priests and destruction of churches, P.N Benjamin, coordinator of the [[Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue]], said Dayal "opens his mouth and wields his pen only to spew venom on the Hindu community". Benjamin said most of the attacks on Christians had been in response to aggressive [[Evangelism|evangelizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, journalist [[François Gautier]] described Dayal as a fanatic who was "radicalizing" his flock. The assertion was made in an [[op-ed]]  in ''[[The Indian Express]]'' that accused [[Sonia Gandhi]] of responsibility for the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Rajiv Malhotra]], in his book ''[[Breaking India]]'', has also criticized Dayal for spreading lies about Hinduism and painting a biased picture of the situation of Indian minorities for a western audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

== John Dayal's testimony against India at U.S. House of Representative==
John Dayal on April 4, 2014, appeared at a hearing on ''The plight of religious minorities in India''  which was convened by [[Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/concerns-in-us-about-religious-freedom-in-india/article5874176.ece|title=Concerns in U.S. about religious freedom in India|first1=Narayan|last1=Lakshman|first2=Narayan|last2=Lakshman|date=5 April 2014|publisher=|access-date=13 September 2017|via=www.TheHindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commission is a mostly white [[bipartisan]] [[caucus]] of [[United States House of Representatives]] that was set up with the help of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. In his short testimony he made unsubstantiated remarks about his views of religious tolerance in India. While as a member of [[National Integration Council]]([[government of India]]) he as a witness recommended the panel of commission to incorporates his concerns in U.S. India relationship and U.S. policy vis-a-vis the United States-India strategic dialogue which is framework of engagement of the [[United States Department of State]] with India. Further, he cited the [[house resolution 417]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/protect-indias-religious-minorities-us-house-resolution/article5368540.ece|title=Protect India’s religious minorities: U.S. House resolution|first=Narayan|last=Lakshman|date=19 November 2013|publisher=|access-date=13 September 2017|via=www.TheHindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged that human rights should be the part of strategic U.S.-India dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlhrc.house.gov/hearing_notice.asp?id%3D1259 |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331011510/http://tlhrc.house.gov/hearing_notice.asp?id=1259 |archivedate=31 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dayal's attempt to advance this resolution was strongly criticized by others, such as the [[United States India Political Action Committee]],&lt;ref name="spsdonmodi"&gt;

The HAF expressed concerns that the panel was 'unbalanced' in favor of [[anti-Hindu]] activists. In particular, Gabbard characterized his testimony as a thinly veiled attempt to covertly influence the upcoming [[Indian general election, 2014|General Elections in India]] in favor of [[anti-Indian]] groups, an action deemed "inappropriate" for the US Congress and "against the shared interests" of both nations.&lt;ref name="hafngabbard"/&gt;

'''Juok''' is the name of god for the tribes on the upper reaches of the [[Nile]]. For some including the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]], Dinka and Nuer, he is the Creator God and is omnipresent. Nyikang, a legendary king, is often invoked as an intermediary. Other Nilotic tribes, for example the Acholi and Lango, use the possibly related term Jok only for local and/or ancestral spirits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cotterell, Arthur (1979)''A Dictionary of World Mythology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The creator Juok moulded all people of earth. While he was engaged in the work of creation, he wandered about the world. In the land of the whites he found a pure white earth or sand, and out of it he shaped white people. Then he came to the land of Egypt and out of the mud of the Nile he made red or brown people. Lastly, he came to the land of the Shilluks, and finding there black earth he created black people out of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The way in which he modeled human beings was this. He took a lump of earth and said to himself, "I will make humans, but they must be able to walk and run and go out into the fields, so I will give each of them two long legs, like the flamingo." Having done so, he thought again, "They must be able to cultivate millet, so I will give each of them two arms, one to hold the hoe, and the other to tear up the weeds." So he gave humans two arms. Then he thought again, "They must be able to see the millet, so I will give them two eyes." He did so accordingly. Next he thought to himself, "They must be able to eat their millet, so I will give each a mouth." And a mouth he gave accordingly. After that he thought within himself, "They must be able to dance and speak and sing and shout, and for these purposes they must have tongues." And tongues he gave accordingly. Lastly the Deity said to himself, "They must be able to hear the noise of the dance and the speech of the great ones, and for that they need two ears." So two ears each he gave, and sent them out into the world as perfect humans."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Another story about Juok, is that he gave birth to several children—an elephant, a buffalo, a lion, a crocodile, a dog, and finally the first humans, a boy and a girl. Juok was not pleased with the humans, so he told the dog to get rid of them. Instead, the dog nurtured the children until they were grown. By then the land had become crowded, so Juok decided to set apart land for his different creatures and give them weapons. He planned to deal with the humans last of all. The dog knew that if this happened, there would be no land or weapons left for the humans; the animals would get it all. He told the man to tell Juok that he was the elephant, buffalo, and lion. When the man did, Juok gave him all the spears. When the animals arrived, there were no spears left for them. Instead, Juok gave the elephant tusks, the buffalo horns, the lion strong claws, and the crocodile sharp teeth. The man used his spears to drive off the animals; then he took the best land for himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A myth about the origin of death describes how a dog helped people attain long lives. In the beginning, death was not permanent. People remained dead for three days and then came back to life. One day, Juok decided to make death permanent by throwing a rock into the river. The dog urged humans to get together and haul the rock out of the river, but they ignored him. The dog was unable to get the rock out by himself, but he managed to break off a large chunk of it and carry it home. Because of this, humans have longer lives than they might have had.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kalloor''' is the name of the place in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], where the [[Apostle Thomas]], one of the 12 disciples of [[Jesus]], is believed{{By whom|date=March 2011}} to have been killed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Though there are differing claims and no written accounts have been found to favor one over another, it is generally accepted{{By whom|date=March 2011}} that the Apostle Thomas arrived in what is now the state of [[Kerala]] and established a number of churches, converting mainly [[Brahmin]] families.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He then traveled to what is now the modern state of [[Tamil Nadu]] and on to [[China]], establishing small works along the way.  After returning to Tamil Nadu, he was killed by some locals.  Though he was buried in India, his body was taken, in the fourth or fifth century, to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], in modern-day [[Turkey]].

==Families in India==
The name, Kalloor, also refers to a number of prominent families, in [[Hindu]], [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] communities.  In Hindu communities, the Kalloor [[family]] is one of the few families that are part of the priestly [[Namboodhiri]] [[Brahmin]] caste.  In Muslim communities also, the Kalloor family is large and prominent.  There are "[[suburbs]]" around a number of the larger cities of Kerala, like [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], that bear this name.  Many of these suburbs have large Muslim populations.

In Christian communities, there are a number of theories for the origin of this [[family name]].  One is that early converts to Christianity (Jewish people ) took this name in remembrance of accepting Jesus (Yeshua) as their " messiah" from Apostle Thomas, at a place named Kalloor, in Tamil Nadu.  Another is that they are converts from the Hindu Kalloor family, reportedly converting in the seventh century.  Members of this family are prominent in a number of the Christian traditions, including in Syriac groups such as the [[Indian Orthodox Church]], Western groups such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and Reform groups such as the [[Indian Brethren]] and [[Pentecost]]al churches.  Listed among the more prominent Christians are Bishop Yoohanon Chrysostom Kalloor of the Catholic Church, from the Kalloor family in [[Pathanamthitta]] and the initial catalyst for the Pentecostal movement in Kerala, the late [[Kalloor Chacko]], from the Kalloor family in [[Thrikkannamangal]]. The Kallor Family in Kanjiralli to Pala route is also now divided into Catholics and Protestants. It is believed that Devasia Kalloor broke from the Catholic chusch along with 5 other families and started the Kalaketty CSI Church. 

It is suspected but not proven whether the two Kalloor families of Pathanamthitta and Thrikkannamangal are related.  Because family names can be modified or even discarded by each generation that establishes a new home, and are often not used as last names for people in [[South India]], the tracing of genealogies is very difficult, if not impossible, without written family trees.  Many in the Kalloor family of Pathanamthitta remain in the Roman Catholic Church and some have risen to leadership within that tradition, like Bishop Yoohanon. The Kalloor family of Thrikkannamangal had nominally remained within the Syrian tradition even during the Portuguese blockade of the 16th and 17th centuries.  This blockade prevented the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] from communicating with their branches in India and forced the majority of the Syrian churches in India to join the Roman Catholic Church in order to preserve Apostolic succession.  Some, however, made a public vow, known as the [[Coonen Cross Oath]], to never succumb to the leadership of the Western Church.  Later, many from Thrikkannamangal joined the Reformation movement within the Syrian Church in the 19th century which resulted in the establishment of the [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church|Mar Thoma]] Church.  Members of this family were also prominent in the establishment of the Brethren churches in South India.  It was while Chacko was in the Brethren church that he became acquainted with the [[United States|American]] [[missionary]] [[Robert F. Cook]], the ''Father of Indian Pentecostalism.''

== Orthodox bishops of Prague ==
The first Orthodox mission in Czech lands was led by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], some time before the [[East–West Schism]], with its centre in [[Moravia]]. The current [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church]] comes from the Czech Orthodox clubs and partly arose from the early [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Czechoslovak Church]] which separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1920s. Consequently, the Czechoslovak Church tended towards Protestantism and an Orthodox branch split off. The Prague Archeparchy encompasses the whole of [[Bohemia]]. 
 
* [[Gorazd (Pavlik) of Prague]] 1921–1942
* (...)
* [[Dorotheus (Filipp) of Prague]] 1963–1999
* [[Metropolitan Christopher (Pulec) of Prague]] since 2000

== Greek Catholic bishops of Prague ==
[[Apostolic Exarchate in the Czech Republic]] was established in 2006. Exarchs: 
*1. [[Ivan Ljavinec]], 1996–2003
*2. [[Ladislav Hučko]], since 2003

== Prague bishops of the Czechoslovak Church and Czechoslovak Hussite Church ==
The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] (until 1971 Czechoslovak Church) split off from the Roman Catholics in 1920s. Initially the church varied between Catholic modernism, Orthodoxy and Protestantism; today it is a Protestant church in principle. 

Bishops of Prague Diocese: 
# [[Karel Farský]], 1925–1927
# [[Gustav Adolf Procházka]], 1928–1942
# [[Miroslav Novák]], 1946–1962
# [[Josef Kupka]], 1962–1982 (in 1971, the church was renamed to "Hussite")
# [[Miroslav Durchánek]], 1982–1988
# [[René Hradský]], 1989–1999
# [[Karel Bican]] 1999–2007
# [[David Tonzar]], since 2008
 
Prague is also the seat of patriarchs. The two first Bishops of Prague were also patriarchs. Since 1946, the patriarch is a different bishop. 
# [[Karel Farský]], 1924–1927
# [[Gustav Adolf Procházka]], 1928–1942
# [[František Kovář]], 1946–1961
# [[Miroslav Novák]], 1961–1990
# [[Vratislav Štěpánek]], 1991–1994
# [[Josef Špak]], 1994–2001
# [[Jan Schwarz]], 2001–2005
# [[Tomáš Butta]], since 2006

It features tiered-roof and ''adat'' based structures, which are characteristics of traditional mosque found throughout the Indonesian archipelago.]]
These are '''lists of [[mosque]]s in [[Indonesia]]''', based on
*The completion year of the building.
*The capacity of the building.
*Grouped into regions

The Indonesian ''Masjid Agung'' is translated as "Great Mosque", while ''Masjid Raya'' is translated as "Grand Mosque". ''Mesjid Keramat'' is translated as "Holy Mosque". ''Masjid Jami'' is translated as Jami Mosque, which refers to the mosque where the weekly [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]] takes place. These lists only include notable mosques.

For the article about the architecture of mosques in Indonesia, ''see [[Indonesian mosques]]''.

==Oldest mosques in Indonesia==
The list is divided into two based on form: traditional mosques and eclectic mosques.

===Traditional mosques===
Many of the year of establishment for traditional mosques refer to the land opening for the mosque which may create confusion as to which mosque is the oldest. To be included in the list, the year should be the year of the building's completion and not the opening of the land.

To be listed in this category, the architecture of the mosque has to be earlier than the beginning of the [[20th century]] and has not undergone major alteration in the later periods. Architecture of the mosque has to show traditional style absent of Western or Middle-Eastern influence, such as multi-tiered roofs.

===Eclectic mosques===
To be listed in this category, the building has to be completed before the independence of Indonesia (pre-1950s). Architecture of the mosque has to show prominent foreign features such as pointed arches and domes during the time of its completion. Ancient Javanese mosque which in later years modified to include eclectic element should be placed on the ''Traditional mosques'' list instead.

Civic buildings that are converted into a mosque can also be listed in the category. The year should be then the year of the completion of the building, and not the year of the establishment of the building as a mosque.

'''MEST''' is an acronym used in [[Scientology]] and coined by author [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. Hubbard used the first letters of the words [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]], the component parts of the physical universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#mest "MEST", Bridge Publications Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Writings and lectures by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard frequently use the term ''MEST'' in place of the phrase "the physical universe". According to Hubbard, [[thetan|"theta energy"]] (souls or spiritual entitites) exists in a separate universe from the MEST universe, with theta influencing MEST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L. Ron Hubbard’s Formulation of Therapy and Religion in Dianetics and Scientology, 1950–1986 |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |date=June 24, 2016 |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |doi=10.5840/asrr201662323 |volume=7 |pages=155–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./dst/Library/Shelf/kent/eastern.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13537909608580753 | volume=11 | title=Scientology''s relationship with eastern religious traditions | journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion | pages=21–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard described the purpose of the "Theta Universe" as "the conquest, change, and ordering of MEST".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Science of Survival'', 1st edition, pg. 99
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |accessdate=2016-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dianetics]] also utilized the concept of MEST.&lt;ref&gt;

These include Hubbard's distinction between 'MEST' and 'theta' (the former is an acronym for the physical universe of Matter-Energy-Space-Time, while the latter stands for the universe of thought); the development of the 'Tone Scale', indicating the amount of 'free theta' available to the analytical mind, and according to which pre-clear individuals and groups can be classified; Hubbard's proliferation of 'logics, corollaries, axioms, and definitions' [...]; and his growing commitment to past lives and deaths.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic minorities and MEST==

===African Americans and MEST===
Hubbard felt that [[African American]]s had a tendency to personify the MEST universe by [[Anthropomorphism|giving objects personalities]]: "Actually, have you ever noticed how a negro, in particular, down south, where they're pretty close to the soil, personifies MEST? The gate post and the wagon and the whip and anything around there. A hat{{snd}} they talk to 'em, you know. 'Wassa madda wit you, hat?' They imbue them, with personality."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Therapy Section of Technique 80: Part I, Route to Infinity'', 21 May 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other racial implications of MEST===
In ''The Fundamentals of Thought'', Hubbard also says:

{{quote|Unlike yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part (and it is all a matter of consideration) that rocks, trees, walls etc. can give them attention. The white man seldom believes this and so is likely to become anxious about people.

Thus the white saves people, prevents famine, flood, disease and revolution for people as the only purveyors of attention are scarce. The white goes further. He often believes he can get attention only from whites and that yellow and brown peoples' attention is worthless. Thus the yellow and brown races are not very progressive but by and large, saner. And the white race is progressive but more frantic. The yellow and brown races do not understand white concern for "bad conditions" since what is a few million dead men? There are plenty of identities and there is plenty of attention, they think. The white can't understand them. Nor can they understand the white.&lt;ref&gt;From the 1997 edition of Fundamentals of Thought, Chapter 3 "The Conditions of Existence", section "Identity and Attention", pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|An [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwe]] ''[[Midewiwin|midew]]'' (ceremonial leader) in a ''mide-wiigiwaam'' (medicine lodge).]]
A '''medicine man''' or '''medicine woman''' is a [[traditional healer]] and spiritual leader who serves a community of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people of the Americas]]. Individual cultures have their own names, in their respective Indigenous languages, for the spiritual healers and ceremonial leaders in their particular cultures. 

==The medicine man and woman in North America==
===Cultural context===
[[Image:Yupik shaman Nushagak.jpg|thumb|[[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] "medicine man exorcising evil spirits from a sick boy" in [[Nushagak, Alaska]], 1890s.&lt;ref name="fienupriordanphoto"&gt;Fienup-Riordan, Ann. (1994). ''Boundaries &amp; Passages: Rule and Ritual in Yup'ik Eskimo Oral Tradition''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 206. [[Nushagak, Alaska|Nushagak]], located on [[Nushagak Bay]] of the Bering Sea in southwest [[Alaska]], is part of the territory of the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik|Yup'ik]], speakers of the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the ceremonial context of Indigenous North American communities, "medicine" usually refers to ''spiritual'' healing. Medicine men/women should not be confused with those who employ [[Native American ethnobotany]], a practice that is very common in a large number of Native American and First Nations households.&lt;ref name=Alcoze&gt;Alcoze, Dr Thomas M.  "[https://www.bgci.org/resources/article/0429/ Ethnobotany from a Native American Perspective: Restoring Our Relationship with the Earth]" in ''[[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]]'' Volume 1 Number 19 - December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moerman&gt;Moerman, Daniel E. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378874179900023 Symbols and selectivity: A statistical analysis of native american medical ethnobotany]" in ''[[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]]'' Volume 1, Issue 2, April 1979, Pages 111-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, "[http://na.fs.fed.us/stewardship/pubs/biodiversity/sustaining-lives-natural-world.pdf Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Sustaining Our Lives and the Natural World]" at ''United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service''. Newtown Square, PA. December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "medicine people" or "ceremonial people" are sometimes used in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities, for example, when Arwen Nuttall ([[Cherokee]]) of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] writes, "The knowledge possessed by medicine people is privileged, and it often remains in particular families."&lt;ref name="nmai"&gt;National Museum of the American Indian. ''Do All Indians Live in Tipis?'' Washington DC: Smithsonian Institution, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-06-115301-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans tend to be quite reluctant to discuss issues about medicine or medicine people with non-Indians. In some cultures, the people will not even discuss these matters with Indians from other tribes. In most tribes, medicine elders are prohibited from advertising or introducing themselves as such. As Nuttall writes, "An inquiry to a Native person about religious beliefs or ceremonies is often viewed with suspicion."&lt;ref name="nmai"/&gt; One example of this is the [[Apache]] medicine cord or ''[[Izze-kloth]]'' whose purpose and use by Apache medicine elders was a mystery to nineteenth century ethnologists because "the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or talk about them."&lt;ref name="ref69jeviq"&gt;{{Citation | title=Annual report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Issue 9 | author=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology | publisher=Government Printing Office, United States Government, 1892 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5MqAAAAMAAJ | quote=''There is probably no more mysterious or interesting portion of the religious or 'medicinal' equipment of the Apache Indian, whether he be medicine-man or simply a member of the laity, than the 'izze-kloth' or medicine cord... the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or talk about them....''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The 1954 version of ''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' reflects the poorly-grounded perceptions of the people whose use of the term effectively defined it for the people of that time: "a man supposed to have supernatural powers of curing disease and controlling spirits." In effect, such definitions were not explanations of what these "medicine people" are to their own communities but instead reported on the consensus of socially and psychologically remote observers when they tried to categorize the individuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The term "medicine man/woman," like the term "[[Shamanism|shaman]]," has been criticized by Native Americans, as well as other specialists in the fields of religion and anthropology.

While non-Native anthropologists sometimes use the term "[[shamanism|shaman]]" for Indigenous healers worldwide, including the Americas, "shaman" is the specific name for a spiritual mediator from the [[Tungusic peoples]] of [[Siberia]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. R. [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/shaman.html "Shamanism."] ''Cabrillo College.'' (Retrieved 28 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and is not used in Native American or First Nations communities.

The term "medicine man/woman" has also frequently been used by Europeans to refer to [[Africa]]n [[traditional healer]]s, along with the offensive term "[[witch doctor]]s".

==Cherokee medicine men and women==
Cherokee spiritual, ceremonial and healing knowledge has been passed down for thousands of years. The Cherokee people were among the first Native Americans to formalize a written language. Some of the  information in the Cherokee ledgers is written in code to prevent other people from trying to misuse or exploit their medicine ways.&lt;ref name=CNO-1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/Culture/General/CherokeeMedicineMenandWomen.aspx|title=Cherokee Medicine Men and Women|website=www.cherokee.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in all Native American cultures, Cherokee medicine people had to practice in secret from the post-contact era until 1978, when the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] was passed.  

Training a Cherokee medicine person takes many years due to the vast amount of knowledge needed to practice.&lt;ref name=CNO-1 /&gt; Modern-day Cherokee medicine people must be born and raised in the Cherokee community and culture, and raised with the language. The skills of gifted and well-trained medicine people are still very important to the Cherokee people, though genocide and oppression have resulted in there being fewer now than pre-contact. There are many fraudulent healers and scam artists who pose as Cherokee "shamans", and the Cherokee Nation has had to speak out against these people, even forming a task force to handle the issue. In order to seek help from a Cherokee medicine person a person needs to know someone in the community who can vouch for them and provide a referral. Usually one makes contact through a relative who knows the healer.&lt;ref name=CNO-1 /&gt;

'''''Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava'''''  is a traditional [[Jain]] ceremony that consecrates one or more Jain [[Tirthankara]] [[icon]]s with celebration of [[Panch Kalyanaka]] (five auspicious events). The ceremony is generally held when new Jain temple is erected or new idols are installed in temples.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}

==Panch Kalyanaka==
[[File:Gajrath,_Tada,_Feb_9_2017,_from_Ahinsa_TV.jpg|thumb|right|Gajrath chariot in Tada, Bundelkhand]]
{{Main|Panch Kalyanaka}}
The five kalyanakas are the five major events associated with a [[Tirthankara]] are:{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}

# Chyavan (conception)
# Janma (birth)
# Diksha (renounciation)
# Keval Gyan (omniscience)
# Moksha (liberation)

These events are celebrated in relation to icons of [[Tirthankara]]s which is called ''Pratishtha''. After the pratishtha the statue represents the [[Tirthankara]], and becomes a worshippable object.

A pratishtha must be authorised by an acknowledged leader of the sangha, an [[Acharya]] or a [[Bhattaraka]], or a representative (pratishthacharya), who can recite the sacred suri-mantra to mark the final step in the installation ceremony. The [[Shvetambara]] sect requires a ceremony called anjana-shalaka. Once an idol is fully installed, it must be worshipped daily.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}

The [[Bhattaraka]] Devendrakeerti of [[Humbaj]] is the only Bhattaraka who has participated in the installations in overseas countries including USA, Canada and Australia.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In [[Jainism in Bundelkhand|Bundelkhand]] region, a panch-kalyanak pratishtha is accompanied by a [[Gajrath|gaj rath]] (chariot drawan by elephants) procession.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7_qEjcgv4  SESAI PANCH KALYANAK MAHOTSAV GAGRATH FERI 22-04-2017, Toofan tv Damoh, Apr 23, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Process Church logo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used by the original Process Church]]
'''The Process Church of the Final Judgment''', commonly known as the '''Process Church''', was a religious group established in London in 1966. Its founders were the British couple Mary Ann MacLean and [[Robert de Grimston]] and it spread across parts of the United Kingdom and United States during the latter 1960s and 1970s.

The Process Church was established by MacLean and de Grimston in London in 1966. The pair had met several years previously, when they were both members of the [[Church of Scientology]]. The duo were ejected from the Church in 1962 and married the following year. They started a Scientology splinter group called Compulsions Analysis, which gained new religious elements and developed into the Process Church. Its members initially lived in a commune in [[Mayfair]] before moving to [[Xtul]] in Mexico's [[Yucatan]] peninsula. They later established a base of operations in the [[United States]] in [[New Orleans]]. Prosecutors investigating the Los Angeles murders committed by the [[Manson Family]] in 1969 suggested that there were links between [[Charles Manson]] and the Process Church. Although no proof of such a connection was ever provided, the allegations damaged the Church's reputation.

In the early 1970s, the sociologist [[William Sims Bainbridge]] studied the group, producing an in-depth account of its activities. In 1974, MacLean and de Grimston separated. The latter tried to continue the group with a small following, but this folded in 1979. MacLean retained the allegiance of the majority of Church members, reforming the group as the '''Foundation Church of the Millennium''' and taking it into an explicitly [[Christianity|Christian]] direction. It was later transformed into the [[Best Friends Animal Society]], based at [[Kanab]], [[Utah]]. 

==Definition==

Various commentators have described the Process Church as a religion,{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=105|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=61}} and it has also been characterised as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}}
There has been some debate as to whether to categorise the Process Church as a form of [[Satanism]] or not; the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine noted that it was "difficult to decide whether it was a truly Satanist organization".{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=105}} The sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] included the group in his study of religious Satanism, although added that "its doctrine was not Satanism in the more classical sense of the term".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=337}} He distinguished it from other religious Satanic groups in that it did not have its origins in [[Anton LaVey]]'s California-based [[Church of Satan]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=328}} and thus was "born on a different field from other contemporary satanic groups."{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=337}}

==History==

===Foundation: 1963–1966===
The Process Church of the Final Judgement was the creation of Mary Ann Maclean (1931–2005) and Robert De Grimston Moore (b.1935).{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} Born in Shanghai, Moore had served in the [[British Household Cavalry]] from 1954 to 1958.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} Maclean was British but had spent a year in the United States.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} She later claimed that she had had a relationship with the boxer [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], although Robinson's son later refuted this.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} Back in England, from 1959 she worked as a high-end prostitute in London, servicing prominent figures in British business and politics.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} Both Moore and Maclean independently involved themselves with the London branch of the [[Church of Scientology]], and it was here that they met.{{sfnm|1a1=Baddeley|1y=2010|1p=60|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=329}} Maclean worked as an [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditor]] for the Church, although neither became senior figures within the organisation.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} In 1962, they were both declared "[[suppressive persons]]" and expelled from the Church.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} In 1963, the couple married.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}}

Together they set up Compulsions Analysis, a group which utilised both the organisational methods of [[Scientology]] and the ideas of the psychologist [[Alfred Adler]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}} In establishing this company, they were financially assisted by a lawyer friend.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=329}}
Moore distinguished the methods of Compulsions Analysis from Scientology in that it did not claim that its benefits were "infinite", stating that "we are not offering super powers, but a means that people can live on this side more effectively".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=329–330}} In 1966, the regular clients of Compulsions Analysis formed into a new group, The Process, which took on an increasingly religious character.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} In March 1966, twenty-five members of the Process moved into a commune at 2 Balfour Place in [[Mayfair]], an affluent area in the [[West End of London]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} In May, the group decided that they would leave London and relocate to a more remote area.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} On 23 June, around thirty Church members—accompanied by their six Alsatian dogs—moved to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} From there, they spent the rest of the summer seeking a more permanent location.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}}

In September 1966, the group members moved to [[Mexico City]]. They obtained an old bus and began driving across the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] for a place to settle.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} They found a location known as [[Xtul]]; its name meant "the end" in the [[Mayan language]], and the group took this as a portent that they should settle there.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} They set about establishing a community, although would only remain there for a month. They faced opposition from both locals and from the parents of several Church members, who enlisted [[anti-cult movement|anti-cult]] groups to try and recuperate their children through legal means.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=330–331}} It was while there that the group clarified its hierarchical structure, with the De Grimstons at the top, who were referred to as "the Omega", followed by those regarded as "masters", then "priests", then "prophets", and finally "messengers".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}}{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}}  In late September, a tropical hurricane devastated their settlement, and while some of them elected to stay, the De Grimstons and most of their followers decided to leave.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} The Yucatan experience remained an important part of the Process Church's own mythology.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}} After that point, there would be a crucial division within the group between those who had gone through the Xtul experience and those who did not.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}}

===Establishing a presence in the United States: 1966–1973===

By November 1966, most of the Process members were back in London.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}} Between the end of that year and 1967, the Process began to operate as a church.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}} It became increasingly evangelical and focused on attracting new members.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=60}} It opened a library and an all-night coffee shop known as Satan's Cavern.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}} It also began issuing a magazine, at first titled ''The Common Market'' and later renamed ''The Process''.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}} The Church's activities attracted the interest of a number of celebrities active in the realms of music and cinema, among them [[Marianne Faithfull]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=331}}

In 1967 and 1968, the De Grimstones made various further international travels, spending time in East Asia, the United States, Germany and Italy; in the latter they visited the ruins of [[Thelema Abbey]] on [[Cefalu]], the commune established in the 1920s by British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=332}} From late 1968 onward, they began spending most of their time in the United States.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=332}} The Church opened "chapters" in many U.S. cities, the first of which was in [[New Orleans]], where the remaining members of the Xtul colony settled.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=332}} Several European chapters followed, in Munich, Rome, and London.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=332}}
In the early 1970s it opened its largest chapter, in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}}
Introvigne thought that at its maximum capacity, the Process Church had "a few hundred active members".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}}

====San Francisco and the Charles Manson Murders====

During its existence, the Process Church attracted much publicity.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=105}}
In [[urban myth]], the Process Church came to be associated with [[ritual abuse|ritual murders]], although no evidence of any such connection was ever forthcoming.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=63}} Rumours spread that a number of Alsatians had been [[ritual sacrifice|sacrificed]] around San Francisco, with these actions sometimes being associated with the Process Church, which kept Alsatians as pets. Nothing was ever proved that substantiated any of these rumours.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=106|2a1=Parfrey|2y=2009|2p=9}}
Baddeley later related that the Process Church "has become legendary, both in the annals of [[History of the hippie movement|hippie history]] and Satanic lore".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=60}}

{{Quote box
| quote = One could make the argument that due to its extreme views and insular arrogance, The Process Church had itself to blame for the smears and resulting hysteria.

Police investigating the [[Manson Family#LaBianca murders|Tate-LaBianca Murders]] which were carried out by members of the [[Manson Family]] suspected a possible connection between the Family's leader [[Charles Manson]] and the Process Church. When they asked Manson if he knew Moore, he responded: "You're looking at him. Moore and I are one and the same".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=106}} Two members of the Church subsequently visited the district attorney to stress that the group had nothing to do with Manson or his Family.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=107}} The Church then included a brief article on Manson in the 1971 ''Death'' issue of its magazine, in which it included a short essay by Manson himself next to another by the Roman Catholic writer [[Malcolm Muggeridge]].{{sfnm|1a1=Parfrey|1y=2009|1p=12|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=62|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=333}} The inclusion of Manson's piece—gained by interviewing him in prison—was, according to Introvigne, because the De Grimstons "probably wanted to take advantage of the strange popularity the criminal was enjoying in some youth groups".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=333}} 

[[Vincent Bugliosi]], the prosecutor of the Manson trial, later suggested in his book ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]'' that Manson may have borrowed philosophically from the Process Church.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=107}} Introvigne suggested that while Manson had never been a member of the Process Church, he likely knew about it given his base in Haight Ashbury.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=333}} Although no connection between the Process Church and Manson was ever substantiated, the group's reputation was damaged by the association.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=62}} The number of donations received began to decline and Church members sometimes received abuse in public.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=62}} To shift the group's image, its leaders played down their image of black garments and Alsatians and presented a softer interpretation of their four divinities doctrine to limit the Satanic elements.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}}

In his 1972 book ''The Family'', [[Ed Sanders]] alleged that Manson had been a member of the Process Church, as evidence citing the fact that Manson once lived in the same road as the Church's San Francisco location.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=107|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=62|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3pp=332–333}} That year, the Church took legal action against Sanders and his U.S. publisher [[E. P. Dutton]] in the [[District Court of Chicago]]; the allegation was subsequently retracted from future printings of ''The Family''.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=107|2a1=Parfrey|2y=2009|2p=19|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=62|4a1=Introvigne|4y=2016|4p=333}} It also brought legal action with the book's British publisher, although in a British court, the publisher won the case.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=333}}
By the late 1970s—when the Church itself had disbanded—it was common for anti-Satanist literature to allege that Manson was a member of the group and that both were linked to blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=172}} In his 1974 book ''America Bewitched'', the journalist Daniel Logan cited the Process Church alongside Manson, the Church of Satan, and the British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=169}} The journalist [[Maury Terry]]—whom Baddeley described as "a sensationalist reporter with a nose for good scare stories"{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=60}}—linked the Process Church to the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and claimed both as part of a grand Satanic conspiracy in his 1987 book ''The Ultimate Evil''.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=114|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=60|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=336}} Claims about the Process Church being linked to a vast Satanic conspiracy and wide range of crimes were also endorsed by members of the [[LaRouche movement]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=336–337}}

A detailed account of the history of and life within the Process Church as told by a participant-observer is contained in [[William Sims Bainbridge|William S. Bainbridge]]'s book ''Satan's Power''. A sociologist, Bainbridge encountered the Process Church in 1970, while he was studying Scientology.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=333}} He joined the Process Church, explaining to its leaders that he wanted to undergo [[participant observation]] in the group as part of his research towards a sociology doctorate.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=333–334}} Bainbridge had conducted several months of fieldwork with the group during the early 1970s, particularly in its Boston branch.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=10}} His observation took place largely in 1970–71, when he was an active group member, but became episodic between 1972 and 1974.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}} In his book, he disguised the names of people to preserve their identities.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=10}}
Adam Parfrey noted that Bainbridge provided a "more even-handed view" of the Church that that provided by the likes of Sanders and Terry.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=10}}
Bainbridge's study was later described as "the main source of information" about the group by La Fontaine.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}}

===Breakdown===
 
The relationship between the De Grimstons grew strained; Robert had begun a relationship with a younger woman, Morgana, who later became his third wife.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}} They also disagreed on the direction of the Process Church; Mary Ann believed that they should declare the "Satanic" phase to be over, to be replaced by a "Christian" phase, although Robert disagreed.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}} In 1974, the De Grimstons separated.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=334}} Robert took a minority of the group members with him, seeking to continue the Process Church in a manner akin to his original form, although abandoned the project in 1979, when he moved professionally into business.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=336}} 

Most of the Church's members retained their allegiance to Mary Ann.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} She renamed the Church as the Foundation Church of the Millennium, which in 1977 became the Foundation Faith of the Millennium, and in 1980 the Foundation Faith of God; followers generally referred to it simple as "The Foundation".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} The group defined itself as "a Christian church" which required its members to believe in the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus Christ, and his second coming.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} It also promoted a healing ministry which was influenced by [[Pentecostalism]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} Like the Process Church, membership was organised according to a hierarchical system of degrees, and it was led by a nine-member Council of Luminaries.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} Mary Ann's principal collaborator in the group was longstanding Church member Timothy Wyllie. In 1977, he founded a group in New York City called the Unit, which he regarded as being part of the Foundation. Mary Ann disagreed with this move and sued Wyllie, although she lost. The Unit soon disbanded.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} Wyllie then pursued an independent career in the [[New Age]] milieu, with a focus on communicating with extraterrestrials, angels, and dolphins.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}}

In 1982, the Process Church moved its base to [[Utah]], where it established an animal rescue refuge in [[Kanab]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} In 1993, the organisation changed its name to [[Best Friends Animal Society]]; it removed all reference to religious ideas from its statutes.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=335}} In 2004, a feature article in ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' publicly revealed Best Friends' origins in the Process Church.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|pp=8–9}} In 2005, Mary Ann died, and the management of her charity was left to her second husband, Gabriel De Peyer, a former Process Church member.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=335–336}} Unverified rumours spread that Mary Ann had been killed by a pack of wild dogs that had escaped her centre.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=336}}

==Teachings and activities==
In the initial phase of the group's beliefs, Moore and Maclean taught there was only one supreme divinity, God, and the focus of the group's activities was to transform those aspects of human nature which defied God.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} Many of the group's therapeutic practices or "processes" (hence the name) and concepts were derived from Scientology, including the term "processing".{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} In these therapy sessions, the group utilised an electronic meter titled the "P-Scope", which was based on the Scientology [[E-meter]].{{sfn|Bainbridge|2017|p=61}}

In 1967, Moore introduced the notion of four divinities to the group's beliefs.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} Maclean and Moore were influenced by [[Jungian psychology]], in particular [[Carl Jung]]'s interpretation of the Christian [[Trinity]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=328}} Jung had argued the Trinity concealed a fourth element, hidden in the human [[subconscious]], which was the Devil. He believed that omitting this fourth component of the "Quaternity" resulted in psychological unbalance.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=328}} 

In his study of Satanism, Gareth Medway described the Process Church's beliefs as "a kind of neo-Gnostic theology".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=106}} The Process Church preached the existence of four gods, who were regarded not as literal entities but as inner realities existing within each human personality.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}} Accordingly, these deities were not worshipped.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}} The names of its deities were drawn from traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] religion.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}} They were known as Jehovah, Lucifer, Satan, and Christ, and were collectively referred to as the "Great Gods of the Universe".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=330}}

The Church stated that "Jehovah is strength. Lucifer is light. Satan is separation. Christ is unification".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=61}} Each member was instructed to follow the god, or gods, which were best suited to them.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=61}} Each individual was understood as a combination of two of these gods.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}} The Church taught that an individual's personality and relationships could be explained by reference to which gods they manifested.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}} Moore for instance described himself as a blend of Luciferian and Christian traits, while Maclean regarded herself as a combination of Jehovan and Satanic traits.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=61}} None of the deities were considered evil, but "basic patterns of human reality".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=304}} Moore taught the real "devil" was humanity or the "Grey Forces", which were understood as representing the compromise and conformity typical of the masses.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=304}} 

As indicated by the group's name, The Process Church of The Final Judgment, the Church taught a form of [[millennialism]].{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} According to Process eschatology, the four separate divinities would be unified in the endtimes.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} The reconciliation of opposites was seen by Moore in [[Matthew 5:44]], where Christ tells his followers to love their enemies.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=304}}  Moore taught Christ's enemy was Satan, and the "reuniting of the Gods" was achieved through love.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=304}}  

The communal life of the Church members was strictly regulated.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}}
Among group members, sex and the use of drugs and alcohol were strictly rationed, with these practices being regarded as a distraction from spiritual work.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=61}} Unlike other Satanic groups active during the same period, the Process Church did not practice [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=106}}
The Process Church strongly opposed [[vivisection]].{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=63}}

The Church held public rituals similar to Christian practices, such as baptisms, marriages and a weekly gathering titled the Sabbath Assembly.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} Baptisms were performed at every elevation of status in the hierarchy of the Church.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=215}} The Processeans sang solemn hymns to the four deities during the assemblies.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=304}}  

The group used a swastika-like symbol ("the P-Sign") as its insignia.{{sfn|Bainbridge|2017|p=61}} The symbol had four superimposed P letters, and was also seen as representing the trumpets of the four "Great Gods".{{sfn|Bainbridge|2017|p=61}} The group also used a second symbol, "the Sign of the Union", which featured the letter Alpha inside the letter Omega, representing the intercourse of male Lucifer with female Jehovah.{{sfn|Bainbridge|2017|p=61}} 

==Influence==

[[File:Psychictv-cologne-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Among the musicians and occultists to have been influenced by the Process Church have been [[Genesis P-Orridge]] and the Psychic TV band (pictured)]]

In 1989 and 1990, several former members of the Church attempted to recreate it in [[Round Lake (village), New York|Round Lake]], New York.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=336}} There were also reports of a revival group being based in [[Yorkshire]], England.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=336}}

[[Funkadelic]] included an excerpt from the group's "Process Number Five on Fear" in the liner notes for their seminal album "Maggot Brain".&lt;ref&gt;https://rateyourmusic.com/list/Joci/liner_notes_mania/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Adam Parfrey noted that the original Process Church "enjoys cultural influence".{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=7}} 

The [[industrial music]] group [[Skinny Puppy]] released an album titled ''Process'' that contained lyrics espousing anti-vivisection themes.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=7}} The Process Church's rituals were later adopted and utilised by the band [[Psychic TV]] and the group that formed around it, [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] (TOPY).{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=7}} Several TOPY members had previously been involved with the Process Church.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=202}} [[Genesis P-Orridge]] worked with longstanding church member Timothy Wyllie to produce a book featuring reproductions of the church's magazines and reminiscences of several members. It was published as ''Love, Sex, Fear, Death: The Inside Story of The Process Church of the Final Judgment'' by Feral House in 2009.{{sfn|Parfrey|2009|p=8}}

Robert de Grimston's writings and the Writ of The Process Church have long outlived the original cult. His 'Brethren Information' (those speeches meant for members of the church at the time) are widely available online&lt;ref&gt;https://processchurchofthefinaljudgment.wordpress.com/free-downloads/&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed discussion of the modern Process Church appeared in [[Disinformation (company)|Disinfo]] in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://disinfo.com/2015/07/process-church-final-judgment-lives/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rishu''' is a [[Daoist]] term originated from [[China]] with its influence spread across [[East Asia]]. The term has variable significance in different religions and cultures. This term finds its first evident presence dated back to 217 BCE in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eap.princeton.edu/events/timing-everything-role-day-books-early-china|title=Timing is Everything: The Role of Day Books in Early China {{!}} East Asian Studies Program|website=eap.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Significance==
===China===
[[File:大禹治水圖.png|thumb|[[Han Dynasty]] depiction of Yu]]
In Mainland China, the Rishu (日書) "Day Book" is one of the divinatory books discovered in late [[Warring States period]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/event/10968|title=Early Chinese Daybooks and the Question of Textual Genre|website=www.international.ucla.edu|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; tomb libraries which has confirmed the ''Baopuzi'' description of [[Yubu]] as a series of three steps. It has great cultural significance in ancient and medieval China. It is an almanac or [[wikt:hemerology|hemerology]] which is one of the [[Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts]] recovered in 1975 in Shuihudi, [[Hubei]], from a tomb dated 217 BCE. Donald Harper (1999:843) believes that for describing texts like the ''Rishu'' 日書, which determine lucky and unlucky days on [[sexagenary cycle]] numerology without reference to [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], "[[Almanac#Hemerologies and parapegmata|hemerology]]" is a more accurate translation than "[[almanac]]" (typically meaning an annual publication for a single calendar year).

The ''Rishu'' has one occurrence of ''Yubu san'' 禹步三, "'Steps of Yu, three times", and one of ''Yubu sanmian'' 禹步三勉, "Steps of Yu, three exertions". This is consistent with the ''Baopuzi'' descriptions of ''Yubu'' in terms of ''sanbu'' "three steps" and ''jiuji'' 九跡, "nine footprints/traces," where each "step" was composed of three separate steps. Andersen (1989:17) notes that the term ''Sanbu jiuji'' was later used synonymously with ''Yubu''.

Yu is closely associated with travel in the ''Rishu'' (Harper 1999:872). The section titled "Yu xuyu" 禹須臾 "Promptuary/Instant of Yu" begins by listing the stem and branch sexagenary cycle in five groups of twelve signs each, and gives, for the days in each group, a certain lucky time of day to safely begin a journey. This section concludes with a ritual to be performed before going out of the city gate.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When traveling, on reaching the threshold-bar of the capital gate, perform the Pace of Yu thrice. Advance one pace. Call out, "''Kǝgw'' [''gao'' 皋 "name of the spirit being addressed"], I dare make a declaration. Let so-and-so [to be filled in with the name of the traveler] travel and not suffer odium; he first acts as Yu to clear the road." Immediately draw five lines on the ground. Pick up the soil from the center of the lines and put it in your bosom. (tr. Harper 1999:873) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Isabelle Robinet (1997:39) says this text lets us reconstruct the connection between "exorcistic practices intended to ward off harmful demons, and therapeutic practices intended to ensure good hygiene and good physical balance", in other words, "the evolution of exorcism toward medicine, a shift from conceiving sickness as caused by demons to seeing sickness as the result of an imbalance".

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the term has more varied and spreaded significances in different aspects of its culture. The most prominent of them are listed below:

'''Rishu-kyō''' (the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sutra) is one of the primary literature for all the schools of orthodox Shingonshu. The others being the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]], the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]], and the Susiddhikāra Sūtra (Soshitsuji-kyō 蘇悉地経). These are the four principle texts of Esoteric Buddhism. They are all [[Tantras]], literally "treatise". These texts played a vital role in [[Tachikawa-ryu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/~n-iyanag/buddhism/buddhism_war.html|title=Buddhism and War|author=Paul Demiéville|publisher=Nobumi Iyanaga|accessdate=9 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But according to the author and Tachikawa-ryu historian, John Stevens as well as James Sanford, the most important text to the [[ryūha]] (流派) perhaps, was the ''Sutra of Secret Bliss'' (ca. 1100). This sutra contains the school's general teachings concerning sexuality and its role in reaching enlightenment. It was Rishu-kyō.

== Contemporary world significance ==

Rishu has a prominent presence across the various cultures of the contemporary world. Although due to the variation of [[phonetics]] in different [[Language|languages]], the exact translation may sometimes vary in the form of spelling, but the real importance is depicted well in every associated culture. It is evident from the walloping applications of the term in the various aspects of daily life as follows -

[[File:Jokyo-reki.jpg|thumb|260px|right|1729 Japanese calendar, which used the [[Jōkyō calendar]] procedure, published by [[Ise Grand Shrine]].]]

* The Japanese calendar designates some days of the year with special names to mark the change in the season. The [[Jieqi|24 ''sekki'']] ({{CJKV|j=二十四節気|r=nijūshi sekki|p=Èrshísì Jiéqì}}) are days that divide the solar year into twenty four equal sections. {{nihongo|''Zassetsu''|雑節}} is a collective term for the seasonal days other than the 24 ''sekki''. {{nihongo|72 ''Kō''|七十二候|''Shichijūni kō''}} days are made from dividing the 24 ''sekki'' of a year further by three. Out of these special names, ''Shunbun'',  ''[[Liqiu|Risshū]]'' and ''Tōji'' are quite frequently used in everyday life in Japan. Of the 24 sekki, ''Risshū'' (立秋) is the 13th solar term which signifies the beginning of [[autumn]] season.

*

== Places associated ==

There are several places across [[Asia]] associated with this term in different aspects.

[[File:境内（本堂と桜ヶ池）.jpg|thumb|Main Hall and Sakuraga-ike Pond of [[Renge-in Tanjō-ji]] temple.]]

* [[Renge-in Tanjō-ji]] (蓮華院誕生寺) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple of the [[Shingon Risshu]],&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Paul B. (March 8, 1999), "Chapter 7: Eison and the Shingon Vinaya Sect," in Tanabe, George, ''Religions of Japan in Practice'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05789-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; situated in [[Tamana, Kumamoto|Tamana]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] of Japan. It is the head temple of Shingon-Vinaya Buddhism in [[Kyūshū]] and a branch temple of [[Saidai-ji]] (西大寺) in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (奈良). It venerates Maha-Bodhisattva Kōen (皇円大菩薩, ''Kōen Daibosatsu'') as its patron deity. At the temple, the 13th of each month is a festive day and the 3rd and the 23rd subsidiary festive days, and services are held on these days. A service comprises the reciting of Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (理趣経, ''Rishu-kyō'') by the monks and various [[sutra]]s designated for the lay devotees in [[Shingon Buddhism]] by the monks along with the devotees followed by a lecture by the abbot.

== In popular culture ==

* '''Rishu''' (離珠) is a tiny, pink-haired, telepathic hoshigami of Shaorin in [[Minene Sakurano|Minene Sakurano's]] [[manga]] called [[Mamotte Shugogetten]] (まもって守護月天!) which was serialized in the monthly magazine ''[[Gangan Comics|Shōnen GanGan]]'' from 1997 to 2000. The manga was adapted into a 22-episode [[anime]] television series produced by [[Toei Animation]] which aired from 1998 throughout 1999. The character was voiced by [[Ayako Kawasumi]], a Japanese [[voice actress]] and [[singer]] from [[Tokyo]].

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lahore''' is a Latin [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab province]], [[Pakistan]].

Its [[cathedral]] episcopal see is the Cathedral of the [[Sacred Heart]] in [[Lahore]].

== History ==
It was founded in 1880 as '''Apostolic Vicariate of Punjab''', on territory split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Agra]] (now also a Metropolitan Archbishopric).

On 1 September 1886 it was promoted and renamed after its see as '''Diocese of Lahore'''.
 
It lost vast territories repeatedly:
* on 6 July 1887 to establish the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Kafiristan and Kashmir]]
* on 13 September 1910 to establish the then Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Simla]] (now a suffragan of Delhi)
* on 17 December 1936 to establish the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Multan]] (now its suffragan diocese)
* on 17 January 1952 to establish the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Jalandhar]] and the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Kashmir and Jammu]]

On 23 April 1994 the diocese was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan Archdiocese. Fr. [[Lawrence Saldanha]] was appointed Archbishop of Lahore by pope [[John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsaldanha.html|title=Archbishiop of Lahore|publisher=catholic-hierarchy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C01%5C23%5Cstory_23-1-2006_pg7_16|title=Exclusive interview with Archbishop Lawrence Saldanha: Archbishop expresses concern at civilian casualties in Balochistan|publisher= Daily Times|date= 23 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fides.org/eng/news/2004/0405/14_2361.html|title= Agenzia Fides|date= 14 May 2004|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155042/http://www.fides.org/eng/news/2004/0405/14_2361.html|archivedate= 30 September 2007|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6110204.stm|title=Charles urges inter-faith respect |publisher= BBC News|date= 2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2011, the archdiocese began celebrations to mark its 125th anniversary. Seventy-five priests and 200 catechists served then in 608 Mass centres in the archdiocese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2011/12/19/lahore-archdiocese-marks-125-years/ UCANews 19 December 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201194514/http://www.ucanews.com/2011/12/19/lahore-archdiocese-marks-125-years/ |date=1 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asian woman making a resolve.jpg|thumb|The motif of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' presumes a natural moral force operating in the world.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=|p=68}}]]
'''Sacca-kiriyā''' ([[Pali language|Pāli]]; {{lang-sa|satya-kriya|italic=yes}}, but more often: ''satyādhiṣṭhāna''),{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=434}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=149}}{{refn|group=note|Also known as ''{{lang-pi|saccavajja}}'' or ''{{lang-sa|satyavādya}}''; ''{{lang-pi|saccavacana}}'' or ''{{lang-sa|satyavacana}}''; ''satyopavācana'', ''satyarākya'', ''satyavākya'', ''satyavacas'' or ''satyasrāvaṇā''; or simply ''{{lang-pi|sacca}}'' or ''{{lang-sa|satya}}''.{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=434}}{{sfn|Brown|1972|p=252}}}} is a solemn declaration of truth, expressed in ritual speech. Most often found in [[Buddhism]], it can be an utterance with regard to one's own virtue, or with regard to a certain fact, followed by a command or resolution. Such a statement is believed to effect a wonder-working power that can benefit oneself and others, depending on the truthfulness of the person making the statement. The ''sacca-kiriyā'' is a motif found in the stories of the Buddhist [[Pali Canon]] and its [[Atthakatha|commentaries]], as well as in post-canonical works such as the [[Milindapanha|Milindapañhā]] and the [[Avadāna]]s. In these stories it is found usually as a blessing, but sometimes as a curse. The motif can also be found in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jain]] texts.

The ''sacca-kiriyā'' presumes a moral force of truth that is operating in the world, and is stronger than gods or humans. Although ''sacca-kiriyā'' often refer to characteristics of [[the Buddha]], [[Dharma|the Buddhist teaching]], and the [[Sangha|monastic community]], it can also refer to facts with regard to natural phenomena, such as the sun or the moon. Some scholars believe that the effectiveness of a ''sacca-kiriyā'' as portrayed in stories depends on virtue and good character, whereas other scholars understand the ''sacca-kiriyā'' to be merely about speaking according to facts. Scholars theorize that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' is an ancient belief that precedes Buddhism, but was used in Buddhism as a teaching device to explain [[Buddhist ethics]] and other teachings. The [[principle]]s underlying the ''sacca-kiriyā'' have also been connected with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s ideal of [[satyagraha|non-violent resistance]], and many other aspects of Asian culture and religious life.

''Sacca-kiriyā'' is a compound noun that derives from the root verb ''saccikaroti'', meaning 'to bring before one's eyes, see face to face, realize, experience, attain'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of the Pali Language|first=Robert Caesar|last=Childers|author-link=Robert Caesar Childers|year=1875|publisher=[[Trübner &amp; Co]]|page=408 |title=Saccakaroti|url=https://static.sirimangalo.org/pdf/childersdictionary.pdf|oclc=922899496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''sacca-kiriya'' is a solemn asseveration with regard to the truth, expressed as a ritualized speech act.&lt;ref name="Shaw 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|1997|p=142}} It is usually a truthful utterance with regard to having performed a certain virtue, followed by a command or resolution,&lt;ref name="Shaw 2013"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/A%20Companion%20to%20Buddhist%20Philosophy_Emmanuel.pdf|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|editor1-last=Emmanuel|editor1-first=Steven M.|encyclopedia=A companion to Buddhist philosophy|title=Character, Disposition, and the Qualities of the ''Arahats'' as a Means of Communicating Buddhist Philosophy in the ''Suttas''|date=2013|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-470-65877-2|page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brown|1968|p=171}} called a 'truth-command' (''{{lang-pi|saccādhiṭṭhānaṃ}}'', ''{{lang-sa|satyādiṣṭhāna}}'').{{sfn|Harvey|1993|p=69}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=432}} The ''sacca-kiriyā'' will usually contain a phrase "By this truth may..." ({{lang-pi|Etena saccavajjena...|italic=yes}}) or "By this power may..." ({{lang-pi|tejasa...|italic=yes}}), followed by the command or wish.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=66–72, 81}} It is generally made with a specific end in mind, such as to control a spirit, a physical object, or cause something to be done.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=68}} Other examples given in the traditional literature are restoring eyesight after blindness, causing other living beings to help,&lt;!--p=68--&gt; causing pregnancy, and causing a sea to retreat.&lt;!--p=69--&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=68–9, 73}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|page=430}} Virtues referred to are to have never hurt a living being, having performed generosity,&lt;!--p=68--&gt; kindness, religious devotion and other virtues. The truthfulness in these virtues is considered the "ground" (''{{lang-pi|vatthu}}'') for the realization of the ''sacca-kiriyā'',{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=69}} but the ground need not be causally related to it.{{sfn|Gómez|2000|page=16}} Sometimes, the ''sacca-kiriyā'' is finished  with certain symbolic rituals, such as the pouring of water, bathing and putting on new garments, and so forth.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=70}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=432}} The ''sacca-kiriyā'' is always a formal act.{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|pp=432, 434}} Indologist George Thompson uses the term "[[performative utterance]]" as coined by philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], because the ''sacca-kiriyā'' manages to realize the statement "in the very uttering".{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=126}}

The Indic ''sacca-kiriyā'' is in its essence very similar to oaths that can be found in ancient [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European literature]].&lt;!--141--&gt; It differs, however, in that the speaker does not necessarily commit to a course of action, but rather expresses a performative utterance,&lt;!--142--&gt; which is immediate and miraculous in nature.&lt;!--143--&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|1998|pp=141-3}}

== Well-known examples ==
[[File:019 Visit of King Asoka to the Bodhi Tree (33769320382).jpg|alt=Relief depicting King Ashoka visiting the Bodhi Tree|upright=1.5|thumb|Visit of King [[Ashoka]] to the [[Bodhi Tree]].]]
There are many examples in literature and in Asian history of people making a ''sacca-kiriyā''. The most well-known is that of the Buddha himself. On the evening of his [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], as the Buddha is about to attain enlightenment, he is challenged by [[Mara (demon)|Māra]], the Buddhist personification of evil. Māra tries to stop the Buddha from attaining enlightenment by accusing him he has no right to sit on the seat beneath the [[Bodhi Tree|tree of enlightenment]], and challenging him to find a witness to his claim of enlightenment. The [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|Buddha-to-be]] then calls Mother Earth to testify of his [[parami|perfections of virtue]] on the evening of his enlightenment, the earth symbolizing [[sacca|truth and righteousness]]. He refers to the virtues he has practiced for many lifetimes. When the earth confirms the Buddha's claims, Māra retreats.{{sfn|Hara|2009|page=270}}{{sfn|Kariyawasam|2003|pages=590–1}} In another example, the Buddha-to-be  places a bowl upon the surface of the water. He declares that if he is to attain [[Buddhahood]] that evening, let the bowl float upwards against the stream, which then happens according to his declaration. In another widely quoted [[Jātaka]] story, a  quail is about to see its nest and fellow birds consumed by a forest fire. After the bird makes a statement about the "efficacy of virtue" (''{{lang-pi|sīla-gunṇa}}'') and "efficacy of truth" (''{{lang-pi|sacca-guṇa}}''), and by expanding on the virtues of the [[list of Buddhas|Buddhas in the past]], the fire miraculously retreats.{{sfn|Kariyawasam|2003|pages=590–1}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=432}}

A legendary example of a ''sacca-kiriyā'' referring to a future act is emperor [[Ashoka]], who vows that by the truth of his intention to support and sustain Buddhism, a dying [[Bodhi Tree]] may be saved, which then happens according to his vow.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=|p=71}}{{sfn|Kariyawasam|2003|page=591}} Another example raised by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]] is that of the Sri Lankan King [[Dutugamunu|Duṭṭhagāmaṇi]], who used a ''sacca-kiriyā'' in warfare.{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=289}} And more recently, the Buddhist reformer [[Anagarika Dharmapala|Anagārika Dharmapāla]] referred to his good intentions for restoring the pilgrimage site [[Bodh Gaya]] into Buddhist hands, and resolved that by those intentions help would come in this campaign.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=71}}

&lt;small&gt;Examples of ''sacca-kiriyā'' in Indic literature&lt;/small&gt;

== Motifs and principles ==
The ''sacca-kiriyā'' is a motif found in the stories of the Buddhist [[Pali Canon]] and its [[Atthakatha|commentaries]], as well as in post-canonical works such as the [[Milindapanha|Milindapañhā]] and the [[Avadāna]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Peter|title=An introduction to Buddhism: teachings, history and practices|date=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|edition=2nd|url=https://toleratedindividuality.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/an-introduction-to-buddhism-teachings-history-and-practices.pdf|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif can also be found in Hindu and [[Jain]] texts.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=67}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|p=432}} The motif of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' presumes a natural moral force operating in the world.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=68}} In some stories, as well as in aspirations recorded in inscriptions, mention is also made of [[merit (Buddhism)|merit]] ({{lang-pi|puñña|italic=yes}}; doing good works) as a force behind the miracles that occur.{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|page=430}}&lt;ref name="Worsley 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worsley|first1=Peter|title=Journeys, Palaces and Landscapes in the Javanese Imaginary. Some Preliminary Comments Based on the Kakawin Sumanasāntaka|journal=Archipel|date=2012|volume=83|issue=1|page=166|doi=10.3406/arch.2012.4342|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_2012_num_83_1_4342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the spiritual power of the [[Triple Gem]] (the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha), or that of [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]] is also related to it.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=70, 72}}{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|page=430}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=142–3}} Nevertheless, the truth of the statement, its agreement to actual events or qualities, is the main principle that is believed to allow a ''sacca-kiriyā'' to work: in the words of Indologist [[Eugene Watson Burlingame|Eugene Burlingame]], "There is nothing that cannot be accomplished by the Truth. Men, gods, powers of nature, all animate and inanimate things alike obey the Truth."{{sfn|Kariyawasam|2003|page=590}}{{sfn|Burlingame |1917|page=432}} In the Milindapañhā, considered the [[locus classicus]] about ''sacca-kiriyā'',{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=127}} The protagonist King [[Milinda]] asks how someone's eyesight (referring to a story of [[Sivi Kingdom|King Sivi]]) could be restored by divine means when this seems to contradict Buddhist doctrine. The monk [[Nāgasena]]'s reply is that King Sivi did not receive divine help, nor is there a physical cause for the healing, but he was healed "by truth alone".{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|pp=437–8}}{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=128}}

Although the ''sacca-kiriyā'' usually refers to a past act, sometimes devotees may refer to a future act which they will perform,&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; or a good intention that has not yet been acted upon.&lt;!--Kong--&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|1993|page=71}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=14}} Sometimes the ''sacca-kiriyā'' refers to a fact in the present, but the expressed wish refers to the future. This form is also known as an 'aspiration' ({{lang-pi|patthanā|italic=yes}}) and usually involves an aim in a future life.{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=179}} Moreover, a ''sacca-kiriyā'' can be performed for another person's benefit, for example to heal another person. In this case, the speaker may refer to the other's person virtue, rather than his own. Devotees performing a ''sacca-kiriyā'' may also refer to a truthful statement about the Triple Gem.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=71–2}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=63–4, 121}} An example of this is the statement that the Buddha is born "for the salvation of all beings".{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pages=71–2}} In the Buddhist text [[Ratana Sutta]] many other examples are given.{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=64}} Lastly, at times, a ''sacca-kiriya'' may refer to the reality of certain natural phenomena, such as the sun or moon, or the characteristics of certain places, or simply a factual statement,{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Gómez|2000|page=16}} even a failure to do something or a mistake made.{{sfn|Harvey|1993|pp=67, 73}} In general, however, the effectiveness of the utterance depends on the speaker's truthfulness and the religious merit the speaker possesses.{{sfn|Kariyawasam|2003|page=589}}&lt;ref name="Worsley 2012" /&gt;

Buddhist tales relate that not only spiritually advanced people can perform a ''sacca-kiriyā'', but also common people&lt;!--Gethin--&gt;, although this is less common in pre-Buddhist [[Vedic]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|authorlink1=Rupert Gethin|editor1-last=Twelftree|editor1-first=Graham H.|editor1-link=Graham Twelftree|title=The Cambridge companion to miracles|date=2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-89986-9|page=229|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NfGlUHU9bCMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Howard|2013|page=56}} Furthermore, in the literature examples exist of people using a ''sacca-kiriyā'' to deceive or curse others, or in other ways act in an anti-social way. Even these people have the power to control the outside environment and people through a ''sacca-kiriyā''.{{sfn|Burlingame |1917|page=431}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=10–1, 153}} Certain people with an immoral reputation in the stories, such as the courtesan Bindumatī, are also depicted as being able to do miracles, based on a truthful statement they make. In the case of the courtesan the truth is that she is "free alike from fawning and contempt" for her clients, regardless of their caste.&lt;!--p=440--&gt;{{sfn|Burlingame |1917|page=440}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=7, 12, 103–4}} Buddhism scholar Luis Gómez argued that the truth of the courtesan was simply that she never denied being a courtesan.{{sfn|Gómez|2000|page=17}}

Scholars are not in agreement what determines the power of the ''sacca-kiriyā''. Judging from the story of courtesan Bindumatī, religion scholar [[Malcolm David Eckel|Malcolm Eckel]] concludes that the ''sacca-kiriyā''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s power is in its underlying intention, not its words.{{sfn|Eckel|2001|page=68}} However, South Asian Studies scholar Choy Fah Kong argues that intention is not the major factor that explains the power of the ''sacca-kiriyā'', but rather whether the statement made agrees with facts.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=184–5, 188}} In studying examples from Vedic texts, Thompson concludes that the emphasis on self-assertion is a common characteristic in ''sacca-kiriyā'' statements, and that they are not necessarily morally motivated.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|pp=129–30, 145}} Both disagree with Indologist [[William Norman Brown]], who stressed that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' was mostly ethical rather than magical. On the other hand, Indologist [[Heinrich Lüders]] stated that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' is somewhere "in the middle between oath and magic".{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=140|ps=: "... zwischen Eid und Zauber die Mitte haltend."}}

== Origins ==
[[File:Religious syms.png|alt=Symbols of all major religions|thumb|According to the Indologist [[Eugene Watson Burlingame|Eugene Burlingame]], the ''sacca-kiriyā'' derives from a belief found everywhere in the world, that truth has an inherent importance and power in it.{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|pp=434–5}}]]
According to Burlingame, the ''sacca-kiriyā'' derives from a belief found everywhere in the world, which underlies many forms of religiosity, both of major religions and of [[folk religion]]: the belief that truth has an inherent importance and power in it.&lt;!--pp=434–5--&gt; He adds, however, that at times it may simply be a ''[[deux ex machina]]'' device to facilitate story-telling.&lt;!--p=437--&gt;{{sfn|Burlingame|1917|pp=434–5, 437}}

Indologist William Norman Brown argued that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' is based on "truth of life, personal integrity, truth in one's personal conduct in its totality, truth in acceptance of responsibilities and fulfillment of them".{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=8}}{{sfn|Brown|1972|p=260}} Through this personal integrity, the speaker of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' "can bend the cosmic forces to his will".{{sfn|Brown|1968|p=173}} Brown believed that this interpretation of the ''sacca-kiriya'' dates back as early as the [[Rig Veda]] (1700–1100 BCE). For this argument, Brown referred to an ancient Vedic belief that human beings could derive a power out of truth by fulfilling their [[vrata|duties]] ({{lang-sa|vrata|italic=yes}}) according to the [[ṛta|cosmic order]] ({{lang-sa|ṛta|italic=yes}}). Brown, as well as Indologist [[Heinrich Zimmer]], described the ''sacca-kiriyā'' as such perfect and moral fulfillment of duty,&lt;!--8-10, 101--&gt; referring to examples in Buddhist scripture and the Hindu [[Bhagavadgītā]].&lt;!--103-5--&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=8–10, 101, 103–5}}{{sfn|Howard|2013|page=52}} This fulfillment implies a high commitment to a virtue or vow and a sense of sacrifice to that end. Zimmer further argued that living one's life in a virtuous way like this, is in itself a ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;!--p=53--&gt;{{sfn|Howard|2013|pages=52–3}}

Thompson and Kong reject Brown's theory, however, both arguing  that Brown is applying [[anachronism]]s. Kong states that such a belief had not yet developed in Vedic times.&lt;!--92-3--&gt; Thompson takes issue with the moral
nature of Brown's theory.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=129}} Kong also rejects that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' is a fulfillment of duty, and argues that it is more a statement of fact.&lt;!--107-13--&gt; Kong, as well as Lüders, do concur that as early as the Rig Veda and [[Atharvaveda]], a belief is attested with regard to the efficacy of utterances of truth. Kong does describe the ''sacca-kiriyā'' as a pre-Buddhist "old belief". She does not believe it had much to do with fulfillment of duties, however.&lt;!--139--&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=10, 31, 92–3, 107–13, 139}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bosch|first=F.D.K.|year=1960|title=Een oudheidkundige benadering van het Brahman-probleem|language=nl|trans-title=An archeological approach to the ''brahman'' problem|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde|volume=116|issue=2|jstor=27860228|pp=208–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from textual analysis of Indic and other ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] sources, Thompson also argues that the ''sacca-kiriyā'' was a pre-Buddhist practice, popular and widespread.{{Sfn|Thompson|1998|p=133}}

Kong theorizes that the idea of ''[[ṛta]]'' as cosmic order should be understood in terms of the original meaning of the word ''ṛta'' as 'truth'. The ancient Indians believed that the world was created through the working-power of speech.&lt;!--pp=40-41, 63--&gt; She also relates the motif of ''sacca-kiriyā'' to the ancient practice of calling out the names of gods&lt;!--p=51--&gt; and requesting something of them.&lt;!--p=53--&gt; The working-power of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' does not lie in its moral intention or fulfillment of duty, but rather whether the utterance agrees with the facts. Furthermore, for the ancient Buddhists, the fact that the Buddha never spoke untruth in itself provided the devotee with miraculous power.&lt;!--..., 194--&gt; She construes that this ancient belief about the power of truthful facts has later been misunderstood by Buddhist commentators, and instead explained as the power of [[jhana|meditative attainment]] ({{lang-pi|jhāna|italic=yes}}), the power of [[metta|loving-kindness]] and the power of [[Śīla|morality]].&lt;!--191-4--&gt; However, she continues, these are not the actual {{em|manifestations}} of truth: only through the manifestation of truth, i.e. the spoken word that corresponds with facts, can a ''sacca-kiriyā'' be accomplished.&lt;!--209--&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=40–1, 51, 53, 63, 191–4, 209}}

With regard to the ''sacca-kiriyā'' scholars point out that speaking untruth in early [[Buddhist ethics]] was highly condemned, often more so than other vices: in other words, truthful speech was very important to Buddhist ethics.{{sfn|Appleton|2013|pages=31–2}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=169–71}}

The blessing of Aṅgulimāla is believed to be a means to tap into Aṅgulimāla's power. Just like the Aṅgulimāla Sutta, the Ratana Sutta and other ''parittas'' are  therefore still chanted today, as part of blessings given on special occasions. These texts will usually contain phrases typical for a truth-command in a ''sacca-kiriyā'', followed by a wish for the listeners.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=66–72, 81}}

Kong argues that the worship of relics in the early centuries of Buddhist history was based on the principle of ''sacca-kiriyā''. Thus, [[early Buddhism|early Buddhists]], as well as [[Theravada|Theravādins]], believed that a resolve made in front of the relics of an enlightened person could come true. They believed this not because of the invisible presence of the deceased master, but rather because of the truthfulness of the enlightened person: because the relics were of somebody who was believed to be "incapable of speaking false speech", what was said in front of the master's relics had also to come true.&lt;!--285-91--&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=285–91}} In [[Pure Land Buddhism]], following a similar belief, the power of the vow that [[Amitābha]] Buddha once took to help all [[sentient being (Buddhism)|living beings]] can be invoked again by [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] devotees today.{{sfn|Eckel|2001|pages=68–9}}{{sfn|Gómez|2000|pages=15-6}} They can do so by calling Amitābha's name, because "his Name is the Vow".{{sfn|Gómez|2000|page=19}}

[[File:Prathat-offering.jpg|alt=Flower offered in the hand of a Buddha image|right|thumb|When devotees [[Offering (Buddhism)|offer flowers to a Buddha image]], they may make a resolve for enlightenment, as a form of ''sacca-kiriyā''.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=61–3}}]]Also, the principles of ''sacca-kiriya'' have been connected to the confessions of Buddhist and Jain monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caillat|first=C.|year=2003|title=Gleanings from a Comparative Reading of Early Canonical Buddhist and Jaina Texts|journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies|url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8930/2823|page=41|volume=26|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the idea of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' may have motivated the aspirations ({{lang-pi|patthanā|italic=yes}}) of ancient Buddhists as found in Buddhist scriptures and [[epigraphical]] findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://globalstudies.gu.se/digitalAssets/1312/1312486_mcdaniel.euroseas.abtsracts.2010.1.pdf|first=Maria|last=Kekki|title=Curses, Truth and the Coming of Maitreya{{nowrap| -}} Lanna Inscriptions as Objects of Power|conference=Magic and Buddhism in Southeast Asia: A Critical Reassessment of the Field|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002258/https://globalstudies.gu.se/digitalAssets/1312/1312486_mcdaniel.euroseas.abtsracts.2010.1.pdf|archive-date=12 February 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=167}} and informed devotional practices. For example, when devotees [[offering (Buddhism)|offer flowers to a Buddha image]], they may make a resolve for enlightenment, based on the truth of the [[anicca|impermanence]] of the flowers on the one hand (a natural phenomenon), and based on the power of the accumulated merit on the other hand. Kong adds to that,

{{quote|Though the verse of offering flowers is recited in front of an image of the Buddha, it is not a prayer to the Buddha. Rather, it is an aspiration that is uttered on the basis of the belief in the power of truth utterance.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=61–3}}}}

Kong concludes that the teachings on the efficacy of [[merit-making]] activities and the [[transfer of merit|transference of such merit]] is "promoted and sustained" by the belief in the ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;!--61,205–9, 267--&gt; Other Buddhist teachings such as those about the ''[[parami|pāramis]]'' (virtues to be developed to be a Buddha),&lt;!--Brown--&gt; [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]],&lt;!--204-5--&gt; loving-kindness,&lt;!--136-9--&gt; as well as the spiritual power of the [[Triple Gem]] and the worship of relics among [[Theravada|Theravādins]], have also been explained using the pre-Buddhist belief in ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;!--146--&gt;{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=61, 136–9, 146, 204–9, 267}}{{sfn|Brown|1968|pp=175–6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Miller|first=B.S.|year=1979|title=On cultivating the immeasurable change of heart: The Buddhist brahma-vihāra formula|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1007/BF00164546|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' has also affected how the Hindu [[Upaniṣad]]s explain Hindu doctrine. The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], for example, explains the doctrine on the [[atman (Hinduism)|self]] by an example of a ''sacca-kiriyā'' performed by a thief.{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=134–6}}

=== Gandhian philosophy ===
Scholars have further linked the concept of ''sacca-kiriyā'' to [[Gandhi]]'s ideal of [[satyagraha|non-violent resistance]] ({{lang-sa|satyāgraha|italic=yes}}),&lt;!--p=52--&gt; literally meaning 'strict adherence to truth'.{{sfn|Howard|2013|page=55}}&lt;ref name="Sharma 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Arvind|author-link=Arvind Sharma|title=Fearlessness (Abhaya) as a fundamental category in Gandhian thought and practice|journal=South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies|date=June 1987|volume=10|issue=1|pages=36–7 |doi=10.1080/00856408708723092}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| Historian [[Dietmar Rothermund]] did point out that [[Gandhi]] was not familiar with the term ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Der Traditionalismus als Forschungsgegenstand für Historiker und Orientalisten|first=Dietmar|last=Rothermund|author-link=Dietmar Rothermund|page=145|journal=[[Saeculum (journal)|Saeculum]]|volume=40|issue=2|doi=10.7788/saeculum.1989.40.2.142|language=de|trans-title=Traditionalism as an object of research for historians and Orientalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ''Satyāgraha'', as Zimmer states, was based on Gandhi's "love of truth and dharma",{{sfn|Howard|2013|page=54}} and scholars argue that [[ahimsa|non-violence]] was Gandhi's ''sacca-kiriyā'', which defined his ''satyāgraha''.{{sfn|Brown|1972|p=267}}{{sfn|Kong|2006|pp=113–4}} Gandhi scholar Veena Howard does point out, however, that Gandhi's ''satyāgraha'' was a political community ideal, and was not limited to the individual as in the accounts of ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;!--p=55--&gt; Furthermore, in Gandhi's ''satyāgraha'', the [[Will of God|divine will]] played an important role, whereas in the traditional ''sacca-kiriyā'' this was not the case. Nevertheless, Gandhi's concept of God was abstract and impersonal,&lt;!--p=56--&gt; and with regard to the ''sacca-kiriyā'', religion scholar [[Arvind Sharma]] notes that Gandhi equated God with truth, or even placed truth above God, and morality above the metaphysical.{{sfn|Howard|2013|pages=52, 55–6}}&lt;ref name="Sharma 1987" /&gt;

Brown argued that the idea of the '' sacca-kiriyā'' has not only influenced [[Gandhian philosophy]], but has also inspired the national Indian motto  ''[[Satyam eva jayate|Satyaṃ eva jayate]]'', meaning 'Truth alone conquers', originating from the [[Mundaka Upanishad|Muṇḍaka Upaniśad]].{{sfn|Brown|1972|p=268}}

=== Other applications ===
[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|alt=Painting of Chinese monk walking with a large backpack|thumb|[[Xuanzang]] (602–664 CE)|upright=0.4]]
''Sacca-kiriyās'' may have been used as a device to prove someone's innocence or truthfulness during an [[trial by ordeal|ordeal]], as has been recorded in ancient Indian epics and classical dramas. This involved entering into a fire, and it was believed the innocent would survive the ordeal by the power of their truthfulness, expressed through a ''sacca-kiriyā''.{{sfn|Hara|2009|pages=253–4, 260}} However, in a Jain story relating a fire-ordeal, the accused survives by admitting her wrongdoing, rather than her innocence.{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=12}} Brown did not think that such ordeals were actual ''sacca-kiriyā'',  though, as such passages merely teach "the widespread belief that Truth protects the righteous".{{Sfn|Brown|1972|p=267}}

Other applications of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' have also been observed. A ''sacca-kiriyā'' is inscribed at the gateway of the first [[stupa|''stupa'' (monument)]] at [[Sanchi]] with a deterrent statement to the effect that a vandal of the ''stupa'' will be cursed.{{sfn|Kong|2006|p=141}} Also, the Vedic ''[[ṛṣi]]'' poets would usually close their hymns with a ''sacca-kiriyā''.{{sfn|Thompson|1997|p=142}} Furthermore, statements very similar to the ''sacca-kiriyā'' were part of [[brahmodya|religious debates in ancient India]], as the participants of the debate wagered their own lives, should they follow incorrect procedure during the debates. Thus, participants of debates are found to put their lives on the line in this manner in the [[Upanishad|Upaniṣads]], in early Buddhist discourses, and in the accounts of the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] (602–664 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=The case of the shattered head |first=M. |last=Witzel|editor-first=Inge|editor-last=Wezler|encyclopedia=Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik|year=1987|pages=397, 407–8, 415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif of the ''sacca-kiriyā'' continues to feature in South-Asian literature, up until modern times.{{sfn|Brown|1968|p=176}} For example, Asian Studies scholar Keller Kimbrough writes that [[waka (poetry)|18th-century Japanese poems]] contain statements very similar to a ''sacca-kiriya''. Sometimes used to conjure rain and alleviate drought, it was believed that such poetry had to be written with an honest intention to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimbrough|first1=R.

Apart from applications in religions that date from India, it has also been suggested some [[Zoroastrianism|Zorastrianist]] texts can be explained as forms of ''sacca-kiriyā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malandra|first1=W.

'''Saci''' ({{IPA-pt|saˈsi|pron}} {{small|or}} {{IPA-pt|sɐˈsi|}}) is a character in [[Brazilian folklore]]. He is a one-legged [[Black Brazilian|black]] or [[mulatto]] [[Youth|youngster]], who smokes a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] and wears a magical red cap that enables him to disappear and reappear wherever he wishes (usually in the middle of a [[dust devil]]). Considered an annoying [[trickster|prankster]] in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he nevertheless grants wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However, his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell. Most people who claimed to have stolen this cap say they can never wash the smell away.

There are several variants of the myth, including:&lt;ref&gt;ARAÚJO, Alceu Maynard. ''Folclore nacional,'' São Paulo, Ed. Melhoramentos, 1964, v.1, p.419 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Saci-pererê''' ({{IPA-pt|sɐˈsi pe̞ɾeˈɾe|pron}}), black as coal (the best known); '''Saci-trique''' ({{IPA-pt|sɐˈsi ˈtɾikɪ|pron}}), mulatto and more benign; '''Saci-saçurá''' ({{IPA-pt|sɐˈsi sɐsuˈɾa|pron}}), with red eyes. 

'''Saci-pererê''' is also the name of a Brazilian [[cocktail]] consisting of {{convert|60|mL}} of [[cachaça]] and {{convert|45|mL}} of [[honey]], which is a home remedy said to be useful in treating the [[common cold]].

==Powers, weaknesses, and habits==
[[File:Saci perere.jpg|thumb|upright|100px|left|Saci]]
An incorrigible prankster, the Saci causes no major harm, but there is no little harm that he won't do. He hides children's toys, sets farm animals loose, teases dogs—and curses [[chicken]] eggs, preventing them from hatching. In the kitchen, the Saci spills salt, sours the milk, burns the bean stew, and drops flies into the soup. 

If a [[popcorn]] kernel fails to pop, it is because the Saci cursed it. Given half a chance, he dulls the [[seamstress]]'s needles, hides her thimbles, and tangles her sewing threads. If he sees a nail lying on the ground, he turns the point up.  In short, people blame anything that goes wrong—in or outside the house—on the Saci.

Besides disappearing or becoming invisible (often with only his red cap and the red glow of his pipe still showing), the Saci can transform himself into a ''[[Striped cuckoo|Matitaperê'' or ''Matita Pereira]]'', an elusive bird whose melancholic song seems to come from nowhere.  One can escape a pursuing Saci by crossing a water [[stream]].  the Saci dares not cross, for then he loses all his powers. Another way is to drop ropes full of knots. The Saci is compelled to stop and undo the knots. One can also try to appease him by leaving behind some [[cachaça]], or some [[tobacco]] for his pipe.

He is fond of juggling [[charcoal|ember]]s or other small objects and letting them fall through the holes on his palms. An exceedingly nimble fellow, the lack of his right leg does not prevent him from bareback-riding a horse, and sitting cross-legged while puffing on his pipe (a feat comparable to the [[Headless Mule]]'s gushing fire from the nostrils).

Every [[dust devil]], says the legend, is caused by the spin-dance of an invisible Saci. One can capture him by throwing into the dust devil a [[rosary]] made of separately [[blessing|blessed]] [[prayer beads]], or by pouncing on it with a [[sieve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lobato.globo.com/Images/infantil/OSacyilustrVoltolino.jpg|title=SÍTIO DO PICAPAU AMARELO – 2ª VERSÃO|website=lobato.globo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With care, the captured Saci can be coaxed to enter a dark glass bottle, where he can be imprisoned by a cork with a cross marked on it. He can also be enslaved by stealing his cap, which is the source of his power. However, depending on the treatment he gets from his master, an enslaved Saci who regains his freedom may become either a trustworthy guardian and friend, or a devious and terrible enemy.

==Origins of the legend==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Saci Perere por Marconi.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of the Saci-pererê'' (2007) by J. Marconi.]]
While some{{Who|date=October 2012}} claim that the Saci myth originated in [[Europe]] in the 13th century such as the [[Monopod (creature)]], it probably{{Weasel-inline|date=October 2012}} derives from the ''Ŷaci-ŷaterê'' of [[Tupi people|Tupi]]-[[Guarani people|Guarani]] mythology, a magic one-legged child with bright red hair who would spell-bind people and break the forest's silence with his loud shouts and whistles. He was originally a creature of the night, and indeed the ''ŷaci'' ({{IPA|jaˈsi}}) means "Moon" in [[Old Tupi language|Old Tupi]].

This indigenous character was appropriated and transformed in the 18th century by the [[Africa]]n slaves who had been brought in large numbers to Brazil. Farm slaves would tell Saci stories to amuse and frighten the children. In this process the creature became black, his red hair metamorphosed into a red cap, and, as the African elders who usually told the tales, he came to be always smoking his clay-and-reed pipe. His name mutated into various forms, such as ''Saci Taperê'' and ''Sá Pereira'' (a common [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] name), and eventually ''Saci Pererê.''

His red cap may have been inspired on the [[Trasgo]] a mythical Portuguese creature with exact same powers as the Saci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algunas trastadas del Diablu|url=http://www.fusionasturias.com/2007/enero/cultura.htm|website=Fusion Asturias|accessdate=23 January 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saci-Pererê concept shows some [[syncretism]] with [[Christian]] elements: he bolts away when faced with crosses, leaving behind a sulphurous smell &amp;mdash; classical attributes of the [[devil]] in Christian folklore.

The concepts of imprisoning a supernatural being in a bottle by a magically marked cork, and of forcing him to grant wishes in return of his liberty, have obvious parallels in the story of [[Aladdin]] from the [[Arabian Nights]]. This may be more than just a coincidence, since some  slaves were [[Muslim]]s and thus presumably familiar with the Arabian tales. Moreover, the occupation of parts of the [[Portugal|Portuguese territory]] (namely in the south) by the Muslim [[Moors]], between the years 711 and 1249, provides another possible path for Arabian influence on the Saci legend. Some people believe that Saci does exist.

==In popular culture==
*The character remains quite popular in present-day Brazilian urban culture, mainly due to the immensely popular children's book ''O Saci'' by [[Monteiro Lobato]] (1932). Saci also has appearances in other films and TV series adaptations of [[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]].
*In the 1960s, the one-legged gnome &amp;mdash; by now "domesticated" into a prankish but inoffensive and lovable creature &amp;mdash; was chosen by premier Brazilian cartoonist [[Ziraldo]] as the leading character of his comics magazine, ''[[Turma do Pererê]].'' This original publication, the first of its genre to feature entirely "national" characters, was short-lived, but paved the way for other Brazilian cartoonists like [[Ziraldo]], [[Angeli (cartoonist)|Angeli]], [[Laerte]], and [[Mauricio de Sousa]].
*[[Tom Jobim]]'s song ''[[Waters of March|Águas de Março]]'' mentions the ''Matinta Pereira,'' and [[Nei Lopes]]'s samba song entitled ''Fumo de Rolo'' tells a tale of a fisherman being accosted by the saci while collecting reeds in the forest. The sací demands some tobacco for his pipe, but the poor fellow has lost his.
*[[Sport Club Internacional]] has the figure of Saci as its mascot, owing to the club's popular roots and the fans' hope that the team could pull tricks on their opponents. When [[Wason Rentería]] played for the club, in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, he would often celebrate his goals by doing an impression of Saci.
*With the purpose of countering the growing trend of adopting the [[Anglo-Celtic]] [[Halloween]] in Brazil (in Portuguese called ''Dia das Bruxas),'' the Day of the Saci was created in 2005, and it is likewise commemorated on October 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/musicacultura/saci-perere.htm|title=Saci-Pererê - folclore, lenda, mito, história, Dia do Saci|first=CacauLimão Comunicação|last=Digital|website=www.suapesquisa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tongue-in-cheek]] Society of Saci Observers was also created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sosaci.org/|title=sosaci.org|website=www.sosaci.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 2012 video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', set mainly in [[São Paulo|São Paulo, Brazil]], a trickster Saci makes a cameo as a villain in the [[Story within a story#TV Show within a video game|in-game cartoon show]], ''The Adventures of Captain Baseball Bat Boy''. In it Saci has his trademark pipe, red cap and shorts, and is missing his right leg. However, his skin is green, which is most likely to avoid any unintended racism due to the fact that his rivals in said cartoon, Captain Baseball Bat Boy and Bicycle Helmet Girl are both white in skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMs6p9AN904|title=Max Payne 3 gameplay: Captain BaseBall Bat Boy!

A novel species of [[dinosauromorph]], discovered in 2001 at [[Agudo, Rio Grande do Sul|Agudo]] (southern Brazil), was named ''[[Sacisaurus]]'' because the [[fossil]] [[skeleton]] was missing one leg.&lt;ref&gt;Ferigolo, J. and Langer, M.C.

Since the Saci's one-legged physique reminds us of people with a [[physical disability]], a [[social network]] named SACI (an acronym of ''Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunicação e Informação'', or [[social solidarity|Solidarity]], Support, [[Communication]] and Information) was created at the [[University of São Paulo]] with the purpose of stimulating these four efforts towards the social and medical [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] of physically disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saci.org.br/?IZUMI_SECAO=2 Rede SACI: Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunicação e Informação - Índice » A SACI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418042507/http://www.saci.org.br/?IZUMI_SECAO=2 |date=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a mascot==
Despite being a one-legged creature, the character is believed to be very agile and powerful, always defeating his enemies. As so, it's a mascot of some sport clubs in Brazil such as [[Sport Club Internacional]] and [[Social Futebol Clube]].

== Early life and education ==
MacFarlane was born and raised in [[Kent, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (born 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt; His sister is voice actress [[Rachael MacFarlane|Rachael Ann MacFarlane]] (born 1976). He has roots in [[New England]] going back to the 1600s, and is a descendant of ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[William Brewster (Mayflower passenger)|William Brewster]].&lt;ref name=wrgsou /&gt; MacFarlane's parents met in 1970, when they both lived and worked in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and married later that year.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt; The couple moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the Admissions Office at [[South Kent School]]. She later worked in the College Guidance and Admissions Offices at the [[Kent School]], a selective [[college preparatory school]], where Ronald was a teacher.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teacher"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF920E64F34493&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=One-man campaign out for 'Family Guy' |work= Fort Worth Star-Telegram |agency=Associated Press |date=July 2, 1999 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |quote=Seth MacFarlane has been out of prep school for eight years, but the headmaster is still on his case. The top administrator of the Kent School is leading a one-man campaign to get advertisers to drop The Family Guy, an animated TV comedy created by MacFarlane, a 1991 Kent alumnus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his childhood, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration and began drawing cartoon characters [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Woody Woodpecker]], as early as two years old.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Levin|title='Dad' joins 'Guy' for yuks|date=February 2, 2005|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc.|url =https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-02-02-macfarlane_x.htm |work =USA Today|accessdate = December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of five, MacFarlane knew that he would want to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating [[flip book]]s, after his parents found a book on the subject for him.&lt;ref name="studio1"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= I was two years old when I started drawing... I knew by five that I wanted to get into animation, and there was just no... there was no information at the time. And I think my parents found one book on animation, that they scrounged up for me, and they got it from a library, you know, two towns over.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, aged nine, MacFarlane began publishing a weekly comic strip titled "Walter Crouton" for ''The Kent Good Times Dispatch'', the local newspaper in Kent, Connecticut, which paid him five dollars per week.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;&lt;ref name="studio2"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= Walter Crouton was a comic strip that I did for our local paper, and I started when I was about nine years old, and, I would do it every week for, you know, five bucks a pop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one anecdote from the time, MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always "weirdly fascinated by the [[Mass (liturgy)|Communion]] ceremony". He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking "Can I have fries with that?" The paper printed it and he got an "angry letter" from the local priest; it led to "sort of a little mini-controversy" in the town.&lt;ref name=MusicToo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/17/140946967/seth-macfarlane-tvs-family-guy-makes-music-too |title=Seth MacFarlane: TV's 'Family Guy' Makes Music, Too |date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teacher" /&gt; While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an [[8 mm film|8 mm camera]].&lt;ref name="studio3"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= I didn't really take a hard crack at {{interp|animation}} until I was in high school. My parents got me an 8&amp;nbsp;mm movie camera.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane went on to study film, video, and animation at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; As a student, he had intended to work for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] but changed his mind after graduating.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

At RISD MacFarlane created a series of independent films, meeting future ''Family Guy'' cast member [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate. During his time at RISD, he performed stand-up comedy.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seth-macfarlane-family-guy-star-trek-247364 |title=Seth MacFarlane Secretly Wants 'Family Guy' to End; Relaunch 'Star Trek' for TV |publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter'' |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his senior year he made a thesis film titled ''[[Larry shorts|The Life of Larry]]'', which became the inspiration for ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/celebs/c116217_seth_macfarlane.html |title=Seth MacFarlane – Profile |publisher=E!

== Career ==

=== Television career ===

==== Hanna-Barbera years ====
MacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President [[Fred Seibert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/nicktoons/2006/06/09/seth-macfarlane/ |title=The Nicktoons Network Animation Festival-Seth MacFarlane |publisher=Frederator Studios |date=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of ''The Life of Larry'', rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He worked as an animator and writer for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an "old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', and ''[[Johnny Bravo]]''.&lt;ref name="stlouis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=My TV hero: Daniel Roche on Seth MacFarlane |author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/29/my-tv-hero-seth-macfarlane |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as both a writer and [[storyboard artist]], MacFarlane spent the most time on ''Johnny Bravo''. He found it easier to develop his own style at ''Johnny Bravo'' through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''Cow and Chicken'', and ''I Am Weasel'' did not use.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; As a part of the ''Johnny Bravo'' crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as [[Adam West]] and [[Jack Sheldon]] of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ''Family Guy'' series.

He also did freelance work for [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], writing for ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', and for [[Nelvana]], where he wrote for ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ''Ace Ventura'').&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ''Zoomates'' for [[Frederator Studios]]' ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frederatorblogs.com/channel_frederator/2006/02/25/rumor-confirmed/ |title=Rumor Confirmed |date=February 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|Larry &amp; Steve]]'', which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''. Executives at Fox saw both ''Larry'' shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane – he's the "Family Guy"|accessdate = December 31, 2007|last = Bartlett|first = James|date = March 12, 2007|website = greatreporter.com|publisher = Presswire Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Family Guy'' ====
{{Main|Family Guy}}
Although MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He first pitched ''Family Guy'' to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was trying to get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million).&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="megadeal"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=Family Guy creator seals megadeal |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macfarlane/family-guy-creator-seals-megadeal-idUSN0435504220080505 |website=Reuters |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling the experience in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', MacFarlane stated, "I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot".&lt;ref name="Weinraub"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinraub |first1=Bernard |title=The Young Guy Of 'Family Guy'; A 30-Year-Old's Cartoon Hit Makes An Unexpected Comeback |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/arts/young-guy-family-guy-30-year-old-s-cartoon-hit-makes-unexpected-comeback.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en |date=7 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a "very, very simply, crudely animated film – with just enough to get the tone of the show across" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and ordered the series immediately.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of ''Family Guy'' for a January 1999 debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mink|last=Eric|title= Fox Fine-'Toons Its Midseason Lineup|date=July 24, 1998|publisher=|url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/07/24/1998-07-24_fox_fine-_toons_its_midseaso.html|archive-url =https://archive.is/20120906034211/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/07/24/1998-07-24_fox_fine-_toons_its_midseaso.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =September 6, 2012|work =[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |page =|accessdate = May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Family Guy'' was originally intended to be a series of shorts on ''[[MADtv]]'', much in the same way ''[[The Simpsons]]'' had begun on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's ''MADtv'' connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

''Family Guy'' first aired January 31, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717064830/http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archivedate=2009-07-17 |title=''Family Guy'' Returns to Production with an Initial Order of 22 New Episodes to Premiere in Early 2005 |date=March 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |website=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane's work in animating ''Family Guy'' has been influenced by [[Jackie Gleason]] and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref name="personal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas |last=McLean |title=Seth MacFarlane: ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad!'' |date=June 1, 2007 |publisher=Reed Business |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117966166.html?nav=eproducer07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65bly3WCg?url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117966166.html?nav=eproducer07 |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |work=Variety |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing three episodes, "[[Death Has a Shadow]]", "[[Family Guy Viewer Mail 1]]" and "[[North by North Quahog]]", MacFarlane voices ''Family Guy''{{'}}s main male characters – [[Peter Griffin]], [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Brian Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and additional characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and established fan loyalty, ''Family Guy'' developed into a US$1-billion franchise.&lt;ref name="megadeal" /&gt; On May 4, 2008, after approximately two and a half years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a US$100-million agreement with Fox to keep ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' until 2012. The agreement makes him the world's highest paid television writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/family-guy-creator-signs-lucra-19173.aspx ''Family Guy'' Creator Signs Lucrative Deal with Fox.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115154922/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/family-guy-creator-signs-lucra-19173.aspx |date=January 15, 2016 }} BuddyTV.

MacFarlane's success with ''Family Guy'' has opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer [[Walter Murphy]] created ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]''. The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track "Stewie's Sexy Party".&lt;ref name="Vegas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=D. |first1=Spence |title=Family Guy Live in Vegas |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/28/family-guy-live-in-vegas |website=IGN |accessdate=7 September 2018 |date=28 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fan of Broadway musicals,&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; MacFarlane comments on using musicals as a component to ''Family Guy'':

{{bquote|I love the lush orchestration and old-fashioned melody writing ... it just gets you excited, that kind of music", he said. "It's very optimistic. And it's fun.

During the sixth season, episodes of ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' were delayed from regular broadcast due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] (which MacFarlane participated in to support the writers while Fox aired three ''Family Guy'' episodes without MacFarlane's permission).

==== ''American Dad!'' ====
{{Main|American Dad!}}
MacFarlane has a second long-running, successful [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom|animated series]] in ''American Dad!'' which has been in production since early 2005. To date, ''American Dad!'' is MacFarlane's only animated series never to have suffered an official cancellation, though it did undergo a network relocation from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] on October 20, 2014, following the show's [[American Dad! (season 11)|11th season]]. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode [[American Dad! (season 12)|12th season]]. Reportedly, the purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new animated broadcasts on Fox's now-defunct "[[Animation Domination]]" lineup. It was reported that the relocation of ''American Dad!'' allowed room for other shows, such as ''[[Mulaney]]'' and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called ''[[Bordertown (2016 TV series)|Bordertown]]''. ''Bordertown'' ran during the 2015–16 television season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bubbleblabber.com/bordertown-being-pushed-til-fox-fall-2015/|title=Bordertown being pushed til FOX Fall 2015?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While MacFarlane regularly does extensive [[voice acting]] work for ''American Dad!'', he has left much of the show's [[creative direction]] up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity.&lt;ref name="doorly1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Doorly |url=http://www.doorly.com/writing/seth-macfarlane.htm |title=Seth MacFarlane Interview |publisher=Doorly.com |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, as announced on November 4, 2013, Barker departed ''American Dad!'' after 10 seasons of serving as the show's producer/co-[[showrunner]], resulting from creative differences as production for season 11 on TBS commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/american-dad-executive-producerco-showrunner-mike-barker-exits/ |title='American Dad' Executive Producer/Co-Showrunner Mike Barker Exits |publisher=Deadline.com |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shakeup"&gt;{{cite web |title='American Dad' Shakeup: Co-Creator Leaving Before TBS Move |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/american-dad-shakeup_n_4218021.html |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=16 October 2018 |date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Dad!'' was first shown after [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], debuting with the episode "[[Pilot (American Dad!)|Pilot]]", which MacFarlane co-wrote. This February 6, 2005 series premiere was somewhat of an early sneak preview as the program would not begin airing regularly as part of Fox's Animation Domination until May 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series/american-dad/ |title=''American Dad'': Series Overview |accessdate=December 22, 2007 |website=MSN |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodman |first1=Tim |title=American Dad |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of atypical scheduling of the show's [[American Dad!

What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear if any of these plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.

MacFarlane has described the initial seasons of ''American Dad!'' as being similar to ''[[All in the Family]]'', likening [[title role|title character]] [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]]'s originally [[bigotry|bigoted]] persona to [[Archie Bunker]].&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;Norton James.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071229222114/http://www.flakmag.com/features/macfarlane.html "Seth MacFarlane's Third Act"].

His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an ''American Dad!'' fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the "[[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]]" character by fans via his Twitter.&lt;ref name="by Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012" /&gt;

The show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, [[wikt: dog-eat-dog|dog-eat-dog]], rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]], he works as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its [[story arc]] elements and other [[American Dad!#Plot techniques|distinguishing plot techniques]]); Stan's [[wikt: paradox|paradoxically]] moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, [[Francine Smith|Francine]]; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley]] and nerdy son [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve]]. Accompanying the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which belong to [[non-human]] species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]], who's [[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|full of disguises/alter egos]] and has few if any limits on his behaviors.

In 2011, it was announced that MacFarlane would be reviving ''[[The Flintstones#Cancelled Seth MacFarlane reboot|The Flintstones]]'' for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, with the first episode airing in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/1/willllllllllmmmmaaa-animated-flinstones-to-be-resurrected-by-seth-macfarlane/|title=Willllllllllmmmmaaa!

Regarding Broadway, MacFarlane told ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "If I did a Broadway musical, I'd probably want to do something a little bit more old-fashioned", and went on saying "I wouldn't necessarily do something that was as edgy as what they &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Book of Mormon (musical)|have done]]. The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for 2011?"&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; He has also said that, "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate.

MacFarlane appeared on the November 11, 2006 episode of Fox's comedy show ''[[MADtv]]'' and performed a live action re-enactment of a scene from the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High]]". In the scene, Peter and Lois suspect [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] of murdering his teacher's husband. As a reaction, a terrified Meg jumps out the window. For the live-action sequence, besides MacFarlane, [[Nicole Parker]] played Lois, [[Ike Barinholtz]] played Chris, [[Nicole Randall Johnson]] played Meg, and [[Keegan-Michael Key]] played Stewie. According to MacFarlane, the live-action thing didn't work too well. After that clip, MacFarlane showed the same scene, but with celebrities who didn't pay attention to the script. They messed up their lines so badly that MacFarlane, in his Peter voice, screamed "The script, guys! Come on!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/news/television/mad-tv-gets-more-animated-fox "MAD TV Gets More Animated on FOX"]. AWN Headline News. November 2, 2006.

In an interview with [[NPR]], MacFarlane commented on their vocal training, to which he said "They really drill you," he said. "They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... [They teach you to] show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he's singing, there's a lot of very exposed teeth.

In 2015, MacFarlane revealed support for [[Bernie Sanders]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], and he introduced Sanders onstage at a [[Los Angeles]] rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wx3T0Xs7Ks|title=Seth MacFarlane Introduces Bernie Sanders at Los Angeles Rally}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the primaries, MacFarlane then supported [[Hillary Clinton]] for president during the general election.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, T.

==== LGBT issues ====
[[File:SethMcFarlaneBillMaherSept10.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with black hair and slight stubble, wearing a black button-up shirt, speaking into a microphone. A man with gray hair, looking straight forward, and wearing suit, sits behind him.|MacFarlane speaking at a ceremony for [[Bill Maher]] to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in September 2010]]
MacFarlane is passionate about his support for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]]. In 2008 he called it "infuriating and idiotic" that two gay partners "have to go through this fucking [[Dog and pony show|dog and pony act]] when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" He went on to say, "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time".&lt;ref name=Advocate2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2008/01/25/bgf-seth-macfarlane|title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane|publisher=Advocate|author=Voss, Brandon|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane continued, "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?"&lt;ref name=Advocate2 /&gt;

MacFarlane, in recognition of "his active, passionate commitment to [[humanism|humanist]] values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues", was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166:seth-macfarlane-harvard-humanist-of-the-year-2011&amp;catid=6:latest-news&amp;Itemid=38|website=Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard|title=Seth MacFarlane, Harvard Humanist of the Year 2011!|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, MacFarlane was criticized for his portrayal of [[transsexualism]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Quagmire's Dad]]". Gay novelist [[Brent Hartinger]] found the episode's inclusion of [[transphobia|transphobic]] remarks from Peter and [[Lois Griffin]]—as well as a scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be [[Glenn Quagmire]]'s father—to be "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, "Frankly, it's literally ''impossible'' for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot".&lt;ref name="aeidiot"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hartinger, Brent |title=Is Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane a Complete Idiot? |publisher=AfterElton.com |date=May 10, 2010 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513151543/http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot |archivedate=May 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" about the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Rosales, Jonathan| title = GLAAD Shares Community Concerns About Last Night's Family Guy| publisher = [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] | date =May 10, 2010| url = http://glaadblog.org/2010/05/10/glaad-shares-community-concerns-about-last-nights-family-guy/| accessdate =May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane said he was "surprised" by the negative reaction to "Quagmire's Dad", saying that "it seemed that [gay commentators] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wallace (2010-08).

=== Lawsuits ===
On October 3, 2007, [[Bourne Co.

Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of their music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Walter Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a [[First Amendment]]-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature magic parody act, involving absurd faux magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |website=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox]], [[Steve Callaghan]], and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—"purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work", and "amount and substantiality of the taking"—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—"economic impact"—had to await more fact-finding.

'''The Coexistence Trust''' is an organisation founded in 2005 by [[Lord Janner of Braunstone]] and [[Prince Hassan of Jordan]]. The body was originally named "The Political Council for Coexistence".

==Purpose and mission==
A network of senior [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] political leaders worldwide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalfamily.org/patronati/pa/coexistence_eng.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322203414/http://www.royalfamily.org/patronati/pa/coexistence_eng.htm |date=March 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with its headquarters in [[London]], UK, the Trust provides a bridge across the political spectrum to combat [[Islamophobia]] and [[Anti-Semitism]] wherever it may be found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UK |url=https://secure.purecharity.org.uk/cgi-bin/csp.py/charity?CharityRef=8 |title=Fundraising with Pure Charity |publisher=Secure.purecharity.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust uses its level of access to intervene at the highest levels of [[government]] whenever and wherever there are [[racist]] attacks against Muslims or Jews.

The Trust believes that with [[political authority]] comes the responsibility to be sensitive to the role of [[religion]] in public life. Therefore, the Trust regularly arranges private meetings between leaders from the spheres of religion and [[politics]] to discuss contemporary issues. In addition to its membership, The Trust has a distinguished group of [[patrons]]. These are among others, eminent personalities from the [[Abrahamic faiths]].

The Coexistence Trust’s mission is to strengthen mutual understanding between Jewish and Muslim communities worldwide and to provide an enlightened [[centrist]] platform for Muslim and Jewish political leaders to combat [[Islamophobia]] and [[Anti-Semitism]] at senior levels. It envisions a world in which the dialogue between Muslim and Jewish leaders is collaborative, open, respectful and focused on the benefit of society as a whole.

[[File:Werwolf.png|thumb|right|[[Woodcut]] of a werewolf attack by [[Lucas Cranach der Ältere]], 1512]]
In [[folklore]], a '''werewolf'''{{efn|1=Also spelled '''werwolf'''. Usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛər|ˌ|w|ʊ|l|f}}, but also sometimes {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪər|ˌ|w|ʊ|l|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɜr|ˌ|w|ʊ|l|f}}.}} ({{lang-ang|werwulf}}, "man-wolf") or occasionally '''lycanthrope''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|k|ə|n|ˌ|θ|r|oʊ|p}} ({{lang-grc-gre|λυκάνθρωπος}} ''lukánthrōpos'', "wolf-person") is a human with the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] (or, especially in modern film, a [[Therianthropy|therianthropic]] [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] wolflike creature), either purposely or after being placed under a [[curse]] or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called '''lycanthropy''' {{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|k|æ|n|θ|r|ə|p|i}}, are [[Petronius]] (27–66) and [[Gervase of Tilbury]] (1150–1228).

The werewolf is a widespread concept in [[European folklore]], existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a [[Christianisation|Christian interpretation]] of underlying European folklore developed during the [[Christendom|medieval period]]. From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the [[New World]] with [[colonialism]]. Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in [[European witchcraft|witches]], in the course of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now [[Switzerland]] (especially the [[Valais]] and [[Vaud]]) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.

The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the "[[witch-hunt]]" phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials.{{efn|1=Lorey (2000) records 280 known cases; this contrasts with a total number of 12,000 recorded cases of executions for witchcraft, or an estimated grand total of about 60,000, corresponding to 2% or 0.5% respectively. The recorded cases span the period of 1407 to 1725, peaking during the period of 1575–1657.}} During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of [[Peter Stumpp]] (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and [[Werewolf witch trials|persecution of supposed werewolves]], primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of [[wolf-charmer]]s recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]].{{efn|1=Lorey (2000) records six trials in the period 1701&amp;1725, all in either Styria or Carinthia; 1701 Paul Perwolf of Wolfsburg, Obdach, Styria (executed); 1705 "Vlastl" of Murau, Styria (verdict unknown); 1705/6 six beggars in Wolfsberg, Carinthia (executed); 1707/8 three shepherds in Leoben and Freyenstein, Styria (one lynching, two probable executions); 1718 Jakob Kranawitter, a mentally retarded beggar, in Rotenfel, Oberwolz, Styria (corporeal punishment); 1725: Paul Schäffer, beggar of St. Leonhard im Lavanttal, Carinthia (executed).}}

After the end of the witch-trials, the werewolf became of interest in [[folklore studies]] and in the emerging [[Gothic horror]] genre; [[werewolf fiction]] as a genre has pre-modern precedents in medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] (e.g. ''[[Bisclavret]]'' and ''[[Guillaume de Palerme]]'') and developed in the 18th century out of the "semi-fictional" [[chap book]] tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern [[popular culture]].

The word ''werewolf'' continues a late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''wer(e)wulf'', a compound of ''[[were]]'' "man" and ''wulf'' "wolf". The only [[Old High German]] testimony is in the form of a given name, ''Weriuuolf'', although an early [[Middle High German]] ''werwolf'' is found in [[Burchard of Worms]] and [[Berthold of Regensburg]]. The word or concept does not occur in medieval German poetry or fiction, gaining popularity only from the 15th century. Middle Latin ''gerulphus'' Anglo-Norman ''garwalf'', [[Old Frankish]] ''*wariwulf''.&lt;ref name="werwolf"&gt;
"Werwolf" in Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]''. {{cite web |url=http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GW18183 |title=online version |publisher= uni-trier.de|accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/7/L0260700.html |chapter=loup-garou |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4 |year=2000 |access-date=2005-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113115529/http://www.bartleby.com/61/7/L0260700.html |archive-date=2006-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }} {{cite book |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots: w-ro- |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2000 |edition=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Old Norse had the cognate ''varúlfur'', but because of the high importance of werewolves in [[Norse mythology]], there were alternative terms such as ''[[Berserker#Ulfhednar_-_wolf_warriors|ulfhéðinn]]'' ("one in wolf-skin", referring still to the totemistic or cultic adoption of wolf-nature rather than the superstitious belief in actual shape-shifting). In modern Scandinavian also ''kveldulf'' "evening-wolf", presumably after the name of [[Kveldulf Bjalfason]], a historical berserker of the 9th century who figures in the Icelandic sagas.

The term ''lycanthropy'', referring both to the ability to transform oneself into a wolf and to the act of so doing, comes from [[Ancient Greek]] λυκάνθρωπος ''lukánthropos'' (from λύκος ''lúkos'' "wolf" and ἄνθρωπος, ''ánthrōpos'' "human").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first= C. |year=2000 |title=Giants, Monsters &amp; Dragons: An Encyclopedia of Folklore, Legend and Myth |location=New York |publisher= Norton |isbn= 0-393-32211-4 |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word does occur in ancient Greek sources, but only in [[Late Antiquity]], only rarely, and only in the context of [[clinical lycanthropy]] described by [[Galen]], where the patient had the ravenous appetite and other qualities of a wolf; the Greek word attains some currency only in [[Byzantine Greek]], featuring in the 10th-century encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In the entry on [[Marcellus of Side]], stating that this 2nd-century author wrote about the topic of lycanthropy. {{lang|grc|(Μ 205) Μάρκελλος Σιδήτης, ἰατρός, ἐπὶ Μάρκου Ἀντωνίνου. οὗτος ἔγραψε δι’ ἐπῶν ἡρωϊκῶν βιβλία ἰατρικὰ δύο καὶ μʹ, ἐν οἷς καὶ περὶ λυκανθρώπου.}} (cited after A. Adler, '' Suidae lexicon'', Leipzig: Teubner, 1928-1935); see [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=mu,205 Suda Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of the Greek-derived ''lycanthropy'' in English occurs in learned writing beginning in the later 16th century (first recorded 1584 in ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' by [[Reginald Scot]], who argued ''against'' the reality of werewolves; "Lycanthropia is a disease, and not a transformation." v. i. 92), at first explicitly for [[clinical lycanthropy]], i.e. the type of insanity where the patient imagines to have transformed into a wolf, and not in reference to supposedly real shape-shifting. Use of ''lycanthropy'' for supposed shape-shifting is much later, introduced ca. 1830.

Slavic uses the term ''vlko-dlak'' (Polish ''wilkołak'', Czech ''vlkodlak'', Slovak ''vlkolak'', Serbo-Croatian ''вукодлак'' - ''vukodlak'', Slovenian ''volkodlak'', Bulgarian ''върколак/vrkolak'', Belarusian ''ваўкалак/vaukalak'', Ukrainian ''вовкулака/vovkulaka''), literally "wolf-skin", paralleling the Old Norse ''[[ulfhéðinn]]''. However, the word is not attested in the medieval period. The Slavic term was loaned into modern Greek as ''[[Vrykolakas]]''. Baltic has related terms, Lithuanian ''vilkolakis'' and ''vilkatas'', Latvian ''vilkatis'' and ''vilkacis''. The name ''vurdalak'' (вурдалак) for the Slavic [[vampire]] ("ghoul, revenant") is a corruption due to [[Alexander Pushkin]], which was later widely spread by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|A.K. Tolstoy]] in his novella ''[[The Family of the Vourdalak]]'' (composed in French, but first published in Russian translation in 1884).

Greek λυκάνθρωπος and Germanic ''werewulf'' are parallel inasmuch as the concept of a shapeshifter becoming a wolf is expressed by means of a [[nominal composition|compound]] "wolf-man" or "man-wolf".

==History==
===Indo-European comparative mythology===
[[File:Lekythos Dolon Louvre CA1802.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dolon (mythology)|Dolon]] wearing a wolf-skin. Attic red-figure vase, c. 460 BC.]]
[[File:Bronsplåt pressbleck öland vendeltid.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vendel period]] depiction of a warrior wearing a wolf-skin (''[[Tierkrieger]]'')]]

The werewolf folklore found in Europe harks back to a common development during the [[Middle Ages]], arising in the context of [[Christianisation]], and the associated interpretation of pre-Christian mythology in Christian terms. Their underlying common origin can be traced back to [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]], where ''lycanthropy'' is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the warrior class. This is reflected in Iron Age Europe in the ''[[Tierkrieger]]'' depictions from the Germanic sphere, among others. The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Kim R. McCone, "Hund, Wolf, und Krieger bei den Indogermanen" in W. Meid (ed.), Studien zum indogermanischen Wortschatz, Innsbruck, 1987, 101-154&lt;/ref&gt;
Such transformations of "men into wolves" in pagan cult were associated with the devil from the early medieval perspective.

The concept of the werewolf in Western and Northern Europe is strongly influenced by the role of the wolf in [[Germanic paganism]] (e.g. the French ''loup-garou'' is ultimately a loan from the Germanic term), but there are related traditions in other parts of Europe which were not necessarily influenced by Germanic tradition, especially in [[Slavic Europe]] and the [[Balkans]], and possibly in areas bordering the Indo-European sphere (the Caucasus) or where Indo-European cultures have been replaced by military conquest in the medieval era (Hungary, Anatolia).{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

In his ''[[Man into Wolf]]'' (1948), [[Robert Eisler]] tried to cast the Indo-European tribal names meaning "wolf" or "wolf-men" in terms of "the European transition from fruit gathering to predatory hunting."{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}
&lt;!--what is this? the "transition from fruit gathering to predatory hunting" happened in deep prehistory, 1.8 Mya, and has clearly nothing to do with PIE or Europe--&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisler"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eisler, Robert |title=Man Into Wolf - An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism, and Lycanthropy |year=1948 |id= ASIN B000V6D4PG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Lycaon Transformed into a Wolf LACMA M.71.76.9.jpg|thumb|[[Zeus]] turning [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]] into a [[wolf]], engraving by [[Hendrik Goltzius]].]]

A few references to men changing into wolves are found in [[Ancient Greek literature]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]]. [[Herodotus]], in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Herodotus| title=Histories| chapter=IV.105}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the [[Neuri]], a tribe he places to the north-east of [[Scythia]], were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, and then changed back to their human shape. In the second century BC, the Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] related the story of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], who was transformed into a wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. In accounts by the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Bibliotheca'']]'' (3.8.1) and [[Ovid]] (''[[Metamorphoses]]'' I.219-239), Lycaon serves human flesh to [[Zeus]], wanting to know if he is really a god. Lycaon's transformation, therefore, is punishment for a crime, considered variously as murder, cannibalism, and impiety.
Ovid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of [[Arcadia]] in the form of wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ovid |title=[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]] |chapter=i|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ménard|first=Philippe|title=Symposium in honorem prof. M. de Riquer|year=1984|publisher=Barcelona UP|language=French|pages=209–38|chapter=Les histoires de loup-garou au moyen-âge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. [[Virgil]] wrote of human beings transforming into wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Virgil |title=[[Bucolica]] |chapter=viii |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he would be free to swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes [[Agriopas]] regarding a tale of a man who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.

In the [[Latin]] work of [[prose]], the ''[[Satyricon]]'', written circa AD 60 by [[Petronius|Gaius Petronius Arbiter]], one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61-62). He describes the incident as follows, "When I look for my buddy I see he'd stripped and piled his clothes by the roadside... He pees in a circle round his clothes and then, just like that, turns into a wolf!... after he turned into a wolf he started howling and then ran off into the woods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Petronius |authorlink= Petronius |title=Satyrica |year= 1996 |publisher= University of California |location= Berkeley |isbn= 0-520-20599-5 |page=56|others= R. Bracht Branham and Daniel Kinney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
There was no widespread belief in werewolves in medieval Europe before the 14th century. There were some examples of man-wolf transformations in the court literature of the time. [[Liutprand of Cremona]] reports a rumour that Bajan, son of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]], could use magic to turn himself into a wolf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000743_00128.html?sortIndex=010%3A070%3A0041%3A010%3A00%3A00 ''Antapodosis'' 3.29]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie de France]]'s poem ''[[Bisclavret]]'' (c. 1200), in which the nobleman Bizuneh, for reasons not described, had to transform into a wolf every week. When his treacherous wife stole his clothing needed to restore his human form, he escaped the king's wolf hunt by imploring the king for mercy and accompanied the king thereafter. His behaviour at court was so much gentler than when his wife and her new husband appeared at court, that his hateful attack on the couple was deemed justly motivated, and the truth was revealed.

The German word ''werwolf'' is recorded by [[Burchard von Worms]] in the 11th century, and by [[Bertold of Regensburg]] in the 13th, but is not recorded in all of medieval German poetry or fiction. References to werewolves are also rare in England, presumably because whatever significance the "wolf-men" of Germanic paganism had carried, the associated beliefs and practices had been successfully repressed after Christianization (or if they persisted, they did so outside of the sphere of literacy available to us).&lt;ref&gt;Baring-Gould, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germanic pagan traditions associated with wolf-men persisted longest in the Scandinavian [[Viking Age]]. [[Harald I of Norway]] is known to have had a body of ''[[Berserker|Úlfhednar]]'' (wolf coated [men]), which are mentioned in the Vatnsdœla saga, Haraldskvæði, and the [[Volsunga saga|Völsunga saga]], and resemble some werewolf legends. The Úlfhednar were fighters similar to the berserkers, though they dressed in [[Wolf hunting#Pelts|wolf hides]] rather than those of bears and were reputed to channel the spirits of these animals to enhance effectiveness in battle.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; These warriors were resistant to pain and killed viciously in battle, much like wild animals. Úlfhednar and berserkers are closely associated with the Norse god [[Odin]].

The Scandinavian traditions of this period may have spread to [[Kievan Rus']], giving rise to the Slavic "werewolf" tales. The 11th-century [[Belarus]]ian Prince [[Usiaslau of Polatsk|Vseslav of Polatsk]] was considered to have been a Werewolf, capable of moving at superhuman speeds, as recounted in ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'': 

"Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan. The path of Great Sun, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed. For him in Polotsk they rang for matins early at St. Sophia the bells; but he heard the ringing in Kiev."

The situation as described during the medieval period gives rise to the dual form of werewolf folklore in Early Modern Europe. On one hand the "Germanic" werewolf, which becomes associated with the [[Early Modern witch-hunts|witchcraft panic]] from around 1400, and on the other hand the "Slavic" werewolf or ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/vьlkolakъ|vlkolak]]'', which becomes associated with the concept of the [[revenant]] or "vampire". The "eastern" werewolf-vampire is found in the folklore of Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Romania and the Balkans, while the "western" werewolf-sorcerer is found in France, German-speaking Europe and in the Baltic.

===Early modern history===
{{Further|Werewolf witch trials|Wolfssegen}}
There were numerous reports of werewolf attacks – and consequent court trials – in 16th-century France. In some of the cases there was clear evidence against the accused of murder and [[cannibalism]], but none of association with wolves; in other cases people have been terrified by such creatures, such as that of [[Gilles Garnier]] in [[Dole, Jura|Dole]] in 1573, there was clear evidence against some wolf but none against the accused.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The ''loup-garou'' eventually ceased to be regarded as a dangerous heretic and reverted to the pre-Christian notion of a "man-wolf-fiend". The ''lubins'' or ''lupins'' were usually female and shy in contrast to the aggressive ''loups-garous''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Werewolvery was a common accusation in witch trials throughout their history, and it featured even in the [[Valais witch trials]], one of the earliest such trials altogether, in the first half of the 15th century. Likewise, in the [[Vaud]], child-eating werewolves were reported as early as 1448. A peak of attention to lycanthropy came in the late 16th to early 17th century, as part of the [[European witch-hunts]].
A number of treatises on werewolves were written in France during 1595 and 1615. Werewolves were sighted in 1598 in [[Anjou]], and a teenage werewolf was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Bordeaux]] in 1603. [[Henry Boguet]] wrote a lengthy chapter about werewolves in 1602. In the Vaud, werewolves were convicted in 1602 and in 1624. A treatise by a Vaud pastor in 1653, however, argued that lycanthropy was purely an illusion. After this, the only further record from the Vaud dates to 1670: it is that of a boy who claimed he and his mother could change themselves into wolves, which was, however, not taken seriously. At the beginning of the 17th century [[witchcraft]] was prosecuted by [[James I of England]], who regarded "warwoolfes" as victims of delusion induced by "a natural superabundance of melancholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Demonologie |chapter=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1650, belief in Lycanthropy had mostly disappeared from French-speaking Europe, as evidenced in [[Diderot's Encyclopedia]], which attributed reports of lycanthropy to a "disorder of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoyt|first1=Nelly S.|last2=Cassierer|first2=Thomas, trans.|title=The Encyclopedia: Selections: Diderot, d'Alembert and a Society of Men of Letters|date=1965|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there were continuing reports of extraordinary wolf-like beasts (but not werewolves). One such report concerned the [[Beast of Gévaudan]] which terrorized the general area of the [[Provinces of France|former province]] of [[Gévaudan]], now called [[Lozère]], in south-central France; from the years 1764 to 1767, an unknown entity killed upwards of 80 men, women, and children.
The only part of Europe which showed vigorous interest in werewolves after 1650 was the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. At least nine works on lycanthropy were printed in Germany between 1649 and 1679. In the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, belief in werewolves persisted well into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. William Monter, "Witchcraft in France and Switzerland" in Otten (ed.) ''A Lycanthropy reader'' (1986), 161-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, [[wolf attacks on humans]] were an occasional, but still widespread feature of life in Europe.&lt;ref name="NO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcie.org/Docs/Regions/Baltic/Linnell%20AZL%20Wolf%20attacks%20in%20Fennoscandia.pdf |format=PDF |title=Is the fear of wolves justified?

Some scholars have suggested that it was inevitable that wolves, being the most feared predators in Europe, were projected into the folklore of evil shapeshifters. This is said to be corroborated by the fact that areas devoid of wolves typically use different kinds of predator to fill the niche; ''[[werehyena]]s'' in Africa, ''[[weretiger]]s'' in India,&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; as well as ''werepumas'' ("''runa uturuncu''")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/p243/12479418822381506109435/p0000001.htm Facundo Quiroga, "The Tiger of the Argentine Prairies" and the Legend of the "''runa uturuncu''".] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quipucultural.galeon.com/uturuncu.htm The Legend of the ''runa uturuncu'' in the Mythology of the Latin-American Guerilla.] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''werejaguars'' ("''yaguaraté-abá''" or "''tigre-capiango''")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temakel.com/leyendayaguarete.htm The Guaraní Myth about the Origin of Human Language and the Tiger-men.] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Ambrosetti (1976). Fantasmas de la selva misionera ("''Ghosts of the Misiones Jungle''"). Editorial Convergencia: Buenos Aires.&lt;/ref&gt; in southern South America.

An idea is explored in [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s work ''The Book of Werewolves'' is that werewolf legends may have been used to explain [[serial killer|serial killings]]. Perhaps the most famous example is the case of [[Peter Stumpp]] (executed in 1589), the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and [[cannibal]], also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.{{CN|date=June 2018}}

===Asian cultures===

In Asian Cultures{{which|date=October 2014}}, the "were" equivalent is a weretiger or wereleopard. (See [[werecats]])

Common [[Altaic mythologies|Turkic folklore]] holds a different, reverential light to the werewolf legends in that Turkic Central Asian [[Shamanism|shamans]] after performing long and arduous rites would voluntarily be able to transform into the humanoid "Kurtadam" (literally meaning Wolfman). Since the wolf was the totemic ancestor animal of the Turkic peoples, they would be respectful of any shaman who was in such a form.

(See [[Asena]])

==Lycanthropy as a medical condition==
{{see also|Hypertrichosis|Clinical lycanthropy}}
Some modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of [[Guy's Hospital]] in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled ''On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves'', in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital [[porphyria]], stating how the symptoms of [[photosensitivity]], reddish teeth and [[psychosis]] could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf.&lt;ref name="Illis-1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Illis |first1=L |title=On Porphyria and the Ætiology of Werwolves |journal=Proc R Soc Med |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=23–6 |date=Jan 1964 |pmid=14114172 |pmc=1897308}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been sufferers of [[hypertrichosis]], a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; People suffering from [[Down syndrome]] have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths.&lt;ref name="SAM" /&gt; Woodward suggested [[rabies]] as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Dening T R &amp; West A (1989) Multiple serial lycanthropy. ''Psychopathology'' 22: 344-347&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk beliefs==
[[File:GermanWoodcut1722.jpg|thumb|right|A German woodcut from 1722]]

===Characteristics===
The beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his [[Doppelgänger|double]] whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a [[altered state of consciousness|state of trance]]; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a [[familiar spirit]], whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.

Werewolves were said in European folklore to bear tell-tale physical traits even in their human form. These included the [[Unibrow|meeting of both eyebrows]] at the bridge of the nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition recalls a werewolf can be recognised by bristles under the tongue.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Werewolf Delusion |last=Woodward |first=Ian |year=1979 |publisher= Paddington Press |location= |isbn=0-448-23170-0 }}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The appearance of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture, though it is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves save for the fact that it has no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf by the fact that it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Varulv|url=http://svt.se/2.150216/vasen|accessdate=2011-05-16|episodelink=|series=Väsen|serieslink=|credits=[[Ebbe Schön]]|network=[[Sveriges Television|SVT]]|station=|airdate=2011-05-16|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|quote=|language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414121333/http://svt.se/2.150216/vasen|archivedate=2011-04-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;
One universally reviled trait in medieval Europe was the werewolf's habit of devouring recently buried corpses, a trait that is documented extensively, particularly in the ''Annales Medico-psychologiques'' in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;
[[Fennoscandia]]n werewolves were usually old women who possessed poison-coated claws and had the ability to paralyse cattle and children with their gaze.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

===Becoming a werewolf===
Various methods for becoming a werewolf have been reported, one of the simplest being the removal of clothing and putting on a belt made of wolfskin, probably as a substitute for the assumption of an entire animal skin (which also is frequently described).&lt;ref name="Fate"&gt;Bennett, Aaron. “So, You Want to be a Werewolf?” [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]. Vol. 55, no. 6, Issue 627. July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic [[salve]].&lt;ref name="Fate" /&gt; Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal in question or from certain enchanted streams were also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Elliot. ''Werwolves''. Methuen. London. 1912. pp. 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 16th-century Swedish writer [[Olaus Magnus]] says that the [[Livonia]]n werewolves were initiated by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his ''Songs of the Russian People'' gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

In other cases, the transformation was supposedly accomplished by [[Satanism|Satanic]] allegiance for the most loathsome ends, often for the sake of sating a craving for human flesh. "The werewolves", writes [[Richard Verstegan]] (''Restitution of Decayed Intelligence'', 1628), &lt;!-- DO NOT FIX SPELLING, THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE ORIGINAL ARCHAIC TEXT --&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;are certayne sorcerers, who having annoynted their bodies with an ointment which they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a certayne inchaunted girdle, does not only unto the view of others seem as wolves, but to their own thinking have both the shape and nature of wolves, so long as they wear the said girdle. And they do dispose themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and most of humane creatures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal [[metamorphosis]], or of sending out a [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the [[magic (paranormal)|magician]], male and female, all the world over; and [[Witchcraft|witch]] superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connection with the bush-soul of the West African and the ''[[nagual]]'' of [[Central America]]; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the ''nagual'' with a human being are not termed lycanthropy. 

The curse of lycanthropy was also considered by some scholars as being a divine punishment. Werewolf literature shows many examples of [[God]] or saints allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with werewolfism. Such is the case of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], who was turned into a wolf by [[Zeus]] as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were [[excommunicate]]d by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were also said to become werewolves.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

The power of transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to malignant sorcerers, but to [[List of saints|Christian saints]] as well. ''Omnes angeli, boni et Mali, ex virtute naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra'' ("All angels, good and [[fallen angel|bad]] have the power of transmutating our bodies") was the dictum of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]. [[St. Patrick]] was said to have transformed the [[Wales|Welsh]] King Vereticus into a wolf; [[Natalis of Ulster|Natalis]] supposedly cursed an illustrious Irish family whose members were each doomed to be a wolf for seven years. In other tales the divine agency is even more direct, while in Russia, again, men supposedly became werewolves when incurring the wrath of the Devil.

A notable exception to the association of Lycanthropy and the Devil, comes from a rare and lesser known account of an 80-year-old man named [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun|Thiess]]. In 1692, in [[Jürgensburg]], [[Livonia]], Thiess testified under oath that he and other werewolves were the Hounds of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gershenson, Daniel. ''Apollo the Wolf-God''. (Journal of Indo- European Studies, Monograph, 8.) McLean, Virginia: Institute for the Study of Man, 1991, {{ISBN|0-941694-38-0}} pp. 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
He claimed they were warriors who went down into hell to do battle with witches and demons. Their efforts ensured that the Devil and his minions did not carry off the grain from local failed crops down to hell. Thiess was steadfast in his assertions, claiming that werewolves in Germany and Russia also did battle with the devil's minions in their own versions of hell, and insisted that when werewolves died, their souls were welcomed into heaven as reward for their service. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for Idolatry and [[Superstition|superstitious belief]].

===Remedies===
Various methods have existed for removing the werewolf form. In antiquity, the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion in curing people of lycanthropy. The victim would be subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of being purged of the malady. This practice stemmed from the fact that many alleged werewolves would be left feeling weak and debilitated after committing depredations.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

In medieval Europe, traditionally, there are three methods one can use to cure a victim of werewolfism; medicinally (usually via the use of [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]]), surgically, or by [[exorcism]]. However, many of the cures advocated by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured if one were to simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing werewolfism in the medieval period; a devotion to [[Hubertus|St. Hubert]] has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.

===Connection to revenants===
{{Further|Revenant}}
Before the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the corpses of werewolves, if not destroyed, would return to life in the form of wolves or hyenas which prowled battlefields, drinking the blood of dying soldiers. In the same vein, in some rural areas of Germany, Poland and Northern France, it was once believed that people who died in mortal sin came back to life as blood-drinking wolves.
These "undead" werewolves would return to their human corpse form at daylight. They were dealt with by decapitation with a spade and exorcism by the parish priest. The head would then be thrown into a stream, where the weight of its sins was thought to weigh it down. Sometimes, the same methods used to dispose of ordinary vampires would be used. The [[vampire]] was also linked to the werewolf in East European countries, particularly Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, the werewolf and vampire are known collectively as ''vulkodlak''.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

===Hungary and Balkans===
In [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] folklore, the werewolves used to live specially in the region of [[Transdanubia]], and it was thought that the ability to change into a wolf was obtained in the infant age, after the suffering of abuse by the parents or by a curse. At the age of seven the boy or the girl leaves the house and goes hunting by night and can change to person or wolf whenever he wants. The curse can also be obtained when in the adulthood the person passed three times through an arch made of a [[Birch]] with the help of a wild [[rose]]'s spine.

The werewolves were known to exterminate all kind of farm animals, especially sheep. The transformation usually occurred in the [[Winter solstice]], [[Easter]] and full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary not only were conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist creating connections between both kinds. Also the vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungary, being both feared in the antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Szabó, György. Mitológiai kislexikon, I-II., Budapest: Merényi Könyvkiadó (év nélkül) Mitólogiai kislexikon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[South Slavs]], and also among the [[Kashub]]s of what is now northern Poland,{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;{{Cite book

[[Serbia]]n ''vukodlak''s traditionally had the habit of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and hang them from trees. They would then get a hold of another ''vulkodlak''{{'}}s skin and burn it, releasing from its curse the ''vukodlak'' from whom the skin came.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

===Caucasus===
According to [[Armenia]]n lore, there are women who, in consequence of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form.&lt;ref&gt;The Fables of Mkhitar Gosh (New York, 1987), translated with an introduction by R. Bedrosian, edited by Elise Antreassian and illustrated by Anahid Janjigian&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.

===Americas and Caribbean===
{{Main|Skin-walker}}
The Naskapis believed that the [[caribou]] afterlife is guarded by giant wolves which kill careless hunters venturing too near. The [[Navajo people]] feared witches in wolf's clothing called "Mai-cob".&lt;ref name="SAM"&gt;{{cite book

Woodward thought that these beliefs were due to the [[Norse colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;
When the [[European colonization of the Americas]] occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore with them and were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies and those of the Natives. Belief in the ''loup-garou'' present in [[Canada]], the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of [[Michigan]]&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.gphistorical.org/legends03.html Legends of Grosse Pointe].&lt;/ref&gt; and upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the [[Wendigo]]. In [[Mexico]], there is a belief in a creature called the ''nahual'', which traditionally limits itself to stealing [[cheese]] and raping women rather than murder.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In [[Haiti]], there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as ''Jé-rouge'' (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic lupine creatures. The Haitian ''jé-rouges'' typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian ''jé-rouges'' differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

==Modern reception==
===Werewolf fiction===
{{Main|Werewolf fiction}}
[[File:The Were-Wolf by Clemence Housman.jpg|thumbnail|right|''The Were-Wolf'' by [[Clemence Housman]]]]
Most modern fiction describes werewolves as vulnerable to [[silver]] weapons and highly resistant to other injuries. This feature appears in German folklore of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D.L.]] (1997-2010) ''Werewolf Legends from Germany''. http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/werewolf.html#temmezarnow&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that the [[Beast of Gévaudan]], an 18th-century wolf or wolf-like creature, was shot by a silver bullet appears to have been introduced by novelists retelling the story from 1935 onwards and not in earlier versions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jackson (1995) ''Witchcraft and the Occult''. Devizes, Quintet Publishing: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
English Folk-lore, prior to 1865, showed shape shifters to be vulnerable to silver.
"...till the publican shot a silver button over their heads when they were instantly transformed into two ill-favoured old ladies..."&lt;ref&gt;S. Baring-Gould. "The Book of Were-Wolves". (1865)&lt;/ref&gt; c. 1640 the city of Greifswald, Germany was infested by werewolves. "A clever lad suggested that they gather all their silver buttons, goblets, belt buckles, and so forth, and melt them down into bullets for their muskets and pistols. ... this time they slaughtered the creatures and rid Greifswald of the lycanthropes."&lt;ref&gt;Temme, J.D.H. Die Volkssagen von Pommern und Rugen. Translated by [[D.L. Ashliman]]. Berlin: In de Nicolaischen Buchhandlung, 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and the short story "[[Dracula's Guest]]", both written by [[Bram Stoker]], drew on earlier mythologies of werewolves and similar legendary demons and "was to voice the anxieties of an age", and the "fears of late [[Victorian age|Victorian]] [[patriarchy]]".&lt;ref name=Sellers&gt;Sellers, Susan. ''Myth and Fairy Tale in Contemporary Women's Fiction'', Palgrave Macmillan (2001) p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Dracula's Guest," a band of military horsemen coming to the aid of the protagonist chase off Dracula, depicted as a great wolf stating the only way to kill it is by a "Sacred Bullet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Brett|title=Dracula's Guest|page=11|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/pdf/stories/03guest/01guest.pdf|quote="A wolf--and yet not a wolf!" ... "No use trying for him without the sacred bullet," a third remarked}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also mentioned in the main novel Dracula as well.

The first feature film to use an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] werewolf was ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' in 1935.

Abrams |isbn=0-8109-0922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as lead actor [[Henry Hull]] was unwilling to spend long hours being made up by makeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, pp. 119-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios]] drew on a Balkan tale of a plant associated with lycanthropy as there was no literary work to draw upon, unlike the case with vampires. There is no reference to silver nor other aspects of werewolf lore such as cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, pp. 117-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more tragic character is [[Lawrence Talbot]], played by [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] in 1941's ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''. With Pierce's makeup more elaborate this time,&lt;ref name=Clem120&gt;Clemens, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; the movie catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness.&lt;ref name=FoSFF/&gt; Sympathetic portrayals are few but notable, such as the comedic but tortured protagonist [[David Naughton (actor)|David Naughton]] in ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiger|first= Brad |title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shapeshifting Beings|publisher=Visible Ink |location=Farmington Hills, MI |year=1999 |isbn=1-57859-078-7 |oclc=41565057 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a less anguished and more confident and charismatic [[Jack Nicholson]] in the 1994 film ''[[Wolf (1994 film)|Wolf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiger |first= Brad |title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shapeshifting Beings |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1999 |isbn=1-57859-078-7 |oclc=41565057 |page= 330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the depiction of werewolves has gone from fully malevolent to even heroic creatures, such as in the ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series, as well as ''[[Blood Lad]]'', ''[[Dance in the Vampire Bund]]'', ''[[Rosario + Vampire]]'', and various other movies, [[anime]], [[manga]], and [[comic book]]s.

Other werewolves are decidedly more willful and malevolent, such as those in the novel ''[[The Howling]]'' and its subsequent sequels and [[The Howling (film)|film adaptations]]. The form a werewolf assumes was generally anthropomorphic in early films such as ''The Wolf Man'' and ''Werewolf of London'', but larger and powerful wolf in many later films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiger |first=Brad |title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shapeshifting Beings |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1999 |isbn=1-57859-078-7 |oclc=41565057}} p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Werewolves are often depicted as immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to [[silver]] objects, such as a silver-tipped cane, [[Silver bullet|bullet]] or blade; this attribute was first adopted cinematically in ''The Wolf Man''.&lt;ref name=Clem120/&gt; This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns. Current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or being transmitted like an [[infectious disease]] by the bite of another werewolf. In some fiction, the power of the werewolf extends to human form, such as invulnerability to conventional injury due to their healing factor, super-human speed and strength and falling on their feet from high falls. Also aggressiveness and animalistic urges may be intensified and harder to control (hunger, sexual arousal). Usually in these cases the abilities are diminished in human form. In other fiction it can be cured by medicine men or antidotes.

Along with the vulnerability to the silver bullet, the full moon being the cause of the transformation only became part of the depiction of werewolves on a widespread basis in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="WicherSpyra2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Wicher|author2=Piotr Spyra|author3=Joanna Matyjaszczyk|title=Basic Categories of Fantastic Literature Revisited|date=19 November 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-7143-3|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie to feature the transformative effect of the full moon was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref name="Cook2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald F.|last=Glut|title=The Frankenstein Archive|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786413530|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi Germany===
Nazi Germany used ''Werwolf'', as the mythical creature's name is spelled in German, in 1942–43 as the codename for [[Werwolf (Wehrmacht HQ)|one of Hitler's headquarters]]. In the war's final days, the Nazi "Operation [[Werwolf]]" aimed at creating a commando force that would operate behind enemy lines as the Allies advanced through Germany itself.

Two fictional depictions of "Operation Werwolf"—the US television series ''[[True Blood]]'' and the 2012 novel ''Wolf Hunter'', by J.L. Benét—mix the two meanings of "Werwolf" by depicting the 1945 diehard Nazi commandos as being actual werewolves{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.
