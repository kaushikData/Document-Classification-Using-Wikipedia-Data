The '''Alaska Permanent Fund''' is a constitutionally established [[permanent fund]] managed by a [[state-owned corporation]], the '''Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation''' (APFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/aboutAPFC/aboutAPFC.cfm |title=About the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC) |publisher=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in [[Alaska]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Alaska Permanent Fund?|url=http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/aboutFund/aboutPermFund.cfm|publisher=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|accessdate=September 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728225046/http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/aboutFund/aboutPermFund.cfm|archivedate=July 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Article 9, Section 15 of the Alaska State Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska State Constitution, 9.15|url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/folioproxy.asp?url=http://wwwjnu01.legis.state.ak.us/cgi-bin/folioisa.dll/acontxt/query=*/doc/{@121}?next|publisher=State of Alaska|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Governor [[Jay Hammond]].

==History==
Shortly after the [[Petroleum|oil]] from Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] began flowing to market through the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], the Permanent Fund was created by an [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[Alaska Constitution]]. It was designed to be an investment where at least 25% of the oil money would be put into a dedicated fund for future generations, who would no longer have oil as a resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why did Alaskans create the Fund?|url=http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/aboutFund/fundFAQ.cfm|publisher=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporations|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean the fund is solely funded by oil revenue{{explain|date=November 2018}}. The Fund  includes neither property taxes on oil company property nor income tax from oil corporations, so the minimum 25% deposit is closer to 11% if those sources were also considered.&lt;sup&gt;[Context?]&lt;/sup&gt; The Alaska Permanent Fund sets aside a certain share of oil revenues to continue benefiting current and all future generations of Alaskans. Many citizens {{Who|date=February 2010}} also believed that the legislature too quickly and too inefficiently spent the $900 million bonus the state got in 1969 after leasing out the oil fields.  This belief spurred a desire to put some oil revenues out of direct political control.

The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation manages the assets of both the Permanent Fund and other state investments, but spending Fund income is up to the Legislature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The Corporation is to manage for maximum prudent return, and not—as some Alaskans at first wanted—as a development bank for in-state projects. The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $53.7 billion as of July 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska Permanent Fund - Balance Sheet|url=http://www.apfc.org/_amiReportsArchive/APFC201208.pdf|publisher=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some growth was due to good management, some to inflationary re-investment, and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years. Each year, the fund's realized earnings are split between [[inflation]]-proofing, operating expenses, and the annual Permanent Fund Dividend.

The fund is a member of the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]]&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/members |title=IFSWF Our members |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=24 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927094338/http://www.ifswf.org/members |archivedate=September 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has therefore signed up to the [[Santiago Principles]] on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds. The Fund's current chief investment officer is Marcus Framption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APFC Promotes Marcus Frampton to Chief Investment Officer - Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation |url=https://apfc.org/fund-news/apfc-promotes-marcus-frampton-to-chief-investment-officer/ |website=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation |date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Permanent Fund Dividend ==

The Permanent Fund Dividend [PFD] is a dividend paid to Alaska residents that have lived within the state for a full calendar year (January 1 – December 31), and intend to remain an Alaska resident indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfd.alaska.gov/Eligibility/EligibilityRequirements|title=Eligibility Requirements|website=pfd.alaska.gov|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means if residency is taken on January 2, the "calendar year" wouldn't start until next January 1.

However, an individual is not eligible for a PFD for a dividend year when:
:(1) during the qualifying year, the individual was [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] as a result of [[conviction]] in this state of a [[felony]];
:(2) during all or part of the qualifying year, the individual was [[Incarceration|incarcerated]] as a result of the conviction in this state of a
::(A) felony; or
::(B) [[misdemeanor]] if the individual has been convicted of
:::(i) a prior felony as defined in AS 11.81.900 ; or
:::(ii) two or more prior misdemeanors as defined in AS 11.81.900

The amount of each payment is based upon a five-year average of the Permanent Fund's performance and varies widely depending on the stock market and many other factors.  The PFD is calculated by the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the PFD amount is calculated|url=http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/dividend/dividend.cfm|publisher=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|accessdate=September 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117184423/http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/dividend/dividend.cfm|archive-date=January 17, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Add Fund Statutory Net Income from the current plus the previous four fiscal years.
# Multiply by 21%
# Divide by 2
# Subtract prior year obligations, expenses and PFD program operations
# Divide by the number of eligible applicants

The lowest individual dividend payout was $331.29 in 1984 and the highest was $2,072 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$2,072: 2015 Alaska Permanent Fund dividend amount announced|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150921/2072-2015-alaska-pfd-amount-announced|publisher=Alaska Dispatch News|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2008 Governor [[Sarah Palin]] signed Senate Bill 4002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Bill No. 4002|url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill_text.asp?hsid=SB4002A&amp;session=25|publisher=State of Alaska|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that used revenues generated from the state's natural resources and provided a one-time special payment of $1,200 to every Alaskan eligible for the PFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palin signs energy relief package|url=http://www.juneaublogger.com/ccwupdates/?p=62|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128114218/http://www.juneaublogger.com/ccwupdates/?p=62|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=Capital Weekly|date=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the principal or corpus of the Fund is constitutionally protected, income earned by the Fund, like nearly all State income, is constitutionally defined as general fund money.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first dividend plan would have paid Alaskans $50 for each year of residency up to 20 years, but the U.S. Supreme Court in {{ussc|name=Zobel v. Williams|457|55|1982}} disapproved the $50 per year formula as an invidious distinction burdening interstate travel.  As a result, each qualified resident now receives the same annual amount, regardless of age or years of residency.

Payments from the fund are subject to federal income tax. Alaska has no state income tax, but part-year residents who leave the state may be taxed on them by their new state of residence.

== Constitutional Budget Reserve (CBR) ==

The '''Constitutional Budget Reserve''' is a companion fund to the Permanent Fund which was established in 1991 to ease problems from the variability of oil revenue, which vary depending upon the price of oil in the market.  Deposits into the CBR consist of settlements of back taxes and other revenues owed to the state.  Draws from the CBR into the general fund require a 3/4 vote of each house of the legislature and must be repaid.  To date, the general fund has amassed a debt of approximately $4 billion to the CBR to maintain a stable level of public spending.

=== Issues with the Constitutional Budget Reserve ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The size of the debt owed to the CBR has raised doubts{{who|date=August 2018}} over repayment.  The CBR is based on the assumption that the general fund deficit will remain constant over time (allowing paybacks to balance draws).  Believing this to be mistaken, critics{{who|date=August 2018}} allege the state uses resources from the CBR to avoid reducing the budget, acknowledging debt, or increasing taxes.  According to them, falling oil revenues and growing spending requirements will leave paybacks consistently lower than draws, causing the CBR to fail.

Former state senator [[Dave Donley]] (R-Anchorage) recognized that the high vote requirement to spend CBR money (¾ of each house) had a perverse and [[unintended consequence]].  The high vote requirement was meant to ensure that draws from the CBR would be rare, but in fact such draws are common.  Donley explained that the high vote requirement really empowers the minority party (in the 2000–07 era, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]), who can then get what they want in a [[Christmas tree bill]] (presents for everyone, both majority and minority) in exchange for their votes (which minority votes would not be needed with the usual 51% voting rule).  Donley thus explains why both parties can and do use the higher voting rule requirement to more frequently spend from the CBR.

== Issues with the Permanent Fund ==

===Dividends and spending===

While the Permanent Fund generally generated large surpluses even after payment of the Dividend [PFD], the state general fund operated at a substantial deficit.  However, the consolidated account of both General and Permanent Funds usually shows a surplus.  The Funds' ultimate uses were never clearly spelled out at its inception, leaving no current consensus over what role Fund earning should play in the current and expected state budget shortfalls.  However, some people argue that the original intent was to fund state government after the temporary oil riches ceased, while others note that the Fund's intent changed from its 1976 origin when in 1982 the Dividend program began.  Public opinion strongly favors the Dividend program.  Indeed, in 1999, with oil prices going as low as $9 per barrel and Alaska's oil consultant Daniel Yergin forecasting low prices "for the foreseeable future", the State put an advisory vote before Alaskans, asking if government could spend "some" part of Permanent Fund earning for government purposes.  Gov. Knowles, Lt. Gov. Ulmer, and many other elected officials urged a "yes" vote.  Campaign spending greatly favored the "yes" side.  The public voted "no" by nearly 84%. (Oil prices rose dramatically, starting about two weeks after Yergin's prediction, to above $60 per barrel, though the quantity produced continues to fall.) Perceived support of the dividend program is so universally strong that it ensures the dividend's continuity and the protection of the Fund's principal, since any measure characterized as negatively impacting dividend payouts represents a loss to the entire populace.  That is, legislators willing to appropriate the Fund's annual earnings are constrained by the politically suicidal nature of any decrease in the public's dividend.

===Percent of Market Value (POMV) Proposal===

In 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apfc.org/_amiResolutions/Res00-13MA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the APFC Board of Trustees proposed changing the Permanent Fund's management system to a [[Percent of Market Value]] (PoMV) approach which would require an amendment to the state constitution.  The PoMV proposal would limit withdrawals to five percent of the fund's value each year, to be spent at the discretion of the Legislature.  Currently the Legislature has authority to appropriate all of the fund's realized earnings.  Tentative, unapproved proposals indicate that half of this five percent withdrawal would go to the dividend and half to government spending—but POMV died in the Legislature because most there saw POMV as unambiguously tied to such politically unpopular spending proposals.  Most Alaskans (84% in 1999) disapprove of allowing the [[government]] to tamper with the fund, especially if that means government might spend Fund income.

Again in 2015–2017, a POMV approach was considered. The market price for North Slope oil fell from an average $107.57 per barrel in FY2014 to $50.05 per barrel in FY2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/oil/prevailing/ans.aspx|title=Alaska Department of Revenue - Tax Division|first=Alaska Department of|last=Revenue|website=www.tax.alaska.gov|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This price shift caused an 80 percent decline in state revenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/sourcebook/index.aspx|title=Alaska Department of Revenue - Tax Division|first=Alaska Department of|last=Revenue|website=www.tax.alaska.gov|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a multibillion-dollar budget gap.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.omb.alaska.gov//ombfiles/18_budget/PDFs/10-Year_Plan_1-9-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both bodies of the legislature have passed a bill that provides for an annual draw of 5.25% of the average balance of the Permanent Fund (average of the first 5 of the last six years).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/30?Root=sb26#tab1_4&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the formula is based on an average, rather than a single year, the effective draw is only about 4.2%—enough to preserve the real value of the fund considering that the fund has returned close to 9% annually.  The legislature carefully vetted this percentage over the course of two sessions and has come to a consensus. This draw is projected to produce $2.7 billion in FY2019 and grow with the balance of the Permanent Fund.  The major point of disagreement, however, is the size of the dividend: The House of Representatives version of the bill uses 5.25% draw for government (33% of for Dividends and 67% for government services) and an additional 0.25% draw for Permanent Fund inflation proofing.  This produces $2.7 billion ($1.8 billion for government use, net of a $900.9 million dividend—about $1,250.00 per Alaskan—growing with the value of the fund).  The Senate version of the bill uses the same 5.25% draw as the House, but directs only 25% of the draw to dividends.  This produces the same $2.7 billion but government services receive $2.0 billion while the dividend receives just under $700 million—about $1,000.00 per person—growing with the value of the fund.

Oil revenues are forecast (by the state Department of Revenue) to remain stagnant through FY2027,&lt;ref&gt;http://tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1387r&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional budget reserves may be empty by FY2019&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akleg.gov/basis/get_documents.asp?session=30&amp;docid=17405&lt;/ref&gt; but with a Permanent Fund value in excess of $60.0 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apfc.org/|title=Home - Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the budget gap can be reduced significantly.  Since this POMV proposal does not close the gap entirely, members of the legislature are  considering a tax bill as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/30?Root=hb115&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
A 2018 paper found that the Alaska Permanent Fund "dividend had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent)... our results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Damon|last2=Marinescu|first2=Ioana|date=February 2018|title=The Labor Market Impacts of Universal and Permanent Cash Transfers: Evidence from the Alaska Permanent Fund |work=NBER Working Paper No. 24312 |doi=10.3386/w24312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleta Baun''' is an award-winning [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]]n environmental activist. She has been described as the Indonesian Avatar.&lt;ref name="IndoAvatar"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Unfinished Story of ‘Indonesian Avatar’ Aleta Baun |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/the-unfinished-story-of-indonesian-avatar-aleta-baun/ |publisher=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She won the 2013 [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] for organizing hundreds of local villagers to peacefully occupy [[marble]] [[mining]] sites in “[[weaving]] [[protests]],” to stop destruction of sacred [[forest]] land on Mutis Mountain on the island of [[Timor]].&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prize Recipient Aleta Baun|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/aleta-baun|publisher=Goldman_Environmental_Prize |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aletaspeaks"&gt;{{cite AV media | date=April 15, 2013 | title=Aleta Baun: 2013 Goldman Environmental Prize Winner, Indonesia | medium=video | location=Timor, Indonesia |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IcanKHMuKo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leader of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Mollo culture|Mollo]] people, she was born to a family of farmers. Having lost her mother at a young age, she was raised by other women and elders in the village who taught her to respect the environment as a source of their spiritual identity and livelihood. As a community leader sharing [[traditional knowledge]], she eventually became known as “Mama Aleta.” &lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;

Mama Aleta’s work made her a target for the mining interests and [[local authorities]], who put a price on her head. After surviving an [[assassination]] attempt, Mama Aleta went into hiding in the forest with her baby.&lt;ref name=IndoAvatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;&lt;ref name=aletaspeaks/&gt;

Despite intimidation, Mama Aleta grew the movement to include hundreds of villagers. It culminated in a weaving [[occupy movement|occupation]] where 150 women spent a year sitting on the marble rocks at the mining site, quietly weaving their traditional cloth in protest. Because women were traditionally responsible for getting food, dye and [[traditional medicine|medicine]] from the mountains, mining in these mountains would have directly impacted their livelihoods. While the women protested at the mine, the men provided domestic support at home, cooking, cleaning and caring for the children.&lt;ref name=IndoAvatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;

In the face of the villagers’ peaceful and sustained presence, marble mining became an increasingly untenable endeavor for the companies involved. Public awareness of the weaving occupation was growing, and [[Indonesian government]] officials took notice. By 2010, the mining companies, reacting to the pressure, halted mining at all four sites within the [[Mollo culture|Mollo]] [[ancestral domain|territories]] and abandoned their operations.&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;

Mama Aleta now helps communities across [[West Timor]] [[Counter-mapping|to map their traditional forests]].&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt; She works in [[water security]] and [[indigenous peoples]] [[natural resource management]] and [[land rights]]. She said to the Jakarta Post:
“We especially want to conserve the upstream region of our territory because it is a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] for the entire island. We are considering a joint [[land title|title]] for our three communities and placing the land under [[collective ownership]] of the communities”.&lt;ref name="aletaquote"&gt;{{cite news | date=April 18, 2013 | title=Aleta Baun: Aleta Baun: Environmental heroine from Molo | publisher=Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/18/aleta-baun-environmental-heroine-molo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help with this, she obtained a law degree in 2011 from Universitas Tritunggal Surabaya.&lt;ref&gt;http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=lom_aquinascoll&amp;id=GALE|A352615266&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=AONE&amp;asid=610aca3f&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6376">The '''Arbel''' (also called '''Loubières''', '''Loubière''', '''Symétric''', '''Symétric-Paris''', or '''Arbel-Symétric''') was a fiber-glass bodied [[Petrol-electric hybrid vehicles|hybrid petrol-electric vehicle]] produced by the Compagnie Normande d'Etudes pour l'Application de Procédés Mécaniques made as individual models from 1951 to 1953 and again 1957 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machine-history.com/node/1051 |title=The Symetric |work=machine-history.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325153610/http://www.machine-history.com/node/1051 |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a limited number were made throughout the period, mainly for experimentation or prototyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Georgano|1982|pp=70, 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Version - 1951 to 1953==
The first Arbel was designed and made by Casimir (Casi) André Loubière, then a 43-year-old car salesman, and financed by his brother Maurice, the owner of an air-transport business, [[COSARA]] (Société Transatlantique Aérienne en Extrême Orient), in Indo-China. They initially traded as ''Les Freres Loubière''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/27005644 Symetric is car with a difference], The Mercury (Hobart, Tasmania, 7 March 1951, Page 2, retrieved 10 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
 

The car was described as an eight seater powered by a [[Simca]] four cylinder 1100cc {{convert|45|hp|abbr=on}} petrol engine that powered four electric motors fitted to the inside of the wheel hubs.  It was built of glass and light alloy, weighed 1,870lb, and had windows that were curved and slid into the roof. The brothers stated that they intended the car to be mass-produced and sell for ₤295. It was first shown as the ''Symétrie'' at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in 1951, but created little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Glass car in Paris, Barrier Miner, Broken Hill, NSW, 8 March 1951, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was redesigned as a roadster with a plastic body and re-shown during the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Grand Palais 40th Salon d'Automobile and Cycle Show]] on 22 October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, October 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://lautomobileancienne.com/arbel-symetric/ retrieved 22 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was stated as being of interest to the French War Department.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Flanner, Letter from Paris, The New Yorker, October 24, 1953, p 73&lt;/ref&gt; Light, cheap, fast electric car; The Central Queensland Herald; Rockhampton, Queensland; 24 December 1953; p 25&lt;/ref&gt; It had one pedal, a handbrake for emergencies, and no gears. The body was fibreglass. Normal braking was automatic when the accelerator was not pressed. The Loubière's drove the car in Paris, where it reached 60&amp;nbsp;mph. It was said to be able to attain a top speed of 95&amp;nbsp;mph and petrol consumption was 32 mpg under normal driving. The stopping distance at 60&amp;nbsp;mph was said to be less than 40 yards, compared with the 60 to 80 yards for cars of the period. With a proposed annual production of 1,000 cars, the ''Symetric'' was estimated to cost £435.&lt;ref&gt;One car but five motors, The Mail, Adelaide, SA, 7 November 1953, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Version - 1957 to 1958==
The second version was designed between 1957 and 1958. It was displayed at the March 1958 Geneva Motor Show.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automobile quarterly Volume 31 Issue 1, Princeton Institute for Historic Research, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Called the Arbel-Symétric, alternative power plants were considered, the first was a static gas generator fueled by diesel oil and the second in 1958, possibly taking the idea from the [[Ford Nucleon]], was to be powered by a "genestatom", a 40-KW [[nuclear battery|nuclear thermal generator]] using radioactive cartridges made of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=And48&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|2005|p=48}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vfZceT8LpYoC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popular Mechanics|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breed|first=Lee|title=SYMETRIC-PARIS:  50 ans d'avance?|url=http://www.vea.qc.ca/vea/articles/symetric.htm|accessdate=22 April 2012|language=French|archiveurl=http://www.vea.qc.ca/vea/articles/symetric.htm|archivedate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French government did not approve the use of nuclear fuel and no development took place.

The 1958 Geneva show also had the [[Packard#Astral|Studebaker-Packard Astral]], another concept car with the idea of nuclear propulsion, on display.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The company went into debt and never recovered.&lt;ref name=And48/&gt; In 1963 the Loubières patented a rotary engine, although this may have related to their engine patented on 13 June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;GB Patent 1036342 and {{US patent|2511441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Compressed hydrogen tube trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Compressed hydrogen]] tube trailer]]
Hydrogen '''tube trailers''' are [[semi-trailer]]s that consist of 10 to 36 cluster high-pressure [[hydrogen tank]]s varying in length from {{convert|20|ft|m|2}} for small tubes to {{convert|38|ft|m|2}} on jumbo tube trailers. They are part of the [[hydrogen highway]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogenhighway.ca/code/navigate.asp?Id=226 BC tube trailers ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234011/http://www.hydrogenhighway.ca/code/navigate.asp?Id=226 |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually precede a local [[hydrogen station]].

==Types==

===Modular tube trailer===
Modular tube trailer range from 8 to 54 tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gas-plants.com/tube-trailer.html Modular tube trailer ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106194139/http://www.gas-plants.com/tube-trailer.html |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermediate trailer===

'''Cotton production in Pakistan''' is integral to the economic development of the country. The nation is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and the crop has been given a principal status in the country. [[Cotton]] is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land during the [[monsoon]] months of May to August, known as the [[Kharif crop|kharif]] period, and is grown at a smaller scale between February and April. Record production of cotton was reported at 15 million bales of {{Convert|470|lbs}} each in the form of ''phutti'' (seed cotton) during 2014–15, which was an 11% rise compared to the previous season (2013–14).&lt;ref name=Bales/&gt; Production-wise, as of 2012–13, Pakistan occupied the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world, the first three being China, India and the United States, in that order.&lt;ref name=Osakwe/&gt; In respect of exports of raw cotton, Pakistan holds third position, and is the fourth in consumption (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn.&lt;ref name= Banuri/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Coolies at the Cotton Market in Bombay 1863 (14781351314).jpg|right|thumb|Earliest period of Cotton production]]
The earliest known historical traces of cotton were found at [[Mehrgarh]] near the city of [[Quetta]], making Pakistan one of the first regions of cotton cultivation.&lt;ref name=Oil/&gt; Cotton was discovered in threads on a copper bead at a burial site dated to the [[Neolithic]] period (6000 BC).&lt;ref name=Oil/&gt; The mineralised threads were subject to metallurgical analysis with a combination of a reflected-light microscope and a scanning electron microscope, revealing that they were of cotton (genus ''[[Gossypium]]'').&lt;ref name=Oil&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icac.org/getattachment/mtgs/Plenary/72nd-Plenary/Documents/Country-Statements/Pakistan.pdf|format=pdf|title=Country Report for Pakistan at the 72nd Plenary Meeting of International Cotton Advisory Committee to be held from 28th September to 5th October, 2013 at Cartagena (Colombia)|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2015|publisher= International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mehrgarh&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Moulherata |first1= Christophe|last2=Tengbergb|first2= Margareta |last3= Haquetc|first3= Jérôme-F. |last4= Mille |first4= Benoı̂t |title=First Evidence of Cotton at Neolithic Mehrgarh, Pakistan: Analysis of Mineralized Fibres from a Copper Bead|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science|volume= 29|issue= 12|date=12 December 2012|pages=1393–1401|doi= 10.1006/jasc.2001.0779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton cultivation became more widespread during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which covered parts of present day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Burton (1998).

Use of cotton cloth in the Indus Valley cities of [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] dates to 2,500 BC. Cotton pollen has been  recorded at [[Balakot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Pakistan - an Archaeological History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qvVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA245|year=2014|publisher=Amazon|isbn=978-1-4959-6643-9|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Harappa (Mature Harappan period 2500-2000 BC), evidence of cotton threads has been found tied to the handle of a mirror, an antiquity from a female burial site, and around a copper razor.&lt;ref name="Singh2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/fuller/usercontent_profile/TextilesbeyondIndus.pdf|format=pdf|title=Linguistics, Archaeology and the Human Past|year=2008|publisher=Indus Project Research Institute for Humanity and Nature Kyoto, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much other evidence of cotton in some form, such as [[Malvaceae|Malavaceae]] (flowering plant) pollen type, similar to ''Gossypium'' in [[Balakot]]  (Mature Harappan period, 2500-2000 BC); as seeds at [[Banawali]] (Mature Harappan, 2200-1900 BC), [[Sanghol]] (Late Harappan, 1900-1400 BC), Kanmer, Kacchh (Late Harappan, 2,000-1,700 BC), Imlidhi Khurd and [[Gorakhpur]] (1300-800 BC); as fibres in [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture|Late Ochre-Coloured Pottery]] at Sringaverapura (1200-700 BC); and in [[Hallur]] as seeds and fragments of the Early Iron Age (950-900 BC).&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

==Growing regions ==
Cotton is purely a cellulose fibre crop, one of the four major crops in the country, and is known by popular epithets as "King cotton" and "white gold". It forms the primary input for the textile industry of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sedf.gos.pk/pdf/sectors/cotton.pdf|format=pdf|title=Cotton|accessdate=14 November 2015|publisher= Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, Government Of Sindh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cotton is integral to [[Pakistan]]'s economy. According to an analysis in the [[USDA]] Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land. It is grown during the [[monsoon]] months of May to August, known as the [[Kharif crop|kharif]] period. It is also grown on a smaller scale between February and April.&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Cotton%20and%20Products%20Annual_Islamabad_Pakistan_4-1-2015.pdf|title= Pakistan:Cotton and Products Annual|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher= Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton is grown mostly in the two provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh province|Sindh]], with the former accounting for 79% and the latter for 20% of the nation's cotton growing land. It is also grown in [[Khyber Pakhtoon Khawah]] (KPK) and [[Balochistan]] provinces. The total land area of cotton cultivation was reported as {{Convert|2950000|ha}} during the 2014–15 growing season. Generally, small farmers with land holdings less than {{Convert|5 |ha}} in size form the largest group of growers;&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt; farmers holding less than {{Convert|2|ha}} account for 50% of the farms. Land holdings with {{Convert|25|ha}} under cotton cultivation form less than 2% of farms.&lt;ref name= Banuri/&gt; According to a 2013 estimate, there were 1.6 million farmers (out of a total of 5 million in all sectors) engaged in cotton farming, growing more than 3 million hectares.&lt;ref name="Annual" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Banuri/&gt;

==Varieties==
Farmers have widely adopted ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) cotton since its first trial in Sindh province in 2002. It is now used in 95% of the area.&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt; The Punjab Seed Council has approved the use of 18 Bt cotton and non-Bt varieties for cultivation. These are: 12 BT varieties FH-114, CIM-598, SITARA-009, A-one, BH-167, MIAD-852, CIM-573, SLH-317, TARZAN-1, NS-141, IR-NIBGE-3, MNH-886, and six non-BT varieties NIBGE −115, FH-941, FH-942, IR-1524, Ali Akbar-802 and NEELAM-121.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/02/16/business/punjab-seed-council-approves-cotton-varieties/|title= Punjab Seed Council approves cotton varieties|date= 16 February 2012|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=Pakistan Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sindh province, local Sindh varieties of cotton are also grown in about 40% of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/768560/sindh-cotton-crop-estimates|title=Sindh cotton crop estimates|date=3 December 2012|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=The Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally planted from April to July, and harvested during August–December.&lt;ref name=Oil/&gt;

==Production==
Cotton serves as the base for the nation's industrial sector.&lt;ref name= Banuri/&gt; Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each in the form of ''phutti'' (seed cotton) during 2014–15; this  was an 11% increase compared to the previous season (2013–14). Its phenomenal growth was from 1.38 million bales in 1961 to 11.138 million bales in 2014, with the estimated 2014–15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales.&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1173796|title=Cotton production reaches 14.838 million bales|accessdate=13 November 2015|date= 4 April 2015|publisher=The Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980–81 and 1990–91, the growth in production was rapid, with production rising from 0.70 million to 2.2 million tonnes, which was called the "magic year" of Pakistan's cotton industry. This was attributed to better pest control measures, use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Textile Industry of India and Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhjhzctZ7r8C&amp;pg=PA44|year=2006|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-958-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1,000 ginneries, 425 textile mills, and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners. Cotton hybrids, created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties, have been developed by local firms dealing with seeds.&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt; In Sindh province cotton is grown in more than one million acres in the districts of Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Mirpur Khas, Naushero Feroz, Sanghar, Badin, Sukkar, Ghotki, Tharparkar, Thatta and Umar Kot.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

In terms of production, Pakistan is at the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world; the first three are China, India and the United States, in that order&lt;ref name=Osakwe&gt;{{Cite web|last=Osakwe|first=Emeka|url=https://www.icac.org/econ_stats/country_facts/e_pakistan.pdf|title=Cotton Fact Sheet Pakistan|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=13 November 2013|publisher=International Cotton Advisory Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw cotton exported from Pakistan holds third position in the world as per records of 2012-13.&lt;ref name=Oil/&gt; Consumption-wise it holds the fourth position (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn.&lt;ref name= Banuri&gt;{{Cite web|last= Banuri| first= Tariq |url=http://www.iisd.org/tkn/pdf/pk_Banuri.pdf|format=pdf|title=Pakistan: Environmental Impact of Cotton Production and Trade|year=1998 |accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher= International Institute for Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton produced within the country is of medium staple. Hence long staple cotton is imported to produce quality fabrics for export.&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt; Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about {{Convert|1.3|-|3.3| cm}}. Long-staple cottons have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and hosiery.&lt;ref name=Weigmann&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weigmann|first= Hans-Dietrich H. |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/cotton-fibre-and-plant|title=Cotton|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country.&lt;ref name=Osakwe/&gt; Apart from use in textiles in the form of cotton lint, yarn, thread, cloth, and garments, its seeds are used for oil extraction.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

==Diseases==
Viruses and pests affect yield of Bt cotton varieties. [[Cotton leaf curl virus]], which is a plant pathogenic virus of the family [[Geminiviridae]], stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield. Pests like White Fly, Mealy Bugs, Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect the plants reducing yield.&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt;

==Exports==
474,091 bales of 470 lbs each were exported during the 2014–15 season, an increase from 382,006 bales in 2014–15.&lt;ref name=Bales/&gt; The cotton and textile industries play a dominant role in exports;&lt;ref name=Osakwe/&gt; cotton accounts for 55 percent of country's export earnings, and Pakistan has a 14% share of the world's cloth exports.&lt;ref name=Oil/&gt; The [[European Union]] (EU) granted Generalized System of Preferences "Plus" status to Pakistan in 2013, which has promoted textile exports to the EU.&lt;ref name="Annual" /&gt;

==Legal framework==
Though a bio-safety regulatory system was part of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that "devolved" several functions to the provinces, the system is still unclear with regard to regulators who can oversee the approval of new seed technologies. In this context the three regulatory acts which are under approval stage are the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, Amendments to the 1976 Seed Act, and the Biosafety Law. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, passage of these laws is crucial to the introduction of new biotech events.&lt;ref name=Annual/&gt;

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''critical Mach number (Mcr or M* )''' of an [[aircraft]] is the lowest [[Mach number]] at which the airflow over some point of the aircraft reaches the [[speed of sound]], but does not exceed it.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', Section 11.6&lt;/ref&gt; At the '''lower critical Mach number''', airflow around the entire aircraft is subsonic.  At the '''upper critical Mach number''', airflow around the entire aircraft is supersonic.&lt;ref name="RATHAKRISHNAN2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Rathakrishnan|title=Gas Dynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY31AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278|date=3 September 2013|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-4839-4|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft flight==
For an aircraft in flight, the speed of the airflow around the aircraft differs considerably in places from the airspeed of the aircraft; this is due to the airflow having to speed up and slow down as it travels around the aircraft's structure.  When the aircraft's airspeed reaches the critical Mach number, the speed of the airflow in some areas near the airframe reaches the speed of sound, even though the aircraft itself has an airspeed lower than Mach 1.0.  This creates a weak [[shock wave]].  As the aircraft exceeds the critical Mach number, its [[drag coefficient]] increases suddenly, causing [[drag divergence Mach number|dramatically increased drag]],&lt;ref name="Clancy Ch11"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; and, in an aircraft not designed for [[transonic]] or [[supersonic]] speeds, changes to the airflow over the [[flight control surfaces]] lead to deterioration in control of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Clancy Ch11"/&gt;

In aircraft not designed to fly at or above the critical Mach number, the shock waves that form in the airflow over the wing and tailplane are sufficient to [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] the wing, render the control surfaces ineffective, or lead to loss of control of the aircraft (such as [[Mach tuck]], when shock waves in the airflow over the elevator send the aircraft into an uncontrollable dive).  These problematic phenomena appearing at or above the critical Mach number became known as [[compressibility]].  Compressibility led to a number of accidents involving high-speed military and experimental aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s.

Although unknown at the time, compressibility was the cause of the phenomenon known as the [[sound barrier]].  1940s-era military [[subsonic aircraft]], such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[Bf 109]], [[P-51 Mustang]], [[Gloster Meteor]], [[He 162]], and [[P-80]], have relatively thick, unswept wings, and are incapable of reaching Mach 1.0 in controlled flight.  In 1947, [[Chuck Yeager]] flew the [[Bell X-1]] (also with an unswept wing, but a much thinner one), reaching Mach 1.06 and beyond, and the sound barrier was finally broken.

Early [[transonic]] military aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[F-86 Sabre]], were designed to fly satisfactorily even at speeds greater than their critical Mach number.  They did not possess sufficient engine thrust to break the sound barrier in level flight, but could exceed Mach 1.0 in a dive while remaining controllable.  Modern [[jet airliner]]s, such as [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] aircraft, have maximum operating Mach numbers slower than Mach 1.0.

[[Supersonic]] aircraft, such as [[Concorde]], [[Tupolev Tu-144|Tu-144]], the [[English Electric Lightning]], [[Lockheed F-104]], [[Dassault Mirage III]], and [[MiG 21]], are designed to exceed Mach 1.0 in level flight, and, therefore, are designed with very thin wings.  Their critical Mach numbers are higher than those of subsonic and transonic aircraft, but are still less than Mach 1.0.

The actual critical Mach number varies from wing to wing.  In general, a thicker wing will have a lower critical Mach number, because a thicker wing deflects the airflow passing around it more than a thinner wing does, and thus accelerates the airflow to a faster speed.  For instance, the fairly-thick wing on the [[P-38 Lightning]] has a critical Mach number of about .69.  The aircraft could occasionally reach this speed in dives, leading to a number of crashes.  The [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s much thinner wing gave it a considerably higher critical Mach number (about 0.89).

{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Models}}
In [[thermodynamics]] and [[solid state physics]], the '''Debye model''' is a method developed by [[Peter Debye]] in 1912 for estimating the [[phonon]] contribution to the [[specific heat]] (heat capacity) in a [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Debye |title=Zur Theorie der spezifischen Waerme  |language=de|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=789–839 |year=1912 |doi= 10.1002/andp.19123441404 |bibcode = 1912AnP...344..789D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It treats the [[oscillation|vibration]]s of the [[Crystal structure#Classification|atomic lattice]] (heat) as [[phonon]]s in a box, in contrast to the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], which treats the solid as many individual, non-interacting [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s. The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity, which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt; – the '''Debye T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; law'''. Just like the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], it also recovers the [[Dulong–Petit law]] at high temperatures. But due to simplifying assumptions, its accuracy suffers at intermediate temperatures.

See M. Shubin and T. Sunada &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mikhail |last1=Shubin |first2=Toshikazu |last2=Sunada |title=Mathematical theory of lattice vibrations |journal=Pure and Appl. Math. Quarterly |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=745–777 |year=2006 |doi=10.4310/pamq.2006.v2.n3.a7|arxiv=math-ph/0512088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a rigorous treatment of the Debye model.

== Derivation ==
The Debye model is a solid-state equivalent of [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], where one treats [[electromagnetic radiation]] as a [[photon gas]]. The Debye model treats atomic vibrations as [[phonon]]s in a box (the box being the solid). Most of the calculation steps are identical as both are examples of a massless [[Bose gas]] with linear dispersion relation.

Consider a cube of side &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. From the [[particle in a box]] article, the resonating modes of the sonic disturbances inside the box (considering for now only those aligned with one axis) have wavelengths given by

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n = {2L\over n}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. The energy of a phonon is

:&lt;math&gt;E_n\ =h\nu_n\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the phonon. Making the approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;E_n=h\nu_n={hc_s\over\lambda_n}={hc_sn\over 2L}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound inside the solid.
In three dimensions we will use:

:&lt;math&gt;E_n^2={p_n^2 c_s^2}=\left({hc_s\over2L}\right)^2\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the three-dimensional momentum of the phonon.

The approximation that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength (giving a constant speed of sound) is good for low-energy phonons but not for high-energy phonons (see the article on [[phonon]]s.) This disagreement is one of the limitations of the Debye model, and corresponds to incorrectness of the results at intermediate temperatures, whereas both at low temperatures and also at high temperatures they are exact.

Let's now compute the total energy in the box,

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_n E_n\,\bar{N}(E_n)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{N}(E_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of phonons in the box with energy &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the total energy is equal to the sum of energy multiplied by the number of phonons with that energy (in one dimension). In 3 dimensions we have:

:&lt;math&gt;U = \sum_{n_x}\sum_{n_y}\sum_{n_z}E_n\,\bar{N}(E_n)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the '''Debye model''' and [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] differ. Unlike electromagnetic radiation in a box, there is a finite number of [[phonon]] energy states because a [[phonon]] cannot have arbitrarily high frequencies. Its frequency is bounded by the medium of its propagation—the atomic lattice of the solid. Consider an illustration of a transverse phonon below.

:::::[[Image:Debye limit.svg|400px]]

It is reasonable to assume that the minimum wavelength of a [[phonon]] is twice the atom separation, as shown in the lower figure. There are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; atoms in a solid.  Our solid is a cube, which means there are  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{N}&lt;/math&gt; atoms per edge. Atom separation is then given by &lt;math&gt;L/\sqrt[3]{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and the minimum wavelength is

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\rm min} = {2L \over \sqrt[3]{N}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

making the maximum mode number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (infinite for [[photon]]s)

:&lt;math&gt;n_{\rm max} = \sqrt[3]{N}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This number bounds the upper limit of the triple energy sum

:&lt;math&gt;U = \sum_{n_x}^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\sum_{n_y}^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\sum_{n_z}^{\sqrt[3]{N}}E_n\,\bar{N}(E_n)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For slowly varying, well-behaved functions, a sum can be replaced with an integral (also known as [[Thomas-Fermi approximation]])

:&lt;math&gt;U \approx\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}} E(n)\,\bar{N}\left(E(n)\right)\,dn_x\, dn_y\, dn_z\,.&lt;/math&gt;

So far, there has been no mention of &lt;math&gt;\bar{N}(E)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of phonons with energy &lt;math&gt;E\,.&lt;/math&gt; Phonons obey [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. Their distribution is given by the famous Bose–Einstein formula

:&lt;math&gt;\langle N\rangle_{BE} = {1\over e^{E/kT}-1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Because a phonon has three possible polarization states (one [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]], and two [[transverse wave|transverse]] which approximately do not affect its
energy) the formula above must be multiplied by 3,

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{N}(E) = {3\over e^{E/kT}-1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(Actually one uses an ''effective sonic velocity'' &lt;math&gt;c_s:=c_{{\rm eff}}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the Debye temperature &lt;math&gt;T_D&lt;/math&gt; (see below) is proportional to &lt;math&gt;c_{{\rm eff}}&lt;/math&gt;, more precisely &lt;math&gt;T_D^{-3}\propto c_{{\rm eff}}^{-3}:=(1/3)c_{{\rm long}}^{-3}+(2/3)c_{{\rm trans}}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, where one distinguishes longitudinal and transversal sound-wave velocities (contributions 1/3 and 2/3, respectively). The Debye temperature or the effective sonic velocity is a measure of the hardness of the crystal.)

Substituting into the energy integral yields

:&lt;math&gt;U  = \int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}}\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{N}} E(n)\,{3\over e^{E(n)/kT}-1}\,dn_x\, dn_y\, dn_z\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The ease with which these integrals are evaluated for [[photon]]s is due to the fact that light's frequency, at least semi-classically, is unbound. As the figure above illustrates, which is not true for [[phonon]]s. In order to approximate this triple integral, [[Peter Debye|Debye]] used spherical coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\ (n_x,n_y,n_z)=(n\sin \theta \cos \phi,n\sin \theta \sin \phi,n\cos \theta )&lt;/math&gt;
and approximated the cube by an eighth of a sphere
:&lt;math&gt;U \approx\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^R E(n)\,{3\over e^{E(n)/kT}-1}n^2 \sin\theta\, dn\, d\theta\, d\phi\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of this sphere, which is found by conserving the number of particles in the cube and in the eighth of a sphere. The volume of the cube is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; unit-cell volumes,

:&lt;math&gt;N = {1\over8}{4\over3}\pi R^3\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so we get:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt[3]{6N\over\pi}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The substitution of integration over a sphere for the correct integral introduces another source of inaccuracy into the model.

The energy integral becomes

:&lt;math&gt;U = {3\pi\over2}\int_0^R \,{hc_sn\over 2L}{n^2\over e^{hc_sn/2LkT}-1} \,dn&lt;/math&gt;

Changing the integration variable to &lt;math&gt;x = {hc_sn\over 2LkT}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;U = {3\pi\over2} kT \left({2LkT\over hc_s}\right)^3\int_0^{hc_sR/2LkT} {x^3\over e^x-1}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To simplify the appearance
of this expression, define the '''Debye temperature''' &lt;math&gt;T_D&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_D\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {hc_sR\over2Lk} = {hc_s\over2Lk}\sqrt[3]{6N\over\pi} = {hc_s\over2k}\sqrt[3]{{6\over\pi}{N\over V}}&lt;/math&gt;

Many references&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittel |first=Charles |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |edition=8 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2004 |isbn=978-0471415268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Daniel V. "An Introduction to Thermal Physics" Addison-Wesley, San Francisco (2000). Section 7.5&lt;/ref&gt; describe the Debye temperature as merely  shorthand for some constants and material-dependent variables. However, as shown below,  &lt;math&gt; kT_D&lt;/math&gt;  is roughly equal to the phonon energy of  the minimum wavelength mode, and so we can interpret the Debye temperature as the temperature at which the highest-frequency mode (and hence every mode) is excited.

Continuing, we then have the specific internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{Nk} = 9T \left({T\over T_D}\right)^3\int_0^{T_D/T} {x^3\over e^x-1}\, dx = 3T D_3 \left({T_D\over T}\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_3(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the (third) [[Debye function]].

Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; we get the dimensionless heat capacity:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{C_V}{Nk} = 9 \left({T\over T_D}\right)^3\int_0^{T_D/T} {x^4 e^x\over\left(e^x-1\right)^2}\, dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These formulae treat the Debye model at all temperatures. The more elementary formulae given further down give the asymptotic behavior in the limit of low and high temperatures. As already mentioned, this behaviour is exact, in contrast to the intermediate behaviour. The essential reason for the exactness at low and high energies, respectively, is that the Debye model gives (i) the exact ''[[dispersion relation]]'' &lt;math&gt;E(\nu )&lt;/math&gt; at low frequencies, and (ii) corresponds to the exact ''[[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]]'' &lt;math&gt;(\int g(\nu ) \, {\rm d\nu}\equiv 3N)\,,&lt;/math&gt;concerning the number of vibrations per frequency interval.

== Debye's derivation ==

Actually, Debye derived his equation somewhat differently and more simply. Using [[continuum mechanics]], he found that the number of vibrational states with a frequency less than a particular value was asymptotic to

:&lt;math&gt; n \sim {1 \over 3} \nu^3 V F\,, &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is the volume and &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; is a factor which he calculated from [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity coefficient]]s and density. Combining this formula with the expected energy of a harmonic oscillator at temperature T (already used by [[Einstein solid|Einstein]] in his model) would give an energy of

:&lt;math&gt;U = \int_0^\infty \,{h\nu^3 V F\over e^{h\nu/kT}-1}\, d\nu\,,&lt;/math&gt;

if the vibrational frequencies continued to infinity. This form gives the &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt; behavior which is correct at low temperatures. But Debye realized that there could not be more than &lt;math&gt;3N&lt;/math&gt; vibrational states for N atoms. He made the assumption that in an atomic solid, the spectrum of frequencies of the vibrational states would continue to follow the above rule, up to a maximum frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_m&lt;/math&gt;chosen so that the total number of states is &lt;math&gt;3N&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; 3N = {1 \over 3} \nu_m^3 V F \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Debye knew that this assumption was not really correct (the higher frequencies are more closely spaced than assumed), but it guarantees the proper behavior at high temperature (the [[Dulong–Petit law]]). The energy is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;U = \int_0^{\nu_m} \,{h\nu^3 V F\over e^{h\nu/kT}-1}\, d\nu\,,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = V F kT (kT/h)^3 \int_0^{T_D/T} \,{x^3 \over e^x-1}\, dx\,,&lt;/math&gt;

::where &lt;math&gt;T_D&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;h\nu_m/k&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt; = 9 N k T (T/T_D)^3 \int_0^{T_D/T} \,{x^3 \over e^x-1}\, dx\,,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = 3 N k T D_3(T_D/T)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt; is the function later given the name of third-order [[Debye function]].

In other words simply define that 
E= 3/5N (πkT)^4 (1/hv)^3
Energy term of debye's theory

== Another derivation ==
First we derive the vibrational frequency distribution; the following derivation is based on Appendix VI from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Terrell L.|title=An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics|date=1960|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Reading, Massachusetts, U.S.A.|isbn=9780486652429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a three-dimensional isotropic elastic solid with N atoms in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with side-lengths &lt;math&gt;L_x, L_y, L_z&lt;/math&gt;. The elastic wave will obey the [[wave equation]] and will be [[plane waves]]; consider the [[wave vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;l_x=\frac{k_x}{|\mathbf{k}|}, l_y=\frac{k_y}{|\mathbf{k}|}, l_z=\frac{k_z}{|\mathbf{k}|}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that we have

::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; l_x^2 + l_y^2 + l_z^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Solutions to the [[wave equation]] are

::&lt;math&gt; u(x,y,z,t) = \sin(2\pi\nu t)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi l_x x}{\lambda}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi l_y y}{\lambda}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi l_z z}{\lambda}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

and with the [[boundary conditions]] &lt;math&gt;u=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x,y,z=0, x=L_x, y=L_y, z=L_z&lt;/math&gt;, we have

::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{2l_xL_x}{\lambda}=n_x; \frac{2l_yL_y}{\lambda}=n_y; \frac{2l_zL_z}{\lambda}=n_z &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;n_x,n_y,n_z&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers. Substituting ({{EquationNote|2}}) into ({{EquationNote|1}}) and also using the [[dispersion relation]] &lt;math&gt;c_s=\lambda\nu&lt;/math&gt;, we have

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{n_x^2}{(2\nu L_x/c_s)^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{(2\nu L_y/c_s)^2} + \frac{n_z^2}{(2\nu L_z/c_s)^2} = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The above equation, for fixed frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, describes an eighth of an ellipse in "mode space" (an eighth because &lt;math&gt;n_x,n_y,n_z&lt;/math&gt; are positive). The number of modes with frequency less than &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is thus the number of integral points inside the ellipse, which, in the limit of &lt;math&gt;L_x,L_y,L_z \to\infty&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. for a very large parallelepiped) can be approximated to the volume of the ellipse. Hence, the number of modes &lt;math&gt;N(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; with frequency in the range &lt;math&gt;[0,\nu]&lt;/math&gt; is
::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; N(\nu) = \frac{1}{8}\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{2\nu}{c_s}\right)^3L_xL_yL_z = \frac{4\pi\nu^3V}{3c_s^3},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;V=L_xL_yL_z&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the parallelepiped. Note that the wave speed in the longitudinal direction is different from the transverse direction and that the waves can be polarised one way in the longitudinal direction and two ways in the transverse direction; thus we define &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{c_s^3} = \frac{1}{c_\text{long}^3} + \frac{2}{c_\text{trans}^3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Following the derivation from,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oberai|first1=M. M.|last2=Srikantiah|first2=G|title=A First Course in Thermodynamics|date=1974|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=9780876920183}}&lt;/ref&gt; we define an upper limit to the frequency of vibration &lt;math&gt;\nu_D&lt;/math&gt;; since there are N atoms in the solid, there are 3N quantum harmonic oscillators (3 for each x-, y-, z- direction) oscillating over the range of frequencies &lt;math&gt;[0,\nu_D]&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can determine &lt;math&gt; \nu_D &lt;/math&gt; like so:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 3N = N(\nu_D) = \frac{4\pi\nu_D^3V}{3c_s^3} &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

By defining &lt;math&gt;\nu_D = \frac{kT_D}{h}&lt;/math&gt;, where k is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and h is [[Planck's constant]], and substituting ({{EquationNote|4}}) into ({{EquationNote|3}}), we get

::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; N(\nu) = \frac{3Nh^3\nu^3}{k^3T_D^3},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}this definition is more standard. We can find the energy contribution for all oscillators oscillating at frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. Quantum harmonic oscillators can have energies &lt;math&gt;E_i = (i+1/2)h\nu&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,2,\dotsc&lt;/math&gt;  and using [[Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics]], the number of particles with energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is

::&lt;math&gt;n_i=\frac{1}{A}e^{-E_i/(kT)}=\frac{1}{A}e^{-(i+1/2)h\nu/(kT)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The energy contribution for oscillators with frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is then

::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; dU(\nu) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty E_i\frac{1}{A}e^{-E_i/(kT)}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

By noting that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty n_i = dN(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (because there are &lt;math&gt;dN(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; modes oscillating with frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;), we have

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{A}e^{-1/2h\nu/(kT)}\sum_{i=0}^\infty e^{-ih\nu/(kT)} = \frac{1}{A}e^{-1/2h\nu/(kT)}\frac{1}{1-e^{-h\nu/(kT)}} = dN(\nu) &lt;/math&gt;

From above, we can get an expression for 1/A; substituting it into ({{EquationNote|6}}), we have

::&lt;math&gt;
dU = dN(\nu)e^{1/2h\nu/(kT)}(1-e^{-h\nu/(kT)})\sum_{i=0}^\infty h\nu(i+1/2)e^{-h\nu(i+1/2)/(kT)}=&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
=dN(\nu)(1-e^{-h\nu/(kT)})\sum_{i=0}^\infty h\nu(i+1/2)e^{-h\nu i/(kT)}
=dN(\nu)h\nu\left(\frac{1}{2}+(1-e^{-h\nu/(kT)})\sum_{i=0}^\infty ie^{-h\nu i/(kT)}\right)
= 
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;dN(\nu)h\nu\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating with respect to ν yields

::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{9Nh^4}{k^3T_D^3}\int_0^{\nu_D}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1}\right)\nu^3d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

== Low temperature limit ==

The temperature of a Debye solid is said to be low if &lt;math&gt;T \ll T_D&lt;/math&gt;, leading to

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{C_V}{Nk} \sim 9 \left({T\over T_D}\right)^3\int_0^{T_D/T} {x^4 e^x\over \left(e^x-1\right)^2}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

This definite integral can be evaluated exactly:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{C_V}{Nk} \sim {12\pi^4\over5} \left({T\over T_D}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

In the low temperature limit, the limitations of the Debye model mentioned above do not apply, and it gives a correct relationship between (phononic) heat capacity, temperature, the elastic coefficients, and the volume per atom (the latter quantities being contained in the Debye temperature).

== High-temperature limit ==

The temperature of a Debye solid is said to be high if &lt;math&gt;T \gg T_D&lt;/math&gt;.  Using &lt;math&gt;e^x - 1\approx  x&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|x| \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;leads to

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{C_V}{Nk} \sim 9 \left({T\over T_D}\right)^3\int_0^{T_D/T} {x^4 \over x^2}\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{C_V}{Nk} \sim 3\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the [[Dulong–Petit law]], and is fairly accurate although it does not take into account anharmonicity, which causes the heat capacity to rise further. The total heat capacity of the solid, if it is a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] or [[semiconductor]], may also contain a non-negligible contribution from the electrons.

== Debye versus Einstein ==

[[Image:DebyeVSEinstein.jpg|thumb|mini|upright=1.5|'''Debye vs. Einstein'''. Predicted heat capacity as a function of temperature.|right|300px]]

So how closely do the Debye and Einstein models correspond to experiment? Surprisingly close, but Debye is correct at low temperatures whereas Einstein is not.

How different are the models? To answer that question one would naturally plot the two on the same set of axes... except one can't. Both the Einstein model and the Debye model provide a ''functional form'' for the heat capacity. They are ''models'', and no model is without a scale. A scale relates the model to its real-world counterpart. One can see that the scale of the Einstein model, which is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_V = 3Nk\left({\epsilon\over k T}\right)^2{e^{\epsilon/kT}\over \left(e^{\epsilon/kT}-1\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon/k&lt;/math&gt;.  And the scale of the Debye model is &lt;math&gt;T_D&lt;/math&gt;, the Debye temperature. Both are usually found by fitting the models to the experimental data. (The Debye temperature can theoretically be calculated from the speed of sound and crystal dimensions.) Because the two methods approach the problem from different directions and different geometries, Einstein and Debye scales are '''not''' the same, that is to say

:&lt;math&gt;{\epsilon\over k} \ne T_D\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which means that plotting them on the same set of axes makes no sense. They are two models of the same thing, but of different scales. If one defines '''Einstein temperature''' as

:&lt;math&gt;T_E \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {\epsilon\over k}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

then one can say

:&lt;math&gt;T_E \ne T_D\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and, to relate the two, we must seek the ratio

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_E}{ T_D} = ?&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Einstein solid]] is composed of '''single'''-frequency [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \hbar\omega = h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. That frequency, if it indeed existed, would be related to the speed of sound in the solid. If one imagines the propagation of sound as a sequence of atoms ''hitting'' one another, then it becomes obvious that the frequency of oscillation must correspond to the minimum wavelength sustainable by the atomic lattice, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{min}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = {c_s\over\lambda} = {c_s\sqrt[3]{N}\over 2L} = {c_s\over 2}\sqrt[3]{N\over V}&lt;/math&gt;

which makes the '''Einstein temperature'''

:&lt;math&gt;T_E = {\epsilon\over k} = {h\nu\over k} = {h c_s\over 2k}\sqrt[3]{N\over V}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the sought ratio is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;{T_E\over T_D} = \sqrt[3]{\pi\over6}\ = 0.805995977...&lt;/math&gt;

Now both models can be plotted on the same graph. Note that this ratio is the cube root of the ratio of the volume of one octant of a 3-dimensional sphere to the volume of the cube that contains it, which is just the correction factor used by Debye when approximating the energy integral above.

Alternately the ratio of the 2 temperatures can be seen to be the ratio of Einstein's single frequency at which all oscillators oscillate and Debye's maximum frequency.  Einstein's single frequency can then be seen to be a mean of the frequencies available to the Debye model.

== Debye temperature table ==
Even though the Debye model is not completely correct, it gives a good approximation for the low temperature heat capacity of insulating, crystalline solids where other contributions (such as highly mobile conduction electrons) are negligible. For metals, the electron contribution to the heat is proportional to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which at low temperatures dominates the Debye &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt; result for lattice vibrations. In this case, the Debye model can only be said to approximate for the lattice ''contribution'' to the specific heat. The following table lists Debye temperatures for several pure elements&lt;ref name=Kittel/&gt; and Sapphire:

The Debye model's fit to experimental data is often phenomenologically improved by allowing the Debye temperature to become temperature dependent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Solid-State Physics: Introduction to the Theory |first1=James D |last1=Patterson |first2=Bernard C. |last2=Bailey |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34933-4 |year=2007 |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for example, the value for water ice increases from about 222 K&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shulman | first1 = L. M. | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20031746 | title = The heat capacity of water ice in interstellar  or interplanetary conditions | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 416 | pages = 187–190| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2004A&amp;A...416..187S }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 300 K&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flubacher | first1 = P. | last2 = Leadbetter | first2 = A.

== Extension to other quasi-particles ==
For other [[boson]]ic [[quasi-particle]]s, e.g., for [[magnon]]s (quantized spin waves) in ferromagnets instead of the [[phonons]] (quantized sound waves) one easily derives analogous results. In this case at low frequencies one has different [[dispersion relation]]s, e.g., &lt;math&gt;E(\nu )\propto k^2&lt;/math&gt; in the case of magnons, instead of &lt;math&gt;E(\nu )\propto k&lt;/math&gt; for phonons (with &lt;math&gt;k=2\pi /\lambda &lt;/math&gt;). One also has different [[Density of states#Density of wave vector states|density of states]] (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\int g(\nu ){\rm d}\nu \equiv N\,&lt;/math&gt;). As a consequence, in ferromagnets one gets a magnon contribution
to the heat capacity, &lt;math&gt;\Delta C_{\,{\rm V|\,magnon}}\,\propto T^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, which dominates at sufficiently low temperatures the phonon contribution, &lt;math&gt;\,\Delta C_{\,{\rm V|\,phonon}}\propto T^3&lt;/math&gt;. In metals, in contrast, the main low-temperature contribution to the heat capacity, &lt;math&gt;\propto T&lt;/math&gt;, comes from the electrons. It is [[Fermion gas|fermion]]ic, and is calculated by different methods going back to [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]'s [[free electron model]].

== Extension to liquids ==

It was long thought that phonon theory is not able to explain the heat capacity of liquids, since liquids only sustain longitudinal, but not transverse phonons, which in solids are responsible for 2/3 of the heat capacity. However, [[Brillouin scattering]] experiments [[neutron scattering|with neutrons]] and [[X-ray scattering|with X-rays]], confirming an intuition of [[Yakov Frenkel]],&lt;ref&gt;In his textbook ''Kinetic Theory of Liquids'' (engl. 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that transverse phonons do exist in liquids, albeit restricted to frequencies above a threshold called the [[Frenkel frequency]]. Since most energy is contained in these high-frequency modes, a simple modification of the Debye model is sufficient to yield a good approximation to experimental heat capacities of simple liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Bolmativ, Brazhin, Trachenko, ''The phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics'', Sci Rep 2:421 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">In mathematics, given a ''G''-[[torsor]] ''X'' → ''Y'' and a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] ''F'', the '''descent along torsors''' says there is a canonical equivalence between ''F''(''Y''), the category of ''Y''-points and ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;, the category of ''G''-equivariant ''X''-points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vistoli|loc=Theorem 4.46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic example of [[descent (mathematics)|descent]], since it says the "equivariant data" (which is an additional data) allows one to "descend" from ''X'' to ''Y''.

When ''G'' is the [[Galois group]] of a finite [[Galois extension]] ''L''/''K'', for the ''G''-torsor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} L \to \operatorname{Spec} K&lt;/math&gt;, this generalizes classical '''Galois descent''' (cf. [[field of definition]]).

For example, one can take ''F'' to be the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves (in an appropriate topology). Then ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of [[equivariant sheaf|equivariant sheaves]] on ''X''; thus, the descent in this case says that to give an equivariant sheaf on ''X'' is to give a sheaf on the quotient ''X''/''G''.

An '''electride''' is a [[ionic compound]] in which an [[electron]] is the [[anion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dye, J. L. | title = Electrons as Anions | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | year = 2003 | volume = 301 | pages = 607–608 | doi = 10.1126/science.1088103 | pmid = 12893933 | issue = 5633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions of [[alkali metal]]s in [[ammonia]] are electride salts.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sodium, these blue [[solution]]s consist of [Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[solvated electron]]s: 
:Na  +  6 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →   [Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The cation [Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is an [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] [[coordination complex]].

==Solid salts==
Addition of a complexant like [[crown ether]] or [[2.2.2-Cryptand|2,2,2-cryptand]] to a solution of [Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; affords [Na(crown ether)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Na(2,2,2-crypt)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Evaporation of these solutions yields a blue-black paramagnetic salt with the formula [Na(2,2,2-crypt)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Most solid electride salts decompose above 240&amp;nbsp;K, although [Ca&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;(e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is stable at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buchammagari, H. |year=2007 |title=Room Temperature-Stable Electride as a Synthetic Organic Reagent: Application to Pinacol Coupling Reaction in Aqueous Media |journal=Org.

Nature, 1994,368, 726-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Solutions of electride salts are powerful [[reducing agent]]s, as demonstrated by their use in the [[Birch reduction]]. Evaporation of these blue solutions affords a mirror of Na. Such solutions slowly lose their colour as the electrons reduce ammonia:
:[Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Sodium amide|NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This conversion is catalyzed by various metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Greenlee, K. W. |author2=Henne, A. L. |title = Sodium Amide | journal = Inorganic Syntheses | year = 1946 | volume = 2 | pages = 128–135 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132333.ch38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An electride, [Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is formed as a [[reaction intermediate]].

==High-pressure elements==
Theoretical evidence supports electride behaviour in insulating high-pressure forms of potassium, sodium, and lithium. Here the isolated electron is stabilized by efficient packing, which reduces enthalpy under external pressure. The electride is identified by a maximum in the [[electron localization function]], which distinguishes the electride from pressure-induced metallization. Electride phases are typically semiconducting or have very low conductivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marques M. |year=2009 |title=Potassium under Pressure: A Pseudobinary Ionic Compound

'''Energy transition''' is generally defined as a long-term structural change in [[energy system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/5293225/Global+Energy+Transitions.pdf/220e6818-3a0a-4baa-af32-8bfbb64f4a6b|title=World Energy Council. 2014. Global Energy Transitions.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have occurred in the past, and still occur worldwide. Historic energy transitions are most broadly described by [[Vaclav Smil]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, Vaclav. 2010. Energy Transitions. History, Requirements, Prospects. Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary energy transitions differ in terms of motivation and objectives, drivers and governance.

The layout of the world’s energy systems have changed significantly over time. Until the 1950s, the economic mechanism behind energy systems was local rather than global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Häfelse|first1=W|last2=Sassin|first2=W|title=The global energy system|journal=Annual Review of Energy|date=1977|volume=2|doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.02.110177.000245|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As development progressed, different national systems became more and more integrated becoming the large, international systems seen today. Historical transition rates of energy systems have been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=Mikael|last2=Li|first2=Junchen|last3=Johansson|first3=Kersti|last4=Snowden|first4=Simon|title=Growth Rates of Global Energy Systems and Future Outlooks|journal=Natural Resources Research|date=2011|volume=21|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s11053-011-9162-0|pages=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While historical energy transitions were generally protracted affairs, unfolding over many decades, this does not necessarily hold true for the present energy transition, which is unfolding under very different policy and technological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-03-01|title=How long will it take? Conceptualizing the temporal dynamics of energy transitions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629615300827|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|language=en|volume=13|pages=202–215|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2015.12.020|issn=2214-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solving the [[global warming]] problem is regarded as the most important challenge facing humankind in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicola Armaroli]], [[Vincenzo Balzani]], ''The Future of Energy Supply: Challenges and Opportunities''. In: [[Angewandte Chemie]] 46, (2007), 52-66, p. 52, {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200602373}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of the earth system to absorb greenhouse gas emissions is already exhausted, and under the [[Paris Agreement|Paris climate agreement]], current emissions must be fully stopped until 2040 or 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Christiana Figueres, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Gail Whiteman, Johan Rockström, Anthony Hobley, Stefan Rahmstorf (2017): Three years to safeguard our climate. Nature [DOI: 10.1038/546593a]&lt;/ref&gt; Barring a breakthrough in [[carbon sequestration]] technologies, this requires an energy transition away from [[fossil fuels]] such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]], [[lignite]], and [[coal]]. This energy transition is also known as the [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]] of the energy system. Available technologies are [[nuclear fuel]] (uranium) and the renewable energy sources [[Wind power|wind]], [[hydropower]], [[solar power]], [[Geothermal electricity|geothermal]], and [[Marine energy]].

A timely implementation for the energy transition requires multiple approaches in parallel. [[Energy conservation]] and improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] thus play a major role. [[Smart meter|Smart electric meters]] can schedule energy consumption for times when electricity is available abundantly, reducing consumption at times when the more volatile renewable energy sources are scarce (night time and lack of wind).

After a transitional period, renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world's energy production. The risk management firm, [[DNV GL]], forecasts that, by 2050, the world's primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and non-fossil sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eto.dnvgl.com/|title=DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook 2018|website=eto.dnvgl.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 projection by the [[International Energy Agency]] expects solar PV to supply more than half of the world's electricity by 2060, dramatically reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="Ben Sills"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-29/solar-may-produce-most-of-world-s-power-by-2060-iea-says.html |title=Solar May Produce Most of World’s Power by 2060, IEA Says |author=Ben Sills |date= Aug 29, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining the term 'energy transition' ==
An 'energy transition' designates a significant change for an energy system that could be related to one or a combination of system structure, scale, economics, and [[energy policy]]. An 'energy transition' is usefully defined as a change in the state of an energy system as opposed to a change in an individual energy technology or fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grübler|first1=A.|title=Diffusion: Long-term patterns and discontinuities|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=1991|volume=39|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/0040-1625(91)90034-D|pages=159–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example is the change from a pre-industrial system relying on traditional biomass and other renewable power sources (wind, water, and muscle power) to an industrial system characterized by pervasive mechanization (steam power) and the use of coal. Market shares reaching pre-specified thresholds are typically used to characterize the speed of transition (e.g. coal versus traditional biomass) and typical market share thresholds in the literature are 1%, 10% for the initial shares and 50%, 90% and 99% for outcome shares following a transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grübler|first1=A|last2=Wilson|first2=C.|last3=Nemet|first3=G.|title=Apples, oranges, and consistent comparisons of the temporal dynamics of energy transitions|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|date=2016|volume=22|issue=12|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2016.08.015|pages=18–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For energy systems, many lessons can be learned from history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podobnik|first1=B.|title=Toward a sustainable energy regime: a long-wave interpretation of global energy shifts|date=1999|volume=62|issue=3|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(99)00042-6|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|pages=155–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rühl,|first1=C.|last2=Appleby|first2=P.|last3=Fennema|first3=F.|last4=Naumov|first4=A.|last5=Schaffer|first5=M.|title=Economic development and the demand for energy: a historical perspective on the next 20 years|journal=Energy Policy|date=2012|volume=50|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.07.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for large amounts of firewood in early industrial processes in combination with prohibitive costs for overland transportation led to a scarcity of accessible (e.g. affordable) wood and it has been found that eighteenth century glass-works “operated like a forest clearing enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debeir|first1=J.C.|last2=Deléage|first2=J.P.|last3=Hémery|first3=D.|title=In the Servitude of Power: Energy and Civilisation Through the Ages|date=1991|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|url=https://books.google.se/books/about/In_the_Servitude_of_Power.html?id=I1sfAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Britain had to resort to coal after largely having run out of wood, the resulting fuel crisis triggered a chain of events that two centuries later culminated in the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nef|first1=J.U|title=Early energy crisis and its consequences|date=1977|journal=Scientific American|volume=237|issue=5|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1177-140|bibcode=1977SciAm.237e.140N|pages=140–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fouquet|first1=R.|last2=Pearson|first2=P.J.G.|title=A thousand years of energy use in the United Kingdom|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1998|volume=19|issue=4|doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol19-no4-1|jstor=41322802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, increased use of peat and coal was vital elements paving the way for the Dutch Golden Age roughly spanning the entire 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unger|first1=R.W.|title=Energy sources for the dutch golden age: peat, wind, and coal|journal=Research in Economic History|date=1984|volume=9|pages=221–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example where [[resource depletion]] triggered technological innovation and a shift to new energy sources in 19th Century [[whaling]] and how whale oil eventually became replaced by [[kerosene]] and other petroleum-derived products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bardi|first1=U.|title=Energy prices and resource depletion: lessons from the case of whaling in the nineteenth century|journal=Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy|date=2007|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.1080/15567240600629435|pages=297–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technology]] has been identified as an important but difficult-to-predict driver of change within energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grübler|first1=A.|last2=Nakićenović|first2=N.|last3=Victor|first3=D.G.|title=Dynamics of energy technologies and global change|journal=Energy Policy|date=1999|volume=27|issue=5|doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(98)00067-6|pages=247–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published forecasts have systematically tended to overestimate the potential of new energy and conversion technologies and underestimated the inertia in energy systems and energy infrastructure (e.g. power plants, once built, characteristically operate for many decades).

The term 'energy transition' could also encompasses a reorientation of policy and this is often the case in public debate about [[energy policy]]. For example, this could imply a rebalance of demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency. In a broader sense the energy transition could also entail a democratization of energy&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Paulitz: [http://www.ippnw.de/atomenergie/energiewende/artikel/b93f91816b/dezentrale-energiegewinnung-eine-r.html ''Dezentrale Energiegewinnung - Eine Revolutionierung der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse'']. [[IPPNW]]. (Decentralized Energy Production - Revolutionizing Social Relations) Accessed 20 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or a move towards increased [[sustainability]].

In June 2018, at their [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit|G20 Summit in Argentina]], the G20 Energy Ministers ‘welcome(d) the approach of Argentina’s G20 Presidency, which recognises that there are different possible national paths to achieve cleaner energy systems - while promoting sustainability, resilience and energy security - under the term “transitions” (in plural). This view reflects the fact that each G20 member - according to its stage of development - has a unique and diverse energy system as starting point, with different energy resources, demand dynamics, technologies, stock of capital, geographies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://g20.org/sites/default/files/media/energy_communique.pdf|title=G20 Energy Ministers Communique|last=|first=|date=15 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’

== Status in specific countries ==

=== Austria ===
Austria embarked on its energy transition (''Energiewende'') some decades ago. Due to geographical conditions, energy production in Austria relies heavily on renewable energies, notably hydropower. 78.4% of domestic production in 2013 came from renewable energy, 9.2% from natural gas and 7.2% from petroleum. (rest: waste). On the basis of the Federal Constitutional Law for a Nuclear-Free Austria, no nuclear power stations are in operation in Austria.
But domestic energy production makes up only 36% of Austria's total energy consumption, which among other things encompasses transport, electricity production, and heating. In 2013, oil accounts for about 36.2% of total energy consumption, renewable energies 29.8%, gas 20.6%, and coal 9.7%. In the past 20 years, the structure of gross domestic energy consumption has shifted from coal and oil to new renewables, in particular between 2005 and 2013 (plus 60%). The EU target for Austria require a renewables share of 34% by 2020 (gross final energy consumption). Austria is on a good way to achieve this target (32.5% in 2013).
Energy transition in Austria can be also seen on the local level, in some villages, towns and regions. For example, the town of [[Güssing]] in the state of Burgenland is a pioneer in independent and sustainable energy production. Since 2005, Güssing has already produced significantly more heating (58 gigawatt hours) and electricity (14 GWh) from renewable resources than the city itself needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eee-info.net/cms/netautor/napro4/appl/na_professional/parse.php?mlay_id=2500&amp;xmlval_ID_DOC%5B0%5D=1000025 ''Modell Güssing - Wussten Sie, dass ...''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Denmark, as a country reliant on imported oil, was impacted particularly hard by the [[1973 oil crisis]]. This roused public discussions on building nuclear power stations to diversify energy supply. A strong [[anti-nuclear movement]] developed, which fiercely criticized nuclear power plans taken up by the government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/sonne-im-norden-ging-die-auf/1958354.html'' Sonne: Im Norden ging die auf'']. In ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'', 18 October 2010. Retrieved 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and this ultimately led to a 1985 resolution not to build any nuclear power stations in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf99.html'' Nuclear Energy in Denmark'']. http://www.world-nuclear.org. Retrieved 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The country instead opted for renewable energy, focusing primarily on [[wind power]]. Wind turbines for power generation already had a [[History of wind energy|long history]] in Denmark, as far back as the late 1800s. As early as 1974 a panel of experts declared "that it should be possible to satisfy 10% of Danish electricity demand with wind power, without causing special technical problems for the public grid."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, Windkraftanlagen: Grundlagen, Technik, Einsatz, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Berlin - Heidelberg 2008, p45.&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark undertook the development of large wind power stations — though at first with little success (like with the Growian project in Germany).

Small facilities prevailed instead, often sold to private owners such as farms. Government policies promoted their construction; at the same time, positive geographical factors favored their spread, such as good [[wind]] power density and Denmark's decentralized patterns of settlement. A lack of administrative obstacles also played a role. Small and robust systems came on line, at first in the power range of only 50-60 kilowatts — using 1940s technology and sometimes hand-crafted by very small businesses. In the late seventies and the eighties a brisk export trade to the United States developed, where wind energy also experienced an early boom. In 1986 Denmark already had about 1200 wind power turbines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2012/06/Windkraft/komplettansicht?print=true ''Die Kraft aus der Luft'']. In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 6 February 2012. Retrieved 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; though they still accounted for just barely 1% of Denmark's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, Windkraftanlagen: Grundlagen, Technik, Einsatz, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Berlin - Heidelberg 2008, p56.&lt;/ref&gt; This share increased significantly over time. In 2011, renewable energies covered 41% of electricity consumption, and wind power facilities alone accounted for 28%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens.dk/en/info/news-danish-energy-agency/renewables-cover-more-40-electricity-consumption ''Renewables now cover more than 40% of electricity consumption'']. Danish Energy Agency. Retrieved 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet|government]] aims to increase wind energy's share of power generation to 50% by 2020, while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/208067.daenemark-hat-neue-regierung.html ''Dänemark hat neue Regierung''] In: ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', 4 October 2011. Retrieved 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 March 2012, the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Building published a four-page paper titled "DK Energy Agreement," outlining long-term principles for Danish energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kebmin.dk/sites/kebmin.dk/files/climate-energy-and-building-policy/denmark/energy-agreements/FAKTA%20UK%201.pdf DK Energy Agreement]. March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of oil and gas heating is banned in newly constructed buildings from the start of 2013; beginning in 2016 this will also apply to existing buildings. At the same time an assistance program for heater replacement was launched. Denmark's goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels 33% by 2020. The country is scheduled to attain complete independence from petroleum and natural gas by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/blogs/2/153749 ''Abschied vom Ölkessel'']. In: ''[[heise.de]]'', 16 February 2013. accessed on 16 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Since 2012, political discussions have been developing in France about the energy transition and how the French economy might profit from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lecercle.lesechos.fr/economie-societe/energies-environnement/energies-classiques/221146420/transition-energetique-vrai-ve La transition énergétique, un vrai vecteur de croissance pour la France] Les échos, Mai 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Minister of the Environment [[Delphine Batho]] coined the term "ecological patriotism." The government began a work plan to consider starting the energy transition in France. This plan should address the following questions by June 2013:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batiactu.com/edito/transition-energetique---quels-moyens-et-quels-cou-33110.php Transition énergétique: quels moyens et quels coûts?] batiactu 21. September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* How can France move towards [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy conservation? Reflections on altered lifestyles, changes in production, consumption, and transport.
* How to achieve the energy mix targeted for 2025? France's climate protection targets call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and 60% by 2040.
* Which renewable energies should France rely on? How should the use of wind and solar energy can be promoted?
* What costs and funding models will likely be required for alternative energy consulting and investment support? And how about for research, renovation, and expansion of district heating, biomass, and geothermal energy? One solution could be a continuation of the CSPE, a tax that is charged on electricity bills.

The Environmental Conference on Sustainable Development on 14 and 15 September 2012 treated the issue of the environmental and energy transition as its main theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Conference-environnementale-14-15.html Conférence environnementale des 14-15 septembre 2012] developpement-durable.gouv.fr, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2013, the national debate leaders submits some proposals to the government. Among them, there were environmental taxation, and [[smart grid]] development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transition-energetique.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/dnte_synthese_nationale_des_debats_territoriaux.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the National Assembly has adopted legislation for the transition to low emission vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-adoption-de-la-loi-sur-la-transition-energetique-5757.html|title=Adoption de la loi sur la transition énergétique|first=Association|last=AVEM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France is second only to Denmark as having the worlds lowest carbon emissions in relation to gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf pg51&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there will be an associated [[research and development]] drive.

The policy has been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 17% in 2010, reaching close to the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany’s energy transformation Energiewende|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21559667|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=Jul 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits. The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market. Nuclear power stations were closed, and the existing nine stations will close earlier than necessary, in 2022.

The reduction of reliance on nuclear stations has had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels. One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

Different [[Lander of Germany|Länder]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany’s energy reform: Troubled turn|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21571440-germanys-national-energy-project-becoming-cause-disunion-troubled-turn|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=9 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, for the first time in more than ten years, electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"/&gt;

=== Japan ===
On 14 September 2012 the Japanese government decided at a ministerial meeting in Tokyo to phase out nuclear power by the 2030s, or 2040 at the very latest. The government said that it would take "all possible measures" to achieve this goal.&lt;ref name="focus atomausstieg"&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/wegen-reaktorunglueck-in-fukushima-japan-verkuendet-atomausstieg-bis-2040_aid_819567.html ''Wegen Reaktorunglück in Fukushima: Japan verkündet Atomausstieg bis 2040''] at focus.de, 14 September 2012 (accessed on 14 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the government retrenched the planned nuclear phaseout after the industry pushed for reconsideration. Arguments cited were that a nuclear phaseout would burden the economy, and that imports of oil, coal, and gas would bring high added costs. The government then approved the energy transition, but left open the time-frame for decommissioning the nuclear power stations.&lt;ref name="zeit ausstiegrücknahme"&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2012-09/japan-atomausstieg-einschraenkung ''Energiewende: Japan schränkt Atomausstieg wieder ein''] at zeit.de, 19 September 2012 (accessed on 20 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom is mainly focusing on [[wind power]], both onshore and offshore, and in particular is strongly promoting the establishment of [[offshore wind power]]. With an installed capacity of 18.8 GW at the end of 2017, Britain is one of the worldwide leaders taking the sixth place, after China, the United States, Germany, India, and Spain. It was initially promoted with a quota system, but expansion targets were missed repeatedly. This led the government to implement a [[feed-in tariff]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.411124.de/12-45.pdf ''Erneuerbare Energien: Quotenmodell keine Alternative zum EEG''].

=== United States ===
{{See also|Energy policy of the Obama administration}}
The [[Presidency of Barack Obama#Cabinet appointees|Obama administration]] made a large push for [[green job]]s, particularly in his first term.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher F. Jones (March 2016): [http://equitablegrowth.org/report/energy-transitions-in-the-u-s/ Energy Transitions in the United States - Worker opportunities past, present, and future].

In the United States, the share of renewable energy (excluding hydropower) in electricity generation has grown from 3.3 percent (1990) to 5.5 percent (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Ochs, Christoph von Friedeburg (2014) / www.worldwatch.org: [http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/energy%20transitions%20in%20Germany%20and%20the%20United%20States.pdf#page=9 Energy Transitions in Germany and the United States. Transatlantic Perspectives, Challenges, and the Way Forward], p. 3. Figure 1 is based on (footnote 8 of the paper names the sources) [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.RNWX.KH http://data.worldbank.org], www.eia.gov (2016 edition of the report [http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/0383(2016).pdf here] (pdf, 13 MB) and an EUROSTAT website.&lt;/ref&gt; Oil use will decline in the USA owing to the increasing efficiency of the vehicle fleet and replacement of crude oil by natural gas as a feedstock for the petrochemical sector. One forecast is that the rapid uptake of electric vehicles will reduce oil demand drastically, to the point where it is 80% lower in 2050 compared with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eto.dnvgl.com/|title=DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook 2018|website=eto.dnvgl.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, [[Block Island Wind Farm]] became the first commercial US [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farm]]. It consists of five 6&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] turbines (together 30&amp;nbsp;MW) located ''near-shore'' ({{convert|3.8|mi}} from [[Block Island]], [[Rhode Island]]) in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
At the same time, Norway-based oil major [[Statoil]] laid down nearly $42.5 million on a bid to lease a large offshore area off the coast of New York.&lt;ref&gt;It was “the highest bid ever for a U.S. offshore wind energy area,” according to the [[American Wind Energy Association]]. The leased area has the potential to develop more than 1 gigawatt of offshore wind, which is a sizeable offshore wind park.

The '''Environmental Forum for Action''' (ENFORAC) is a coalition of 16 environmental [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], community groups and academic institutions that have come together as a united voice to protect and advocate for [[Sierra Leone]]’s [[natural resources]].

Formed in 2004, it was not officially launched until April 2006.

Between 2009-2014 The Environmental Forum for Action was Implementing Partner in the EU funded project:
"Conserving the Western Area Peninsula Forest and its Watersheds"-WAPFOR.
German-Agro Action, later known as Welthungerhilfe was project holder. The action resulted in the declaration of the Western Area Peninsula Forest Reserve as a National Park and tentative scoping steps towards qualification of The Western Area National Park as a candidate for REDD+ carbon credit and UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration. 55,000 indigenous forest fringe residents were educated about forest benefits and provided facilities and equipment to provide incentive for alternative livelihoods for forest destruction activities such as logging, charcoal production and hunting.

Carried through in partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone Forestry Division, the previous forest was re-demarcated with GIS from 17,000 hectares to 18,000 hectares.

A National Protected Area Authority is assuming the mantle of responsibility for this National Park and others in Sierra Leone.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2388">In [[fluid mechanics]], the '''force density''' is the negative [[gradient]] of pressure. It has the physical dimensions of [[force (physics)|force]] per unit [[volume]].  Force density is a [[vector field]] representing the [[flux]] density of the [[hydrostatic force]] within the bulk of a [[fluid]].  Force density is represented by the symbol '''f'''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ForceDensity.html Force Density]. Eric Weisstein's World of Physics. Accessed March 8th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
, and given by the following equation, where ''P'' is the [[pressure]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = - \nabla P &lt;/math&gt;.

The net force on a differential [[volume element]] ''dV'' of the fluid is:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{f}dV&lt;/math&gt;

Force density acts in different ways which is caused by the boundary conditions. There is stick-slip boundary conditions and stick boundary conditions which effect force density.

In a sphere placed in an arbitrary non-stationary flow field of viscous incompressible fluid for stick boundary conditions where the force density’s calculations leads to show the generalization of [[Faxén's law|Faxen's theorem]] to force multipole moments of arbitrary order.

In a sphere moving in an incompressible fluid in a non-stationary flow with mixed stick-slip boundary condition where the force of density shows an expression of the Faxén type for the total force, but the total torque and the symmetric force-dipole moment.&lt;ref&gt;Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications Volume 84, Issue 3, Pages 435-641 (1976)Accessed January 19th, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The force density at a point in a fluid, divided by the [[density]], is the [[acceleration]] of the fluid at that point.

The force density F is defined as the force per unit volume, so that:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf(F)=\int f(r)d^3 r &lt;/math&gt;.

The force density in an electromagnetic field is given in cgs by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf(f)=pE+ \frac{J}{c} \times B, &lt;/math&gt;.

Where p is the charge density, E is the electric field, J is the current density, c is the speed of light, and B is the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ForceDensity.html Force Density]. Eric Weinstein's World of Physics. Accessed January 17th, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sodium-sulfur battery]] in the floor of the cargo area stored power for a {{convert|75|hp|kW|0}} electric motor under the front hood.  The Ecostar introduced the road-and-leaf logo now used on a number of Ford products.

Just over 100 Ecostars were produced, and used in fleet tests between 1992 and 1996 with over {{convert|1000000|miles|km|0}} driven. The Ecostar averaged {{convert|94|miles|km|0}} on a full charge, and demonstrated {{convert|155|mi|km|0}} range in one test. However, on several occasions the battery burst into flame during recharging. For this, and several other reasons, Ford lost interest in the sodium-sulfur battery and turned to [[fuel cell]] concepts instead.

The product niche appeared to be a useful one and has led to a number of similar designs. While the 1998 [[Citroën Berlingo électrique]] was almost identical in performance and range, it just replaced the older 1991 [[Citroën C15|C15 électrique]]. Ford is re-entering the market as well, with an electric version of the [[Transit Connect]].

==History==
Ford developed the sodium-sulfur battery technology in 1965,&lt;ref name=f&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=14300 "Today in Ford History--Feb. 3"], reprint of a 1992 article&lt;/ref&gt; but had not developed it commercially. Development was later picked up in Europe.

The Ecostar was introduced as a purely experimental effort, to help develop all aspects of electric vehicle design from engineering to supplier development to market development. A "prototype-of-the-prototypes" was completed with lead acid batteries in 1992, and introduced with the comment that future models would include the new battery technology. Several similar models followed and were lent out for test drives with favorable results.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stepler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAMbdaR3IvYC&amp;pg=PA32 "Coming: Speedy Electric Delivery"], ''Popular Science'', January 1993, pg. 32 (sidebar)&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 80&lt;ref name=f/&gt; to 105&lt;ref name=h/&gt; "production-prototype" sulfur-powered Ecostars were hand-built starting in 1993, and used in fleet trials with a number of customers starting the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Leitman and Bob Brant, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jf4jrFJtH7cC&amp;pg=PA62 "Build Your Own Electric Vehicle"], McGraw-Hill, 2008, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the cost of the battery was a significant $46,000. However, the vehicles were hand-built at a cost of $250,000, so the battery cost was not representative of a production version.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Lienert, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9378679_ITM "Where's the plug?"], ''Management Review'', 1 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The tests ran for 30 months. Throughout the tests there were problems with the system, including two vehicles that burst into flame while charging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-06/business/9406060018_1_ecostar-sodium-sulfur-battery-30-month-evaluation "Ford Unplugs Electric Vans After 2 Fires"], ''Chicago Tribune'' (Bloomberg Network News), 6 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The sulfur in the battery was flammable, a serious safety risk. ABB introduced a new version of the battery, but was unwilling to guarantee performance beyond one year.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hGHr2L6HtKwC&amp;pg=PA106 "Advanced Automotive Technology"], US Congress, pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1997, Ford announced a partnership with [[Daimler-Benz]] and [[Ballard Power Systems]] to introduce car-ready [[fuel cell]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Nauss, [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/16/news/mn-64565 "Ford Investing $420 Million for Fuel-Cell-Powered Auto"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and their experiments with the sodium-sulfur batteries ended.

==Description==
The Ecostar's chassis was based on the Escort Van produced by Ford's [[Halewood Body &amp; Assembly]] factory outside [[Liverpool]]. This was essentially a European [[Ford_Escort_(Europe)#Ford Escort Mark V (1990–1992)|Escort Mk V]] with a raised cargo area forming a 2-door [[panel van]]. Fully equipped, it weighed {{convert|3100|lbs|kg|0}}.&lt;ref name=h/&gt;

A significant portion of that weight was its {{convert|780|lb|kg|0}} [[sodium-sulfur battery]], which stored 37&amp;nbsp;kWh.&lt;ref name=h/&gt; Using the Federal Urban Driving Schedule, this gave the Ecostar a range of {{convert|100|miles|km|0}}.&lt;ref name=h/&gt; The sodium-sulfur technology was invented by Ford in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=c/&gt; but the battery for the Ecostar was built by [[ABB Group]] in [[Heidelberg, Germany]].&lt;ref name=h/&gt; In order for the battery to work, it had to be maintained at a temperature of {{convert|600|F|C|0}}, which keeps the sulfur molten.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Cogan&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid heat loss, and to insulate the cabin from its heat, the battery was stored inside a double-walled stainless steel vacuum bottle. This allowed it to stay warm overnight, and keep its temperature constant even during cold weather, when traditional batteries are less responsive. The container was mounted below the floor plan of the cargo area, which gave the vehicle a low center of gravity that give it well-liked handling.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; One complaint, however, was the lack of [[power steering]].&lt;ref name=c106/&gt;

The battery powered a three-phase electric motor located under the hood in the area normally used for the gasoline engine. The motor delivered only 75&amp;nbsp;hp, low for a vehicle of this size, but up to 143&amp;nbsp;foot-pounds of [[torque]], numbers typical of a much more powerful gasoline engine. This was better torque than the Ford Escort GT, for instance, whose 1.8 litre four-cylinder engine delivered 127&amp;nbsp;hp but only 114&amp;nbsp;ft-lb.&lt;ref name=c106&gt;Chaikin, pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

One drawback of the sodium-sulfur battery is its relatively slow discharge rates, which limited the amount of power that could be drawn from the battery during acceleration.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Drivers described it as "sedate", while Ford estimated its 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (0-100&amp;nbsp;km/h) acceleration at about 16.5&amp;nbsp;seconds. While slow by car standards, this is similar to other small European delivery vans of the era, like the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|Volkswagen Eurovan]].&lt;ref name=h&gt;Highway&lt;/ref&gt;

While cruising the motor used only 8&amp;nbsp;kW to maintain speed,&lt;ref name=j&gt;Ronald Jurgen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpSNZCOSy6MC&amp;pg=SA33-PA21 "Automotive Electronics Handbook"], pg. 33.21&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|6|hp|kW|0}}. This speaks to the motor-to-wheel efficiency of the electric drivetrain, as well as the 50&amp;nbsp;psi low-drag tires.&lt;ref name=c106/&gt; However, the long quoted ranges referred only to driving, not accessory systems. These added considerably to the load; the electric heater burned 5&amp;nbsp;kW, and the [[air conditioner]] 6&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name=j/&gt; In real-world driving, using either would significantly impact range.

A '''forwarder''' is a [[forestry]] vehicle that carries big [[felling|felled]] [[Timber|log]]s from the stump to a roadside landing.  Unlike a [[skidder]], a forwarder carries [[logging|logs]] clear of the ground, which can reduce soil impacts but tends to limit the size of the logs it can move.  Forwarders are typically employed together with [[harvester (forestry)|harvesters]] in [[cut-to-length logging]] operations.

== Load capacity ==

Forwarders are commonly categorised on their load carrying capabilities. The smallest are trailers designed for towing behind [[all-terrain vehicle]]s which can carry a load between 1 and 3 tonnes. Agricultural self-loading trailers designed to be towed by farm tractors can handle load weights up to around 12 to 15 [[tonne]]s. Light weight purpose-built machines utilised in commercial [[logging]] and early [[thinning]] operations can handle payloads of up to 8 tonnes. Medium-sized forwarders used in [[clearfelling|clearfell]]s and later thinnings carry between 12 and 16 tonnes. The largest class specialized for [[clearfelling|clearfell]]s handles up to 25 tonnes. Forwarders also carry their load at least 2 feet above the [[Earth's surface|ground]].

|}[[Standard Dry Air]] is the agreed-upon gas composition for air from which all water vapour has been removed.  There are various standards bodies which publish documents that define a dry air gas composition.  Each standard provides a list of constituent concentrations, a [[gas density]] at [[standard conditions]] and a [[molar mass]].

It is extremely unlikely that the actual composition of any specific sample of air will completely agree with any definition for standard dry air.  While the various definitions for standard dry air all attempt to provide realistic information about the constituents of air, the definitions are important in and of themselves because they establish a standard which can be cited in legal contracts and publications documenting measurement calculation methodologies or [[equations of state]].

The standards below are two examples of commonly used and cited publications that provide a composition for standard dry air:

* ISO TR  29922-2017 provides a definition for standard dry air which specifies an air molar mass of 28,965 46 ± 0,000 17&amp;nbsp;kg·kmol-1.&lt;ref name="ISO TR 29922-2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/67135.html|title=ISO/TR 29922:2017 - Natural gas -- Supporting information on the calculation of physical properties according to ISO 6976|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* GPA 2145:2009 is published by the Gas Processors Association.  It provides a molar mass for air of 28.9625 g/mol, and provides a composition for standard dry air as a footnote.&lt;ref name="GPA 2145:2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/Details.aspx?productID=1096564|title=GPA 2145:2009 {{!}} Table Of Physical Properties For Hydro... {{!}} SAI Global|last=saiglobal.com|website=infostore.saiglobal.com|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hardwood timber production''' is the process of managing stands of [[deciduous]] trees to maximize woody output. The production process is not linear because other factors must be considered, including marketable and non-marketable goods, financial benefits, management practices, and the environmental implications ,of those management practices.

Forests include market and non-market products.  Marketable products include goods that have a market price. Timber is the main one, with prices that range from a few hundred dollars per thousand board feet (MBF) to several thousand dollars for a [[Wood veneer|veneer]] log. Others include grazing/fodder, specialty crops such as mushrooms or berries, usage fees for recreation or hunting, and biomass. Forests also provide some non-market values which have no current market price.  Examples of non-market goods would be improving water quality, air quality, aesthetics, and [[carbon sequestration]]. 

The more biodiverse the hardwood-forest ecosystem, the more challenges and opportunities its managers face. Managers aim for [[sustainable forest management]] to keep their cash crop renewing itself, using [[silvicultural]] practices that include growing, selling, controlling insects and most diseases, providing manure, applying herbicle treatments, and thinning. Fertilization can stop the growth rate and amount of plant material, thus possibly increasing the number of wildlife that can inhabit a site. Invasive species control maintains an area's structure and native composition.

But management can also harm the ecosystem; for example, machinery used in a timber harvest can compact the soil, stress the root system, reduce tree growth, lengthen the time needed for a stand to mature to harvestability. Machinery can also damage the [[understory]], disturbing wildlife habitat and prevent regeneration.

The '''Hwange Thermal Power Station''' is the biggest power plant in [[Zimbabwe]] with an installed capacity of 920&amp;nbsp;MW. It is owned and driven by the national electricity company [[Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority|ZESA Holdings (Pvt) LTD.]]

It was built in two stages and consists of 4 units of 120&amp;nbsp;MW each and 2 units of 220&amp;nbsp;MW each. Engineering Consultants, Merz &amp; McLellan, were employed for the design and supervision of the construction of the power station. Construction of Stage 1 commenced in 1973, but was suspended in 1975 due to economic sanctions imposed on [[Rhodesia]]. Stage 1's units were commissioned from 1983 to 1986 with Stage 2's units following in 1986/87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zpc.co.zw/index.php/power-stationszim |title=Power Stations - Zimbabwe Power Company : Hwange Power Station. |accessdate=2013-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029125415/http://www.zpc.co.zw/index.php/power-stationszim |archivedate=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reliable source of water lies further north, in the Zambezi River.  From there, through a 44 kilometre long pipeline, water for the Boilers and Cooling Towers is drawn by both high and low lift pumps to a storage reservoir located adjacent to the station and conveyed by gravity to the station.  About 107,000 cubic meters of raw water can be provided per day; while the demineralisation plant has a capacity of 5,420 cubic metres per day.

A 3.5 kilometre conveyor belt brings about 1,750 tonnes of coal per hour from the nearby Wankie colliery open cast mine, and 250,000 tonnes of coal are stockpiled on site.  Coal reserves estimated to support 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW for an estimated 30 years are concealed beneath the vast expanse of the coal mine.

Technical problems due to neglect of maintenance, part replacement and upgrading make the plant prone to frequent production stops. In 2009, [[Namibia]]'s [[NamPower]] made agreements to help ZESA to revive the plant’s capacity in exchange for power deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/botswana-namibia-to-ramp-up-zim-power-generation-2009-11-05 |title=Engineering News online: Botswana, Namibia to ramp up Zim power generation|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive problems are however continuing and have even led the government to considering a full close-down of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE6220CV20100303 |title=Reuters: Zimbabwe mulls decommissioning Hwange power plant|accessdate=2010-03-21 | date=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, [[Chadha Power]] of India secured a contract to refurbish four units at the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eoi.gov.in/harare/?2000?000|title=India Zimbabwe relations|accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 China agreed to provide a $1.2 billion loan to add 600&amp;nbsp;MW of generating capacity to the Hwange station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esi-africa.com/news/zimbabwe-china-promises-1-2bn-loan-for-hwange-thermal-power-plant-upgrade/ Zimbabwe: China promises $1.2bn loan for Hwange thermal power plant upgrade]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">{{short description|breathing gas mixture of helium, oxygen and hydrogen }}
'''Hydreliox''' is an exotic [[breathing gas]] mixture of [[helium]], [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="Fife1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rostain1988" /&gt;  For the [[Hydra VIII]] mission at 50 atmospheres of ambient pressure, the mixture used was 49% hydrogen, 50.2% helium, and 0.8% oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;i=1&amp;index=ent&amp;srchtxt=HYDRELIOX|publisher=Termium Plus (government of Canada)|title=Hydreliox|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used primarily for research and scientific [[deep diving]], usually below {{convert|130|m|ft}}. Below this depth, extended breathing of [[heliox]] gas mixtures may cause [[high pressure nervous syndrome]] (HPNS).&lt;ref name="Hunger1974" /&gt; Two gas mixtures exist that attempt to combat this problem: [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] and hydreliox. Like trimix, hydreliox contains helium and oxygen and a third gas to counteract HPNS. The third gas in trimix is [[nitrogen]] and the third gas in hydreliox is [[hydrogen]]. Because hydrogen is the lightest element, it is easier to breathe than [[nitrogen]] under high pressure.  To avoid the risk of explosion, as a rule of thumb hydrogen is only considered for use in breathing mixtures if the proportion of oxygen in the mixture is less than 5%. However, the pressure during the dive must be such that the [[partial pressure]] of 5% oxygen is sufficient to sustain the diver. (The flammability of the mixture also depends to some degree on the pressure)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/mixhistory.htm|title=Diving With Gas Mixes Other Than Air|author=Larry "Harris" Taylor, Ph.D.|publisher=Author preprint; the article was published in Watersport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydreliox has been tested to simulated depths in excess of {{convert|700|m|ft}} in a chamber by [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|COMEX]] [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]], a French diving company.&lt;ref name="Lafay1995" /&gt; Although breathing hydreliox improves the symptoms seen in HPNS, tests have shown that [[hydrogen narcosis]] becomes a factor at depths of {{convert|500|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Rostain1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraini1994" /&gt;

'''Indium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''In''' and [[atomic number]] 49. It is a [[post-transition metal]] that makes up 0.21&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than [[sodium]] and [[gallium]], but lower than [[lithium]] and [[tin]]. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and [[thallium]], and it is largely intermediate between the two in terms of its properties.&lt;ref name="Ph.D.Lide2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. M. Haynes|editor=David R. Lide|title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics: A Ready-reference Book of Chemical and Physical Data|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oROqPwAACAAJ|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-2077-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indium was discovered in 1863 by [[Ferdinand Reich]] and [[Hieronymous Theodor Richter]] by [[spectroscope|spectroscopic methods]]. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.

Indium is a minor component in [[zinc sulfide]] ores and is produced as a byproduct of [[zinc]] refinement. It is most notably used in the [[semiconductor industry]], in low-melting-point metal [[alloys]] such as [[Solder#Alloying element roles|solders]], in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and in the production of transparent conductive coatings of [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO) on glass.

Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.

==Properties==

===Physical===
[[File:Indium wetting glass.jpg|thumb|left|Indium wetting the glass surface of a test tube]]
Indium is a silvery-[[white]], highly [[ductile]] [[post-transition metal]] with a bright [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].&lt;ref name="InProcess"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfantazi|first=A. M.|date=2003|title=Processing of indium: a review|journal=Minerals Engineering|volume=16|issue=8|pages=687–694|doi=10.1016/S0892-6875(03)00168-7|author2=Moskalyk, R. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so soft ([[Mohs hardness]] 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper.&lt;ref name="Binder"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binder |first=Harry H. |date=1999 |title=Lexicon der chemischen Elemente |publisher=S. Hirzel Verlag |isbn=978-3-7776-0736-8 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of [[boron group|group 13]] on the [[periodic table]] and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours [[gallium]] and [[thallium]]. Like [[tin]], a high-pitched [[tin cry|cry]] is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to [[crystal twinning]].&lt;ref name="InProcess"/&gt; Like [[gallium]], indium is able to [[wetting|wet]] glass. Like both, indium has a low [[melting point]], 156.60&amp;nbsp;°C (313.88&amp;nbsp;°F); higher than its lighter homologue, [[gallium]], but lower than its heavier homologue, [[thallium]], and lower than [[tin]].&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=John A.  |title=Lange's handbook of chemistry (Fifteenth edition) |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc.|date=523|isbn=978-0-07-016190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling point is 2072&amp;nbsp;°C (3762&amp;nbsp;°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of indium, 7.31&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the [[critical temperature]], 3.41&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], indium becomes a [[superconductor]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], indium crystallizes in the face-centered [[tetragonal crystal system]] in the [[space group]] ''I''4/''mmm'' ([[lattice parameter]]s:&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;325&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;495&amp;nbsp;pm):&lt;ref name="Lange" /&gt; this is a slightly distorted [[face-centered cubic]] structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324&amp;nbsp;pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref name="Greenwood252"&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However it does have a [[Size effect on structural strength|size effect]] in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100&amp;nbsp;µm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iliev|first=S.

===Chemical===
Indium has 49 electrons, with an electronic configuration of &amp;#91;[[krypton|Kr]]&amp;#93;4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In compounds, indium most commonly donates the three outermost electrons to become indium(III), In&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.  In some cases, the pair of 5s-electrons are not donated, resulting in indium(I), In&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The stabilization of the [[valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] state is attributed to the [[inert pair effect]], in which [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] stabilize the 5s-orbital, observed in heavier elements.  Thallium (indium's heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]]) shows an even stronger effect, causing [[Redox|oxidation]] to thallium(I) to be more probable than to thallium(III),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 892–893|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|author2 = Wiberg, Egon |author3 = Wiberg, Nils|chapter =Thallium|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas gallium (indium's lighter homolog) commonly shows only the +3 oxidation state. Thus, although thallium(III) is a moderately strong [[oxidizing agent]], indium(III) is not, and many indium(I) compounds are powerful [[reducing agent]]s.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the energy required to include the s-electrons in chemical bonding is lowest for indium among the group 13 metals, bond energies decrease down the group so that by indium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 5s-electrons.&lt;ref name=Greenwood256&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Indium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and indium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic.&lt;ref name=Greenwood256/&gt;

A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reaction under study,&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible92nd|page=8.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are reported for indium, reflecting the decreased stability of the +3 oxidation state:&lt;ref name=Greenwood252/&gt;

Indium metal does not react with water, but it is oxidized by stronger oxidizing agents such as [[halogen]]s to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a [[boride]], [[silicide]], or [[carbide]], and the hydride [[Indium trihydride|InH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] has at best a transitory existence in [[ether]]eal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt; Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight [[amphoteric]] characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood255&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of indium}}
Indium has 39 known isotopes, ranging in [[mass number]] from 97 to 135. Only two isotopes occur naturally as [[primordial nuclide]]s: indium-113, the only stable isotope, and indium-115, which has a half-life of 4.41{{e|14}} years, four orders of magnitude greater than the age of the universe and nearly 30,000 times greater than that of [[Isotopes of thorium|natural thorium]].&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–128 | date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.8504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-life of &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;In is very long because the beta decay to &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;[[tin|Sn]] is [[selection rule|spin-forbidden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dvornický |first=R. |last2=Šimkovic |first2=F. |date=13–16 June 2011 |title=Second unique forbidden β decay of &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;In and neutrino mass |journal=AIP Conf. Proc. |volume=1417 |issue=33 |pages=33 |doi=10.1063/1.3671032|series=AIP Conference Proceedings }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indium-115 makes up 95.7% of all indium.  Indium is one of three known elements (the others being [[tellurium]] and [[rhenium]]) of which the stable isotope is less abundant in nature than the long-lived primordial radioisotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciaaw.org/pubs/Periodic_Table_Isotopes.pdf |title=IUPAC Periodic Table of the Isotopes |date=1 October 2013 |website=ciaaw.org |publisher=[[IUPAC]] |access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stablest [[synthetic radioisotope|artificial]] isotope is indium-111, with a half-life of approximately 2.8&amp;nbsp;days. All other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 5 hours. Indium also has 47 meta states, among which indium-114m1 (half-life about 49.51&amp;nbsp;days) is the most stable, more stable than the ground state of any indium isotope other than the primordial.  All decay by [[isomeric transition]]. The indium isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;In predominantly decay through [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]] to form [[cadmium]] isotopes, while the other indium isotopes from &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;In and greater predominantly decay through [[beta-minus decay]] to form tin isotopes.&lt;ref name=Audi/&gt;

===Indium(III)===
[[File:Kristallstruktur Chrom(III)-chlorid.png|thumb|right|upright=1|[[Indium trichloride|InCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] ''(structure pictured)'' is a common compound of indium.]]
[[Indium(III) oxide]], In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, forms when indium metal is burned in air or when the hydroxide or nitrate is heated.&lt;ref name="downs"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Chemistry of aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium| author = Anthony John Downs| publisher = Springer| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-7514-0103-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a structure like [[alumina]] and is amphoteric, that is able to react with both acids and bases. Indium reacts with water to reproduce soluble [[indium(III) hydroxide]], which is also amphoteric; with alkalis to produce indates(III); and with acids to produce indium(III) salts:

:In(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3&amp;nbsp;HCl  →  InCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The analogous sesquichalcogenides with [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], and [[tellurium]] are also known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood286&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Indium forms the expected [[indium halides|trihalides]]. Chlorination, bromination, and iodination of In produce colorless [[indium(III) chloride|InCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[indium(III) bromide|InBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and yellow InI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s, somewhat akin to the better known aluminium trihalides.  Again like the related aluminium compound, InF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is polymeric.&lt;ref name=Greenwood263&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 263–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct reaction of indium with the [[pnictogen]]s produces the gray or semimetallic III–V [[semiconductor]]s. Many of them slowly decompose in moist air, necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent contact with the atmosphere. Indium nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis.&lt;ref name=Greenwood288&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indium(I)===
Indium(I) compounds are not common. The chloride, [[indium(I) bromide|bromide]], and iodide are deeply colored, unlike the parent trihalides from which they are prepared. The fluoride is known only as an unstable gaseous compound.&lt;ref name=Greenwood270&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 270–1&lt;/ref&gt; Indium(I) oxide black powder is produced when indium(III) oxide decomposes upon heating to 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=downs/&gt;

===Other oxidation states===
Less frequently, indium forms compounds in oxidation state +2 and even fractional oxidation states.  Usually such materials feature In–In bonding, most notably in the [[indium halides|halides]] In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="can82"&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1139/v82-102| title =Neutral complexes of the indium dihalides| date =1982| last1 =Sinclair| first1 =Ian| last2 =Worrall| first2 =Ian J.| journal =Canadian Journal of Chemistry| volume =60| issue =6| pages =695–698}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various subchalcogenides such as In&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood287&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Several other compounds are known to combine indium(I) and indium(III), such as In&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(In&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1002/anie.199108241 |title = In7Cl9—A New"Old" Compound in the System In-Cl |date = 1991 |last1 = Beck |first1 = Horst Philipp |last2 = Wilhelm |first2 = Doris |journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English |volume = 30 |issue = 7 |pages = 824–825}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(In&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(In&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1002/anie.199511261| title =Synthesis, Structure, and Decay of In4Br7| date =1995| last1 =Dronskowski| first1 =Richard| journal =Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English| volume =34| issue =10| pages =1126–1128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;In&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="can82"/&gt;

==History==
In 1863, the German chemists [[Ferdinand Reich]] and [[Hieronymous Theodor Richter]] were testing ores from the mines around [[Freiberg, Saxony]]. They dissolved the minerals [[pyrite]], [[arsenopyrite]], [[galena]] and [[sphalerite]] in [[hydrochloric acid]] and distilled raw [[zinc chloride]]. Reich, who was [[color-blind]], employed Richter as an assistant for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain [[thallium]], they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals.

==Occurrence==
[[File:S-process-elem-Ag-to-Sb.svg|thumb|right|400 px|alt=yellow squares with red and blue arrows|The s-process acting in the range from [[silver]] to [[antimony]]]]
Indium is created by the long-lasting (up to thousands of years) [[s-process]] (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 [[solar mass]]es). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a [[beta decay]] to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another [[beta decay]]. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A. I. | last= Boothroyd| title = Heavy elements in stars| journal= Science| volume= 314 | issue= 5806| date= 2006 | pages= 1690–1691 | doi= 10.1126/science.1136842 | pmid = 17170281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stable indium isotope, indium-113, is one of the [[p-nuclei]], the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and [[r-process]]es (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight [[quadrillion]] years, this cannot account for all indium-113.&lt;ref name="s-contrib"&gt;C.

Indium is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|68th most abundant element in Earth's crust]] at approximately 50 [[parts per billion|ppb]]. This is similar to the crustal abundance of [[silver]], [[bismuth]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. It very rarely forms its own minerals, or occurs in elemental form.

==Production and availability==

Indium is produced exclusively as a [[by-product]] during the processing of the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the [[Zinc smelting|roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting]], indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood247&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.&lt;ref name="InProcess"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Its by-product status means that indium production is constrained by the amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials ''per year'' under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenzel|first=Max|last2=Tolosana-Delgado|first2=Raimon|last3=Gutzmer|first3=Jens|date=December 2015|title=Assessing the supply potential of high-tech metals – A general method|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420715000781|journal=Resources Policy|volume=46, Part 2|pages=45–58|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2015.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they ''cannot'' be extracted independently from the main-products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/indium/mcs-2017-indiu.pdf|title=Indium - in: USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries|last=|first=|publisher=United States Geological Survey|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price.

China is a leading producer of indium (290 tonnes in 2016), followed by South Korea (195 t), Japan (70 t) and Canada (65 t).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Teck Resources]] refinery in [[Trail, British Columbia]], is a large single-source indium producer, with an output of 32.5&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2005, 41.8&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2004 and 36.1&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2003.

The primary consumption of indium worldwide is [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] production. Demand rose rapidly from the late 1990s to 2010 with the popularity of LCD computer monitors and television sets, which now account for 50% of indium consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Indium Price Supported by LCD Demand and New Uses for the Metal|work = Geology.com|format = PDF|url = http://geology.com/articles/indium.shtml|accessdate = 2007-12-26|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071221130320/http://geology.com/articles/indium.shtml|archive-date = 2007-12-21|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="919">A '''local distribution company''', or '''LDC''', is a [[distribution company]] that maintains the portion of the utility supply grid that is closest to the residential and small commercial consumer. There are many alternative terms depending on the type of utility and its location; in Ontario, Canada, the term is used for both the [[electrical grid]] and [[natural gas]] supply, while within the UK's [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] they are known as [[distribution network operator]]s (DNOs).

LDCs normally buy their power from larger companies, sometimes ones dedicated solely to wholesale supply. They re-sell it to the smaller customer. Larger customers typically buy their power directly from the wholesaler, and do not use the LDC.

{{Context|date=October 2009}}

'''Low-temperature thermal desorption''' ('''LTTD'''), also known as '''low-temperature thermal volatilization''', '''thermal stripping''', and '''soil roasting''', is an [[ex-situ]] [[remedial technology]] that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. Thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose [[Soil organic matter|organic]] constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and the temperature of the desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially [[decompose]]. The vaporized [[hydrocarbon]]s are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an [[afterburner]], catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.

Some preprocessing and postprocessing of soil is necessary when using LTTD. Excavated soils are first screened to remove large (greater than 2&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter) objects. These may be sized (e.g., crushed or shredded) and then introduced back into the feed material. After leaving the desorber, soils are cooled, re-moistened to control dust, and stabilized (if necessary) to prepare them for disposal or reuse. Treated soil may be redeposited onsite, used as cover in [[landfills]], or incorporated into asphalt.

==Application==
LTTD has proven very effective in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including [[gasoline]], [[jet fuel]]s, [[kerosene]], [[diesel fuel]], [[heating oil]]s, and [[lubricating oil]]s. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°F. Most [[desorber]]s operate at temperatures between 300&amp;nbsp;°F to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°F. Desorbers constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°F. More volatile products (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. kerosene, diesel fuel) generally need temperatures over 700&amp;nbsp;°F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. [[gravel]] and [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]]) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. [[clay]]) may require shredding.

State and local [[regulation]]s specify that [[petroleum]]-contaminated [[soil]]s must be [[pilot test]]ed, by some soil from the site being processed through the LTTD system (a "test burn"). The results of preliminary testing of soil samples should identify the relevant constituent properties, and examination of the machine's performance records should indicate how effective the system will be in treating the soil. However, it should be noted that the proven effectiveness of a particular system for a specific site or waste does not ensure that it will be effective at all sites or that the treatment efficiencies achieved will be acceptable at other sites. If a test burn is conducted, it is important to ensure that the soil tested is representative of average conditions and that enough samples are analyzed before and after treatment to confidently determine whether LTTD will be effective.

Operation of LTTD units requires various permits and demonstration of compliance with permit requirements. Monitoring requirements for LTTD systems are by their nature different from monitoring required at a UST site. Monitoring of LTTD system waste streams (e.g. concentrations of [[particulate]]s, [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]]s, and [[carbon monoxide]] in [[stack gas]]) are required by the [[government agency|agency]] or agencies issuing the [[License|permits]] for operation of the facility. The LTTD facility owner/operator is responsible for complying with limits specified by the permits and for other LTTD system operating parameters (e.g. desorber temperature, soil feed rate, afterburner temperature).

The decision as to whether or not LTTD is a practical remedial alternative depends upon site-specific characteristics (e.g. the location and volume of contaminated soils, site layout). Practicability is also determined by regulatory, [[logistical]], and [[economic]] considerations. The economics of LTTD as a remedial option are highly site-specific. Economic factors include:-
* Site usage (because [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] and onsite soil treatment at a [[retail site]] (e.g. [[gasoline station]], [[convenience store]]) will most likely prevent the [[business]] from operating for a longish time).
* The cost of LTTD per unit volume of soil relative to other remedial options.
* The location of the nearest applicable LTTD system (because transportation costs are a function of distance).

==Operation principles==
Thermal desorption systems fall into two general classes—stationary facilities and mobile units. Contaminated soils are excavated and transported to stationary facilities; mobile units can be operated directly onsite. Desorption units are available in a variety of process configurations including rotary desorbers, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, thermal screws, and [[conveyor]] [[furnace]]s.

The plasticity of the soil is a measure of its ability to deform without shearing and is to some extent a function of water content. Plastic soils tend to stick to screens and other equipment, and agglomerate into large clumps. In addition to slowing down the feed rate, plastic soils are difficult to treat. Heating plastic soils requires higher temperatures because of the low surface area to volume ratio and increased moisture content. Also, because plastic soils tend to be very fine-grained, [[organic compound]]s tend to be tightly [[sorption|sorbed]]. Thermal treatment of highly plastic soils requires pretreatment, such as shredding or blending with more friable soils or other amendments (e.g. [[gypsum]]).

Material larger than 2&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter will need to be crushed or removed. Crushed material is recycled back into the feed to be processed. Coarser-grained soils tend to be free-flowing and do not agglomerate into clumps. They typically do not retain excessive moisture, therefore, contaminants are easily desorbed. Finer-grained soils tend to retain soil moisture and agglomerate into clumps. When dry, they may yield large amounts of particulates that may require recycling after being intercepted in the baghouse.

The solids processing capacity of a thermal desorption system is inversely proportional to the moisture content of the feed material. The presence of moisture in the excavated soils to be treated in the LTTD unit will determine the residence time required and heating requirements for effective removal of contaminants. In order for desorption of petroleum constituents to occur, most of the soil moisture must be evaporated in the desorber. This process can require significant additional thermal input to the desorber and excessive residence time for the soil in the desorber. Moisture content also influences plasticity which affects handling of the soil. Soils with excessive moisture content (&gt; 20%) must be dewatered. Typical dewatering methods include air drying (if storage space is available to spread the soils), mixing with drier soils, or mechanical dewatering.

The presence of metals in soil can have two implications:
* Limitations on disposal of the solid wastes generated by desorption.
* Attention to air pollution control regulations that limit the amount of metals that may be released in stack emissions.
At normal LTTD [[operating temperature]]s, heavy metals are not likely to be significantly separated from soils.

High concentrations of petroleum products in soil can result in high soil heating values. Heat released from soils can result in overheating and damage to the desorber. Soils with heating values greater than 2,000 Btu/lb require blending with cleaner soils to dilute the high concentration of hydrocarbons. High hydrocarbon concentrations in the offgas may exceed the thermal capacity of the afterburner and potentially result in the release of untreated vapors into the atmosphere. Excessive constituent levels in soil could also potentially result in the generation of vapors in the desorber at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit (LEL). If the LEL is exceeded there is a potential for explosion.

== System design ==
The term "thermal desorber" describes the primary treatment operation that heats petroleum-contaminated materials and desorbs organic materials into a purge gas. Mechanical design features and process operating conditions vary considerably among the various types of LTTD systems. Desorption units are: available in four configurations:
# Rotary dryer
# Asphalt plant aggregate dryer
# Thermal screw
# Conveyor furnace

Although all LTTD systems use heat to separate (desorb) organic contaminants from the soil matrix, each system has a different configuration with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The decision to use one system over another depends on the nature of the contaminants as well as machine availability, system performance, and economic considerations. System performance may be evaluated on the basis of pilot tests (e.g., test burns) or examination of historical machine performance records. Pilot tests to develop treatment conditions are generally not necessary for petroleum-contaminated soils.

=== Rotary dryer ===
Rotary dryer systems use a cylindrical metal reactor (drum) that is inclined slightly from the horizontal. A burner located at one end provides heat to raise the temperature of the soil sufficiently to desorb organic contaminants. The flow of soil may be either cocurrent with or countercurrent to the direction of the purge gas flow. As the drum rotates, soil is conveyed through the drum. Lifters raise the soil, carrying it to near the top of the drum before allowing it to fall through the heated purge gas. Mixing in a rotary dryer enhances heat transfer by convection and allow soils to be rapidly heated. Rotary desorber units are manufactured for a wide range of treatment capacities; these units may be either stationary or mobile.

The maximum soil temperature that can be obtained in a rotary dryer depends on the composition of the dryer shell. The soil discharge temperature of carbon steel drums is typically 300 to 600 degrees F. Alloy drums are available that can increase the soil discharge temperature to 1,200 degrees F. Most rotary dryers that are used to treat petroleum contaminated soil are made of carbon steel. After the treated soil exits the rotary dryer, it enters a cooling conveyor where water is sprayed on the soil for cooling and dust control. Water addition may be conducted in either a screw conveyor or a pugmill.

Besides the direction of purge gas flow relative to soil feed direction, there is one major difference in configuration between countercurrent and cocurrent rotary dryers. The purge gas from a countercurrent rotary dryer is typically only 350&amp;nbsp;°F to 500&amp;nbsp;°F and does not require cooling before entering the baghouse where fine particles are trapped. A disadvantage is that these particles may not have been decontaminated and are typically recycled to the dryer. Countercurrent dryers have several advantages over cocurrent systems. They are more efficient in transferring heat from purge gas to contaminated soil, and the volume and temperature of exit gas are lower, allowing the gas to go directly to a baghouse without needing to be cooled. The cooler exit gas temperature and smaller volume eliminates the need for a cooling unit, which allows [[downstream processing]] equipment to be smaller. Countercurrent systems are effective on petroleum products with molecular weights lower than No.2 fuel oil.

In cocurrent systems, the purge gas is 50&amp;nbsp;°F to 100&amp;nbsp;°F hotter than the soil discharge temperature. The result is that the purge gas exit temperature may range from 400&amp;nbsp;°F to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. Purge gas first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the purge gas, the baghouse and all other [[downstream processing]] equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated purge gas is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.

=== Asphalt plant aggregate dryer ===
Hot-mix asphalt plants use aggregate that has been processed in a dryer before it is mixed with liquid asphalt. The use of petroleum contaminated soils for aggregate material is widespread. Aggregate dryers may either be stationary or mobile. Soil treatment capacities range from 25-150 tons per hour. The soil may be incorporated into the asphalt as a recycling process or the treated soil may be used for other purposes.

Asphalt rotary dryers are normally constructed of carbon steel and have a soil discharge temperature of 300&amp;nbsp;°F to 600&amp;nbsp;°F. Typically, asphalt plant aggregate dryers are identical to the countercurrent rotary desorbers described above and are effective on the same types of contaminants. The primary difference is that an afterburner is not required for incorporation of clean aggregate into the asphalt mix. In some areas, asphalt plants that use petroleum-contaminated soil for aggregate may be required to be equipped with an afterburner.

=== Thermal screw ===
A thermal screw desorber typically consists of a series of 1-4 augers. The auger system conveys, mixes, and heats contaminated soils to volatilize moisture and organic contaminants into a purge gas stream. Augers can be arranged in series to increase the soil residence time, or they can be configured in parallel to increase throughput capacity. Most thermal screw systems circulate a hot [[heat-transfer oil]] through the hollow flights of the auger and return the hot oil through the shaft to the heat transfer fluid heating system. The heated oil is also circulated through the jacketed trough in which each auger rotates. Thermal screws can also be steam-heated. Systems heated with oil can achieve soil temperatures of up to 500&amp;nbsp;°F, and steam-heated systems can heat soil to approximately 350 °F.

Most of the gas generated during heating of the heat-transfer oil does not come into contact the waste material and can be discharged directly to the atmosphere without emission controls. The remainder of the [[flue gas]] maintains the thermal screw purge gas exit temperature above 300 degrees F. This ensures that volatilized organics and moisture do not condense. In addition, the recycled [[flue gas]] has a low oxygen content (less than 2% by volume) which minimizes oxidation of the organics and reduces the explosion hazard. If pretreatment analytical data indicates a high organic content (greater than 4 percent), use of a thermal screw is recommended. After the treated soil exits the thermal screw, water is sprayed on the soil for cooling and dust control. Thermal screws are available with soil treatment capacities ranging from 3-15 tons per hour.

Since thermal screws are indirectly heated, the volume of purge gas from the primary thermal treatment unit is less than one half of the volume from a directly heated system with an equivalent soil processing capacity. Therefore, offgas treatment systems consist of relatively small unit operations that are well suited to mobile applications. Indirect heating also allows thermal screws to process materials with high organic contents since the recycled flue gas is inert, thereby reducing the explosion hazard.

=== Conveyor furnace ===
A conveyor furnace uses a flexible metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread evenly over the belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The conveyor furnace can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the conveyor furnace is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the treated soil exits the conveyor furnace, it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control. As of February 1993, only one conveyor furnace system was currently in use for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soil. This system is mobile and can treat 5 to 10 tons of soil per hour.

==Offgas treatment==
Offgas treatment systems for LTTD systems are designed to address three types of air pollutants: particulates, organic vapors, and carbon monoxide. Particulates are controlled with both wet (e.g., venturi scrubbers) and dry (e.g., cyclones, baghouses) unit operations. Rotary dryers and asphalt aggregate dryers most commonly use dry gas cleaning unit operations. Cyclones are used to capture large particulates and reduce the particulate load to the baghouse. Baghouses are used as the final particulate control device. Thermal screw systems typically use a venturi scrubber as the primary particulate control.

The control of organic vapors is achieved by either destruction or collection. Afterburners are used downstream of rotary dryers and conveyor furnaces to destroy organic contaminants and oxidize carbon monoxide. Conventional afterburners are designed so that exit gas temperatures reach 1,400&amp;nbsp;°F to 1,600 °F. Organic destruction efficiency typically ranges from 95% to greater than 99%.

Condensers and activated carbon may also be used to treat the offgas from thermal screw systems. Condensers may be either water-cooled or electrically cooled systems to decrease offgas temperatures to 100&amp;nbsp;°F to 140&amp;nbsp;°F. The efficiency of condensers for removing organic compounds ranges from 50% to greater than 95%. Noncondensible gases exiting the condenser are normally treated by a vapor-phase activated carbon treatment system. The efficiency of activated carbon adsorption systems for removing organic contaminants ranges from 50% to 99%. Condensate from the condenser is processed through a phase separator where the non-aqueous phase organic component is separated and disposed of or recycled. The remaining water is then processed through activated carbon and used to rehumidify treated soil.

Treatment temperature is a key parameter affecting the degree of treatment of organic components. The required treatment temperature depends upon the specific types of petroleum contamination in the soil. The actual temperature achieved by an LTTD system is a function of the moisture content and heat capacity of the soil, soil particle size, and the heat transfer and mixing characteristics of the thermal desorber.

Residence time is a key parameter affecting the degree to which decontamination is achievable. Residence time depends upon the design and operation of the system, characteristics of the contaminants and the soil, and the degree of treatment required.

'''Magna Steyr AG &amp; Co KG ''' is an [[automobile]] manufacturer based in [[Graz]], Austria, where its primary manufacturing plant is also located. It is a subsidiary of Canadian-based [[Magna International]] and was previously part of the [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] conglomerate.

Magna Steyr engineers, develops and assembles automobiles for other companies on a contractual basis; therefore, ''Magna Steyr'' is not an automobile [[marque]].  In 2002, the company absorbed [[Daimler AG]]'s Eurostar vehicle assembly facility. With an annual production capacity of approximately 200,000 vehicles as of 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/2017/10/17/press-release---magna-to-build-new-paint-line-in-slovenia-to-support-graz-vehicle-production|title=Magna to Build New Paint Line in Slovenia to Support Graz Vehicle Production|last=|first=|date=17 October 2017|website=Magna International|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the largest contract manufacturer for automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cee.siemens.com/web/austria/en/corporate_en/portal/success_en/Pages/NeueTelekomwelt_en.aspx|title=New World of Telecommunications|publisher=[[Siemens]]|year=2008|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has several manufacturing sites, with its main car production in [[Graz]] in Austria.

Magna Steyr developed [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s "[[4Matic]]" [[four-wheel drive]] (4wd) system, and assembles all [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]] 4Matic models.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The company also undertook substantial development on the [[BMW X3]] and manufactured all original X3s (model code E83), and the [[Aston Martin Rapide]]. The company developed several cars on behalf of manufacturers such as the [[Audi TT]], [[Fiat Bravo (2007)|Fiat Bravo]] and [[Peugeot RCZ]].

==History==
Magna Steyr AG &amp; Co KG was founded in 2001 after Magna International Inc. acquired a majority shareholding in [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG]] three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magna.com/xchg/complete_vehicle/XSL/standard.xsl/-/content/148_1867.htm]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second quarter of 2015, the Magna Steyr battery pack business was sold to [[Samsung SDI]] for approximately $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Press Release – Magna Announces Second Quarter and Year to Date Results | url = http://www.magna.com/investors/press-releases-news/news-page/2015/08/07/press-release---magna-announces-second-quarter-and-year-to-date-results | work = Magna International website | date = August 7, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mangahao Power Station''' is a hydroelectric power station near the town of [[Shannon, New Zealand|Shannon]], [[New Zealand]]. After being delayed by [[World War I|war]], access road construction and foundation testing was started by late 1919 and the station opened in November 1924.&lt;ref name="ipenz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangahao Power Station|url=http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/itemdetail.cfm?itemid=430|publisher=IPENZ Engineering Heritage|accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mangahao Hydro | publisher = Todd Energy |author= | date = | url = http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/mangahao-hydro | accessdate = 2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of [[Mangahao River]], through a series of tunnels and pipelines totaling 4.8 kilometers, in the Tararua Ranges. Mangahao Power Station became the power station for Wellington, Horowhenua, Taranaki, Hawkes Bay, and the Wairarapa.&lt;ref name="ipenz"/&gt; 
As of 2012, it is jointly owned and operated by Todd Energy and King Country Energy.&lt;ref name="ipenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="todd"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Minol''' (pronounced ''mine-ol'') is a military [[explosive]] developed by the British [[Admiralty]] early in the [[Second World War]] to augment supplies of [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and [[RDX]], which were then in short supply.  The [[aluminium]] component in Minol significantly prolongs the explosive pulse, making it ideal for use in underwater naval weapons (e.g. [[naval mine]]s, for which it was developed, [[depth charge]]s, and [[torpedo]]es) where munitions with a longer explosive pulse are more destructive than those with high [[brisance]].

Minol cannot be used in weapons fired from gun barrels (e.g. [[artillery shell]]s) because there is a risk of [[detonation]] when subjected to over 250 [[g-force|gs]] of acceleration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Typically, four different Minol formulas were used.  All percentages shown are by weight:

* Minol-1: 48% [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], 42% [[ammonium nitrate]], and 10% powdered [[aluminium]].
* Minol-2: 40% TNT, 40% ammonium nitrate, and 20% powdered aluminium.
* Minol-3: 42% TNT, 38% ammonium nitrate, and 20% powdered aluminium.
* Minol-4: 40% TNT, 40% ammonium nitrate &amp; [[potassium nitrate]] (90/10), and 20% powdered aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyars|first1=Carl|title=Minol IV A new explosive|date=March 29, 1973|publisher=Naval Ordnance Library|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/763332.pdf|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, Minol has gradually been superseded by more modern [[polymer bonded explosive|PBX]] compositions, due to their superior explosive yield and stable storage characteristics. As a result, Minol is regarded as [[obsolete]]. Generally, any Minol-filled munitions encountered will be in the form of legacy munitions or [[unexploded ordnance]] dating from before the 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8706">'''Nanophase ceramics''' are [[ceramic]]s that are [[nanophase materials]] (that is, materials that have grain sizes under 100 nanometers).&lt;ref name="Averback 1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a254661.pdf|title=Nanophase Ceramics: Final Report|last=Averback  |first=Robert S.|date=May 21, 1992|publisher=University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceramics.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03_10_cover-story.pdf|title=Nanophase Ceramics for Improved Drug Delivery: Current Opportunities and Challenges|author=Lei Yang|author2=Brian W.

They have the potential for [[superplastic deformation]].&lt;ref name="Averback 1992" /&gt; Because of the small grain size and added grain boundaries properties such as ductility, hardness, and reactivity see drastic changes from ceramics with larger grains.

==Structure of Nanophase Ceramics==
The structure of nanophase ceramics is not too different than that of [[ceramic]]s.  The main difference is the amount of surface area per mass.  Particles of [[ceramic]]s have small surface areas, but when those particles are shrunk to within a few nanometers, the surface area of the same amount of a mass of a [[ceramic]] greatly increases.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale"&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special "What's So Special about the Nanoscale?"]. nano.gov. Retrieved December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  So in general, nanophase materials have greater surface areas than that of a similar mass material at a larger scale.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is important because if the surface area is very large the particles can be in contact with more of their surroundings, which in turn increases the reactivity of the material.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  The reactivity of a material changes the material's [[mechanical properties]] and [[chemical properties]], among many other things.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is especially true in nanophase ceramics.

==Properties of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties than regular [[ceramic]]s due to their improved reactivity.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  Nanophase ceramics exhibit different mechanical properties than their counterpart such as higher [[hardness]], higher [[fracture toughness]], and high [[ductility]].&lt;ref name="Szlufarska"&gt;Szlufarska, Izabela, Nakano, Aiichiro, Vashista, Priya.(August 5, 2005). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5736/911.full "A Crossover in the Mechanical Response of Nanocrystalline Ceramics"] sciencemag.com. Volume 309 pgs. 911-913. Accessed December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These properties are far from [[ceramic]]s which behave as brittle, low ductile materials.

===Titanium Dioxide===
[[File:Strain Rate Sensitivity-page0001.jpg|thumb|Strain rate sensitivity for {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]][[File:Microhardness of titaniumdioxide-page0001.jpg|thumb|Microhardness of {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]
[[Titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|TiO|2}}), has been shown to have increased hardness and ductility at the nanoscale.  In an experiment, grains of [[titanium dioxide]] that had an average size of 12 nanometers were compressed at 1.4 GPa and [[sintered]] at 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;Siegel, R.W.. [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ms.21.080191.003015 "Cluster-Assembled Nanophase Materials"]. ''Annual Review of Materials Science'' (1991) Volume 21, pgs. 559-577.&lt;/ref&gt;   The result was a grain hardness of about 2.2 times greater than that of grains of [[titanium dioxide]] with an average size of 1.3 micrometers at the same temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  In the same experiment, the [[ductility]] of [[titanium dioxide]] was measured.  The [[strain rate]] sensitivity of a 250 nanometer grain of [[titanium dioxide]] was about 0.0175, while a grain with size of about 20 nanometers had a [[strain rate]] sensitivity of approximately .037; a significant increase.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Processing of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics can be processed from atomic, molecular, or bulk precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Gas condensation, [[chemical precipitation]], aerosol reactions, biological templating, [[chemical vapor deposition]], and [[physical vapor deposition]] are techniques used to synthesis nanophase ceramics from molecular or atomic precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;Siegel, Richard W.. [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/79912 "SYNTHESIS, PROPERTIES, AND APPLICATIONS OF NANOPHASE MATERIALS"]. April 1995. Accessed December 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To process nanophase ceramics from bulk precursors, mechanical attrition, [[crystallization]] from the [[amorphous state]], and phase separation are used to create nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Synthesizing nanophase ceramics from atomic or molecular precursors are desired more because a greater control over microscopic aspects of the nanophase ceramic can occur.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;

===Gas Condensation===
[[File:Gas condensation-page0001.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of nanophase ceramics using gas condensation.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]Gas condensation is one way nanophase ceramics are produced.  First, precursor ceramics are evaporated from sources within a gas-condensation chamber.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Then the ceramics are condensed in a gas (dependent on the material being synthesized) and transported via [[convection]] to a liquid-nitrogen filled cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Next, the ceramic powders are scraped off the cold finger and collect in a funnel below the cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  The ceramic powders then become consolidated in a low-pressure compaction device and then in a high-pressure compaction device.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  This all occurs in a vacuum, so no impurities can enter the chamber and affect the results of the nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Applications==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties that make them optimal for a variety of applications.

===Drug Delivery===
Materials used in drug delivery in the past ten years have primarily been [[polymers]]. However, nanotechnology has opened the door for the use of [[ceramic]]s with benefits not previously seen in [[polymers]]. The large surface area to volume ratio of nanophase materials makes it possible for large amounts of drugs to be released over long periods of time. Nanoparticles to be filled with drugs can be easily manipulated in size and composition to allow for increased [[endocytosis]] of drugs into targeted cells and increased dispersion through fenestrations in capillaries. While these benefits all relate to nanoparticles in general (including [[polymers]]), ceramics have other, unique abilities. Unlike [[polymer]]s, slow degradation of ceramics allows for longer release of the drug. [[Polymers]] also tend to swell in liquid which can cause an unwanted burst of drugs. The lack of swelling shown by most ceramics allows for increased control. Ceramics can also be created to match the chemistry of biological cells in the body increasing bioactivity and biocompatibility. Nanophase ceramic drug carriers are also able to target specific cells. This can be done by manufacturing a material to bond to the specific cell or by applying an external magnetic field, attracting the carrier to a specific location.

===Bone Substitution===
Nanophase ceramics have great potential for use in [[orthopedic medicine]]. Bone and [[collagen]] have structures on the nanoscale. Nanomaterials can be manufactured to simulate these structures which is necessary for grafts and implants to successfully adapt to and handle varying stresses. The surface properties of nanophase ceramics is also very important for bone substitution and regeneration. Nanophase ceramics have much rougher surfaces than larger materials and also have increased surface area. This promotes reactivity and absorption of proteins that assist tissue development. Nano-hydroxyapatite is one nanophase ceramic that is used as a bone substitute. Nano grain size increases the bonding, growth, and differentiation of [[osteoblasts]] onto the ceramic. The surfaces of nanophase ceramics can also be modified to be porous allowing [[osteoblasts]] to create bone within the structure. The degradation of the ceramic is also important because the rate can be changed by changing the crystallinity. This way as bone grows the substitute can diminish at a similar rate.

==Education and career==
Keohane received a B.A. in [[Economics]] from Yale University in 1993.  He went on to receive a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government from [[Harvard University]] in 2001. From 2001 to 2007, he was an Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor of Economics at the Yale School of Management.&lt;ref name=edf/&gt; Keohane then became Director of Economic Policy and Analysis and then Chief Economist at Environmental Defense Fund.&lt;ref name=edf/&gt; While there he played "a leading role in helping to shape the group's advocacy on domestic and international climate policy."&lt;ref name=samuelsohn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/46973.html |title=White House hires veteran environmental economist |work=[[Politico]] |author=Darren Samuelsohn  |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an expert on environmental policy, Keohane testified before various committees of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. His testimony included two appearances before the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy|Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Statement of Nathaniel Keohane'' in "Hearing on The American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009" before the United States House Committee on Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment (April 21, 2009), {{cite web|url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg72878/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg72878.pdf |title=GPO Serial No. 111–29 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(45.2 MB)}}, pp. 274–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Statement of Nat Keohane'' in "Hearing on Allowance Allocation Policies in Climate Legislation: Assisting Consumers, Investing in a Clean Energy Future, and Adapting to Climate Change" before the United States House Committee on Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment (June 9, 2009), {{cite web|url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg73749/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg73749.pdf |title=GPO Serial No. 111–44 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.52 MB)}}, pp. 189–98.&lt;/ref&gt; He also submitted a written statement to a [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] hearing on "Policy Options to Prevent Climate Change".&lt;ref&gt;''Statement of Environmental Defense Fund'' in "Hearing on Policy Options to Prevent Climate Change" before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means (September 18, 2008), {{cite web|url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg62201/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg62201.pdf |title=GPO Serial No. 110-98 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(14.87 MB)}}, pp. 208–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 2011 to mid-2012,&lt;ref name=edf/&gt; Keohane served in the Obama Administration as Special Assistant to the President for Energy and Environment in the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] and [[United States Domestic Policy Council|Domestic Policy Council]], where he helped to develop and coordinate administration policy on a wide range of energy and environmental issues.&lt;ref name=samuelsohn/&gt; He rejoined the EDF in September 2012.&lt;ref name=edf/&gt;

The '''National Hardwood Lumber Association''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hardwood]] [[lumber grade|lumber grading]] group. It was founded in 1898&lt;ref name="nhla.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhla.com/ourroles |title=Our Roles |publisher=Nhla.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to standardize the grades for hardwood lumber. Previously, lumber was graded by [[Sawmill|lumber mill]]s on an individual basis, and there was no standardization between mills.&lt;ref name="Agriculture2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=U S Dept of Agriculture|title=The Encyclopedia of Wood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUGSaiTsBAIC&amp;pg=SA5-PA2|accessdate=20 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-60239-057-7|pages=5–1–5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1898 to 1932, the NHLA based its lumber grades on the number and size of visual imperfections in a given piece of lumber. In 1932, it changed its standards to grade based on clear cutting sizes. The grade is determined by "the proportion of a piece that can be cut into a certain number of smaller pieces of material, commonly called cuttings, which are general clear on one side, have the reverse side sound, and are not smaller than a specified size."&lt;ref name="Agriculture2007" /&gt;

==General==
As the creators of North America's commonly used lumber grading system, the NHLA has involved itself heavily in the education and certification of lumber inspectors. It also serves as a tool for communication and promotion for hardwood producers, consumers, and equipment manufacturers.The NHLA advocates for the hardwood industry, provides services and expertise to the industry, and promotes networking between groups interested in the profitable production of hardwood and related products.&lt;ref name="nhla.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lumber&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forest Plywood|title=Hardwood &amp; Softwood Lumber|url=https://forestplywood.com/product/hardwood-softwood/|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training programs==
The NHLA offers a 12-week training program for people interested in becoming a lumber inspector. It also offers continuing education for graduates of the 12-week program or individuals already in the lumber industry who have a firm understanding of the field. In addition to the traditional 12-week course, NHLA now offers the Progressive Program. In an attempt to further its educational reach, the NHLA Inspector Training School is embracing new technology and offering a distance learning ITS Program. The "Progressive Program" is divided into three blocks. Upon successful completion of one block, a student can then progress to the next study block. Block 1 of the Progressive Program requires two weeks of hands-on study at the NHLA Inspector Training School in Memphis, Tenn. Block 2 allows for up to 12 months of online study for memorization and study of required material; and Block 3 Block 3 requires an additional three weeks of classroom study and board runs back at NHLA headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhla.com/education |title=Education |publisher=Nhla.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention==
The NHLA holds an “Annual Convention &amp; Exhibit Showcase” which serves as a focal point for the lumber industry as well as businesses involved in forestry, lumber production and sales, and tool and machinery manufactures’. Visit www.nhlaconvention.com to learn more about the upcoming conventions. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Advocacy==
The NHLA founded the Hardwood Federation to act as a lobby for the hardwood industry in Washington, D.C. and has remained the leading partner of that organization. Their focus is mainly on issues that will affect the production of hardwood and hardwood markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardwoodfederation.wildapricot.org/ |title=Hardwood Federation - Home |publisher=Hardwoodfederation.wildapricot.org |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and advertising==
The NHLA publishes the ''Hardwood Matters'' magazine which serves as the flagship publication for the industry. It offers opportunities for advertising and provides information to trends and changes in the industry to its members. For similar purposes it also publishes a members-only newsletter and has an extensive online job board and website.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

"'''Nucular'''" is a commonly used mispronunciation of the word "[[wikt:nuclear|nuclear]]". While no dictionaries list this particular pronunciation as correct, several make mention of it because of its increased usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/nuclear |title=Nuclear - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=nuclear |title=Nuclear - Definition from the American Heritage Online Dictionary |publisher=Ahdictionary.com |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Notes in dictionaries==

''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' receives enough questions about their mention of this mispronunciation in the dictionary that it is one of two mispronunciations which receive particular mention in their FAQ:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though disapproved of by many, pronunciations ending in \-kyə-lər\ have been found in widespread use among educated speakers, including scientists, lawyers, professors, congressmen, United States cabinet members, and at least two United States presidents and one vice president. While most common in the United States, these pronunciations have also been heard from British and Canadian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/nuclear |title=nuclear - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.m-w.com/help/faq/pronounce.htm
| title = Your pronunciations of "often" and "nuclear" are wrong! How can you say they are correct?
| publisher = Merriam-Webster online
| accessdate = 2006-10-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The pronunciation (noo'kyə-lər), which is generally considered incorrect, is an example of how a familiar phonological pattern can influence an unfamiliar one … [since] much more common is the similar sequence (-kyə-lər), which occurs in words like ''particular'', ''circular'', ''spectacular'', and in many scientific words like ''molecular'', ''ocular'', and ''vascular''.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The colloquial pronunciation British /ˈnjuːkjʊlə/, U.S. /ˈn(j)ukjələr/ (frequently rendered in written form as ''nucular''[...]) has been criticized in usage guides since at least the mid 20th century [...] although it is now commonly given as a variant in modern dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/128926 nuclear, adj. (and adv.) and n.]". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. Accessed 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Oxford English Dictionary''{{'}}s entry for ''nucular'', representing the colloquial pronunciation, dates the first published appearance of the word to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/258266 nucular, adj.2]". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. Accessed 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Big Book Of Beastly Mispronunciations'', logophile [[Charles Harrington Elster]] noted that the vast majority of those he spoke with during the writing of his book as well as 99 percent of the 1985 [[Survey panel|usage panel]] of Morris &amp; Morris' ''Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage'' specifically condemned the use of the word and characterized it as a mispronunciation. Elster's own view on the matter derives from the root of the word: "''nucleus''". [[Argument by analogy|Arguing by analogy]], Elster suggests that "''Molecular'' comes from ''molecule'', and ''particular'' comes from ''particle'', but there is no ''nucule'' to support ''nucular''."&lt;ref name=elster&gt;[[Charles Harrington Elster|Elster, Charles Harrington]]. ''The Big Book Of Beastly Mispronunciations: The Complete Opinionated Guide for the Careful Speaker''. Houghton Mifflin. Pp.347-350. {{ISBN|978-0-618-42315-6}}. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.pbs.org/speak/speech/beastly/#Nuclear Do you Speak American?]'' [[PBS]]. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable users==
U.S. presidents who have used this pronunciation include [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2002/09/why_does_bush_go_nucular.html|newspaper=Slate|title=Why Does Bush Go "Nucular"?|author=Kate Taylor|date=18 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as U.S. Vice President [[Walter Mondale]].&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. ''Pinker contra Nunberg re nuclear/nucular''. LanguageLog. http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=730&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 2005 book, ''Going Nucular'', linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] suggests that the reasons underlying the differing pronunciations of this word may be different from president to president. Whereas Eisenhower's pronunciation most likely arose from his lack of familiarity with the word (having first learned it in mid-life), Bush's usage may represent a calculated effort to appeal to [[Populism|populist]] sentiment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Nunberg|Nunberg, Geoffrey]]. ''Going Nucular: Language, Politics. and Culture in Confrontational Times''. PublicAffairs. Pp.297-298. {{ISBN|1586483455}}. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; though this theory is rejected by linguist [[Steven Pinker]].&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt; This analysis is repeated in the second edition of Charles Harrington Elster's ''The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations''.&lt;ref name=elster/&gt;

Oxford Professor [[Marcus du Sautoy]] was heard to use it in a BBC documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] documentary, "Faster Than the Speed of Light"&lt;/ref&gt; The actor and narrator [[Orson Welles]] said "nucular" while speaking at the 1982 "No Nukes" rally in New York City's Central Park.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Edward Teller]], "father" of the American [[hydrogen bomb]], supposedly used this particular pronunciation, and this usage is a limited tradition within the American nuclear research establishment.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A|title=Physics for Future Presidents: The Science behind the Headlines|year=2008|publisher=W.W.

== In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=November 2017}}
In Woody Allen's 1989 film ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', [[Mia Farrow]]'s character says she could never fall for any man who says "nucular".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunberg |first=Geoffrey |url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/nucular.html |title=Going Nucular |date=October 2, 2002 |accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation was satirized in the 1996 science fiction film ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''. Later, the pronunciation was utilized earnestly by the titular character in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' after Indiana survives an atomic bomb test by crawling inside a lead-lined refrigerator. This pronunciation was also used in the 2012 animated family film ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95Kp3eL83qM |title=Nucular |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Don Delillo]]'s 1997 novel [[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|''Underworld'']], Marvin mentions nuclear weapons and it is said "He pronounced it nucular".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug3ArDMHLnQC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=don+delillo+underworld+%22he+pronounced+it+nucular%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fWmPL0yWXa&amp;sig=CDzE5_KRaHyGCXA6rXZtJc6khXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI37WhuMHvxgIVizOICh03lgRe#v=onepage&amp;q=don%20delillo%20underworld%20%22he%20pronounced%20it%20nucular%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer Simpson]] (a nuclear power plant employee) of the popular American animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoASZyihalc |title=Nucular |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Griffin]] of the animated comedy series ''[[Family Guy]]'' both pronounce nuclear this way (during the episode "Da Boom", Peter 'corrects' [[Lois Griffin]]'s correct pronunciation of the word).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'S' is silent.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV6X73bGKD0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game ''[[Starcraft II]]'', the Ghost exclaims ''"Nucular launch detected"'' if he is clicked on repeatedly.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

In ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'', the President, in a clear parody of [[George W. Bush]], says "nucular", only for the exasperated Chief of CONTROL to loudly correct him.

In the 2012 Film [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]] Skipper corrects Gloria's correct pronunciation of the word 'nuclear' with ''nucular''

==Motivation==
[[Steven Pinker]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pinker |first=Steven |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2008_Palin_language.html |title=Everything You Heard Is Wrong |date=Oct 4, 2008 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[phonotactic]] explanation for the conversion of ''nuclear'' to ''nucular'': the unusual and disfavored sequence {{IPA|[kli.ər]}} is gradually transformed to a more acceptable configuration via [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  However, [[Arnold Zwicky]] notes that {{IPA|[kli.ər]}} presents no difficulty for English speakers in words such as ''pricklier''.  He also regards the proposition of metathesis as [[Occam's razor|unnecessary]].  Zwicky suggests a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] origin, combining the slang ''[[wikt:nuke|nuke]]'' with the common sequence ''-cular'' (''molecular'', ''particular'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zwicky |first=Arnold |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001999.html |title=Axe a stupid question |date=March 21, 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting Zwicky's hypothesis, [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] quotes a government weapons specialist: "Oh, I only say 'nucular' when I'm talking about nukes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunberg |first=Geoffrey |url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/nucular.html |title=Going Nucular |date=October 2, 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nunberg argues that this pronunciation by weapons specialists and by politicians such as Bush – who are aware of the correct pronunciation – may be a "deliberate choice". He suggests that the reasons for this choice are to "assert authority" or to sound folksy.

'''Oxinium''' is the brand name of a material used for [[replacement joint]]s manufactured by the reconstructive [[orthopedic surgery]] division of medical devices company [[Smith &amp; Nephew]]. It consists of a [[zirconium]] [[alloy]] metal substrate that transitions into a ceramic zirconium oxide outer surface.

The ceramic surface is extremely abrasion resistant compared to traditional metal implant materials such as [[Vitallium|cobalt chromium]]. It also has a lower coefficient of friction against ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ([[UHMWPE]]), the typical counterface material used in total joint replacements. These two factors likely contribute to the significantly lower UHMWPE wear rates observed in simulator testing. Reducing UHMWPE wear is thought to decrease the risk of implant failure due to [[osteolysis]]. All-ceramic materials can have a similar effect on reducing wear, but are brittle and difficult to manufacture. The metal substrate of Oxinium implants makes components easier to manufacture and gives them greater toughness (a combination of strength and ductility). In essence, this technology combines the abrasion resistance and low friction of a ceramic with the workability and toughness of a metal.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

This combination of properties led to Oxinium technology being the first ever implant-related technology to win the prestigious [[ASM International (society)|ASM International]] Engineering Materials Achievement Award (EMAA) in 2005.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

Current competitive reduced-wear options in [[hip replacement|total hip arthroplasty]] (THA) are [[ceramic]]-on-ceramic, [[metal]]-on-metal, and metal-on-cross-linked [[polyethylene]]. The only competitive reduced-wear option for [[knee replacement|total knee arthroplasty]] (TKA) is metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene.

In September 2003, Smith &amp; Nephew recalled its Macrotextured Oxinium Profix and Genesis II knee implants because of reports that 30 people receiving the implants without bone cement had to undergo a replacement surgery after they became loose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1044180,00.html Knee implant recall hits Smith &amp; Nephew], [[The Guardian]], [September 18, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''para''-Diethynylbenzene dianion''' is the third strongest base ever synthesized. It is an [[isomer]] of ''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion, as well as of ''meta''-diethynylbenzene dianion.

Each of the [[ethynyl group]]s in ''Para''-diethynylbenzene dianion has a negative charge. ''Para''-diethynylbenzene dianion has no known use yet. It has two isomers: [[Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion|''Meta-''diethynylbenzene dianion]] and [[Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion|''Ortho-''diethynylbenzene dianion]] All of these isomers including ''Para-''diethynylbenzene dianion exist in the gas phase, contrary to the normal bases (such as the [[hydroxide]] anion) which exists in the solution state.

== Synthesis ==
;Step 1: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;is the parent compound. In the next step, the parent compound is ionized (i.e., the two hydrogen atoms from the two carboxylic acid groups (which is attached to the carbon atom of the [[ethyne]] group, while the ethyne group is further attached to the [[benzene]] group)).

;Step 2: The ionized parent compound [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is subjected to collisional activation, because of which, one of the [[carboxylate]] anion loses a [[carbon dioxide]] molecule.

;Step 3: The ionized parent compound is again subjected to collisional activation, because of which, the other carboxylate anion loses the other carbon dioxide molecule.

;Step 4: Therefore, the ''Para-''diethynylbenzene dianion  '''[C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;''' is formed, having lost, in total, 2 Hydrogen atoms and 2 molecules of Carbon dioxide.

This is the reaction through which the researchers in Australia created the super base.

=== Summary of the reaction ===
: &lt;chem&gt;C6H4(C3HO2)2 -&gt; {[C6H4(C3O2)2]}^{2-} -&gt; {[C6H4(C5O2)]}^{2-} -&gt; {[C6H4(C2)2]}^{2-}&lt;/chem&gt;

Although the process of synthesizing the Para-diethynylbenzene dianion is the same as the process of synthesizing Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, the only difference is that the parent compound [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]  is a different isomer, different than that of Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion.

[[Image:Pineapple pit heligan.jpg|thumb|right|Close up of a pineapple inside the pineapple pit at the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]], Cornwall, UK]]

A '''pineapple pit''' is a method of growing [[pineapple]]s in colder climates.  
This method of cultivation was invented by gardeners in the UK, during the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lost Gardens of Heligan Handbook, 2002 Updated 2007, copyright Heligan Gardens Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of cultivation==
The pineapple pit consisted of three trenches covered with glass, slightly below ground level, connected with two cavity walls.  The outer troughs were kept filled with 15 tonnes of fresh horse manure, which gave off heat as it decomposed.  This heat passed through small gaps at the bottom of the wall, rose up, and was then forced through gaps at the top of the wall, into the central trough.  The central trough is where the pineapples were grown, at an artificially high temperature, due to the manure.

== Maintenance and obsolescence ==
A pineapple pit requires a huge amount of fresh manure, and manual labour to maintain the temperature of the central trench.  The introduction of [[steam ships]] meant that the pineapple pit became obsolete, as it was cheaper to transport fruit from overseas than to grow them under special conditions in the UK.

== Modern pineapple pits ==
An original pineapple pit was discovered at the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]] in the UK,  and renovated in 1993 by John Nelson, architectural historian John Chamberlain, and horticultural historian Peter Thoday.&lt;ref&gt;The Lost Gardens of Heligan Handbook, 2002 Updated 2007, copyright Heligan Gardens Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses two varieties of [[South African pineapple]]s, [[Jamaica Queen]] and [[Smooth Cayenne]].  In 1997, the first pineapple was successfully grown in the renovated pit.  The second pineapple grown there was donated to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II of the UK]].

'''Port Reading Refinery''', also known as '''Hess Refinery''', was an [[oil refinery]] located in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]] and [[Port Reading, New Jersey|Port Reading]], [[New Jersey]]. It was constructed by Hess Oil under [[Leon Hess]] in 1958. It is a simple refinery which further processes other refinery's product which begins with heavy sour crude. It is owned by the [[Hess Corporation]], refiners of Hess brand gasoline. The refinery itself has outlets that connect with [[Arthur Kill]], enabling oil [[barge]]s to make passage into the refinery's commons. The refinery had a neon red "HESS" sign on its [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]] unit [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=403298326470055 which was removed] in December, 2013 after the property was sold.

A '''thyristor''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|s|t|ər}}) is a [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[semiconductor device]] with four layers of alternating [[P-type semiconductor|P-]] and [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] materials. It acts exclusively as a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, and continuing to conduct until the voltage across the device is reversed biased, or until the voltage is removed (by some other means). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of the Anode to Cathode path by controlling that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its Gate. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).

Some sources define [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] (SCR) and thyristor as synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Donald; Alexander, Charles K. (2005); ''Standard Handbook of Electrical Engineering (5th edition.)''. McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-138421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources define thyristors as more ornately constructed devices that incorporate at least four layers of alternating N-type and P-type substrate.

The first thyristor devices were released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control a relatively large amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light [[dimmer]]s and electric motor speed control to [[high-voltage direct-current]] power transmission. Thyristors may be used in power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc.  Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the control gate signal.  The latter is known as a [[gate turn-off thyristor]], or GTO thyristor.  A thyristor is not a proportional device like a [[transistor]]. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.

== Introduction ==
The thyristor is a four-layered, three-terminal semiconductor device, with each layer consisting of alternately [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labelled anode and cathode, are across all four layers. The control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near the cathode. (A variant called an SCS—silicon controlled switch—brings all four layers out to terminals.) The operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, arranged to cause a self-latching action:
:[[File:thyristor.svg|thumb|center|600px|Structure on the physical and electronic level, and the thyristor symbol.]]
Thyristors have three states:
# Reverse blocking mode – Voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode
# Forward blocking mode – Voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction
# Forward conducting mode – The thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the "holding current"

=== Function of the gate terminal ===
The thyristor has three [[p-n junction]]s (serially named J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the anode).
[[File:Thyristor layers.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|Layer diagram of thyristor.]]
When the anode is at a positive potential V&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are forward biased, while junction J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reverse biased. As J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; is increased beyond the breakdown voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BO&lt;/sub&gt; of the thyristor, [[avalanche breakdown]] of J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).

If a positive potential ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs at a lower value of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt;. By selecting an appropriate value of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly.

Once avalanche breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, irrespective of the gate voltage, until: (a) the potential ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a [[UJT]] [[relaxation oscillator]].

The gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;GT&lt;/sub&gt;) and gate trigger current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;GT&lt;/sub&gt;). Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate [[electric charge|charge]] required to trigger the thyristor.

In a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (''i.e.'' does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the holding current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure ''I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''  has to come above the ''I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' on y-axis since ''I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt;''I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''.

A thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased (a method known as natural, or line, commutation). In some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor. This method is called forced commutation.

After the current in a thyristor has extinguished, a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased ''and'' retain the thyristor in the off-state. This minimum delay is called the circuit commutated turn off time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;). Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the thyristor to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]] and [[electron]]s) that have not yet [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombined]].

For applications with frequencies higher than the domestic AC mains supply (e.g. 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), thyristors with lower values of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; are required. Such fast thyristors can be made by diffusing [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] [[ion]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]] which act as charge combination centers into the silicon. Today, fast thyristors are more usually made by [[electron]] or [[proton]] [[irradiation]] of the silicon, or by [[ion implantation]].  Irradiation is more versatile than heavy metal doping because it permits the dosage to be adjusted in fine steps, even at quite a late stage in the processing of the silicon.

== History ==
The silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) or thyristor proposed by [[William Shockley]] in 1950 and championed by Moll and others at [[Bell Labs]] was developed in 1956 by power engineers at [[General Electric]] (G.E.), led by Gordon Hall and commercialized by G.E.'s Frank W. "Bill" Gutzwiller.

=== Etymology ===
An earlier [[gas-filled tube]] device called a [[thyratron]] provided a similar electronic switching capability, where a small control voltage could switch a large current. It is from a combination of "thyratron" and "[[transistor]]" that the term "thyristor" is derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905132123/http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf |date=September 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:Regulated rectifier.gif|thumb|right|Waveforms in a thyristor circuit controlling an AC current.&lt;br /&gt;Red trace: load (output) voltage&lt;br /&gt;Blue trace: trigger voltage.]]
Thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved, and are often used to control [[alternating current]]s, where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically, referred to as "[[zero cross circuit|zero cross]]" operation. The device can be said to operate ''synchronously''; being that, once the device is triggered, it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required, i.e., the device is biased ''fully on''. This is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation, as the output is unidirectional, flowing only from cathode to anode, and so is asymmetrical in nature.

Thyristors can be used as the control elements for phase angle triggered controllers, also known as [[phase fired controllers]].

They can also be found in power supplies for [[digital electronics|digital circuits]], where they are used as a sort of "enhanced [[circuit breaker]]" to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components. A thyristor is used in conjunction with a [[Zener diode]] attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the Zener voltage, the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]). This kind of protection circuit is known as a [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar]], and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered.

The first large-scale application of thyristors, with associated triggering [[diac]], in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color [[television]] receivers in the early 1970s.{{clarify|reason=Verb missing. 'DIAC' or 'DIACs'? Etc.|date=April 2015}}  The stabilized high voltage DC supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the AC supply input (if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation). The precise switching point was determined by the load on the DC output supply, as well as AC input fluctuations.

Thyristors have been used for decades as light dimmers in [[television]], [[motion picture]]s, and [[theater]], where they replaced inferior technologies such as [[autotransformer]]s and [[rheostat]]s. They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).

=== Snubber circuits ===
Thyristors can be triggered by a high rise-rate of off-state voltage. This is prevented by connecting a [[resistor]]-[[capacitor]] (RC) [[snubber]] circuit between the anode and cathode  in order to limit the dV/dt (i.e., rate of voltage change over time).

=== HVDC electricity transmission ===
[[File:Manitoba Hydro-BipoleII Valve.jpg|thumb|[[Valve hall]] containing ''{{vanchor|[[thyristor valve]]}}'' stacks used for long-distance transmission of power from [[Manitoba Hydro]] dams]]
Since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of [[megawatt]]s, thyristor valves have become the heart of [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.siemens.co.in/pool/about_us/our_business_segments/hvdc_proven_technology.pdf |title=High Voltage Direct Current Transmission – Proven Technology for Power Exchange |publisher=[[Siemens]] |chapter=Chapter 5.1 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://library.e.abb.com/public/3c981b9078f55447c1256feb0022602a/ETT%20vs%20LTT.pdf|title=ETT vs. LTT for HVDC | publisher=[[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]] |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a [[valve hall]]. Thyristors are arranged into a [[diode bridge]] circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a [[Rectifier#Twelve-pulse_bridge|12-pulse converter]]. Each thyristor is cooled with [[Distilled water#Deionization|deionized water]], and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a ''quadruple valve''. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/gad02181/c1256d71001e0037c12568320068995e.aspx |title=HVDC Thyristor Valves |publisher=[[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]] |accessdate=2008-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122071434/http://www.abb.com/cawp/gad02181/c1256d71001e0037c12568320068995e.aspx |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0809/high-power.cfm |title=High Power |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910162625/http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0809/high-power.cfm |archivedate=September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons to other devices ==
The functional drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, called a [[TRIAC]], is able to work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the [[Alternating current|AC]] power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily [[inductance|inductive]] motor loads usually requires the use of a "[[snubber]]" circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. [[Antiparallel (electronics)|Inverse parallel]] SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The "price" to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.

Although thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale [[rectifier|rectification]] of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like [[Power MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s. One major problem associated with SCRs is that they are not fully controllable switches. The [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO thyristor]] and [[IGCT]] are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only [[majority carriers]] carry the current).

== Failure modes ==
Thyristor manufacturers generally specify a region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given [[operating temperature]]. The boundary of this region is partly determined by the requirement that the maximum permissible gate power (P&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;), specified for a given trigger pulse duration, is not exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerguru.org/2012/05/09/safe-firing-of-thyristors/ ''"Safe Firing of Thyristors"''] on powerguru.org&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage, current or power ratings, thyristors have their own particular modes of failure, including:
* Turn on di/dt – in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area (SCRs &amp; triacs).
* Forced commutation – in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction (SCRs only).
* Switch on dv/dt – the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great.

== Silicon carbide thyristors ==
In recent years, some manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://powerelectronics.com/news/silicon-carbide-inverter/ ''Silicon Carbide Inverter Demonstrates Higher Power Output''] in Power Electronics Technology (2006-02-01)&lt;/ref&gt; have developed thyristors using [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) as the semiconductor material. These have applications in high temperature environments, being capable of [[Operating temperature|operating at temperatures]] up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Reverse conducting thyristor ===
A reverse conducting thyristor (RCT) has an integrated reverse [[diode]], so is not capable of reverse blocking.  These devices are advantageous where a reverse or freewheel diode must be used. Because the [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] and [[diode]] never conduct at the same time they do not produce heat simultaneously and can easily be integrated and cooled together. Reverse conducting thyristors are often used in [[frequency changer]]s and [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].

=== Photothyristors ===
[[File:LASCRsymbol.png|100px|thumb|[[Electronic symbol]] for light-activated SCR (LASCR)]]
Photothyristors are activated by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, which can cause faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which [[electromagnetic radiation]] (usually [[infrared]]) is coupled by an [[optical fiber]].  Since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as [[HVDC]].  Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high;  they have also been made with in-built ''forward recovery protection'', but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.

Two common photothyristors include the light-activated [[Silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]] (LASCR) and the light-activated [[TRIAC]]. A LASCR acts as a switch that turns on when exposed to light. Following light exposure, when light is absent, if the power is not removed and the polarities of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed, the LASCR is still in the "on" state. A light-activated TRIAC resembles a LASCR, except that it is designed for alternating currents.
