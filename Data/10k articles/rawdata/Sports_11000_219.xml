James’ son Greg runs the archery division independently from the team sports concern as a family owned division, having divested the team sports operations in 2006 to the former Easton-Bell group.

The independent, family owned&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2016-08-straight-story-arrow-advances-sports.html&lt;/ref&gt; archery division consists of two companies, [[Hoyt Archery]], Inc. and Easton Technical Products, both located in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.  The two companies employ approximately 800 people in the manufacture of compound bows, recurve bows, and arrows.  Easton arrows have been used to win every Olympic Games title in archery since the restoration of archery to the Olympic program in 1972.  Easton Technical Products is also a supplier to the military, medical and outdoor sports industries for high-strength carbon fiber and aluminum alloy tubing.  Hoyt and Easton are run as independent divisions of Jas. D. Easton, Inc.  Greg Easton is the third generation President of Jas. D. Easton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchery.org/HOME/History/World-Archery-Presidents/James-L-EASTON-USA James L.

The '''Battle of Brookvale''' was the unofficial name given to the [[2011 NRL season results#Round 25|Round 25, 2011]] [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) match between the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and [[Melbourne Storm]], played at [[Brookvale Oval]] on 26 August 2011.

A number of incidents in the first half led to some fights breaking out all over the ground, eventually turning into a five-minute brawl involving all players on the ground. Following the brawl, Manly went on to win the match 18&amp;ndash;4, on its way to finishing second on the premiership ladder.

Several players faced charges at the [[NRL Judiciary]] with suspensions and fines being handed out.

==Background==
{{see also|Manly&amp;ndash;Melbourne NRL rivalry}}
The Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Melbourne Storm have, in recent years, engaged in a modern-day rivalry which is amongst one of the most recognised in the National Rugby League today. In seven of eight seasons between 2006 and 2013 (except 2010), at least one of these two teams featured in the Grand Final, and, in the five of six seasons between 2007 and 2012, one of these teams won the premiership, though the Storm's 2007 and 2009 titles (the former of which was won by defeating Manly in the Grand Final) were later stripped from the club as a result of [[Melbourne Storm salary cap breach|salary cap breaches]] exposed by the NRL in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/melbourne-storm-stripped-of-everything-20100422-tfy6.html|title=Melbourne Storm stripped of everything|last=Munro|first=Ian|date=23 April 2010|publisher=The Age|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of this rivalry came with the two clubs' meetings in the [[2007 NRL Grand Final|2007]] and [[2008 NRL Grand Final|2008]] NRL Grand Finals. Melbourne defeated Manly 34&amp;ndash;8 to win the 2007 title, whilst Manly reversed the result and won by a record 40&amp;ndash;0 scoreline in 2008. They have also featured in two finals matches, with Melbourne winning both by the scoreline of 40&amp;ndash;12 in the 2009 qualifying final and the 2012 preliminary final.

This was to be the first match attended by [[David Gallop]] of either side since suspending [[Brett Stewart (rugby league)|Brett Stewart]] from the first four weeks of the 2009 season for a sexual assault charge for which he would later be exonerated, and since stripping the Storm of two premiership titles and three minor premiership titles for salary cap breaches; extra security was hired for his presence at the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/security-for-david-gallop-at-brookvale/story-e6frg7mf-1226120765776|title=Security for David Gallop at Brookvale|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|date=24 August 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the match==

===Lead-up to the brawl===
[[Kieran Foran]] scored the first try of the match for the Sea Eagles early in the first half, after [[Billy Slater]] misjudged a ball which had bounced in the Sea Eagles' in-goal area.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"/&gt;

In the 22nd minute of the match, Manly winger [[David Williams (rugby league)|David Williams]] suffered a neck injury, which resulted in play being suspended whilst he was carried off the stretcher. In stark contrast to what would come later in the game, Billy Slater who had tackled Williams (Williams had hit Slater's chest with the top of his head which caused the injury), realising there was a neck injury, cradled Williams and wouldn't let him move or his Manly team mates move him until the medical staff arrived.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-26/sea-eagles-rout-melbourne-at-brookvale/2857914 Sea Eagles rout Storm in fiery clash], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10747888|title=NRL: Neck injury ends Williams' season|date=29 August 2011|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brawl===
Shortly after the Williams injury, Melbourne interchange forward [[Ryan Hinchcliffe]] conceded a penalty when he struck Manly's [[Darcy Lussick]] close to the Sea Eagles' line.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/sea-eagles-v-storm-live/story-e6frexnr-1226123075124 Manly Sea Eagles beat Melbourne Storm 18-4 in NRL round 25], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a brawl between the two players, following which [[Adam Blair]] and [[Glenn Stewart]] were sin-binned for joining in.

On their way to the dressing rooms, a major brawl erupted between Blair and Stewart, which involved players and officials from both sides; the two subsequently had their sin-bin punishments upgraded to a [[red card (sports)|send off]], meaning they would take no further part in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/battle-of-brookie-set-to-take-toll-on-big-guns-title-assault-20110826-1jeto.html|title=Battle of Brookie set to take toll on big guns' title assault|last=Jackson|first=Glenn|date=27 August 2011|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the main culprits, many other players, including [[Brett Stewart (rugby league)|Brett Stewart]], also joined in the brawl, with Stewart claiming that he was acting in self-defence of his older brother. Officials and trainers from both clubs also joined in the brawl.&lt;ref name="judiciary"&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/no-less-than-12-players-and-officials-from-manly-and-melbourne-storm-will-be-scrutinised-by-the-nrl/story-fn2mcuj6-1226124189530 No less than 12 players and officials from Manly and Melbourne Storm will be scrutinized by the NRL], ''Fox Sports Australia'', 29 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the brawl===
Manly captain [[Jamie Lyon]] converted a penalty goal from the Hinchcliffe penalty from right in front, as the Sea Eagles' lead stretched to 8&amp;ndash;0. The Sea Eagles would eventually win 18&amp;ndash;4 with a late [[Billy Slater]] try preventing the Storm from being held scoreless for the first time since the 2008 NRL Grand Final.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"/&gt;

==Judiciary==

==Reaction==

Then-NRL CEO [[David Gallop]] condemned the actions of both teams, saying:

{{quote|''The sight of so many players from both teams fighting, of people running in and leaving the bench area, was a horrendous look for the game.''| [[David Gallop]] &lt;ref name="BattleofBrookvale"/&gt;}}

Despite the spiteful nature of the match, Melbourne's Billy Slater won universal praise for his actions after the neck injury to Manly winger David Williams.

'''Bryant–Denny Stadium''' is an outdoor stadium in the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] United States, on the campus of the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. It is the home field of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|football team]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).

Opened {{Time ago|1929}} in [[1929 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1929]], it was originally named Denny Stadium in honor of [[George H. Denny]], the school's president from 1912 to 1932. In 1975, the [[Alabama Legislature|state legislature]] added longtime head coach and alumnus [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] to the stadium's name. Bryant led the Tide for seven more seasons, through [[1982 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1982]], and is one of the few in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] to have coached in a venue bearing his name.

With a [[seating capacity]] of 101,821, it is the fourth-largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference, the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|seventh largest]] stadium in the United States and the [[List of stadiums by capacity|eighth largest]] stadium in the world.

==Construction==
The replacement for [[Denny Field (Alabama)|Denny Field]], Denny Stadium opened in [[1929 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1929]], with 6,000 in attendance for a 55–0 victory over [[Mississippi College Choctaws|Mississippi College]] on September 28.&lt;ref name="Sept 29, 1929"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama Gets 6 Touchdowns by Swift Play in First Half|first=Donald|last=Tubb|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=29A-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gkwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5474%2C5147177|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=September 29, 1929|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially dedicated the following week at [[Homecoming]] ceremonies against [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]], a 22–7 Crimson Tide victory.&lt;ref name="Oct 6, 1929"&gt;{{cite news |title=12,000 See Alabama Win, 22–7|first=Donald|last=Tubb|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nIA-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BkwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5886%2C252468|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=October 6, 1929|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 12,000—the lower half of the current stadium's east grandstand. However, President Denny initially envisioned a full bowl stadium capable of seating 66,000.&lt;ref name="1937Expansion"&gt;{{cite news |title=Denny Stadium|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ftY-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=10wMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6504%2C4372156|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=October 8, 1937|accessdate=April 12, 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[1937 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1937]] season, permanent seats were built along the east sideline, increasing the capacity to 24,000.&lt;ref name="1937Expansion"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official/&gt; Further expansions in [[1946 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1946]] (bleachers in both end zones), [[Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1961]] (new seats in west grandstand), and [[1966 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1966]] (both end zones fully enclosed, new seats in east grandstand) raised capacity to 31,000, 43,000, and 60,210, respectively.&lt;ref name=brushup&gt;{{cite news |title=Brushing Up|first=Mike|last=Land|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vDUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=paUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6296%2C3052438|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=July 15, 1983|accessdate=February 12, 2012|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Official/&gt; An upper deck was added to the west side in [[1988 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1988]] and raised the seating by nearly 10,000 to 70,123. During the construction, the Crimson Tide played its entire [[1987 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1987]] home schedule at [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], {{convert|57|mi|-1}} northeast of Bryant-Denny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Renovation at Bryant–Denny Welcome News|first=Andrew|last=Carroll|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H4o0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lKUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6698%2C6277559|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=January 25, 1987|accessdate=February 21, 2012|page=2F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East upper deck (1998)===
In September 1995, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees approved the construction of the east upper deck.&lt;ref name="Sept 16, 1995"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Deal Gets Approval |first=Richard|last=Powell|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7TsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MaYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4889%2C5084886|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=September 16, 1995|accessdate=February 5, 2011|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by the architectural firm of [[Heery International|Heery-Chambless-Adams]], the construction was financed by the university and $4.65 million from the city of Tuscaloosa, the city of [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]], and [[Tuscaloosa County, Alabama|Tuscaloosa County]].&lt;ref name="Sept 16, 1995"/&gt; The localities contributed to construction costs in return for the university pledging to move all Crimson Tide home games to Bryant–Denny and not play any at Legion Field.&lt;ref name="Sept 16, 1995"/&gt;

The new upper deck provided 10,000 additional bleacher seats and 81 [[Luxury box|skyboxes]] on two levels—63 16-seat and 18 24-seat capacity boxes.&lt;ref name="Oct 10, 1998"&gt;{{cite news |title=Skyboxes a Popular Addition to Stadium|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3iEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UqYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=skybox%20news&amp;pg=6747%2C1890841|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=October 10, 1998|accessdate=February 5, 2011|page=8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, four additional skyboxes were built to bring the total number of skyboxes to 85. A [[JumboTron]] scoreboard with video display capabilities was erected in the south end zone and was at the time the largest in collegiate sports.&lt;ref name="JumboTron"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jumbo View: Bama's Big-Screen Scoreboard is the Largest in College Football|first=Tommy|last=Deas|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=XUmZziu-z7kC&amp;dat=19981010&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=October 10, 1998|accessdate=September 17, 2018|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a new east side entrance tower, a brick facade and reception areas for the Scholarship and A-Club level patrons was also added during the 1998 expansion.

The stadium's eastern upper deck was opened in [[1998 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1998]] and raised its official [[seating capacity]] to 83,818 at a final cost of $35 million for the addition.&lt;ref name="Sept 5, 1998"&gt;{{cite news |title=So What Else Is New?|first=Robert|last=DeWitt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4UogAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z6YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5652%2C541265|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=September 5, 1998|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly expanded venue debuted on September 5, and Alabama defeated [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]] 38–31 as running back [[Shaun Alexander]] set a Tide single-game record with five touchdowns.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexander spearheads Tide shootout |first=Cecil |last=Hurt |page=C1 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |date=September 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North end zone expansion (2006)===
[[File:Bryant-Denny Stadium by Highsmith 01.jpg|thumb|left|View of the north end zone of the stadium exterior and the Walk of Champions]]
Following the [[2004 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2004]] season, the university spent approximately $47&amp;nbsp;million on an expansion to the north end zone, which was completed days before the 2006 opener against Hawaii. It added a new upper deck to the North end zone area, complete with three different levels of skyboxes, which collectively are known as "The Zone", which brought the number of skyboxes in the stadium to 123. Two large display screens by [[Daktronics]] were placed in each corner of the north end zone, and [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] ribbon screens, {{convert|3.5|ft}} tall by {{convert|422|ft}} wide, were placed along the front edge of the east and west upper decks.

Massive changes were made to the grounds of the north side of the stadium with the addition of a [[:Category:Walks of fame|Walk]] of Champions.  Building the Walk of Champions required the demolition of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity house and the [[Grading (engineering)|grading]] of the hill it sat upon. The Walk of Champions comprises a brick plaza leading from University Boulevard to the north end zone entrances.  The plaza features 16 granite monuments set into the walkway commemorating the Crimson Tide's SEC and national championship teams throughout the years. Along the west side of the plaza are five roughly {{convert|2000|lb|adj=on}}, {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} tall bronze statues, one for each Alabama football coach who has led the Crimson Tide to a national championship. Each statue has a semicircular wall behind it bearing the coach's name and the year(s) that he led the team to a national championship. The first four statues, unveiled during the opening in 2006, included [[Wallace Wade]], [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]], and [[Gene Stallings]].&lt;ref name="gadstimesjun2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bryant–Denny Undergoing Monumental Change|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=20060629&amp;id=qp1GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3P0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2100,2884194|newspaper=[[The Gadsden Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 29, 2006|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth statue, that of [[Nick Saban]], was unveiled prior to the A-Day game on April 16, 2011.  It commemorates Saban guiding Alabama to its 13th National Championship with a 37–21 win over the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]].

[[File:BDSNEExpansion.jpg|thumb|The north end zone entrance in 2007, with commemorative Alabama players statuary group on the left.]]
Finally, there is a bronze statuary group of two anonymous Alabama football players at the entrance to the north end zone, with the one on the left holding a large Alabama Crimson Tide flag upright on a flagpole. This player is wearing the number 18 and a helmet, with the player on the right wearing the number 92 and pointing into the distance. The jersey numbers represent 1892, the first season of Crimson Tide football.&lt;ref name="gadstimesjun2006"/&gt;

The north end zone was opened for the [[2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2006]] season opener versus [[2006 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii]], which set a new record attendance of 92,138. The Crimson Tide was victorious, 25–17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Late Defensive Stand Helps Tide Hold Off Game Hawaii|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=262450333|work=[[ESPN]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 2, 2006|accessdate=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South end zone expansion (2010)===
[[File:Bryant-Denny south 2010-09-04 Altered.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the new south end zone in 2010.]]
The University of Alabama Board of Trustees approved a study for further expansion of Bryant–Denny on September 19, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UA Trustees Approve Unitial Study for Bryant-Denny stadium Expansion|first=Kyle|last=Fondren|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20080919/WVUA01/809190297|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Physical Properties Committee of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees heard a presentation from the UA athletic department on November 13, 2008 regarding the proposed $80.6 million expansion of the south end zone upper deck and suite level of Bryant–Denny Stadium.  The proposed expansion would bring the stadium's capacity to approximately 101,600, therefore making it the second largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the fifth largest stadium in college football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Offeseason Pigskinpalooza: College Football's Megastadiums|first=D.

On February 6, 2009, the university's Board of Trustees voted unanimously and without discussion to give the final approval for construction to commence on the south end zone expansion. With the approval of the Board of Trustees, construction began in the Spring of 2009 and continued throughout the 2009 football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Official|first=Ian|last=Rapport|url=http://blog.al.com/rapsheet/2009/02/its_official_bryantdenny_will.html|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=February 6, 2009|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Board of Trustees Officially Approves Bryant–Denny Stadium South End Zone Expansion Project|url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020609aaa.html|publisher=University of Alabama Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=February 6, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414004253/http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020609aaa.html|archivedate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion was finished in time for the first game of the team's [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2010 season]].

''The Tuscaloosa News'' reported on April 17, 2009 that due to the economic climate and resultant lowered construction costs, the stadium expansion cost $15 million less than expected, coming in around $65.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UA Stadium Expansion Cheaper Than Expected|first=Adam|last=Jones|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090417/NEWS/904169969|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bryant Denny 2 9-4-10.jpg|thumb|right|Newly expanded south end zone of Bryant Denny with new LED screens]]
The expanded south end zone now includes a two level South Zone club with a total of 1,700 seats and 36 skyboxes to bring the total number of skyboxes in Bryant–Denny Stadium to 159, as well as  an 8,500 seat upper deck. The entire stadium's audio/visual system was upgraded to include two new video boards in both corners of the south end zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Mal Moore Announces Request For Approval Of South End Zone Project|url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020309aaa.html|publisher=University of Alabama Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=February 6, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909034948/http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020309aaa.html|archivedate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2009]] season, the large south scoreboard was disassembled to make way for the construction of the new stadium expansion. During this process, some welding equipment started a fire that burned the inside of the scoreboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Small Fire Strikes Bryant–Denny Stadium Scoreboad|first=Gentry|last=Estes|url=http://blog.al.com/bamabeat/2009/02/small_fire_strikes_bryantdenny.html|newspaper=[[Press-Register]]|location=Mobile|date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during this time, four new play clocks and down/distance indicators were installed (one behind each corner of the end zones) and a new LED game clock was placed behind the south goalpost.

The expansion was completed in mid-summer [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2010]] and held an official capacity of 101,821 making it the fifth largest college football stadium in the country. The new seats were all sold out quickly for the entire 2010 football season. In the future, the new expansion will include stores and other extras on the bottom of the end zone.

The University is planning a full stadium expansion with construction expand to begin at the start of the 2020 season. 

==Football lore==
Since its opening in [[1929 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1929]] through [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2010]], the Crimson Tide owns a {{Winning percentage|212|50|3|record=y}} record at Bryant–Denny Stadium.&lt;ref name="BDS_all-time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-awards.pdf |title=Bryant–Denny Stadium Year-By-Year Record |work=2010 Alabama Football Media Guide |publisher=University of Alabama Athletic Department |page=138 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102902/http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-awards.pdf |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear Bryant is the leader in wins at the stadium, with an all-time record of {{Winning percentage|72|2|record=y}} in his quarter century as Tide head coach.&lt;ref name="BDS_all-time"/&gt;

Despite its success at Bryant–Denny, most of Alabama's "home" football history from the 1920s through the 1980s occurred at Birmingham's Legion Field.&lt;ref name="Legion_all-time"&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 Alabama Football Media Guide|trans-title=Alabama Football at Legion Field|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-awards.pdf|publisher=University of Alabama Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|accessdate=February 3, 2011|pages=141–142|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102902/http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-awards.pdf|archivedate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the late 1990s, the higher capacity Legion Field hosted most of Alabama's important home games, including the [[Iron Bowl]] with rival [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]], which was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant–Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]]. However, in 1998, when Bryant–Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant–Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later.&lt;ref name="March 6, 1999"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vols Due in Fall, AU in 2000|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ckdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VqYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C631746|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2011|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham. Finally, in 2003, Alabama played its final game at Legion Field against the [[South Florida Bulls]], and now Bryant–Denny is the sole home of Alabama football.&lt;ref name="Legion_all-time"/&gt;

[[File:BDSfromDennyChimes.JPG|thumb|View of the northern side of the stadium and [[Tailgate party|tailgaters]] as seen from the [[Denny Chimes]] vicinity of [[University of Alabama Quad|The Quad]] in 2008.]]
However, despite the majority of past big games being played at Legion Field, Bryant–Denny Stadium has hosted many memorable games, such as the 1994 shootout between Alabama's [[Jay Barker]] and Georgia's [[Eric Zeier]], Marvin Constant's goal-line stop against [[1999 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] quarterback Josh Booty as time expired in 1999, [[Tyrone Prothro]]'s reception over the back of Southern Miss defensive back Jasper Faulk in 2005, a 31–3 victory over No. 5 Florida in 2005, the [[Roman Harper]]-forced fumble against [[2005 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] in 2005 that helped the Crimson Tide to victory, Alabama's 36–0 shutout victory against Auburn in 2008 thus breaking the six-game losing streak and first ever [[Iron Bowl]] victory in Bryant–Denny Stadium, and [[Terrence Cody]]'s field goal block against [[2009 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] as time expired in 2009. In recent years, Bryant–Denny Stadium has become a feared place to play again.  Also Bryant-Denny has been put on many lists ranking it one of the best places to watch football. [[NCAA Football 11]] ranked Alabama's Bryant–Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|Florida]] and [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|LSU]]. ''Sporting News'' ranks it first while Bleacher Report has it ranked as the 5th toughest and the 2nd best stadium in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=College Football Rankings: 25 Best College Football Game Day Experiences|first=Wes|last=O'Donnell|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/592904-25-best-college-football-game-day-experiences/page/25|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the turn of the millennium, the field at Bryant–Denny Stadium had only the necessary markings required for play. As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant–Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of "ALABAMA" in a white, block-style font. During the 2002 season, however, a large white script “A” was added to midfield.

The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script “A” was replaced with the crimson script “A” logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has "Alabama Crimson Tide" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.

For the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.

For the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team. These were in the same places as the 175th logos were during the 2006 season.

For the 2008 season, two identical SEC logos were added to the home field of every SEC team. Alabama’s crimson was used as the primary color for the logos at Bryant–Denny. These logos were located in the same places as the previous logos and remain there today.

For the 2009 A-day game, the end zones were changed back to the original white block-style font that was used prior to the 2004 season, except that the background was shaded crimson. The north end zone displayed "ALABAMA", while the south end zone displayed "CRIMSON TIDE".  This design layout has remained in use since the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photo of Bryant-Denny Stadium Design for the 2009 A-day Game|url=http://i40.tinypic.com/dnp09e.jpg|publisher=Tiny Pic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011 season, two identical [[houndstooth]] [[awareness ribbon]]s recognizing the ongoing relief efforts following the [[2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado|April 27, 2011 tornado]] were added to the field on the 25 yard lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bryant–Denny Unveils Tornado Ribbons|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=rivals-1259179|work=[[Rivals.com|Rivals]]|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Awareness"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama's Opener Against Kent State Could Help Healing in Tuscaloosa|first=Izzy|last=Gould|url=http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/09/alabamas_opener_against_kent_s.html|newspaper=[[Press-Register]]|location=Mobile|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locker rooms==
In 2008, the visitors' locker room was officially named "The Fail Room" after alumnus and donor [[James M. Fail]]. He commented, "Earlier this year, when I saw the visitors' locker room as a potential naming right, I figured it was the most appropriate opportunity I would ever have to use my name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Bryant–Denny Stadium Visitors Locker Room Named for James M.

==High school championships==
Beginning in 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and [[Auburn University]]'s [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]] became the homes of the [[Alabama High School Athletic Association]] state football championship games, known as the Super Seven. Bryant-Denny hosts the Super Seven in odd-numbered years, with Jordan–Hare taking the games in even-numbered years. Previously, the Super Six was held at [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

A '''chess title''' is a [[title]] created by a [[chess]] governing body and bestowed upon players based on their performance and rank. Such titles are usually granted for life. The most prestigious titles are those granted by the international chess governing body [[FIDE]]; many national chess federations also grant titles such as "National Master".&lt;ref&gt;World Chess Federation. [http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=B0101 FIDE Handbook: Chess Rules. 1.0. Requirements for the titles designated in 0.31.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315221010/http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=B0101 |date=March 15, 2008 }} Retrieved 9 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Over-the-board chess==
In general, a ''chess master'' is a player of such skill that he or she can usually beat most amateurs. Among chess players, the term is often abbreviated to ''master'', the meaning being clear from context.

The establishment of the world chess body, [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs]] (FIDE), saw the creation of titles superior to the "national master" titles. In 1950, FIDE created the titles "[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]" and "[[International Master]]", the requirements for which were increasingly formalized over the years. In 1978 FIDE created the lesser title of "[[FIDE Master]]".

===Early use of the Master title===
From the beginning of recorded chess, to the establishment of the first chess organizations, the term ''master'' was applied informally, being simply a matter of popular acclaim. Strong players demonstrated their strength in play, and gained the informal reputation of being chess masters.

As chess became more widespread in the latter half of the 19th century, the term began to be given out by organizations. One of the most prestigious events of the time was the [[DSB Congress]], first organised by the [[Deutscher Schachbund|Deutscher Schachbund (German Chess Federation)]] in 1876. The DSB's standard for the title of Master was the ''Meisterdrittel'', i.e. to win at least one third of the games in the premiere tournament at a DSB Congress. The winner of the ''Hauptturnier'' or "reserve" event was entitled to compete in the premiere event in the next congress, with a chance to achieve the ''Meisterdrittel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===FIDE titles===
{{Main article|FIDE titles}}
*''[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]'' (abbreviated as GM, sometimes ''International Grandmaster'' or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo chess rating (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other Grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are also other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.
*''International Master'' (abbreviated as IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.
*''FIDE Master'' (abbreviated as FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE Rating of 2300 or more.
*''Candidate Master'' (abbreviated as CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE Rating of at least 2200.
All the titles listed above are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are also available. Beginning with [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] in 1978, many women have also earned the unsegregated GM title.&lt;ref&gt;Current FIDE lists of top players with their titles are online at [http://www.fide.com/ratings/toplist.phtml fide.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430092221/http://www.fide.com/ratings/toplist.phtml |date=April 30, 2008 }}. Retrieved 11 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===National titles===
Some [[Chess around the world|national chess federations]] award titles such as "National Master" (NM). National chess federations are free to set whatever standards they want for such titles, which are not recognized by [[FIDE]]. Standards for "Master" titles in different countries vary, but are usually based on criteria such as achieving a certain rating (typically about 2200 [[Elo rating system|Elo]]), achieving the required number of tournament performances ("norms") at a certain level, or featuring prominently in the country's national championship. In some cases, it may extend to honorary titles awarded to (for example) prominent chess administrators, business patrons or politicians. Since the introduction of the [[FIDE Master]] (FM) title in 1978, some federations such as those of Ireland and Germany have ceased awarding National Master titles, apparently regarding them as obsolete.

====Individual federations====

=====Soviet Union=====
In the Soviet Union, the Master title was conferred by the federal government and was connected to the title of [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|Master of Sport]]. The first chess player to receive the title was [[Peter Romanovsky]] in 1934. Only players who featured prominently in the [[Soviet Chess Championship]] were considered for the title, and less than 100 awards were made altogether. The majority of these players also qualified for the FIDE [[International Master]] or [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title.

=====United States=====
The [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] currently gives a national title for achieving 2200 rating (life master):

Chess expert is a title given by the [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF). It is awarded to [[chess]] players [[Chess rating systems|rated]] from 2000 to 2199. Players rated above that are [[chess master|masters]], while players below that are class players. Approximately 50,000 chess players have USCF ratings, of which approximately 2,500 are rated 2000 or better. Thus, chess experts are in the top 5% of all USCF tournament chess players. Since 2008, USCF has also awarded Candidate Master titles to players that achieve 5 performance-based [[Norm (chess)|'norms']] in tournaments while holding a rating above 2000. Like the title of Master, Candidate Master titles are awarded for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glicko.net/ratings/titles.pdf|title=US Chess Title System, Update Feb 2016|last=|first=|date=Feb 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of chess expert is not awarded for life. Every time a tournament chess player plays a game, his rating goes up or down depending on the game's outcome and on how strong his opponent is. If the rating of a chess expert falls below 2000, he is not a chess expert any more (though he retain the title of Candidate Master, if it was earned according to criteria above). This is in contrast to international titles awarded by [[FIDE]], which are awarded for life. In European countries the term of "expert" is not used. Instead, players of that level are called "[[Candidate Master]]s", although the FIDE Candidate Master title generally requires a higher rating (2200 FIDE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=58&amp;view=article|title=Handbook|website=www.fide.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308182527/http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=58&amp;view=article|archivedate=2013-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible (and common), however, for players in the United States to have a rating that places them in the 'expert' category while still retaining the title of 'Life Master' or 'National Master'. The 'title' of 'master' is awarded to anyone meeting the criteria laid down by the USCF, including having once been rated over 2200. Like the FIDE titles of [[FIDE Master]], [[International Master]], and [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]], the title of 'Master' is awarded for life. Players with a rating below 2200, but who have earned the title of 'National Master' or 'Life Master', are, according to the USCF, still referred to as 'masters'.

The first USCF rating list was published in December 1950. On that list, experts were players rated from 2100 to 2300 and masters were players rated from 2300 to 2500. However, within a few years, it was discovered that the ratings were rapidly deflating. As a result, the classifications were dropped by 100 points so that since then experts were rated between 2000 and 2200. In 1960, the USCF adopted the new [[Elo rating system]] replacing the original [[Kenneth Harkness|Harkness]] System. There have been continuous adjustments to that system ever since, with the primary purpose of stabilizing the rating system against the forces of inflation and deflation, so that a chess expert today will be approximately the same strength as a chess expert was 20 or 40 years ago.

This information stated here also applies in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.ca/section_7.htm |publisher=CFC |title=701. C.F.C. RATING SYSTEM &amp; FIDE RATED EVENTS |accessdate=2009-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225073722/http://www.chess.ca/section_7.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the Canadian Federation of Chess (CFC), with one difference being that Class E encompasses all players rated under 1200. Similar class distinctions may apply in other national chess federations as well.

======Master======
The [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) awards the Title of National Master to anyone who achieves a USCF [[ELO rating system|rating]] of 2200, and the title of Senior Master to anyone who achieves a USCF rating of 2400 along with certain performance-based [[Norm (chess)|'norms']] during tournament play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glicko.net/ratings/titles.pdf|title=US Chess Title System Feb 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USCF also awards the Life Master title to anyone who holds a 2200 rating for a total of 300 or more games in his or her lifetime.

In the United States, the title of "National Master" is awarded for life, regardless of whether the rating of a National Master subsequently goes below 2200.&lt;ref&gt;"Meeting Minutes – Board of Directors Meeting – August 2002", United States Chess Federation, PO Box 3967, Crossville, TN 38557&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, this position was codified (after being recognized as the existing status quo) by the USCF Policy Board with the passage of a motion stating "Any USCF member who has had a regular post tournament rating of 2200 or higher (published or not) has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and is recognized by being automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master."

======Life Master======
Life Master is a [[chess]] title awarded by the [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF). To be awarded this title, one must hold a [[Chess master|master's]] [[ELO rating|rating]] of over 2200 for at least 300 USCF-rated tournament chess games. 

During the 1990s, the USCF also awarded a "Life Master" title on the basis of a different and more complex system that was similar to the FIDE 'norm system' of awarding titles. This method of attaining Life Master became officially recognized by the USCF on January 1, 1996. The "class norm" system was later discontinued, and players who had or were subsequently granted the title on the 300-game basis were renamed "Original Life Masters." In practice, the distinction is rarely made. Original Life Masters had to play 300 games as a Master with out going below 2200 in their rating or the count would start over again. 

As the name of this title implies, this title is held for life, regardless of any subsequent decrease in rating. Thus it is possible to have a player with a USCF rating of 2100 (or below) who is a Life Master. While this is uncommon for 'Original Life Masters' (since such a rating floor can only be dropped by the USCF itself), Original Life Masters  have a floor rating of 2200 .

=====Canada=====
The [[Chess Federation of Canada]] awards the title of National Master to players who achieve a national rating of 2200, and three tournament performances ("norms") of 2300 or more.

== Chess compositions ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Kasparian.jpg|thumb|Genrikh Gasparyan]] --&gt;
{{See also|List of grandmasters for chess composition}}
Just as in over-the-board play, in [[chess problem|problem chess]] the titles '''International Grandmaster''', '''International Master''' and '''FIDE Master''' are awarded by FIDE via the [[Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions|PCCC]] (''Permanent Commission for Chess Composition'') for especially distinguished problem and study composers and solvers (unlike over-the-board chess, however, there are no women-only equivalents to these titles in problem chess).

=== Composers ===
For composition, the title of Grandmaster for chess composition was established in 1959, with [[André Cheron]], [[Arnoldo Ellerman]], [[Alexander Gerbstmann]], [[Jan Hartong]], and [[Cyril Kipping]] being the first honorary recipients. In subsequent years, qualification for the IM title, as well as for the GM title (first awarded in 1972 to [[Genrikh Kasparyan]], [[Lev Loshinsky]], [[Comins Mansfield]], and [[Eeltje Visserman]]) and the FM title (first awarded 1990) has been determined on the basis of the number of problems or studies a composer had selected for publication in the [[FIDE Album]]s. These albums are collections of the best problems and studies composed in a particular three-year period, as selected by FIDE-appointed judges. Each problem published in an album is worth 1 point; each study is worth 1⅔; joint compositions are worth the same divided by the number of composers. For the FIDE Master title, a composer must accumulate 12 points; for the International Master title, 25 points are needed; and for the Grandmaster title, a composer must have 70 points.

=== Solvers ===
For solvers, the GM (International Solving Grandmaster) and IM titles were both first awarded in 1982; the FM title followed in 1997. GM and IM titles can only be gained by participating in the official [[World Chess Solving Championship]] (WCSC):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunalahti.fi/~stniekat/pccc/wcsc.htm|title=Rules for the WCSC and ECSC|first=Hannu|last=Harkola|website=www.saunalahti.fi|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719040413/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~stniekat/pccc/wcsc.htm|archivedate=2009-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become a GM, a solver must score at least 90 percent of the winner's points and on each occasion finish in at least tenth place three times within ten successive WCSCs. For the IM title they must score at least 80 percent of the winner's points and each time finish in at least fifteenth place twice within five successive WCSCs; alternatively, winning a single WCSC or scoring as many points as the winner in a single WCSC will earn the IM title. For the FM title, the solver must score at least 75 percent of the winners points and each time finish within the top 40 percent of participants in any two PCCC-approved solving competitions.

=== Judges ===
The title [[International Judge of Chess Compositions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunalahti.fi/~stniekat/pccc/ij.htm|title=International judges|first=Hannu|last=Harkola|website=www.saunalahti.fi|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025084555/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~stniekat/pccc/ij.htm|archivedate=2007-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given to individuals considered capable of judging composing tournaments at the highest level.

== Correspondence chess ==
The [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF)]] awards the titles International Master, Senior International Master and [[International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster]]—these are equivalent to similar titles awarded by FIDE for over-the-board chess. The ICCF also runs the World Correspondence Chess Championships. Because these events can last a long time, they may overlap: for instance, in February 2005 [[Joop van Oosterom]] was declared winner of the eighteenth Championship (which began in June 2003), though the winner of the seventeenth Championship (which began in March 2002) had not yet been determined.

'''''Gears and Tears''''' was a British television documentary series about [[stock car racing]], which originally aired on [[BBC One]] in 2010.

==Synopsis==
''Gears and Tears'' follows the story behind a [[BriSCA Formula One Stock Car Racing]] season, particularly a bitter battle between two dominant clans in the sport: the Wainmans from [[Yorkshire]] and the Smiths from [[Lancashire]]. Although the Wainmans and the Smiths are the central characters, other drivers who appear in the series include Nuneaton-based father and son Rob and Chris Cowley (race number 73 and 37 respectively), and Leicestershire double glazing company manager [[Paul Hines (racing driver)|Paul Hines]] (race number 259).

==Production==
The programme was narrated by [[Ralph Ineson]] (who was in ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'') and produced by Charlie Clay who also produced ''[[Trawlermen (TV series)|Trawlermen]]''. It was initiated by lifelong stock car fan and assistant producer on the show John Lakey who has worked on other [[BBC]] shows such as ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''Wrong Car Right Car'', and ''Panic Mechanics.''

A large amount of on board mini-cameras that were used in the series brought stock car racing to life in a way that had never been seen before.

==Reception==
The first episode of ''Gears and Tears'' was broadcast on Monday 2 August 2010, at 10:35pm, except in Northern Ireland and Wales, where it was shown half an hour later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gears and Tears, Episode 1|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tc28r#programme-broadcasts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent episodes were shown in the same timeslot, except for episode 5, which aired on Tuesday instead of Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gears and Tears, Episode 5|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tnkld#programme-broadcasts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gears and Tears - Buy Online|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/products/7421|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hand guards''' are devices worn by athletes in [[artistic gymnastics]]. Various types of hand guards are used by gymnasts:

* '''[[Grip (gymnastics)|Grip]]s''' are used on the [[uneven bars]], [[high bar]], [[still rings]] and [[parallel bars]] to enhance the gymnast's grip and, in the case of bar exercises, to reduce friction between the gymnast's hands and the bar.
* '''Braces''' do not offer the gymnast any performance advantage, but help to prevent injury by providing support and lessening impact on the wrists and hands. {{Clarify|date=February 2009}}
* '''Wrist guards''' are usually worn by male gymnasts performing on the [[pommel horse]], and sometimes by female gymnasts on the [[floor exercise]] or [[vault (gymnastics)|vault]]. {{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

'''Het Houten Stadion''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Wooden Stadium'') is a former stadium of [[AFC Ajax]] which served as the team's home stadium from 1907 to 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geheugenvanoost.nl/22708/nl/het-houten-ajax-stadion-1911-1934 |title=Het Houten Ajax-Stadion (1911-1934) |publisher=Geheugen van Oost|accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Het Houten Stadion is a former stadium of AFC Ajax. Before Ajax moved to this stadium, they had played on a field in [[Amsterdam-Noord]]. Houses had been built on their field in 1907 which sent Ajax searching for a new place to play.

The club found two locations in the [[municipality]] of [[Watergraafsmeer]] losing their previous pitch to housing development. Both new places were located on the [[Polder]], but were closer than the former field in Noord.

In the early years of the grounds there was no actual stadium, there were no stands, no water and the players would change and get ready in a bar nearby. The first stands were built in 1911 with covered seating on one side, and standing tribunes on the other. In 1916 the stands were built behind both goal lines. Designed by architect and Ajax-member [[Jordanus Roodenburgh|Daan Roodenburgh]], the funding for the stadium came from Wim Eggerman, a local businessman, who was the president of the club at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/regionaal/5-historische-ajax-plekken/SrZljo!MOHCqK7yI0pkQ/ |title=5 historische Ajax-plekken |publisher=Metro Nieuws|accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of [[AFC Ajax]] in the 1930s the stadium became too small. Every match more people would come to see Ajax play, the last [[Klassieker]] match to be played at Het Houten Stadion against [[Feyenoord]] was so busy, no corners could be taken during that match because there were spectators spilling out on to the pitch. 15,000 spectators attended that match. On 9 December 1934, Ajax moved to their new [[De Meer Stadion]].

In 1936 Daan Roodenburgh competed in the [[Art competitions at the 1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] in the Mixed Architecture event for Sports venues with his construction of Het Houten Stadion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ro/daan-roodenburgh-1.html |title=Daan Roodenburgh / Olympic Sports |publisher=Sports-reference.com |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204005811/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ro/daan-roodenburgh-1.html |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now an [[Albert Heijn]] situated in the location of the former main entrance to the stadium on Middenweg in the Watergraafsmeer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29285">Various obstacles are found in competitive sports involving [[jumping (horse)|horse jumping]]. These include [[show jumping]], [[show hunter|hunter]], and the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country phase]] of the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] discipline of [[eventing]]. The size and type of obstacles vary depending on the course and the level of the horse and rider, but all [[horse]]s must successfully negotiate these obstacles in order to complete a competition. Fences used in hunter and eventing are generally made to look relatively rustic and natural.

In jumping competition, they are often brightly colored and creatively designed.  In hunter and jumper competition, obstacles are constructed to fall down if struck by the horse.  In eventing, they are built to be solid, though for safety, certain elements may be designed to break away if hit.

==Arrowhead==
Also called chevrons, these fences are shaped like triangles, with the point facing towards the ground.  They are generally very narrow, usually only a few feet wide.  Arrowhead fences require the rider to keep their horse straight between their hands and legs, as it is easy for a run-out to occur due to the narrowness of the fence.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;[http://www.localriding.com/cross-country-obstacles.html "Equestrian Eventing"]. ''Local Riding''. Referenced February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  These fences are often used in combination with other obstacles to increase their difficulty, such as right after a bank or as the second obstacle in a bending line. This tests the rider's ability to regain control of his/her horse following an obstacle.

==Bank==
[[File:Xc bank.jpg|upright|thumb|Horse negotiating uphill bank]]
These jumps are steps up or down from one level to another, and can be single jumps or built as a "staircase" of multiple banks.  Banks up require large amounts of impulsion, although not speed, from the horse. The drop fence incorporates a down bank.  Both types of banks require the rider to be centered over the horse. Down banks require the rider to lean further back, with slipped reins and heels closer to the front of the horse, in order to absorb the shock of the landing.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Bounce==
[[File:Descriptive Zoopraxography Horse Jumping Animated 13.gif|left|thumb|Animation showing an endless loop of horses clearing ''bounce'' type obstacles.]]
A '''bounce''', also called a no-stride, is a fence combination sometimes found on the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]] course of [[eventing]]. It is also very commonly used in grid-work or gymnastics. It consists of two fences placed close together so the horse cannot take a full stride between them, but not so close that the horse would [[jumping (horse)|jump]] both fences at once. The horse "bounces" between the two jumps, landing with his hind legs before immediately taking off with his front legs. The distance between the two usually is 7–8 feet for small ponies; 9&amp;nbsp;ft for large ponies or small horses; and 9.5–11&amp;nbsp;ft for horses. A bounce (or several can be used in a row for more advanced horses) teaches the horse good balance, to push off with his hind end, and to fold his front end well. It can also be used to slow down a speedy horse, as a horse cannot go flying over a bounce (he/she will knock a rail) as he could with a single jump.

==Brush Fence==
[[Image:Blenheim Horse Trials 3.jpg|150px|thumb|Horse and rider negotiating a brush fence]]
These jumps consist of a solid base with brush placed on top, generally low enough for the horse to see over.  The horse is supposed to jump through the brush in a flat jump, rather than over the top of it in a more rounded arc. Brush fences are also used for steeplechase racing. This type of fence is closely related to the bullfinch. Sometimes the fence is painted to camouflage in with the brush, so it is unseen by both horse and rider.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Bullfinch==
This fence has a solid base with several feet of brush protruding out of the top of the jump up to six feet high.  The horse is supposed to jump through the brush, rather than over it.  Due to the height of the brush, the horse generally cannot see the landing.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;  This tests the horse's trust in the rider, as the horse must depend on the rider to guide it carefully and steer it to a solid landing.  The horse must be taught to jump calmly through the brush, as attempting to jump over the brush could lead to a refusal, a run-out at the next fence, or a misstep and possible injury.  Bullfinches must be approached positively, with lots of impulsion, in order to prevent stops. When jumping a bullfinch, the rider must stay tight in the saddle so that brush cannot be caught between his or her leg and the fence.

==Coffin==
[[File:Rolex XCountry.JPG|thumb|150px|Horse and rider negotiating the ditch element of a coffin]]
Also called the rails-ditch-rails, the coffin is a combination fence where the horse jumps a set of rails, moves one or several strides downhill to a ditch, then goes back uphill to another jump.  In the past, coffins were more pronounced, with up and down banks leading to the ditch in the middle. However, today only the former type with the rails is seen.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; The coffin is intended to be jumped in a slow, impulsive canter (known to eventers as a "coffin canter" for that reason). This canter gives the horse the power and agility to negotiate the obstacle, and also allows him the time needed to assess what question is being asked, so that he may better complete the combination without problem. Approaching in a fast, flat gallop will cause miss striding and may entice a refusal from the horse. Going too fast may also result in a fall, if the horse cannot physically make a stride between the obstacles.

==Combinations==
[[Image:Obst triple-1-.jpg|right|thumb|A triple combination.]]

These fences are combinations of banks, logs, water, ditches and other elements.  All of the jumps are placed within 1–3 strides of each other, and are meant to be jumped as a series in a specific order. Also see [[#Normandy bank|Normandy bank]], [[#Sunken road|Sunken road]], and [[#Coffin|Coffin]].&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; They are seen in the equestrian jumping sports of [[show jumping]] and [[eventing]] (both the cross-country and stadium jumping phases), but are uncommon in [[hunt seat]] competition.

Combinations are often one of the challenges of a course, and the course designer knows how to manipulate the distances and types of obstacles to make them more difficult.

Combinations are named by their number of elements. Double and triple combinations are the most common. In general, the more elements involved, the more difficult the obstacle. However, other variables can greatly influence the difficulty:
[[Image:Coffin fence.jpg|right|thumb|A "[[coffin (jump)|coffin]]:" a cross-country combination which incorporates change in terrain, striding, and different types of obstacles.]]
# Distance between Obstacles: the course designer may shorten or lengthen the distance from the usual 12-foot stride. The most extreme case is when the designer puts enough room for a half-stride, in which case the rider must shorten or lengthen according to the horse's strengths. At the lower levels, the designer will not change the distances from what is considered "normal" for the combination. Additionally, the designer may make the distance between the first two elements of a combination ask for one type of stride—for example, very long—and the distance between the second and third elements ask for the exact opposite type of stride—in this case, very short. This tests the horse's adjustability, and can greatly enhance the difficulty of the combination.
# Types and Order of the Obstacles: Riders must adjust their horse's stride according to the type of obstacle that must be jumped, and the order they occur. For example, a vertical to [[oxer]] rides differently from an oxer to vertical. Horses take off and land at different distances from the obstacle depending on its type: usually closer for triple bars, slightly further for oxers, and even further for verticals. Other factors, such as a "spooky" fence or a [[water (obstacle)|liverpool]], may change the distances for particular horses as they back them off.
# Height of the Obstacles: The higher the fences, the less room there is for error. At the lower levels, the designer may make certain elements in the combination slightly lower, to make it easier. Fence height also has some influence on the horse's take-off distance, usually decreasing both the take-off and landing, although this is only a great variant when the fences are 4 feet 6 inches or higher.
# Terrain: this is especially a factor for eventers as they ride combinations cross-country. A combination on the downhill tends to lengthen the stride, and on the uphill it tends to shorten it. Going through water tends to shorten the stride. Landing up a bank causes a shorter landing distance than from an upright obstacle.

To negotiate a combination successfully, a rider must maintain the qualities needed in all riding: rhythm, balance, and [[impulsion]] as they approach the fence. They must also have a great understanding of their horse's stride length, so that they may know how much they need to shorten or lengthen it for each particular combination.

Before riding the course, the rider should walk the distances of the combination and decide the stride from which they should jump it.

==Corner==
[[Image:RolexKentuckyThreeDayCorner.jpg|250px|thumb|Horse and rider negotiating a corner]]
Also called an apex, corner fences are in a triangular shape with the horse jumping over one corner of the triangle.  They are similar to the "fan" jump seen in show-jumping. As the name suggests, the fence makes a "V" shape, that can have an angle up to 90 degrees.  At novice levels, the fence is formed by two angled fences, open in the center while more advanced designs have a solid triangular cover.  The corner is meant to be jumped on a line perpendicular to an imaginary bisecting line of the angle,&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; and as close to the narrow apex as possible while still far enough in on the jump that the horse knows he is supposed to go over it. If the rider aims too far toward the wider section of the obstacle, it may be too wide for the horse to clear it. This usually results in a stop or run out, although some of the braver horses might "bank" a solid corner fence (touching down on it before quickly jumping off). This is not desirable, as the horse is more likely to slip, catch a leg, or fall. If the rider aims too far toward the apex, it is very easy for the horse to run right past, especially if is unsure as to whether he is to jump the obstacle. Due to their relative difficulty, the corner is not seen at the lowest levels. The corner is a precision fence, requiring accurate riding and good training, with the horse straight and between the rider's aids. Due to the build of the fence, an uncommitted horse and rider pair may have a run-out at this type of obstacle. It is best that the rider use their aids to "block" the horse from running out to the side, with a strong contact to prevent the shoulders from popping, and a supporting leg.

==Ditch==
[[Image:Rosie thomas barrys best jubilee leap burghley 2009.jpg|thumb|Ditch obstacle]]
These fences are dropped areas in the course that may be up to 11 feet 10 inches wide in advanced competition, although they are seen at lesser widths at all levels of competition.  They can be used individually, or in combinations such as the coffin and trakehner fences.  Ditches should be ridden positively, with increased stride length and forward motion.  The rider should always focus ahead, rather than looking down into the ditch, to keep their balance aligned correctly and allow the horse to give their best effort.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Drop Fence==
[[Image:Leaping off the step into thin air.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Horse and rider negotiating a drop fence]]
These fences ask the horse to jump over a log fence and land at a lower level than the one at which they took off.  They are closely related to the bank fences.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; Many riders have fallen badly on drop fences if the horse swerves unexpectedly. Jumping drop fences places a good deal of stress on the horse's legs, and therefore practice should be kept to a minimum. To help minimise the concussion on the horse's legs, the rider should encourage it to jump the fence as conservatively as possible, with little bascule or speed, using just enough power to safely clear the log before dropping down.

Drop fences require a great deal of trust of the horse in the rider, because often the animal can not see the landing until it is about to jump. It is important for the rider to keep their leg on to the base, and not "drop" the horse before the fence, as this may result in a refusal. In the air, the rider usually allows their shoulders to move slightly forward, and lifts their seatbones off the saddle until the peak of the jump. However, as the horse descends, the rider should allow their upper body to open, keeping their body relatively upright (especially if the drop is large). If the rider continues to lean forward on landing, it is much more likely that they will topple forward and become unseated when the horse touches the ground, due to the momentum. This is especially true with drops because the landing is almost always slightly downhill, as this helps reduce concussion on the horse's legs. The rider must also be sure to slip their reins as the horse descends, allowing the horse the freedom to stretch its neck forward and down. Many riders, especially those who have only jumped in the ring, believe cross-country riders to be falling backward (or getting "left behind") when they jump a drop fence. However, it is important to note that more security is needed when jumping this type of fence than is typically required when jumping in a level arena. Additionally, the fences are solid, so the rider need not worry about dropping a rail (as would typically happen if he began sitting up too soon when riding fence in show jumping). The rider is not trying to encourage a great bascule from the horse. Although it may appear that the rider is getting left behind, a properly ridden drop fence will keep the rider centered over the horse, and still provide him enough freedom to comfortably negotiate the obstacle.

==Log Fence==
[[Image:Jonty Evans (IRL) riding round Badminton.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An oxer made out of logs]]
[[Image:Parc a mouton.png|right|thumb|Log fences used on a cross-country course]]

'''Log fences''' are obstacles that are jumped in equestrian competition, including in the cross-country phase of [[eventing]] and in hunter paces. Additionally, they may be met when [[fox hunting]]. They are the most common type of cross-country fence, includes oxers, log piles, vertical, and triple bar obstacles. The approach of these fences varies according to the height and width of the obstacle and the terrain.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Log fences differ from the usual equestrian jump, which involves removable poles set in jump cups that are attached to a standard, because they are solid and do not fall down. Therefore, the horse may touch the fence, and even scramble over it, without penalty.

However, the fact that they are solid increases the risk that horse and rider will be injured if they make a mistake: the horse may hit it so hard that the rider is launched from the saddle or the horse may stumble over it and fall on landing. In the worst-case scenario, a horse may hit the fence on his forearms, and somersault over it, which risks injury to the horse and especially the rider if the horse lands on him/her. Therefore, the rider must be especially proficient before attempting solid fences, to ensure he can approach them properly. Additionally, most riders get into a slightly more defensive seat when jumping log fences, and do not raise out of the saddle as high or fold as much, which will allow them to stay in the saddle if their horse accidentally hits the fences and stumbles on landing. This position is considered a fault when jumping [[show jumping]] fences, because the horse is always encouraged to [[bascule (horse)|bascule]] over the fence to help prevent him from touching and knocking the rails, and keeping the weight on his back encourages him to drop it instead. However, a ''slightly'' defensive position is not only acceptable when riding over solid obstacles, but in most cases ideal.

Horses will generally jump log fences quite well, as they look natural to the animal. It is best when designing and jumping such fences, however, to only ride over obstacles that have a larger log (rather than a thin, stick-like pole) as the horse will respect the jump and is more likely to jump it cleanly and boldly. Due to the risks, it is especially important to jump log fences in a forward manner with plenty of [[impulsion]] and good balance.

==Normandy bank==
[[Image:2007RolexNormandyBank0001.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Normandy bank involves a jump on, and a [[bounce (jump)|bounce]] over and off the bank.]]
A Normandy bank is a combination of obstacles. A ditch precedes the bank, so the horse must jump over the ditch and onto the bank in one leap. There is also a solid fence on the top of the bank, which may produce a drop fence to get off the obstacle, or may allow for a stride off.

Because this obstacle incorporates several different types of obstacles into one, it is considered quite difficult and is usually not seen until the upper levels. The rider not only has to worry about a bold jump over the ditch and onto the bank, but also the obstacle on the top of the bank and the quick jump off.

==Oxer==
[[Image:NIC Zuidlaren 2004 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|A parallel oxer – note the highest front and back rails are at the same height.]]
[[Image:Obst spa-1-.jpg|thumb|right|A triple bar.]]

An '''oxer''' is a type of [[equestrianism|horse jump]] with two rails that may be set even or uneven.  The width between the poles may vary. Some shows do not have oxers in the lower show jumping divisions.

There are several types of oxers:
*'''Ascending''':  the front rail is lower than the back rail. This is the easiest for the horse to jump, as it naturally fits into the animal's [[bascule (horse)|bascule]] and encourages a round and powerful jump.
*'''Descending''':  the back rail is lower than the front rail. This type is not often used, as it can cause an optical illusion for the horse. It is forbidden by the FEI because of the danger for the horse.
*'''Parallel''':  both the top front and back rail are even, but the jump is higher than it is wide.
*'''Square''':  a type of parallel oxer, where the jump's height is the same as its width. This is the hardest type of oxer seen in competition.  It is seen in jumper but not hunter competition
*'''Swedish''': a "cross-rail" type of oxer, the highest front and back rails of the oxer form an X when viewed head-on, so that one section of the jump is lower than the other sections.
*'''Triple Bar''': similar to an ascending oxer, but rather than having two rails there are three, in graduating height. This is more difficult than an ascending oxer, however, because of the added width of the third rail.
*'''Hogsback''': a type of oxer with three rails in which the tallest pole is in the center. Sometimes this kind of oxer is filled in to look like a barn or house, which is often used on cross country courses.

==Rolltop==
These jumps have a rounded half-barrel appearance on top. They can be quite wide at upper levels, and often govern respect from the horse, but are not usually considered a "scary" fence for horses on course and generally produce a good jump. A modified version of the rolltop is sometimes seen in hunter and showjumping classes.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Shark's Tooth==
These fences have a top log rail, with an inverted triangle of logs pointing downwards, resembling a shark's top jaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourbloke.com/elandlodgenew/facilities_cross-country.htm "Facilities: Cross Country Course"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520222914/http://www.tourbloke.com/elandlodgenew/facilities_cross-country.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}. ''Eland Lodge Equestrian''. Referenced February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skinny==
[[Image:Andrew hoy master monarch coutts curve burghley 2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A "skinny" requires accurate riding.]]
A "skinny" is any fence with a narrow face. These require accurate riding and the ability to keep the horse straight, as it is easy for a horse to "glance off" such narrow obstacles. Combinations involving skinnies become increasingly common as the rider moves up the levels because they reduce the degree of error that is available if the rider is to successfully negotiate the fence.

==Stone Wall==
These jumps are solid walls made out of stone or a similar material.  They sometimes have logs placed on top to make them larger or change the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/competitionnews/386/87646.html "Facing the Hickstead Derby Course"]. ''Horse and Hound''. Referenced February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunken road{{anchor|Sunken Road}}==
These are combination jumps involving banks and rails.  At the lower levels, it may consist of a bank down, with a few strides to a bank up. At the upper levels, the sunken road often is quite complicated, usually beginning with a set of rails, with either one stride or a bounce distance before the bank down, a stride in the "bottom" of the road before jumping the bank up, and another stride or bounce distance before the final set of rails.  Sunken roads are very technical, especially at the upper levels, and require accurate riding. A bad approach or extravagant jump in can possibly ruin the rider's distances, which may result in a stop from the horse, or a fall. Additionally, the quick change in the type of obstacle, from upright fence, to down bank, to upbank, makes it physically difficult for rider and horse. It thus requires that both horse and rider are balanced, and that the rider stays centered and follows the motion of their mount.
&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Table==
[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A large table]]
A table is a fence with height and width, with the top of the table being one piece of material (unlike an open oxer, which is not "filled in"). The horse is encouraged to jump over the entire obstacle at once, similar to an oxer, however there are times where the animal may accidentally touch down on, or "bank," the top. Because of this, tables should be built strongly enough to support the horse landing on it.

Tables are also usually built so that the back part is slightly higher than the front, or with a piece of wood at the back, so the horse can easily see that there is width to the obstacle and therefore judge it appropriately.

Tables can get extremely wide, and generally test the horse's scope. They are intended to be jumped at a forward pace and a slightly long stride.

==Trakehner==
[[Image:Pc trakehner2.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]
These fences consist of a rail over a ditch. The ditch can be frightening for the horse, and so this type of jump is a test of bravery. Trakehners are first seen at training level (United States), and at the higher levels they can be quite large. 
[[File:Faux_Trakehner.jpg|thumb|right|A Faux (False) Trakehner]]
A Faux (False) Trakehner is a mobile cross-country jump designed to look like a trakehner by using heavy posts or poles on the ground to simulate the front and back edges of the ditch.

Trakehners were originally fencelines that were built in drainage ditches. The Trakehnen area of East Prussia, originally wetlands, was drained by the Prussian kings in the 17th and 18th centuries, before a horse breeding program was begun. The Main Stud Trakehnen, which produced the Trakehner breed of horse, was established on the land in 1732. The large drainage ditches, with fencelines in the bottom of them, were later used as a test for the 3-year-olds for suitability for breeding and war mounts. Due to the build of the fence, the take-off spot for the horse was on the downside of the ditch, and the landing was on the upside. However, the old-style trakehner jump is not seen today, mainly because the landing was on an uphill grade, which was very punishing to the horses, even when the horse took off well. The ditch is now revetted, and the fence does not have an uphill landing.

In 1973, Rachael Bayliss and her horse, Gurgle the Greek, "cleared" a trakehner at the Badminton Horse Trials by going under it. The rules were changed after this incident, requiring the horse not only to go between the flags but also to pass over the log.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Water==
[[Image:Annabel Wigley (NZL) tackles the water.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Horse and rider negotiating a water obstacle. The rider stays well back, to avoid being thrown forward on landing.]]

These fences range in difficulty from simple water crossings at lower levels to combinations of drop fences into water, obstacles or "islands" within the water, and bank or obstacles out of the water at upper levels. The water may be no more than 14 inches deep.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Water, due to the drag it places on the horse, makes water obstacle rides different from those without the water. Drop fences in can cause the rider to come flying off on landing if he or she is not in a defensive position. The stride of the horse is shortened, which must be taken into account when designing and riding obstacles within the water. Fences within the water need to be ridden with a good deal of impulsion.

Additionally, some horses are cautious of water, and require a strong ride. Experience and confidence-building training can help to lessen any timidity from the horse.

[[Image:Kentucky Derby Days-Hopscotch.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A show jumper riding over a liverpool at a lower level competition]]
'''Water''' is often used in equestrian events as an obstacle for jumping. The water complex on a course may be as simple as a water crossing at the lowest levels of eventing, to a combination involving several jumps into and out of water at the highest levels. At all levels, however, the footing of the complex should be firm, and it is important for the competitor to walk into the water during the course walk to test the footing and deepness of the water, and any drop-off areas in the complex. If your horse does not go into water you will have a problem at almost every event you go to.  In show jumping, water is never meant to be run through but rather jumped over, and a foot in the water will count as a fault to the rider's score.

[[United States Eventing Association|USEA]] rules state (2005) that water may be no more than 14" deep.

Water crossings often include a bank or, at higher levels, a drop fence into the water [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122559/http://www.useventing.com/bios/images/Tryon%20Poggio%20ll.jpg]. There may be a fence or a bank complex in the water, and a bank out, possibly to another fence. Water is often a challenge on the cross-country course, and there are usually several riders at the largest events who get "dunked" when they reach the obstacle

There are two types of water jumps used in show jumping:

* Open Water: a large, rectangular-shaped "ditch" of water, often with a small brush (18") or a rail on one side to act as a ground line. Water jumps are one of the widest obstacles a horse will be asked to jump, with a width up to 16&amp;nbsp;ft. They should be approached strongly, with a long stride, and the rider must judge the take-off to put the horse as deep (close) to the obstacle as possible, so that the jumping effort isn't increased. Should the rider cause the horse to take off too far back, it may be near impossible for him to clear the obstacle. However, the rider should also take care not to over-ride this fence, as it may unnerve the horse and make him very difficult to get back under control afterwards. Riders and horses need to keep eyes up and not look down. Water, although it can be spooky for a horse, is usually more daunting for the rider. Open water is not used in the stadium phase of eventing.
* Liverpool [http://www.sebastiansproducts.com/bluejump-liverpool.jpg]: a show jumping obstacle that takes the form of an [[oxer]] or vertical jump with a small pool of water underneath (although some liverpools may be "dry" and just consist of a blue or black tarp). These fences tend to make the horse look down, so the horse does not focus on the actual rails it must jump and may hit the fence. Riders and horses need to keep eyes up and focused on the actual fence they must jump. Liverpools may also be found in the stadium phase of eventing.

The '''International Tent Pegging Federation''' ('''ITPF''', {{lang-ar|الاتحاد الدولی لإلتقاط الأوتاد}}), formerly known as the World Tent Pegging Federation is the international [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of [[tent pegging]]. The ITPF is responsible for the organisation of tent pegging's major international tournaments, notably the [[ITPF World Cup|World Cup]] which commenced in 2014, and other international events.

Prince Malik Atta Khan of Pakistan, pushed a meeting for all representatives of 17 countries that were participating in the World Equestrian Tent Pegging Championship in India. 

This meeting marked the beginning of Unification of Tent Pegging playing countries of the world. India through its major organiser, Equiwings Sports had sustainable conducted International and Asian Equestrian Tent Pegging Championships in 2010, 2012 prior to the World event in 2013. Mr. Ahmad Afsar's first lecture for formation of Equestrian Tent Pegging Federation was recognition of the Thrilling Sport of Tent Pegging as an Olympic discipline from International Equestrian Federation (FEI) and International Olympic Council (IOC)

'''International Workers' Olympiads''' were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SASI). It was an organisation supported by [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties and [[International Federation of Trade Unions]]. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the [[Olympic Games]]. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2012/08/01/workers-olympics |title= A workers' Olympics? |publisher= Workers' Liberty |date=1 August 2012 | language = |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays [http://www.csit.tv/en/world-sports-games the CSIT World Sports Games] are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The "World Sports Games" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|CSIT]]. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation)]] is an international Multi-Sports Organization.

== History ==
[[File:Opening march 1931 Vienna.JPG|thumb|Opening march of the 1931 Workers' Olympiad in Vienna.]]
The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]] and [[Avery Brundage]], were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace.&lt;ref name=riordan&gt;Riordan, James: ″Sport, Politics, and Communism″, p. 38–40. Manchester University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-071-90285-0-2}}. [https://books.google.fi/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=1921+olympiad+prague&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmua0exF57&amp;sig=OYtYQPyvi6_UKl2nqH2hz3z6wpk&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m9BjVaTNFYqesAHd0YHQBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucerne Sport International]] (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. The IOC had banned the losing side of the [[World War I]] from the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the "enemy" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schreiberhau]], which today is a part of [[Poland]]. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name=riordan/&gt; 

National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.helsinki.fi/shentila/files/2005/04/TUL_ja-kansainv%C3%A4linen.pdf Hentilä, Seppo: ″Työväen Urheiluliitto ja kansainvälinen työläisurheilu″] (in Finnish). University of Helsinki. Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad]] in [[Vienna]] was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] at [[Los Angeles]], both in number of participants as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm Roni Gechtman: "Socialist Sports in Yiddish – The Bundist Sport Organization Morgnshtern in Interwar Poland".] Retrieved 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praterstadion]] (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/sportamt/annodazumal/sportstaetten/stadion.html |title= Wiener Praterstadion - Ernst-Happel-Stadion - Historische Sportstätte der Stadt Wien |publisher= City of Vienna |date= | language = German|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Workers' Olympiad at [[Antwerp]] in 1937 was a joint event with the [[Red Sport International]] organized [[Spartakiads]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish (ed.): "Sports Around the World – History, Culture and Practice" (p. 463).

The '''John W. Pope Jr. Convocation Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina]]. The arena, '''Gore Arena''', is located on the campus of [[Campbell University]] and hosts the university's [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[wrestling]] programs. It is named for Gilbert Craig Gore, the late son of a Campbell alum.  The John W. Pope Jr. Convocation Center is a part of the expansion plan of Campbell's athletic facilities, which includes a new football stadium and renovations to existing Taylor Field of the baseball program. The John W. Pope Jr. Convocation Center replaced [[Carter Gymnasium]], which was the second smallest gymnasium in Division I Basketball with just 947 seats, second only to Charleston Southern's Fieldhouse which holds 750. The John W. Pope Jr. Convocation Center also host events such as the universities commencement ceremonies and other university related events.

The Pope Convocation Center will play host to the 2016 [[Big South Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]], taking place March 3–6 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news|last=Payne|first=Marilyn|title=Camels to host 2016 Big South Men's Basketball Championship|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/campbell-will-host-2016-big-south-men-s-basketball-championship/15060675/|work=[[WRAL-TV|WRALSportsFan.com]]|date=November 4, 2015|access-date=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] field in [[Lakeland, Florida]]. The 8,500-seat stadium was opened in 1966 and has had multiple renovations, most recently in 2017. It was named after local resident and former Lakeland Parks and Recreation Director Marcus "Joker" Marchant. It is the [[spring training]] home of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and the regular-season home of the minor league affiliates [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]] and [[Gulf Coast Tigers]]. 

On March 15, 2011, the largest crowd in the stadium's history (10,307 people) watched a spring training game between the [[Detroit Tigers]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spring Attendance Was 2nd All Time for Detroit Tigers|first=Tom|last=Zebold|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20110418/NEWS/110419393|newspaper=[[The Ledger]]|location=Lakeland|date=April 18, 2011|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions==
The stadium could seat 4,900 people when it opened in 1966. In 1988, a bleacher section was added down the left field line, increasing seating capacity to 7,027. In 2002, Joker Marchant Stadium was renovated. The State of Florida's $4.5 million grant was the biggest chunk of the financing, while the Polk County Tourist Development Council chipped in $2 million. The remainder of the renovation's cost was paid for by the Tigers and City of Lakeland, increasing capacity to its present 8,500.&lt;ref name="bbp"/&gt;

In October 2014, the Lakeland City Commission announced part of a new agreement with the Detroit Tigers included the start of a $37 million renovation and upgrade of the 50-year-old stadium, starting in April 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springtrainingonline.com/joker-marchant-stadium-renovations-moving-forward/ Joker Marchant Stadium Renovations on Tap (Spring Training Online)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theledger.com/article/20141006/news/141009548 The Ledger Newspaper Online]&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Major League Baseball]] [[Spring Training]]. Funding provided in part by the Detroit Tigers, the City of Lakeland and [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]]. Two construction firms Barton Malow of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]], [[Michigan]] and Rodda Construction of Lakeland were chosen by the City Commission to oversee the project. The [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]], which are the Detroit Tigers' High Class 'A' Minor League club, played their [[Florida State League]] season at [[Henley Field Ball Park|Henley Field]], 1.5 miles away.

==Naming rights==
Under a 20-year deal that ends in 2036, the stadium was renamed Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium on the first day of MLB's 2017 Spring Training. The [[Publix]] supermarket chain is headquartered in Lakeland and their hometown field is the only sports complex for which they have purchased naming rights.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/sports/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2016/8/3/lakeland_s_tigers_st.html |first=Stephanie |last=Claytor |title=Lakeland's Tigers stadium to be renamed, renovated for 2017 |website=Bright House Sports Network |date=August 5, 2016 |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catnach broomstick-wedding 1822.jpg|thumb|300px|"Marrying over the Broomstick", 1822  illustration of a "broomstick-wedding" by [[James Catnach]].&lt;ref&gt;
"Cathnach's illustrated twopenny-sheets of the 1820s carried charming drawings of broomstick weddings"  R. B. Outhwaite, ''Clandestine Marriage in England, 1500-1850'', A&amp;C Black, 1995, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=dmZ14qiH-T0C&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 140].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Jumping the broom''' (or '''jumping the besom''') is a phrase and custom relating to a [[wedding]] ceremony where the couple jumps over a broom. 
It has been suggested that the custom is based on an 18th-century idiomatic expression for "sham marriage", "marriage of doubtful validity"; it was popularized in the context of the introduction of [[civil marriage]] in Britain with the [[Marriage Act 1836]].

There have also been suggestions that the expression may derive from an actual custom of jumping over a "broomstick" (where "broom" refers to the plant ''[[common broom]]'' rather than the household implement) associated  with the [[Romani people]] of the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="Dundes, Alan page 327"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=541535|title="Jumping the Broom": On the Origin and Meaning of an African American Wedding Custom|first=Alan|last=Dundes|date=26 May 1996|publisher=|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=109|issue=433|pages=324–329|doi=10.2307/541535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  especially those  [[Welsh Kale|in Wales]].&lt;ref name="THOMPSON, T.W. p 21"&gt;Thompson, T. W. "British Gipsy Marriage and Divorce Rites", quoted in ''The Times'', Issue 54004, 21 September 1928; p.11. A paper read at the 1928 jubilee congress of the Folk Lore Society in London refers to this: "In Wales there was preserved until recently a marriage ritual of which the central feature was the jumping of the bride and bridegroom over a branch of flowering broom or over a besom made of broom."&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of a marrying couple literally jumping over a broom is now most widespread among [[African Americans]],  popularized in the 1970s by the novel and miniseries ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]''  but   originating in the mid 19th century as a practice in [[antebellum South|antebellum]] [[slavery in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Kolpas, Katie Kolpas "Practically Useless Information on Weddings" Thomas Nelson Inc, 2005 p30&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an expression for "irregular marriage"==
References to "broomstick marriages" emerged in England in the mid-to-late 18th century, always to describe a wedding ceremony of doubtful validity.  The earliest use of the phrase is in the 1764 English edition of a French work: the French text, describing an elopement, refers to the runaway couple hastily making ''un mariage sur la croix de l'épée'' (literally ‘marriage on the cross of the sword’), an expression  the English translator freely renders as ‘performed the marriage ceremony by leaping over a broomstick’.&lt;ref name="Probert"&gt;Probert, R. ''Marriage Law and Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1774 usage in the ''Westminster Magazine'' also describes an elopement.  A man who had taken his under-age bride off to France discovered it was as hard to arrange a legal marriage there as in England, but declined a suggestion that a French [[sexton (office)|sexton]] might simply read the marriage service through before the couple as "He had no inclination for a Broomstick-marriage".&lt;ref&gt;(1774) 2 ''Westminster Magazine'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789 the rumoured clandestine marriage between the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and [[Maria Fitzherbert]] is similarly referred to in a  [[satire|satirical song]] in ''[[The Times]]'': "Their way to consummation was by hopping o’er a broom, sir".&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Tuesday, 8 September 1789; pg. 4; Issue 1251; col A&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these allusions, research by the [[legal historian]] [[Rebecca Probert|Professor R. Probert]] of [[Warwick University]] has failed to find any proof of an actual contemporary practice of jumping over a broomstick as a sign of informal union.  Probert also points out that the word ''broomstick'' was used in the mid-18th century in several contexts to mean ‘something ersatz, or lacking the authority its true equivalent might possess.’ She therefore argues that because the expression ''broomstick marriage'', meaning 'sham marriage', was in circulation, [[false etymology|folk etymology]] led to a belief that people must actually have once signified irregular marriage by jumping over a broom.&lt;ref name="Probert"/&gt; Tyler D. Parry, Associate Professor of African American Studies, contests the claim that no literal jump was used in Britain, arguing that enslaved people of African descent and British migrants engaged in numerous cultural exchanges during the 18th and 19th centuries. He shows numerous correlations between the ceremonies of slaves and those of the rural British, contending it is not simply coincidental that two groups, separated by an ocean, utilized similar matrimonial forms revolving around the broomstick. If British practitioners never used a physical leap, Parry wonders how enslaved people in the US South learned of the custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=Tyler D.|title=Married in Slavery Time: Jumping the Broom in Atlantic Perspective|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=May 2015|volume=81|issue=2|pages=273–312|url=https://www.academia.edu/12373198/_Married_in_Slavery_Time_Jumping_the_Broom_in_Atlantic_Perspective_The_Journal_of_Southern_History_Vol._81_No._2_May_2015_pp._273-312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are later examples of the term ''broomstick marriage'' being used in Britain,  always with a similar implication that the ceremony so performed did not create a legally binding union.  This meaning survived into the early nineteenth century: during a case heard in London in 1824 regarding the legal validity of a marriage ceremony consisting of nothing more than the groom placing a ring on the bride's finger before witnesses, a court official commented that the ceremony "amounted to nothing more than a broomstick marriage, which the parties had it in their power to dissolve at will."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 August 1824, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later, the [[Marriage Act 1836]], which introduced civil marriage, was contemptuously referred to as the ‘Broomstick Marriage Act’ by those who felt that a marriage outside the [[Church of England|Anglican church]] did not deserve legal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson’s Oxford Journal'' 12 September 1840, p. 1; ''Saint Valentine: or, Thoughts on the evil of Love in Mercantile Community: The Galanti Show'' (1843) 13 ''Bentley’s Miscellany'' 151&lt;/ref&gt; Some also began to use the phrase to refer to non-marital unions: a man interviewed in Mayhew's ''London Labour and the London Poor'' admitted: "I never had a wife, but I have had two or three broomstick matches, though they never turned out happy."&lt;ref&gt;Volume I, Pg. 389-91. Quoted in Thomas, Donald, ''The Victorian Underworld'' John Murray, 1998. Pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tinkers]] were said to have a similar custom of marriage called "jumping the budget", with the bride and groom jumping over a string or other symbolic obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;Chesney, Kellow. ''The Victorian Underworld'' Penguin, 1970. Pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Dickens]]' novel, ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (first published in serial form in the publication ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from 1 December 1860 to August 1861), contains a reference in chapter 48 to a couple having been married "over the broomstick."  The ceremony is not portrayed, but the reference indicates that the readers would have recognized this as referring to an informal, not a legally valid, agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard-street here, had been married very young, over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man,..." DICKENS, C. ''Great Expectations'' (1860-1861), Chap. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

It has often been assumed that, in England, jumping over the broom (or sometimes walking over a broom), always indicated an irregular or non-church union (as in the expressions "Married over the [[besom]]", "living over the brush"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |last=Dundes |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Dundes
 |title='Jumping the Broom': On the Origin and Meaning of an African American Wedding Custom
 |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=109 |issue=433 |date=Summer 1996
 |page=327&lt;!--Exact page; article is pp. 324-329--&gt; |doi=10.2307/541535
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are examples of the phrase being used in the context of legal weddings, both religious and civil.&lt;ref&gt;See Dudley Heath, ‘In Coster-Land’ (1894) 125 ''English Illustrated Magazine'' 517, referring to ‘a newly-made and happy couple on their way from Bethnal Green, where, at the Red Church, they have for the sum of seven-pence halfpenny gone through the ceremony of "jumping the broomstick"’&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources have stepping over a broom as a test of chastity, while putting out a broom was also said to be a sign "that the housewife’s place is vacant" and a way, therefore, of advertising for a wife.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Whitehead, M. Terry, B. Aitken, ‘Scraps of English Folklore, XII’ (1926) 37 ''Folklore'' 76; Sheila Stewart, ''Lifting the Latch: A Life on the Land'' (Charlbury: Day Books, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In America the phrase could be used as slang describing the act of getting married legally, rather than as specifying an informal union not recognised by church or state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In a short story published in 1896 a character remarks of two lovers who are keen to wed, "Young  ‘n’ old has be’n lookin’ constant fer these two ter jump the broomstick ‘n’ give ‘em weddin’ cake, ‘n’ chicken pie."|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 March 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Romani customs==
In [[Wales]], [[Romani people|Romani]] couples would get married by [[Elopement (marriage)|eloping]], when they would "jump the broom," or over a branch of flowering [[common broom]] or a [[besom]] made of [[Broom (plant)|broom]].&lt;ref name="THOMPSON, T.W. p 21"/&gt; [[Welsh Kale]] and English [[Romanichals]] and Romanichal populations in [[Scotland]] practised the ritual into the 1900s.&lt;ref name="THOMPSON, T.W. p 21" /&gt;

According to [[Alan Dundes]] (1996), the custom originated among [[Romani people]] in Wales ([[Welsh Kale]]) and England ([[Romanichal]]).&lt;ref name = "Dundes 327"&gt;Dundes, Alan. "'Jumping the Broom': On the Origin and Meaning of an African American Wedding Custom", ''The Journal of American Folklore'', 1996, p.327.&lt;/ref&gt;

C.W. Sullivan III (1997) in a reply to Dundes argued that the custom originated among the [[Welsh people]] themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=541813|title="Jumping the Broom": A Further Consideration of the Origins of an African American Wedding Custom|first=C. W.|last=Sullivan|date=1 January 1997|publisher=|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=110|issue=436|pages=203–204|doi=10.2307/541813}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as  ''priodas coes ysgub'' ("besom wedding"),&lt;ref name="Gwynn1928"&gt;Gwynn, Gwenith (W. Rhys Jones). "'Besom Wedding' in the Ceiriog Valley", ''Folklore'', Vol. 39, No. 2, 30 June 1928, pp.149-166.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sullivan's source is the Welsh folklorist Gwenith Gwynn (a.k.a. W. Rhys Jones),&lt;ref name="Gwynn1928"/&gt; who assumed that the custom had once existed on the basis of conversations with elderly Welsh people during the 1920s, none of whom had ever seen such a practice. One had claimed that: "It must have disappeared before I was born, and I am seventy-three".&lt;!--we get it.  Others had heard of the practice, but all were unclear on the details, their evidence being peppered with phrases such as "it must have" and "I should think".--&gt;
Gwynn's dating of the custom to the 18th century rested on the assumption that it must have disappeared before these elderly interviewees were born, and on his misreading of the baptism register of the parish of [[Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog]].&lt;ref&gt;Probert, R. (2005) Chinese Whispers and Welsh Weddings, 20 ''Continuity and Change'' 211-228&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Local variations of the custom were developed in different parts of England and Wales. Instead of placing the broom on the ground, and jumping together, the broom was placed in an angle by the doorway. The groom jumped first, followed by the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T. Gwynn.

==African American custom==
[[File:Jumping the Broom2011.jpg|thumb|A 2011 wedding in California]]
In some [[African-American]] communities, marrying couples will end their ceremony by jumping over a [[broom]]stick, either together or separately. This practice is well attested for as a marriage ceremony for [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the Southern United States]] in the 1840s and 1850s who were often not permitted to wed legally.
Its revival in 20th century [[African American]] culture is due  to the  novel and miniseries ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'' (1976, 1977).&lt;ref name="Parry2011"/&gt;

[[Alan Dundes]] (1996) notes the unusual development of how "a custom which slaves were ''forced'' to observe by their white masters has been revived a century later by African Americans as a treasured tradition".&lt;ref name="Dundes 324"&gt;Dundes(1996:324-328).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been occasional speculations to the effect that  the custom may have origins in [[West Africa]], but there is no direct evidence for this, although Dundes points to a custom of [[Ghana]] where brooms were waved above the heads of newlyweds and their parents.&lt;ref name="Dundes, Alan page 326"&gt;Dundes, Alan. "'Jumping the Broom': On the Origin and Meaning of an African American Wedding Custom", ''The Journal of American Folklore'', 1996, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among southern Africans, who were largely not a part of the Atlantic slave trade, it represented the wife's commitment or willingness to clean the courtyard of the new home she had joined.&lt;ref name="Dundes, Alan page 326"/&gt; Tyler D. Parry argues the Ghanaian connection is a weak case for its origins, especially considering the ritual used by slaves bears far more similarities to the custom in the British Isles. Parry argues that, despite the racial animus that characterized the US South in the nineteenth century, poor white southerners (many of them descendants of people who used irregular forms of matrimony in Britain) and enslaved people exchanged their cultures between one another at far greater rates than commonly acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=Tyler D.|title=The Holy Land of Matrimony: The Complex LEgacy of the Bromstick Wedding in American History|journal=American Studies|date=2016|volume=55|issue=1|pages=81–106|url=https://www.academia.edu/26237514/_The_Holy_Land_of_Matrimony_The_Complex_Legacy_of_the_Broomstick_Wedding_in_American_History_American_Studies_Vol._55_No._1_2016_pp._81-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave-owners were faced with a dilemma regarding committed relationships between slaves.  While some family stability might be desirable as helping to keep slaves tractable and pacified, anything approaching a legal marriage was not.  Marriage gave a couple rights over each other which conflicted with the slave-owners’ claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=3 February 1824|page=3|title=The sort of difficulties which might arise were raised by an anti-slavery correspondent in 1824 in ''The Times'' discussing Jamaican slaves.  He asked what changes a recent increase in church marriages among them had actually achieved: "Do they legally prevent a master from separating husband and wife, at his pleasure, by sale or transfer? Do they legally bind the husband to the wife, and the wife to the husband?  Do they give to the husband the right and the means of redress against the violator of his conjugal peace?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most marriages between enslaved blacks were not legally recognized during American slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Orville W.|last= Taylor|title= Jumping the Broomstick:Slave Marriage and Morality in Arkansas|journal=The Arkansas Historical Quarterly|year=1958}} Taylor quotes from an 1882 ruling by Justice James Eakin of the Arkansas Supreme Court: 'There were no valid marriages amongst that class [the slaves], in the slave states of America before their general emancipation...'&lt;/ref&gt; as in law marriage was held to be a civil contract, and civil contracts required the consent of free persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= A Slave's Marriage Valid: Its Legality Defined|journal=New York Times|date=20 July 1876}} A New York court upheld the retrospective validity of a marriage between Anthony Jones and Patsy Minor, even though at the time and place it had been contracted such marriages between slaves were not legally recognized.  
Both Jones and Minor had been slaves in Virginia when, with consent of their respective masters, they declared an intention to live together as man and wife. Jones later died intestate in New York, leaving an estate valued at $15,000; a court ruled in favour of the claims of his widow and surviving son.&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of any legal recognition, the slave community developed its own methods of distinguishing between committed and casual unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= A Slave's Marriage Valid: Its Legality Defined|journal=New York Times|date=20 July 1876}} 'It appears by the evidence that Anthony Jones and Patsy Minor were named according to the custom among slaves, and that the distinction was recognized among slaves, and by their masters, between such lawful and illicit intercourse, and those who cohabited without such marriage were regarded as disreputable.'&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ceremonial jumping of the broom served as an open declaration of settling down in a marriage relationship. Jumping the broom was always done before witnesses as a public ceremonial announcement that a couple chose to become as close to married as was then allowed.&lt;ref&gt;In 'The Story of My Life' (1897) a white author, [[Mary Ashton Rice Livermore]], described a broomstick wedding she attended at a Virginia plantation c. 1842.  The preacher (a fellow slave) encouraged the marrying couple to see the broomstick-jumping as a serious expression of their mutual commitment, although he was well aware of the legal limitations of the ceremony. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/4728109.0001.001/263?page=root;rgn=full+text;size=100;view=image;q1=broomstick]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumping the broom fell out of practice when blacks were free to marry legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Tyler|title="An Irregular Union: Exploring the Welsh Connection to a Popular African-American Wedding Ritual" in'' Welsh Mythology and Folklore in Popular Culture: Essays on Adaptations in Literature, Film, Television, and Digital Media ''edited by Audrey L.

The practice did survive in some communities, and the phrase "jumping the broom" was synonymous with "getting married," even if the couple did not literally jump a broom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=Tyler D.|title=The Holy Land of Matrimony: The Complex Legacy of the Broomstick Wedding in American History|journal=American Studies|date=2016|volume=55|issue=1|pages=81–106|url=https://www.academia.edu/26237514/_The_Holy_Land_of_Matrimony_The_Complex_Legacy_of_the_Broomstick_Wedding_in_American_History_American_Studies_Vol._55_No._1_2016_pp._81-106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its smaller scale continuity in certain rural areas of the United States (among both black and white communities), it made a resurgence among African Americans after the publication of [[Alex Haley]]'s ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]''&lt;ref name="Parry2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Tyler|title="An Irregular Union: Exploring the Welsh Connection to a Popular African American Wedding Ritual"'' in Welsh Mythology and Folklore in Popular Culture: Essays on Adaptations in Literature, Film, Television and Digital Media ''edited by Audrey L.

Danita Rountree Green describes the African American custom as it stood in the early 1990s in her book ''Broom Jumping: A Celebration of Love'' (1992).

==In popular culture==
American singer-songwriter [[Brenda Lee]] released the [[rockabilly]] song "[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]" on Decca Records in 1959.
Via its association with [[Wales]] and the popular [[Besom#In Wicca|association of the broom with witches]], the custom has also been adopted by some [[Wiccans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/handfastings/p/BroomJumping.htm Jumping the Broom: Besom Weddings]

&lt;/ref&gt;

A film titled ''[[Jumping the Broom]]'', directed by Salim Akil, and starring [[Paula Patton]] &amp; [[Laz Alonso]] was released on 6 May 2011.

In a 2013 episode of [[Grey's Anatomy]], [[Miranda Bailey]] and Ben Warren jump over a broom at the conclusion of their wedding ceremony.

In the classic 1977 TV mini-series [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|''Roots'']], Kunta Kinte/"Toby" (played by [[John Amos|John Amos as adult Kunta Kinte - Levar Burton played the teenager Kunta Kinte]]) had a marriage ceremony where he and Belle (played by [[Madge Sinclair]]) jumped the broom.

In the 2016 film [[The Birth of a Nation (2016 film)|''The Birth of a Nation'']], a couple getting betrothed is seen jumping a broom.

In an episode of [[The Originals (season 2)]] (Episode 13 "The Devil is Damned") the custom is described as being necessary when a priest is not available and the wedding "couldn't wait."

The custom has been reference twice by rap duo [[Outkast]]: in "Call the Law" on their 2006 album ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]'' and in 2007 song [[International Players Anthem (I Choose You)]].

The '''Lunada Bay Boys''' or simply the '''Bay Boys''', are a [[surfer]] [[gang]] in [[Palos Verdes Estates]], [[California]], known for their aggressive [[Surf culture#Localism|localism]]. In 2016, ''[[Newsweek]]'' called the Lunada Bay Boys "America's most notorious surf gang".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/lunada-bay-boys-surfing-gang-480473&lt;/ref&gt; The group's territorialism of the Lunada Bay public beach has caused controversy in the legal and surfing worlds. Although the Bay Boys are now often considered a gang, the group had non-violent beginnings in the 1960s as a self-described surfing "family" or [[fraternity]].

==History==
Historically [[Lunada Bay]] had been considered an acclaimed [[big wave surfing|big wave]] winter surf spot, with a [[surf break|right-hand break]].&lt;ref name="HamburgerHill"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.easyreadernews.com/bavada-at-lunada-second-helpings-hamburger-hill-2/ |title=Bravada at Lunada: Second Helpings of Hamburger Hill |newspaper=[[Easy Reader]] |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5Most"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mondy |first=Ben |url=http://www.grindtv.com/surf/surfings-5-most-fiercely-protected-local-breaks/ |title=5 of surfing’s most fiercely protected local breaks |publisher=Grind TV |date=May 27, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of Palos Verdes surfing clubs extends back as far the 1930s with groups such as the Palos Verdes Surfing Club.&lt;ref name="HamburgerHill" /&gt;

The Lunada Bay Boys started in the 1960s as a [[fraternity]] of local surfers in the Palos Verdes region. An anonymous member stated, "It was more like a big family. I wouldn’t call it a gang. We used to camp down there every other night. We would almost live down there." The group wasn't known for its localism during the 1960s, and surfers within the group were not as prone to violence. At the time, the Lunada Bay Boys wasn't the only surf crew in the city and neighbored the "[[Portuguese Bend]] crew" (Portuguese Bend Club) as well as the "Haggerty's crew" (Haggerty's Surfing Club) of their respective surf spots.&lt;ref name="LunadaHistory"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilolla |first=Ed |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20160514/bay-boys-history-times-leadership-change-in-lunada-bay |title=Bay Boys history: Times, leadership change in Lunada Bay |publisher=The Daily Breeze |newspaper=The Daily Breeze |date=May 14, 2016 |accessdate=June 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time, localism of surf spots was considered common sense due to outside surfers often causing boards to fall in the rocks due to lack of leashes at the time. [[Big wave surfing]] pioneer [[Greg Noll]] as well as U.S. champion Mike Purpus of Redondo Beach would surf with the Bay Boys in Lunada Bay during this era.&lt;ref name="LunadaHistory" /&gt; The acclaim of Lunada Bay as a surf spot led to the creation of Lunada Bay Wetsuits in the late '60s. Mike Purpus and surfers [[Dewey Weber]], Collie Ragland, Don Craig, and [[Donald Takayama]] would model for these Lunada Bay Wetsuits ads.&lt;ref name="HamburgerHill"/&gt; Around this time, members would hang out on a rock ledge, however in the late 60s, a stone balcony was created on the shoreline of Lunada Bay, as a hangout for local surfers (often referred to as their "fort").&lt;ref name="LunadaHistory" /&gt;

In the 1970s a leadership shift happened in which older members moved away, and newer members surfaced into leadership. Older members of the group were stated to have "kept it safe and sane", whereas the newer leadership began to hassle outsiders more directly.&lt;ref name="LunadaHistory" /&gt; A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed that the reason violence escalated in years after was because the younger generation sought to show devotion to the territory in the presence of veteran members.&lt;ref name="OutofLove"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20161114/accused-lunada-bay-boy-recorded-saying-harassment-is-all-out-of-love |title=Accused Lunada Bay Boy recorded saying harassment is ‘all out of love.’ |publisher=Daily Breeze |date=November 11, 2016 |accessdate=September 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
In the 1960s the Lunada Bay Boys culture was mostly nonviolent and held close alliances with the neighboring Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Activities of the original generation included camping down at the beach, fishing, diving, or shaping their surf boards in their shops. Becoming a member of the group was more relaxed and involved no more than to be a local.&lt;ref name="LunadaHistory" /&gt;

One local told ''Stab'' magazine that approximately one quarter to one half of local surfers in Lunada Bay are members of the Lunada Bay Boys.&lt;ref name="STAB"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Jeb |url=http://stabmag.com/news/so-who-the-hell-are-the-lunada-bay-boys/ |title=So, Who The Hell Are The Lunada Bay Boys? |magazine=Stab |date=2017 |accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common acts of localism by the Bay Boys include hassling people, intimidation, vandalizing vehicles, slashing tires, throwing rocks, and inciting violence against non-locals.&lt;ref name="TurfWar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-04/local/me-5657_1_lunada-bay |title=Turf War Between Surfers in Lunada Bay Is Settled |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 4, 1996 |accessdate=January 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianVideo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Rory |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/18/california-surf-wars-lunada-bay-localism-surfing |title=California's surf wars: wave 'warlords' go to extreme lengths to defend their turf |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 18, 2015 |accessdate=January 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed his feelings on localism stating, "If we let every nice guy surf, there’d be a hundred guys out here. You have to nip it in the bud. The reason it’s not crowded is that people protect it. It’s fucked, dude. People think we’re a bunch of assholes, but you know what? We want to keep it like this so we can go somewhere where it’s fucking sacred."&lt;ref name="GuardianVideo" /&gt;

==Legality and lawsuits==
The Palos Verdes Estates Police Department has been criticized for not taking effective legal action against the Lunada Bay Boys, with the ''LA Times'' reporting that "city leaders repeatedly downplayed the alleged harassment by the Bay Boys against other surfers at Lunada Bay".&lt;ref name="BothSides"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Milena, Diana (Defendant); Ponce, Frank (Palos Verdes Resident) |date=Oct 4, 2016 |title=Both Sides of Lunada Bay Localism Lawsuit Speak Out |medium=Short video |location=Palos Verdes Estates |publisher=The Inertia |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0FKWGP2DJM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes-PalosVerdesOfficials"&gt;{{cite web |last=Therolf |first=Garrett |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-surf-gang-20160509-story.html |title=Surfer gang harassment allegations dismissed by Palos Verdes officials, records sho |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 15, 2017 |accessdate=September 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Jeff Kepley has acknowledged that officers in his department "may have relationships with surfers accused of tormenting outsiders."&lt;ref name="Probe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20170805/probe-finds-hundreds-could-have-known-about-foiled-bay-boys-sting-operation |title=Probe finds ‘hundreds’ could have known about foiled Bay Boys sting operation |newspaper=Daily Breeze |date=August 5, 2017 |accessdate=September 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, surfer Diana Milena Reed and her lawyer sought an injunction against alleged members of the Lunada Bay Boys, to keep them from surfing at Lunada Bay. This lawsuit included claims of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name="BothSides"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Milena, Diana (Defendant); Ponce, Frank (Palos Verdes Resident) |date=Oct 4, 2016 |title=Both Sides of Lunada Bay Localism Lawsuit Speak Out |medium=Short video |location=Palos Verdes Estates |publisher=The Inertia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OutofLove" /&gt; The defendants denied Reed's allegations.

The '''Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium''' ({{lang-mr|महाराष्ट्र क्रिकेट असोसिएशन स्टेडियम}}) is a [[cricket stadium]] located at Gahunje, [[Pimpri Chinchwad]], [[Pune]], [[India]].

It serves as the home stadium for the [[Maharashtra cricket team]] including headquarters for the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association]]. 

With India having the largest cricket audience in the world and Indian influence in international cricket growing, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed. [[Hopkins Architects]] of [[London]] was commissioned to design a new 37,000 seat stadium in Pimpri Chinchwad and the stadium was the result. As of 19 Aug, 2017 it has hosted 1 Test, 3ODIs and 2 T20Is. 

[[File:Sahara Stadium.jpg|thumb|MCA stadium from outside]]

The MCA Stadium was inaugurated in April 2012 by Shri Shantanu Sarnayak of Akola (the former health minister's grandson) and the first match was played between [[Kings XI Punjab]] and [[Pune Warriors]] in April 2012. The first [[Twenty20 International]] match at the stadium was played between [[Indian cricket team|India]] and [[England cricket team|England]] in December 2012. The first [[Test cricket|Test]] match at the venue was played between [[Australian cricket team in India in 2016–17|India and Australia]] in February 2017.&lt;ref name="MCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-australia-2016-17/content/story/1083824.html |title=Australia brace for tough road test on Pune's debut |accessdate=22 February 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|List of international cricket centuries on Indian cricket grounds}}

The MCA's decision to build a new Cricket stadium in [[Pune]] stemmed from a dispute with the [[Pune Municipal Corporation]]{{cn|date=April 2012}}, regarding ticket allocations for [[Nehru Stadium, Pune|Nehru Stadium]]. This conflict came to a head when an international match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] was moved to [[Kolkata]], with the MCA stating they were in no position to host the match. Following this, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed.

MCA Pune was inaugurated by the then [[List of ICC presidents|ICC President]] and [[Minister for Agriculture (India)|Agriculture Minister]] [[Sharad Pawar]] on 1 April 2012.&lt;ref name=ndtvapr12&gt;{{cite news|title=International cricket stadium inaugurated near Pune|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/international-cricket-stadium-inaugurated-near-pune-192642?pfrom=home-cities|accessdate=2 April 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Indian company [[Sahara India Pariwar]] bought the naming rights and the stadium was renamed the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium. However, the name was changed back to the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium because Sahara paid only a part of the Rs. 200 crore that it had promised when acquiring the rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/naming-rights-tussle-sahara-stadium-to-go-by--mca--name/1167970/ Naming rights tussle: Sahara stadium to go by ‘MCA’ name]. Indian Express (2013-09-12). Retrieved on 2013-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the stadium was selected as one of the six new Test venues along with [[Holkar Stadium]], [[JSCA International Stadium Complex]], [[Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], [[Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium]] and [[Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/938911.html|title=BCCI revamps selection committee, announces new Test centres|work=espncricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

The stadium was designed by British architecture company, [[Hopkins Architects]]. Its original completion date was November 2010 at a cost of Rs 1.50&amp;nbsp;billion, covering and area of {{convert|35|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pune-to-have-own-cricket-stadium/230931/ |title=Pune to have own cricket stadium |publisher=Indian Express |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stadium was ready by 2012. As a result, the stadium was not able to host [[ICC Cricket World Cup]] matches as originally intended.

The site is located close to the [[Mumbai Pune Expressway]], just outside the city of [[Pune]], with dramatic views of the surrounding mountains.

The stadium and the seating arrangement have been designed in such a way that an unobstructed view is assured from each location.

The most important feature of this stadium is the rainwater drainage system. Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour. To overcome this problem, MCA opted for sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drained out fast making it ready for play again just in few minutes.&lt;ref name="MCA Stadium" /&gt;

===Notable Events===

In 2018 IPL, due to members of a few fringe political parties staging protests outside the [[M. A. Chidambaram Stadium]], [[Chennai]] as well as several parts of Chennai demanding the IPL matches to be moved out of the city until the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) was set up as directed by the honourable Supreme Court of India. Despite tight security for the match against KKR, the Chennai police expressed their inability in ensuring enough personnel at the venue for the smooth conduct of the remaining games. MCA Stadium in Pune was selected to host remaining six home games of [[Chennai Super Kings]]

== Controversy ==
In October 2017 a stadium groundsman, Pandurang Salgaoncar, was sacked after video emerged of him allegedly agreeing to tamper with the [[wicket]] before a one-day international between [[New Zealand cricket team in India in 2017–18|India and New Zealand]]. 

The sting operation was conducted by [[India Today (TV channel)|India Today TV]]. They captured Salgaoncar on camera allegedly stating he would prepare the pitch to suit two unnamed bowlers.

The second ODI went ahead on schedule after the pitch had been inspected by match referee Chris Broad.

The India Today footage of Salgaoncar speaking with a reporter, who was posing as a [[Bookmaker (gambling)|bookmaker]], was broadcast a few hours before the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/41753622|title=India v New Zealand: Groundsman sacked after TV sting tampering claims|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mannofield Park''' is a [[cricket]] ground in the [[Mannofield]] district of [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.

The cricket ground is the regular home of the [[Scotland national cricket team]] and [[Aberdeenshire Cricket Club]]. It is also known as Citylets Mannofield for international fixtures.

==History==
The first recorded match on the ground dates back to 1879 when [[Aberdeen University]] played [[Edinburgh University]]. The first first-class match to be held on the ground came in 1930 when Scotland played [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]]. The ground has been host to many great cricketing names over the years, most notably Sir Donald Bradman, who scored his last first class century on British soil at the ground in 1948.

The ground has since played host to 12 first-class matches, the last of which came in August 2009 when Scotland played Ireland in the [[2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup]].

The ground has also played host to 12 [[One Day Internationals]], the first of which came in the [[2008 Associates Tri-Series in Scotland]] when Ireland played [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]]. The last One Day International to date came in May 2014 when Scotland lost to England.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been selected to host Scotland's [[2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship|World Cricket League]] and [[2015–17 ICC Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] matches in August 2016.&lt;ref name="ScotRound4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-intercontinental-cup-2015-17/content/story/997909.html |title=Scotland to host UAE in August |accessdate=14 April 2016 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nyayo National Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Nairobi]], Kenya. It is located near the city centre. The stadium was built in 1983 for a capacity of 30,000. It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches. The popular [[AFC Leopards]] football club plays most of its home games at Nyayo stadium. The stadium is also used for [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] and various ceremonies. Other facilities at the Nyayo Stadium include a gymnasium and a 50-metre swimming pool. Rugby union club [[Mwamba RFC]] used the Nyayo National Stadium for home games.

The completion of the Nyayo Stadium gave Kenya the opportunity to be placed in the category of nations that were invited to bid for the [[1987 All-Africa Games|4th All-Africa Games]] in 1987, a bid that was awarded to Kenya, giving it International status. In essence, the Nyayo Stadium "gave birth" to [[Moi International Sports Centre]].

The Nyayo Stadium was the host venue of the [[2010 African Championships in Athletics]].

The stadium was renamed to the '''[[Coca-Cola]] National Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Nyayo National Stadium renamed in $1.5M  |publisher=variouse  |url=http://www.kenyafootball.com/index.php?doc=story&amp;id=3426&amp;categ=1&amp;PHPSESSID=881b3f89f8675c3afa5aac040f1a08bd  |accessdate=4 February 2009  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713144449/http://www.kenyafootball.com/index.php?doc=story&amp;id=3426&amp;categ=1&amp;PHPSESSID=881b3f89f8675c3afa5aac040f1a08bd  |archivedate=13 July 2011  |df=dmy-all  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; after the multi-national company won the naming rights to the stadium in February 2009. The deal was worth USD 1.5 million and would have seen the beverage company do branding, marketing and naming to the whole stadium for three years. Three months later, however, Coca Cola withdrew from the contract, because the Kenyan government wanted to have the stadium branded as Coca Cola Nyayo National Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Nyayo Stadium no longer on the Coke side of life  |publisher=Daily Nation
  |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/sports/football/-/1102/601640/-/10enrmm/-/
  |accessdate=26 May 2009  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but was renamed again to the Nyayo National Stadium, as the [[Government of Kenya]] wanted it branded. This decision has been widely criticised by many Kenyan citizens, because they believe that Coca-Cola would have heavily improved and popularised the stadium.

The stadium houses headquarters for the [[Football Kenya Federation]] and [[Athletics Kenya]].

The venue was opened in 1967 by GC "Pete" Ashlock and was sold in 1981 to Edward Gossett (Eddie Graham) and renamed after [[professional wrestler]] and [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] [[Eddie Graham]].  After his death the venue transferred to Mike Graham and later, Tony Andrews. It closed in 1993 and was demolished in 1995.

During its existence, it hosted numerous concerts, professional wrestling and boxing contests.&lt;ref name=Info&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cwfarchives.com/Location.php?id=13 | title=Archives of Championship Wrestling from Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena played host to [[rock band]] [[Led Zeppelin]] on August 31, 1971 and the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] concert tour on April 23, 1976, headed by [[Bob Dylan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bjorner.com/DSN03275%201976%20Rolling%20Thunder%20Revue%20II.htm | title=STILL ON THE ROAD 1976 ROLLING THUNDER REVUE II}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Elvis Presley]] who played there on February 15, 1977, six months before his death.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} 
[[The Beach Boys]], [[Edgar Winter]] and [[Deep Purple]] played concerts there. Former world champion kick boxer [[Don "The Dragon" Wilson]] from Cocoa Beach fought there. [[George Wallace]] campaigned for president there.

The building was a basic indoor arena, no air conditioning, concrete floor, wood plank benches, and plywood doors on the stalls in the bathroom. It was closed by the [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] Building Department because of code violations and was demolished in November 1995. The land on which it stood is now occupied by a [[housing development]] called Econ River Estates.&lt;ref name=Info /&gt;

'''[[Panama]]''' competed in the '''[[2008 Summer Olympics]]''' which was held in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China]] from August 8 to August 24, 2008.  Yesika Jimenez was the delegation's [[2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers|flagbearer]] at the [[Olympic Games#Opening|Opening Ceremony]].&lt;ref name="flag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/08/content_9054194.htm|title=Flag-bearers for Beijing Olympic Games opening ceremony_English_Xinhua|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama's participation was initially uncertain.  The country was suspended by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in July 2007, due to what was described as government interference in Panama's [[National Olympic Committee]].  The suspension was lifted in April 2008, enabling the country's athletes to compete for qualification at the Beijing Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishnewspanama.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=572&amp;Itemid=1|title=IOC Lifts Olympic Ban on Panama|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Said regularly played for the [[Brunei national football team]] at the [[Southeast Asian Games]] of the nineties, scoring five (known) goals. He scored twice in two defeats at the group stage of the [[Football at the 1993 Southeast Asian Games|17th SEA Games]] held in [[Singapore]] in 1993, against [[Laos national football team|Laos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XOoVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3983%2C3124216|title=Laos shock Brunei|via=Google News Archive Search|date=8 June 1993|publisher=New Straits Times|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XuoVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6002%2C3780279|title=A winning start|via=Google News Archive Search|date=10 June 1993|publisher=New Straits Times|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later in [[Indonesia]], Said scored Brunei's solitary goal of the [[Football at the 1997 Southeast Asian Games|19th SEA Games]] against [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] in a 1-6 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South East Asian Games 1997 (Jakarta, Indonesia)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/sea97.html|date=17 September 2001|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Brunei]] hosted the SEA Games in [[1999 Southeast Asian Games|1999]], Said scored twice in Brunei's opening group stage match against [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]] in a 3-3 draw.

'''Sixways Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Worcester]], [[England]].  It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Worcester Warriors]]. The stadium is able to hold 11,499 with parking for 1,000 cars, Sixways has 60 modern meeting and event rooms .&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.warriors.co.uk/club/about.php | title=About Sixways Stadium | publisher=[[Worcester Warriors]] | accessdate=31 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705133124/http://www.warriors.co.uk/club/about.php | archivedate=5 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground opened 1975 and is located off junction 6 of the [[M5 motorway]], which splits into six directions, hence the name Sixways. The Stadium commenced building on the site of the old 3rd team pitch and club house after a lottery grant in 1998.

On 7 April 2016 it was announced that Sixways' pitch would be converted to the latest technology [[artificial grass]] ahead of the 2016&amp;ndash;17 season. Sixways will become the third premiership venue with an artificial pitch after [[Barnet Copthall|Allianz Park]] and [[Kingston Park (stadium)|Kingston Park]] but the first to feature organic infill rather than rubber crumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/sport/wrfc/news/14411062.Worcester_Warriors_to_install_synthetic_pitch_for_next_season/|title=Worcester Warriors to install synthetic pitch for next season|website=Worcester Warriors|publisher=Worcester News|last1=Berkely|first1=Geoff|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Stand ==
The main focal point of Sixways Stadium is the magnificent East Stand which was completed in 2008 and has become one of the iconic images of Worcester on arrival in the city from the M5.

The multimillion-pound development on the east side of the stadium complex includes The PitchView Restaurant, The Business Club, The Duckworth Suite, The Worcester Suite, The Hindlip Suite and many boxes which are utlilised every day of the year. Below the stand is the Slick Systems Supporters bar area for fans to enjoy on matchdays and many food outlets and programme booths.

The entrance to the East Stand is through the main glass fronted club reception which is also home to the Sixways Store and Warriors Ticket Office which are open throughout the week.

== West Stand ==
The popular West Stand at Sixways Stadium has become a key gathering point for fans on matchdays as the most established stand at the home of the Warriors. The West Stand houses the Clubhouse Bar which offers a wide selection of draught and bottled beer. There is also a separate food counter serving hot snacks and in front of the bar is a large standing area to take in all the action.

The Sixways Premier Suites Upper and Lower are located to the south end of the stand and offer a large bar area and dance floor with a live band after every game. A lively and friendly sociable atmosphere is guaranteed to greet both home and away supporters after the action!

Above the Clubhouse Bar on the second floor is the International Bar which is full of rugby memorabilia past and present - and offers a fantastic view of all the action! Opposite is the Hallmark Bar which hosts an exclusive bar and dining area open to West Stand Debenture holders.

The West Stand is also home to the indoor training centre, changing rooms and rugby department offices which become the main training area for the Warriors during the week.

== South Stand ==
Standing proud behind the posts at Sixways Stadium, the South Stand is a busy and lively place to watch the action unfold on a big Warriors match day. The stand hosts 30 hospitality boxes for supporters to take in all the action over two floors with spacious bar areas to the rear.

The South Stand Terrace, in the middle of the stand, is a busy bar area where supporters can meet and enjoy food and drink before, during and after the kick-off at Warriors.

== North Stand ==
The all-seater North Stand gives supporters the chance to get close up to the action with easy access to bars to the left and right of the stand on match days. Popular with groups, the stand also hosts many of our Family Season Tickets. One of the most easily accessible areas of the stadium and with reasonably priced tickets, this stand often attracts many newcomers to the game eager to enjoy a Warriors fixture. Plans have been approved to increase the North Stand at Sixways Stadium to make it the same size as the Slick Systems Stand in years to come and complete an impressive looking front to the complex on arrival.

==Finals==
The stadium hosted the [[2009–10 LV Cup]] final on 21 March 2010 between [[Northampton Saints]] and [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]]. Northampton won 30–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8571457.stm | title=Northampton 30-24 Gloucester | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=21 March 2010 | accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixways hosted the [[2011–12 LV Cup]] final on 18 March 2012 between [[Leicester Tigers]] and [[Northampton Saints]]. Leicester won 26–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/matchcentre/fixtures/1361.php | title=Leicester Tigers 26 - 14 Northampton Saints | publisher=premiershiprugby.com | date=18 March 2012 | accessdate=31 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107124338/http://www.premiershiprugby.com/matchcentre/fixtures/1361.php | archivedate=7 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also hosted the [[2012–13 LV Cup]] final on 17 March 2013.  [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] defeated [[Sale Sharks]] 32–14 in front of 8,100 spectators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/matchcentre/fixtures/23547.php | title=Harlequins 32 - 14 Sale Sharks | publisher=premiershiprugby.com | date=17 March 2013 | accessdate=31 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924081242/http://www.premiershiprugby.com/matchcentre/fixtures/23547.php | archivedate=24 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained a place in the [[2013–14 Heineken Cup]] as a result.

The stadium has also hosted the [[Britbowl]], the championship game of British [[American Football]] twice, in 2010 and 2016.  [[London Blitz (American football)|London Blitz]] played in both finals, beating [[Coventry Jets]] 34-20 in 2010 and losing to [[London Warriors]] 36-15 in 2016.

'''Swimmer’s itch''' or '''cercarial dermatitis''', is a short-term [[Allergy|allergic]] [[immune reaction]] occurring in the [[Human skin|skin]] of humans that have been infected by water-borne [[schistosomatidae|schistosomes]]. Symptoms, which include itchy, raised [[papules]], commonly occur within 1–2 days of infection and do not generally last more than 2–3 weeks. However, people repeatedly exposed to cercariae develop heavier symptoms with faster onset.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macháček|first=Tomáš|last2=Turjanicová|first2=Libuše|last3=Bulantová|first3=Jana|last4=Hrdý|first4=Jiří|last5=Horák|first5=Petr|last6=Mikeš|first6=Libor|date=2018-10-09|title=Cercarial dermatitis: a systematic follow-up study of human cases with implications for diagnostics|journal=Parasitology Research|volume=117|issue=12|pages=3881–3895|language=en|doi=10.1007/s00436-018-6095-0|pmid=30302587|issn=0932-0113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cercarial dermatitis is common in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats worldwide.&lt;ref name="cercderm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schistosomes.net/cercderm.html|title=Avian Schistosome Biodiversity|website=www.schistosomes.net|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] may be on the rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring. Nevertheless, the condition has been regarded as [[emerging infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horák|first=Petr|last2=Mikeš|first2=Libor|last3=Lichtenbergová|first3=Lucie|last4=Skála|first4=Vladimír|last5=Soldánová|first5=Miroslava|last6=Brant|first6=Sara Vanessa|date=January 2015|title=Avian schistosomes and outbreaks of cercarial dermatitis|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=28|issue=1|pages=165–190|doi=10.1128/CMR.00043-14|issn=1098-6618|pmc=4284296|pmid=25567226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no permanent effects to people from this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/news/weekly/article/?id=1123|title=With warm weather, Swimmers Itch makes annual appearance|website=dnr.wi.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orally administered [[hydroxyzine]], an [[antihistamine]], is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in [[oatmeal]], [[baking soda]], or [[Epsom salt]]s can also provide relief of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/swimmersitch/faqs.html In CDC. "Swimmers Itch FAQS." retrieved May 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Swimmer’s itch probably has been around as long as humans. The condition was known to exist as early as the 1800s, but it was not until 1928 that a biologist found that the [[dermatitis]] was caused by the larval stage of a group of [[flatworm]] [[parasite]]s in the family [[Schistosomatidae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/wrd-swas-itchbrochure_445468_7.pdf|title=Swimmer's Itch in Michigan|date=2014|website=|publisher=State of Michigan|access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genus|genera]] most commonly associated with swimmer’s itch in humans are ''[[Trichobilharzia]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and ''[[Gigantobilharzia]]''. It can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as ''Schistosomatium douthitti'', which infects snails and [[rodent]]s. Other [[taxon|taxa]] reported to cause the reaction include ''Bilharziella polonica'' and ''Schistosoma bovis''. In [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[habitat]]s, especially along the [[coast]]s, swimmer’s itch can occur as well.&lt;ref name=Brant&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brant S, Cohen A, James D, Hui L, Hom A, Loker E |title=Cercarial Dermatitis Transmitted by Exotic Marine Snail |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1357–65 |year=2010 |pmid=20735918 |doi=10.3201/eid1609.091664 |pmc=3294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These parasites use both [[freshwater snail]]s and [[vertebrates]] as hosts in their [[parasitic life cycles]] as follows:
# Once a schistosome egg is immersed in [[water]], a short-lived, non-feeding, free-living stage known as the [[miracidium]] emerges. The miracidium uses [[cilium|cilia]] to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, a [[freshwater snail]].
# After infecting a snail, it develops into a mother [[Apicomplexa lifecycle stages|sporocyst]], which in turn undergoes [[asexual reproduction]], yielding large numbers of daughter sporocysts, which asexually produce another short-lived, free-living stage, the [[cercaria]]. 
# Cercariae use a tail-like appendage (often forked in [[genus|genera]] causing swimmer’s itch) to swim to the surface of the water; and use various physical and chemical cues in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercariae cannot infect humans, but they cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly [[itch]]y spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each papule corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite.[[File:Cercarial_LifeCycle.png|thumbnail|Life-cycle of swimmers itch]]
# After locating a bird, the parasite penetrates through the skin (usually the feet), dropping the forked tail in the process. Inside the circulatory system, the immature worms ([[schistosomulum|schistosomula]]) develop into mature male and female worms, mate and migrate through the host’s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of ''[[Trichobilharzia regenti|T. regenti]]'') to the final location (veins feeding the gastrointestinal tract) within the host body. There they lay eggs in the small veins in the intestinal mucosa from which they make their way into the lumen of the gut, and are dumped into the water when the bird defecates. One European species, ''[[Trichobilharzia regenti]]'', instead infects the bird host’s [[Nose|nasal]] [[Biological tissue|tissues]] and larvae hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue during drinking/feeding of the infected birds.&lt;ref&gt;Horák, P., Kolářová, L. &amp; Dvořák, J. 1998: ''Trichobilharzia regenti'' n. sp. (Schistosomatidae, Bilharziellinae), a new nasal schistosome from Europe. Parasite, 5, 349-357. {{doi|10.1051/parasite/1998054349}} {{pmid|9879557}} ([http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/pdf/1998/04/parasite1998054p349.pdf Free PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
[[File:Schistosomal cercaria.jpg|thumbnail|Image of infectious cercariae]]
Humans usually become infected after swimming in [[lake]]s or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely in the morning and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe&lt;ref name="Chamot"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chamot E, Toscani L, Rougemont A |title=Public health importance and risk factors for cercarial dermatitis associated with swimming in Lake Leman at Geneva, Switzerland |journal=Epidemiol. Infect. |volume=120 |issue=3 |pages=305–14 |year=1998 |pmid=9692609 |doi= 10.1017/S0950268898008826|url= |pmc=2809408}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindblade KA |title=The epidemiology of cercarial dermatitis and its association with limnological characteristics of a northern Michigan lake |journal=J.

Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines.&lt;ref name="leighton"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leighton BJ, Zervos S, Webster JM |title=Ecological factors in schistosome transmission, and an environmentally benign method for controlling snails in a recreational lake with a record of schistosome dermatitis |journal=Parasitol.

Parasitol. |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=697–704 |year=2004 |pmid=15357056 |doi= 10.1645/GE-237R|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host [[skin]] include [[saturated fat|unsaturated]] [[fatty acids]], such as [[Linoleic acid|linoleic]] and [[α-Linolenic acid|linolenic]] acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in [[sun lotion]]s and creams based on [[plant oils]].

==Control==
[[Image:Lake Annecy.jpg|right|thumb|Mechanical removal of snails in [[Lake Annecy]], [[France]]]]
Various strategies targeting the [[mollusc]] and [[bird|avian]] [[Host (biology)|host]]s of schistosomes, have been used by lakeside residents in recreational areas of North America to deal with outbreaks of swimmer's itch. In [[Michigan]], for decades, authorities used [[copper sulfate]] as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because:
 
* Snails become tolerant
* Local water chemistry reduces the molluscicide's efficacy
* Local currents diffuse it
* Adjacent snail populations repopulate a treated area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blankespoor, H. D., Reimink, R. L.|title=The control of swimmer's itch in Michigan: Past, present, and future |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=7–23 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, perhaps, [[copper sulfate]] is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on [[aquatic ecosystem]]s are not well understood.

Another method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America&lt;ref name=leighton/&gt; and [[Lake Annecy]] in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering [[praziquantel]] to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blankespoor, C. L., Reimink, R. L., Blankespoort, H. D. |title=Efficacy of praziquantel in treating natural schistosome infections in common mergansers |journal=Journal of Parasitology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=424–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11318576 |doi= 10.1645/0022-3395(2001)087[0424:EOPITN]2.0.CO;2|url=|title-link=common merganser }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent [[DEET]] prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salafsky, B., Ramaswamy, K., He, Y. X., Li, J., Shibuya, T. |title=Development and evaluation of LIPODEET, a new long-acting formulation of N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) for the prevention of schistosomiasis |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=743–50 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10586906 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10586906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.

'''Verizon Arena''' (formerly known as the '''Alltel Arena''') is an 18,000-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]], directly across the [[Arkansas River]] from downtown [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. The arena opened in October 1999. It is Little Rock's main entertainment venue.

The [[Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans]] played home games at the arena from the time when the arena opened until the team moved in 2005 to a new arena, the [[Jack Stephens Center]], on the school's campus in Little Rock. The [[Arkansas RiverBlades]], a defunct [[ice hockey]] team of the [[ECHL]], the [[Arkansas RimRockers]], a defunct minor league [[basketball]] team of the [[NBA Development League]], and the [[Arkansas Diamonds (indoor football)|Arkansas Diamonds]], a defunct [[Indoor Football League]] team, also played at the arena. The arena is also used for other events, including concerts, rodeos, auto racing, professional wrestling, and trade shows and conventions.

==History==
On August 1, 1995, [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], voters approved a one-year, one-cent sales tax for the purpose of building a multi-purpose arena, expanding the [[Statehouse Convention Center]] in Little Rock, and making renovations to the Main Street bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock. $20 million of the sales tax proceeds went toward the Convention Center expansion, with the remainder used to build the arena.

That money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the State of Arkansas, $17 million from private sources and $7 million from Little Rock-based [[Alltel]] Corporation paid for the construction of a {{convert|377000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} arena, which cost nearly $80 million to build. When the doors opened in 1999, the facility was paid for and there was no public indebtedness.

Two sites in North Little Rock drew interest from county officials for the proposed arena. The first was a {{convert|19.5|acre|m2|sing=on}} commercial site west of Interstate 30, which contained a strip mall, a Kroger and an abandoned K-Mart storefront. The second site was an {{convert|11.6|acre|m2|sing=on}} plot at the foot of the Broadway Bridge.

The Pulaski County Multipurpose Civic Center Facilities Board selected the larger site for the arena in 1996 and paid $3.7 million for the land, some of which was acquired through eminent domain, a move protested in court by several landowners.
[[File:AlltelArenaFromLittleRock.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Although located in [[North Little Rock]], Verizon Arena can be seen across the [[Arkansas River]] from a number of locations in [[Little Rock]].]]

The second site later would be chosen for the new baseball stadium, [[Dickey-Stephens Park]], constructed for the [[Arkansas Travelers]]. The Class AA minor-league baseball team moved from the then 73-year-old [[Ray Winder Field]] in Little Rock to a new $28 million home in North Little Rock at the start of the 2007 season.

The arena was the home of the 2003, 2006, and 2009 [[Southeastern Conference]] women's basketball tournament and the 2000 [[Sun Belt Conference]] men’s basketball tournament. The Arena holds the all-time attendance record for an SEC Women's Tournament when 43,642 people attended the event in 2003.

The arena hosted portions of the first and second rounds of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in March 2008 and the SEC Gymnastics Championships in 2007.

The arena is also used for other events: [[concerts]] ([[seating capacity]] is between 15,000 and 18,000 for end-stage concerts; the arena has an 80-by-40-foot portable stage); rodeos and auto racing (seating capacity is 14,000); and trade shows and conventions (there are {{convert|28000|sqft|m2|-2}} of arena floor space plus {{convert|7050|sqft|m2|0}} of meeting space and {{convert|2580|sqft|m2|0}} of pre-function space).  As a concert venue, its location prompted [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]] to play one of its most rarely performed numbers, 1973's "Mary Queen of Arkansas", during a March 2000 show on their [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]].

The arena is owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was designed by the Civic Center Design Team (CCDT), Burt Taggart &amp; Associates, Architects/Engineers, The Wilcox Group, Garver &amp; Garver Engineering and [[Rosser International]] of Atlanta.

The arena held the [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2004|2004]], [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2007|2007]] and [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2009|2009 American Idols LIVE! Tour]] concerts on August 13, 2004, July 13, 2007 and July 25, 2009, respectively.

Because of the $28.1 billion sale of [[Alltel]] to [[Verizon Wireless]], as of June 30, 2009, the Alltel Arena was renamed '''Verizon Arena'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arena Set to Take on Name of Verizon|first=Kristin|last=Netterstrom|url=http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/256998/|newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=April 13, 2009|accessdate=April 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fleetwood Mac]] performed at Verizon Arena May 4, 2013 with surprise guests former President [[Bill Clinton]] and First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] attending the show. Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood introduced the couple, who were seated in an arena suite, to the sold-out audience and dedicated the song "Don't Stop" to them, which was appropriately Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign song.

In 2019 the naming rights to the venue will be changed from [[Verizon]] to Arkansas based [[Simmons Bank]]. The deal was announced in November 9, 2018.

A '''wax comb''' is a tool used in the maintenance and removal of [[surfboard wax]] on a [[surfboard]]. Wax combs typically have features such a jagged or toothed edge and a straight, relatively sharp edge. The jagged edge is used to create textured grooves for improving the traction of the wax and the straight edge is used for scraping off unwanted wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtin|first=Ryan|title=How To Use A Surfboard Wax Comb|url=http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-use-surfboard-wax-comb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the straight edge for wax removal, some wax combs even have an inwardly curved edge for the rails (such as [[Mr. Zog's Sex Wax]] “Sex Comb”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surf Wax 101|url=http://www.surfinghandbook.com/knowledge/beginners-surfing-tips/surf-wax/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, wax combs can have features such as [[FCS (fins)|fin]] key, [[bottle opener]] or a snap for portability (attachment to interior pocket loop, lanyard or leash attachment lanyard).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing Wales: Wax|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/surfing/sites/learn/pages/wax.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
