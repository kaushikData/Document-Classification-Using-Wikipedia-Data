==Life==

Forsyth was born in [[Glasgow]] on 18 June 1858, the son of John Forsyth, a marine engineer, and his wife Christina Glen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forsyth studied at [[Liverpool College]] and was tutored by [[Richard Pendlebury]] before entering [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating [[senior wrangler]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FRST877AR|name=Forsyth, Andrew Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a fellow of Trinity and then appointed to the chair of mathematics at the [[University of Liverpool]] at the age of 24.  He returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in 1884 and became [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics]] in 1895.

Forsyth was forced to resign his chair in 1910 as a result of a scandal caused by his affair with Marion Amelia Boys, ''née'' Pollock, the wife of physicist [[C. V. Boys]].  Boys was granted a divorce on the grounds of Marion's adultery with Forsyth.  Marion and Andrew Forsyth were later married.

Forsyth became professor at the [[Imperial College of Science]] in 1913 and retired in 1923, remaining mathematically active into his seventies. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1886&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; and won its [[Royal Medal]] in 1897. He was a Plenary Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1908 at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forsyth, A. R.|chapter=On the present condition of partial differential equations of the second order as regards formal integration|editor=G. Castelnuovo |title=Atti del IV Congresso Internazionale dei Matematici (Roma, 6–11 Aprile 1908)|year=1909|volume=vol. 1|pages=87–103|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0081.001;view=1up;seq=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now remembered much more as an author of treatises than as an original researcher. His books have, however, often been criticized (for example by [[J. E. Littlewood]], in his ''[[A Mathematician's Miscellany]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Mathematician's Miscellany | last1 = Littlewood | first1 = John Edensor | page = 135 | quote = A. R.

It is a thoroughly bad book. | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1986 | isbn13 = 9780521337021 |authorlink = J.E. Littlewood }} &lt;/ref&gt; [[E. T. Whittaker]] was his only official student.&lt;ref name="MathGenealogy"/&gt;

He died in [[London]] on 2 June 1942 and was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forsyth received the degree of ''Doctor mathematicae ([[honoris causa]])'' from the [[Royal Frederick University]] on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Foreign degrees for British men of Science |day_of_week=Monday |date=8 September 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36867| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/om/tall-og-fakta/aresdoktorer/tidligere-aresdoktorer/1902-1910/ |title=Honorary doctorates from the University of Oslo 1902-1910}} ''(in Norwegian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Forsyth married Marion Amelia Pollock in 1910.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14567">In [[mathematics]], especially [[functional analysis]], a '''Banach algebra''', named after [[Stefan Banach]], is an [[associative algebra]] ''A'' over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers (or over a [[nonarchimedean field|non-Archimedean]] complete [[normed field]]) that at the same time is also a [[Banach space]], i.e. a [[normed space]] and [[complete metric space|complete]] in the metric induced by the norm. The norm is required to satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x, y \in A : \|x \, y\| \ \leq  \|x \| \, \| y\|. &lt;/math&gt;

This ensures that the multiplication operation is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].

A Banach algebra is called ''unital'' if it has an [[identity element]] for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and ''commutative'' if its multiplication is [[commutative]].
Any Banach algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (whether it has an [[identity element]] or not) can be embedded isometrically into a unital Banach algebra &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt; so as to form a closed ideal of &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt;. Often one assumes ''a priori'' that the algebra under consideration is unital: for one can develop much of the theory by considering &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt; and then applying the outcome in the original algebra. However, this is not the case all the time. For example, one cannot define all the trigonometric functions in a Banach algebra without identity.

The theory of real Banach algebras can be very different from the theory of complex Banach algebras. For example, the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of an element of a nontrivial complex Banach algebra can never be empty, whereas in a real Banach algebra it could be empty for some elements.

Banach algebras can also be defined over fields of [[p-adic number]]s. This is part of [[p-adic analysis]].

== Examples ==
The prototypical example of a Banach algebra is &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of (complex-valued) continuous functions on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space that vanish at infinity. &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is unital if and only if ''X'' is compact. The complex conjugation being an involution, &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a [[C*-algebra]]. More generally, every C*-algebra is a Banach algebra.

* The set of real (or complex) numbers is a Banach algebra with norm given by the [[absolute value]].
* The set of all real or complex ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] becomes a [[unital algebra|unital]] Banach algebra if we equip it with a sub-multiplicative [[matrix norm]].
* Take the Banach space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  (or '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with norm ||''x''|| = max |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;| and define multiplication componentwise: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional real Banach algebra, with the norm being given by the absolute value of quaternions.
* The algebra of all bounded real- or complex-valued functions defined on some set (with pointwise multiplication and the [[supremum]] norm) is a unital Banach algebra.
* The algebra of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] real- or complex-valued functions on some [[locally compact space]] (again with pointwise operations and supremum norm) is a Banach algebra.
* The algebra of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear]] operators on a Banach space ''E'' (with functional composition as multiplication and the [[operator norm]] as norm) is a unital Banach algebra. The set of all [[compact operator]]s on E is a Banach algebra and closed ideal. It is without identity if {{math|dim ''E'' {{=}} ∞}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Example VII.1.8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''G'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] and μ its [[Haar measure]], then the Banach space L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') of all μ-integrable functions on ''G'' becomes a Banach algebra under the [[convolution]] ''xy''(''g'') = ∫ ''x''(''h'') ''y''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g'') dμ(''h'') for ''x'', ''y'' in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Example VII.1.9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uniform algebra]]: A Banach algebra that is a subalgebra of the complex algebra C(X) with the supremum norm and that contains the constants and separates the points of X (which must be a compact Hausdorff space).
* [[Uniform algebra|Natural Banach function algebra]]: A uniform algebra all of whose characters are evaluations at points of X.
* [[C*-algebra]]: A Banach algebra that is a closed *-subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on some [[Hilbert space]].
* [[Measure algebra]]: A Banach algebra consisting of all [[Radon measure]]s on some [[locally compact group]], where the product of two measures is given by [[Convolution#Measures|convolution of measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Example VII.1.9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counterexamples ==
The algebra of the [[quaternion]]s &lt;math&gt;\H&lt;/math&gt; is not a complex Banach algebra (for any norm on &lt;math&gt;\H&lt;/math&gt;), for if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is a complex Banach algebra that is also a [[division algebra]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A \approx \C&lt;/math&gt; ([[Gelfand&amp;ndash;Mazur theorem]]), since if &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \C&lt;/math&gt; is a point in the non-empty&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Theorem 7.3.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma(a) \subset \C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a - \lambda 1&lt;/math&gt; is not invertible, hence &lt;math&gt;a - \lambda 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is a division algebra, whence &lt;math&gt;a = \lambda 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Corollary to theorem 8.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which also proves the Gelfand&amp;ndash;Mazur theorem).

== Properties ==
Several [[list of functions|elementary functions]] which are defined via [[power series]] may be defined in any unital Banach algebra; examples include the [[exponential function]] and the [[trigonometric functions]], and more generally any [[entire function]]. (In particular, the exponential map can be used to define [[abstract index group]]s.) The formula for the [[geometric series]] remains valid in general unital Banach algebras. The [[binomial theorem]] also holds for two commuting elements of a Banach algebra.

The set of [[invertible element]]s in any unital Banach algebra is an [[open set]], and the inversion operation on this set is continuous, (and hence is a homeomorphism) so that it forms a [[topological group]] under multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Theorem VII.2.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a Banach algebra has unit '''1''', then '''1''' cannot be a [[commutator (ring theory)|commutator]]; i.e., &lt;math&gt;xy - yx \ne \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp; for any ''x'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''. This is because ''xy'' and ''yx'' have the same [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] except possibly ''0''.

The various algebras of functions given in the examples above have very different properties from standard examples of algebras such as the reals. For example:

* Every real Banach algebra which is a [[division algebra]] is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions. Hence, the only complex Banach algebra which is a division algebra is the complexes. (This is known as the [[Gelfand–Mazur theorem]].)
* Every unital real Banach algebra with no [[zero divisor]]s, and in which every [[principal ideal]] is [[closed set|closed]], is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions.
* Every commutative real unital [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] Banach algebra with no zero divisors is isomorphic to the real or complex numbers.
* Every commutative real unital Noetherian Banach algebra (possibly having zero divisors) is finite-dimensional.
* Permanently singular elements in Banach algebras are [[topological divisor of zero|topological divisors of zero]], ''i.e.'', considering extensions ''B'' of Banach algebras ''A'' some elements that are singular in the given algebra ''A'' have a multiplicative inverse element in a Banach algebra extension ''B''.  Topological divisors of zero in ''A'' are permanently singular in all Banach extension ''B'' of&amp;nbsp;''A''.

== Spectral theory ==
{{main|Spectral theory}}

Unital Banach algebras over the complex field provide a general setting to develop spectral theory. The ''spectrum'' of an element ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt;, consists of all those complex [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s ''λ'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1''' is not invertible in ''A''.  The spectrum of any element ''x'' is a closed subset of the closed disc in '''C''' with radius ||''x''|| and center 0, and thus is  [[Compact space|compact]]. Moreover, the spectrum &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; of an element ''x'' is [[non-empty]] and satisfies the [[spectral radius]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ |\lambda| : \lambda \in \sigma(x) \} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^n\|^{1/n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''A'', the [[holomorphic functional calculus]] allows to define ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;∈ ''A'' for any function ''ƒ'' [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x).&lt;/math&gt;  Furthermore, the spectral mapping theorem holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f(x)) = f(\sigma(x)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Takesaki|1979|loc=Proposition 2.8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Banach algebra ''A'' is the algebra L(''X'') of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space ''X''&amp;thinsp; (e.g., the algebra of square matrices), the notion of the spectrum in ''A'' coincides with the usual one in the operator theory. For ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; ''C''(''X'') (with a compact Hausdorff space&amp;nbsp;''X''), one sees that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f) = \{ f(t) : t \in X \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The norm of a normal element ''x'' of a C*-algebra coincides with its spectral radius.  This generalizes an analogous fact for normal operators.

Let ''A''&amp;thinsp; be a complex unital Banach algebra in which every non-zero element ''x'' is invertible (a division algebra).  For every ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; ''A'', there is ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; '''C''' such that
''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1''' is not invertible (because the spectrum of ''a'' is not empty) hence ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1'''&amp;nbsp;:  this algebra ''A'' is naturally isomorphic to '''C''' (the complex case of the Gelfand–Mazur theorem).

== Ideals and characters ==
Let ''A''&amp;thinsp; be a unital ''commutative'' Banach algebra over '''C'''. Since ''A'' is then a commutative ring with unit, every non-invertible element of ''A'' belongs to some [[maximal ideal]] of ''A''. Since a maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; in ''A'' is closed, &lt;math&gt;A / \mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach algebra that is a field, and it follows from the Gelfand–Mazur theorem that there is a bijection between the set of all maximal ideals of ''A'' and the set Δ(''A'') of all nonzero homomorphisms from ''A''&amp;thinsp; to '''C'''. The set Δ(''A'') is called the "[[structure space]]" or "character space" of ''A'', and its members "characters."

A character χ is a linear functional on ''A'' which is at the same time multiplicative, χ(''ab'') = χ(''a'') χ(''b''), and satisfies ''χ''('''1''') = 1.  Every character is automatically continuous from ''A''&amp;thinsp; to '''C''', since the kernel of a character is a maximal ideal, which is closed. Moreover, the norm (''i.e.'', operator norm) of a character is one. Equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence on ''A'' (''i.e.'', the topology induced by the weak-* topology of&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;), the character space, Δ(''A''), is a Hausdorff compact space.

For any ''x'' ∈ ''A'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(\hat x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gelfand representation]] of ''x'' defined as follows: &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt; is the continuous function from Δ(''A'') to '''C''' given by &lt;math&gt;\hat x(\chi) = \chi(x).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;  The spectrum of &lt;math&gt;\hat x,&lt;/math&gt; in the formula above, is the spectrum as element of the algebra ''C''(Δ(''A'')) of complex continuous functions on the compact space Δ(''A'').  Explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\hat x) = \{ \chi(x) : \chi \in \Delta(A) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

As an algebra, a unital commutative Banach algebra is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] (i.e., its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero) if and only if its Gelfand representation has trivial kernel. An important example of such an algebra is a commutative C*-algebra. In fact, when ''A'' is a commutative unital C*-algebra, the Gelfand representation is then an isometric *-isomorphism between ''A'' and  ''C''(Δ(''A'')) .&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Proof: Since every element of a commutative C*-algebra is normal, the Gelfand representation is isometric; in particular, it is injective and its image is closed. But the image of the Gelfand representation is dense by the [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">[[File:Complete-edge-coloring.svg|thumb|A partition of a [[complete graph]] on 8 vertices into 7 colors ([[perfect matching]]s), the case ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 of Baranyai's theorem]]
In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, '''Baranyai's theorem''' (proved by and named after [[Zsolt Baranyai]]) deals with the [[Glossary of graph theory#Independence|decompositions]] of complete [[hypergraph]]s.

==Statement of the theorem==
The statement of the result is that if &lt;math&gt;2\le r&lt;k&lt;/math&gt;  are natural numbers and ''r'' divides ''k'', then the complete [[hypergraph]] &lt;math&gt;K^k_r&lt;/math&gt; decomposes into [[graph factorization|1-factors]]. &lt;math&gt;K^k_r&lt;/math&gt; is a hypergraph with ''k'' vertices, in which every subset of ''r'' vertices forms a hyperedge; a 1-factor of this hypergraph is a set of hyperedges that touches each vertex exactly once, or equivalently a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the vertices into subsets of size&amp;nbsp;''r''. Thus, the theorem states that the ''k'' vertices of the hypergraph may be partitioned into subsets of ''r'' vertices in &lt;math&gt;\binom{k}{r}\frac{r}{k} = \binom{k-1}{r-1}&lt;/math&gt; different ways, in such a way that each ''r''-element subset appears in exactly one of the partitions.
==The case &lt;math&gt;r = 2&lt;/math&gt;==
In the special case &lt;math&gt;r = 2&lt;/math&gt;, we have a complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, and we wish to color the edges with &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}\frac{2}{n} = n-1 &lt;/math&gt; colors so that the edges of each color form a perfect matching. Baranyai's theorem says that we can do this whenever &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even.

==History==
The ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 case can be rephrased as stating that every [[complete graph]] with an even number of vertices has an [[edge coloring]] whose number of colors equals its [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], or equivalently that its edges may be partitioned into [[perfect matching]]s. It may be used to schedule [[round-robin tournament]]s, and its solution was already known in the 19th century.  The case that ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''r'' is also easy.

The ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 case was established by R. Peltesohn in 1936. The general case was proved by [[Zsolt Baranyai]] in 1975.

A '''bigraph''' (often used in the plural '''bigraphs''') can be modelled as the superposition of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (the ''link graph'') and a set of [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the ''place graph'').&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;''[http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Introduction_To_Bigraphs A Brief Introduction To Bigraphs]'', [[IT University of Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;Milner, Robin. ''[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/rm135/uam-theme.html The Bigraphical Model]'', [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Node (mathematics)|node]] of the bigraph is part of a graph and also part of some tree that describes how the nodes are nested. Bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as [[diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; They have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for [[ubiquitous computing]] and can be used to describe [[Mobile agent|mobile]] interactions. They have also been used by [[Robin Milner]] in an attempt to subsume [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] (CCS) and [[Pi calculus|π-calculus]].&lt;ref name="milner" /&gt; They have been studied in the context of [[category theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Anatomy of a bigraph==

Aside from nodes and ([[hyperedge|hyper-]])[[Edge (graph theory)|edges]], a bigraph may have associated with it one or more ''regions'' which are roots in the place forest, and zero or more  ''holes'' in the place graph, into which other bigraph regions may be inserted.  Similarly, to nodes we may assign ''controls'' that define identities and an arity (the number of ''ports'' for a given node to which link-graph edges may connect).  These controls are drawn from a bigraph ''signature''.  In the link graph we define ''inner'' and ''outer'' names, which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link.

==Foundations==

A bigraph is a 5-tuple:

&lt;math&gt;(V,E,ctrl,prnt,link) : \langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set of nodes, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a set of edges, &lt;math&gt;ctrl&lt;/math&gt; is the ''control map'' that assigns controls to nodes, &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is the ''parent map'' that defines the nesting of nodes, and &lt;math&gt;link&lt;/math&gt; is the ''link map'' that defines the link structure.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the bigraph has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ''holes'' (sites) and a set of inner names &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''regions'', with a set of ''outer names'' &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  These are respectively known as the ''inner'' and ''outer'' interfaces of the bigraph.

Formally speaking, each bigraph is an arrow in a symmetric partial [[monoidal category]] (usually abbreviated ''spm-category'') in which the objects are these interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04081-8_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the composition of bigraphs is definable in terms of the composition of arrows in the category.

==Extensions and variants==

===Bigraphs with sharing===
[[File:Bigraphs-sharing-example.svg|alt=Example bigraph with sharing|thumb|230x230px|Example bigraph with sharing in which the node of control M is shared by the two nodes of control S. This is represented by M being in the intersection of the two S-nodes.]]

In bigraphs with sharing, the place graph is defined as a [[directed acyclic graph |directed acyclic graph (DAG)]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binary relation]] instead of a [[Function (mathematics)|map]]. The definition of link graph is unaffected by the introduction of sharing. Note that standard bigraphs are a sub-class of bigraphs with sharing.

Areas of application of bigraphs with sharing include wireless networking protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Catherine Huafei Yan''' ({{lang-zh|颜华菲}}) is a professor of mathematics at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] interested in [[algebraic combinatorics]].

Yan earned a bachelor's degree from [[Peking University]] in 1993.{{r|cv}}
She was a student of [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where she earned her Ph.D. in 1997 with a dissertation on ''The Theory of Commuting Boolean Algebras''.{{r|mgp}}
After working for two years as a Courant Instructor at [[New York University]], she joined Texas A&amp;M in 1999, with a three-year hiatus as Chern Professor at the Center of Combinatorics, [[Nankai University]], from 2005 to 2008.{{r|cv}}

With her advisor and Joseph Kung, she is an author of ''Combinatorics: The Rota Way'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009). The book provides an exposition of the areas of combinatorics of interest to Rota, unified through an algebraic framework, and lists many open research problems in this area.{{r|ctrw}}

She was elected to the 2018 class of [[fellow]]s of the [[American Mathematical Society]] "for contributions to combinatorics and discrete geometry".{{r|fams}}

In [[linear algebra]], a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for a [[vector space]] of [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] ''n'' is a set of ''n'' vectors {{nowrap|(&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, called '''basis vectors''', with the property that every vector in the space can be expressed as a unique [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors. The [[Transformation matrix|matrix representations]] of [[linear transformation|operators]] are also determined by the chosen basis. Since it is often desirable to work with more than one basis for a vector space, it is of fundamental importance in linear algebra to be able to easily transform coordinate-wise representations of vectors and operators taken with respect to one basis to their equivalent representations with respect to another basis.  Such a transformation is called a '''change of basis'''.

Although the terminology of vector spaces is used below and the symbol '''R''' can be taken to mean the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s, the results discussed hold whenever '''R''' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''vector space'' is everywhere replaced with ''[[free module|free]] [[module (mathematics)|R-module]]''.

== Preliminary notions ==

=== Transformation matrix ===

The [[standard basis]] for &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; is the ordered sequence &lt;math&gt;E_n=\{ e_1, \cdots, e_n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e_j&lt;/math&gt; is the element of &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;j^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; place and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;s elsewhere. For example, the standard basis for &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; would be

:&lt;math&gt;E_2 = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1\end{pmatrix} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;T : R^n \rightarrow R^m&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear transformation]], the &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] associated with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix &lt;math&gt;M_T&lt;/math&gt; whose &lt;math&gt;jth&lt;/math&gt; column is &lt;math&gt;T(e_j) \in R^m&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;j=1, \cdots, n&lt;/math&gt;, that is

:&lt;math&gt;M_T = \begin{bmatrix}T(e_1) \cdots T(e_j) \cdots T(e_n)\end{bmatrix} \in R^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case we have &lt;math&gt;T(x) = M_T\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in R^n&lt;/math&gt;, where we regard  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a column vector and the multiplication on the right side is [[matrix multiplication]].  It is a basic fact in linear algebra that the vector space  Hom(&lt;math&gt;R^n, R^m&lt;/math&gt;) of all linear transformations from  &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;R^m&lt;/math&gt; is naturally [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the space  &lt;math&gt;R^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;of  &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;; that is, a linear transformation &lt;math&gt;T : R^n \rightarrow R^m&lt;/math&gt; is for all intents and purposes equivalent to its matrix &lt;math&gt;M_T&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Uniqueness of linear transformations ===

We will also make use of the following simple observation.

==== Theorem ====

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces, let &lt;math&gt;B=\{ \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;C=\{ \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vectors in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.  Then there exists a ''unique linear transformation'' &lt;math&gt;T : V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; with 
&lt;math&gt;T(\alpha_j) = \gamma_j&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;j=1, \cdots, n&lt;/math&gt;.

This unique &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
T(x_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots + x_n \alpha_n) = 
T(x_1 \alpha_1) + \cdots + T(x_n \alpha_n) = 
x_1 T(\alpha_1) + \cdots + x_nT(\alpha_n) = 
x_1 \gamma_1 + \cdots + x_n \gamma_n&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, if &lt;math&gt;C=\{ \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_n \}&lt;/math&gt; happens to be a basis for &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[bijective]] as well as linear; in other words, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isomorphism]].  If in this case we also have &lt;math&gt;W = V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is said to be an [[automorphism]].

===== Coordinate isomorphism =====

Now let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and suppose &lt;math&gt;B=\{ \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, if &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\xi = x_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots  +  x_n \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; for a unique choice of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] &lt;math&gt;x_1, \cdots , x_n \in R&lt;/math&gt; called the ''coordinates of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; relative to the ordered basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;''.  The vector &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n)^T \in R^n&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''coordinate tuple of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;''.

The unique linear map &lt;math&gt;\phi : R^n \rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi(e_j) = \alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\cdots,n&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''coordinate isomorphism''' for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the basis &lt;math&gt;B=\{ \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n \}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = \xi&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]]  &lt;math&gt;\xi = x_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots  +  x_n \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Matrix of a set of vectors===

A set of vectors can be represented by a matrix of which each column consists of the components of the corresponding vector of the set. As a basis is a set of vectors, a basis can be given by a matrix of this kind. Later it will be shown that the change of basis of any object of the space is related to this matrix. For example, vectors change with its inverse (and they are therefore called contravariant objects).

== Change of coordinates of a vector==
First we examine the question of how the coordinates of a vector &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; in the vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; change when we select another basis.

===Two dimensions===
This means that given a matrix &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; whose columns are the vectors of the new basis of the space (new basis matrix), the new coordinates for a column vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are given by the matrix product &lt;math&gt;M^{-1}v&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is said that ordinary vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] objects.

Any finite set of vectors can be represented by a matrix in which its columns are the coordinates of the given vectors. As an example in dimension 2, a pair of vectors obtained by rotating the standard basis counterclockwise for 45°. The matrix whose columns are the coordinates of these vectors is

:&lt;math&gt;M=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to change any vector of the space to this new basis, we only need to left-multiply its components by the inverse of this matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/changebasis/|title=Change of Basis - HMC Calculus Tutorial|website=www.math.hmc.edu|access-date=2017-08-22}}
and the explanation / proof {{Cite web|url=https://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/changebasis/why.html|title=Why?|website=www.math.hmc.edu|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three dimensions===

For example, let R be a new basis given by its [[Euler angles]]. The matrix of the basis will have as columns the components of each vector. Therefore, this matrix will be (See [[Euler angles]] article):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \begin{bmatrix}
 \mathrm{c}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\gamma - \mathrm{s}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\beta \, \mathrm{s}_\gamma &amp;
-\mathrm{c}_\alpha \, \mathrm{s}_\gamma - \mathrm{s}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\beta \, \mathrm{c}_\gamma &amp;  
 \mathrm{s}_\beta  \, \mathrm{s}_\alpha \\ 
 \mathrm{s}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\gamma + \mathrm{c}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\beta \, \mathrm{s}_\gamma &amp;
-\mathrm{s}_\alpha \, \mathrm{s}_\gamma + \mathrm{c}_\alpha \, \mathrm{c}_\beta \, \mathrm{c}_\gamma &amp;  
-\mathrm{s}_\beta  \, \mathrm{c}_\alpha  \\
 \mathrm{s}_\beta  \, \mathrm{s}_\gamma &amp;
 \mathrm{s}_\beta  \, \mathrm{c}_\gamma &amp;  
 \mathrm{c}_\beta
\end{bmatrix}
.&lt;/math&gt;

Again, any vector of the space can be changed to this new basis by left-multiplying its components by the inverse of this matrix.

=== {{Anchor|Transition matrix}} General case ===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A=\{ \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\{ \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n \}&lt;/math&gt; are two ordered bases for an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' over a field ''K''. Let ''φ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the corresponding coordinate isomorphisms ([[linear map]]s) from ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''V'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;\phi_A (e_i) = \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_B (e_i) = \beta_i&lt;/math&gt; for {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, …, ''n''}}, where ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the ''n''-tuple with ''i''&lt;sup&gt; th&lt;/sup&gt; entry equal to 1, and all other entries equal to 0.

If &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1, \dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate ''n''-tuple of a vector ''v'' in ''V'' with respect to the basis ''A'', so that &lt;math&gt;v = \phi_A (x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the coordinate tuple of ''v'' with respect to ''B'' is the tuple ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_B (y) = v&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;y = \phi_B^{-1} (v) = \phi_B^{-1} (\phi_A (x))&lt;/math&gt;, so that for any vector in ''V'', the map &lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1} \circ \phi_A&lt;/math&gt; maps its coordinate tuple with respect to ''A'' to its coordinate tuple with respect to ''B''. Since this map is an automorphism on ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, it therefore has an associated square matrix ''C''. Moreover, the ''i''&lt;sup&gt; th&lt;/sup&gt; column of ''C'' is &lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1} \circ \phi_A (e_i) = \phi_B^{-1} (\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the coordinate tuple of ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''B''.

Thus, for any vector ''v'' in ''V'', if ''x'' is the coordinate tuple of ''v'' with respect to ''A'', then the tuple &lt;math&gt;y = \phi_B^{-1} (\phi_A(x)) = Cx&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate tuple of ''v'' with respect to ''B''. The matrix ''C'' is called the '''transition matrix''' from ''A'' to ''B''.

== The matrix of a linear transformation ==
Now suppose {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a linear transformation, {{nowrap|{&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is a basis for ''V'' and {{nowrap|{&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is a basis for ''W''.  Let &amp;phi; and &amp;psi; be the coordinate isomorphisms for ''V'' and ''W'', respectively, relative to the given bases.  Then the map {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;psi;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''T'' ∘ &amp;phi;}} is a linear transformation from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore has a matrix '''t'''; its ''j''th column is {{nowrap|&amp;psi;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''(&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;))}} for {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, …, ''n''}}.  This matrix is called the matrix of ''T'' with respect to the ordered bases {{nowrap|{&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{nowrap|{&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}.}}  If {{nowrap|1=&amp;eta; = ''T''(&amp;xi;)}} and '''y''' and '''x''' are the coordinate tuples of &amp;eta; and &amp;xi;, then {{nowrap|1='''y''' = &amp;psi;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(T(&amp;phi;('''x'''))) = '''tx'''}}.  Conversely, if &amp;xi; is in ''V'' and {{nowrap|1='''x''' = &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;xi;)}} is the coordinate tuple of &amp;xi; with respect to {{nowrap|{&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;},}} and we set {{nowrap|1='''y''' = '''tx'''}} and {{nowrap|1=&amp;eta; = &amp;psi;('''y''')}}, then {{nowrap|1=&amp;eta; = &amp;psi;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''')) = ''T''(&amp;xi;)}}.  That is, if &amp;xi; is in ''V'' and &amp;eta; is in ''W'' and '''x''' and '''y''' are their coordinate tuples, then {{nowrap|1='''y''' = '''tx'''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1=&amp;eta; = ''T''(&amp;xi;)}}.

'''Theorem''' Suppose ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'' are vector spaces of finite dimension and an ordered basis is chosen for each.  If {{nowrap|''T'' : ''U'' → ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''S'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} are linear transformations with matrices '''s''' and '''t''', then the matrix of the linear transformation {{nowrap|''S'' ∘ ''T'' : ''U'' → ''W''}} (with respect to the given bases) is '''st'''.

=== Change of basis ===
Now we ask what happens to the matrix of {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} when we change bases in ''V'' and ''W''.  Let {{nowrap|{&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{nowrap|{&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} be ordered bases for ''V'' and ''W'' respectively, and suppose we are given a second pair of bases {{nowrap|{&amp;alpha;′&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{nowrap|{&amp;beta;′&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;′&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}.}}  Let &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the coordinate isomorphisms taking the usual basis in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the first and second bases for ''V'', and let &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the isomorphisms taking the usual basis in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to the first and second bases for ''W''.

Let {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''T'' ∘ &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''T'' ∘ &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (both maps taking '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;), and let '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be their respective matrices.  Let '''p''' and '''q''' be the matrices of the change-of-coordinates automorphisms {{nowrap|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and  {{nowrap|&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The relationships of these various maps to one another are illustrated in the following [[commutative diagram]].
&lt;!--
 insert change-of-basis diagram her
--&gt;
Since we have {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''T'' ∘ &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ∘ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ (&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and since composition of linear maps corresponds to matrix multiplication, it follows that
: '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q''' '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Given that the change of basis has once the basis matrix and once its inverse, these objects are said to be [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|1-co, 1-contra-variant]].

== The matrix of an endomorphism ==
An important case of the matrix of a linear transformation is that of an [[endomorphism]], that is,
a linear map from a vector space ''V'' to itself: that is, the case that {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''V''}}.
We can naturally take {{nowrap|1={&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} = {&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1={&amp;beta;′&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;beta;′&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} = {&amp;alpha;′&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &amp;alpha;′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.}}  The matrix of the linear map ''T'' is necessarily square.

===Change of basis===

We apply the same change of basis, so that {{nowrap|1='''q''' = '''p'''}} and the change of basis formula becomes
: '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''p''' '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this situation the [[invertible matrix|invertible]] matrix '''p''' is called a change-of-basis matrix for the vector space ''V'', and the equation above says that the matrices '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''t'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[similar (linear algebra)|similar]].

== The matrix of a bilinear form ==
A ''[[bilinear form]]'' on a vector space ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''R''' is a mapping {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → '''R'''}} which is [[linear transformation|linear]] in both arguments. That is, {{nowrap|''B'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → '''R'''}} is bilinear if the maps
:&lt;math&gt;v \mapsto B(v, w)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v \mapsto B(w, v)&lt;/math&gt;
are linear for each ''w'' in ''V''. This definition applies equally well to [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[commutative ring]] with linear maps being [[module homomorphism]]s.

The [[Gram matrix]] ''G'' attached to a basis &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;G_{i,j} = B(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) .&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;v = \sum_i x_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = \sum_i y_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are the expressions of vectors ''v'', ''w'' with respect to this basis, then the bilinear form is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B(v,w) = v^\mathsf{T} G w .&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix will be [[symmetric (matrix)|symmetric]] if the bilinear form ''B'' is a [[symmetric bilinear form]].

===Change of basis===
If ''P'' is the invertible matrix representing a change of basis from
&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\alpha'_1,\dots, \alpha'_n&lt;/math&gt;
then the Gram matrix transforms by the [[matrix congruence]]

:&lt;math&gt;G' = P^\mathsf{T} G P .&lt;/math&gt;

==Important instances==
In abstract vector space theory the change of basis concept is innocuous; it seems to add little to science. Yet there are cases in [[associative algebra]]s where a change of basis is sufficient to turn a caterpillar into a butterfly, figuratively speaking:
 
*In the [[split-complex number]] plane there is an alternative "diagonal basis". The standard hyperbola {{nowrap|1=''xx'' − ''yy'' = 1}} becomes {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 1}} after the change of basis. Transformations of the plane that leave the hyperbolae in place correspond to each other, [[modulo (jargon)|modulo]] a change of basis. The contextual difference is profound enough to then separate [[Lorentz boost]] from [[squeeze mapping]]. A panoramic view of the literature of these mappings can be taken using the underlying change of basis.
*With the [[2 × 2 real matrices]] one finds the beginning of a catalogue of linear algebras due to [[Arthur Cayley]]. His associate [[James Cockle]] put forward in 1849 his algebra of ''coquaternions'' or [[split-quaternion]]s, which are the same algebra as the {{nowrap|2 × 2}} real matrices, just laid out on a different matrix basis. Once again it is the concept of change of basis that synthesizes Cayley’s matrix algebra and Cockle’s coquaternions.
*A change of basis turns a {{nowrap|2 × 2}} complex matrix into a [[biquaternion#Linear representation|biquaternion]].

'''Cymatics''', from {{lang-grc|κῦμα}}, meaning "wave", is a subset of [[normal mode|modal vibrational phenomena]]. The term was coined by [[Hans Jenny (cymatics)|Hans Jenny]] (1904-1972), a Swiss follower of the philosophical school known as [[anthroposophy]]. Typically the surface of a plate, diaphragm or membrane is vibrated, and regions of maximum and minimum displacement are made visible in a thin coating of particles, paste or liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenny |first= Hans |title= Cymatics: A Study of Wave Phenomena &amp; Vibration |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Macromedia Press]] |date=July 2001 |isbn= 1-888138-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different patterns emerge in the excitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.

The apparatus employed can be simple, such as the Chinese [[standing bell|spouting bowl]], in which copper handles are rubbed and cause the copper bottom elements to vibrate. Other examples include the [[Ernst Chladni#Chladni figures|Chladni Plate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Instructional Research Lab: Chladni Plate |url= http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demoweb/demomanual/acoustics/effects_of_sound/chladni_plate.html |publisher= University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the so-called cymascope.

==History==
On July 8, 1680, [[Robert Hooke]] was able to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.&lt;ref name="ODS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130408234655/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni], ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientists,'' Oxford Univ. Press, 1999, p. 101 (archive.org link). Accessed 24 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German musician and physicist [[Ernst Chladni]] noticed in the eighteenth century that the modes of vibration of a membrane or a plate can be observed by sprinkling the vibrating surface with a fine dust (e.g., [[lycopodium powder]], flour or fine sand). The powder moves due to the vibration and accumulates progressively in points of the surface corresponding to the sound vibration. The points form a pattern of lines, known as "nodal lines of the vibration mode". The normal modes of vibration, and the pattern of nodal lines associated with each of these, are completely determined, for a surface with homogeneous mechanical characteristics, from the geometric shape of the surface and by the way in which the surface is constrained.&lt;ref name="ODS"/&gt;

Experiments of this kind, similar to those carried out earlier by [[Galileo Galilei]]&lt;ref name="amsci"&gt;J. McLaughlin, "[http://www.americanscientist.org/my_amsci/restricted.aspx?act=pdf&amp;id=3057428159866 Good Vibrations]" in ''American Scientist'', July–August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1630 and by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1680, were later perfected by Chladni, who introduced them systematically in 1787 in his book ''Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges'' (Discoveries on the theory of sound). This provided an important contribution to the understanding of acoustic phenomena and the functioning of musical instruments. The figures thus obtained (with the aid of a violin bow that rubbed perpendicularly along the edge of smooth plates covered with fine sand) are still designated by the name of "Chladni figures".

==Work of Hans Jenny==
In 1967 [[Hans Jenny (cymatics)|Hans Jenny]], a follower of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] doctrine of [[Rudolf Steiner]], published two volumes entitled ''Kymatic'' (1967 and 1972), in which, repeating Chladni's experiments, he claimed the existence of a subtle power based on the normal, symmetrical images made by [[sound wave]]s. Jenny put sand, dust and fluids on a metal plate connected to an oscillator which could produce a broad spectrum of frequencies. The sand or other substances were organized into different structures characterized by geometric shapes typical of the frequency of the vibration emitted by the oscillator. Modern analysts, including [[Michael Shermer]], have termed anthroposophy's application in areas such as engineering, medicine, biology, and biodynamic agriculture as [[pseudoscience]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to Jenny, these structures, reminiscent of the mandala and other forms recurring in nature, would be a manifestation of an invisible force field of the vibrational energy that generated it. He was particularly impressed by an observation that imposing a vocalization in ancient Sanskrit of [[Om]] (regarded by Hindus and Buddhists as the sound of creation) the lycopodium powder formed a circle with a centre point, one of the ways in which Om had been represented. In fact, for a plate of circular shape, resting in the centre (or the border, or at least in a set of points with central symmetry), the nodal vibration modes all have central symmetry, so the observation of Jenny is entirely consistent with well known mathematical properties.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

From the physical-mathematical standpoint, the form of the nodal patterns is predetermined by the shape of the body set in vibration or, in the case of acoustic waves in a gas, the shape of the cavity in which the gas is contained. The sound wave, therefore, does not influence at all the shape of the vibrating body or the shape of the nodal patterns. The only thing that changes due to the vibration is the arrangement of the sand. The image formed by the sand, in turn, is influenced by the frequency spectrum of the vibration only because each vibration mode is characterized by a specific frequency. Therefore, the spectrum of the signal that excites the vibration determines which patterns are actually nodally displayed.

The physical phenomena involved in the formation of Chladni figures are best explained by classical physics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==In healing==

It has been speculated by some researchers that application of ultrasound cause wounds to heal faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= July 16, 2015 |url=https://www.popsci.com/sound-waves-accelerate-healing |title=Sound Waves Could Speed Up Wound Healing |website=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other than select articles on the subject of low-amplitude high-frequency sound in bone fracture healing,&lt;ref name="fractures"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18924140 | doi=10.1002/jor.20753 | volume=27 | title=Low-magnitude high-frequency vibration accelerates callus formation, mineralization, and fracture healing in rats | journal=J Orthop Res | pages=458–65 | last1 = Leung | first1 = KS | last2 = Shi | first2 = HF | last3 = Cheung | first3 = WH | last4 = Qin | first4 = L | last5 = Ng | first5 = WK | last6 = Tam | first6 = KF | last7 = Tang | first7 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no medical evidence of this phenomenon.

==Influences on art and music==
Devices for displaying nodal images have influenced visual arts and contemporary music. Artist [[Björk]] created projections of cymatics patterns by using bass frequencies on tour for her album ''Biophilia''.

Hans Jenny's book on Chladni figures influenced [[Alvin Lucier]] and helped lead to Lucier's composition ''Queen of the South''. Jenny's work was also followed up by [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] (CAVS) founder [[György Kepes]] at [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="kepes"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021104072629/http://web.mit.edu/cavs/people/kepes/kepes.html György Kepes profile at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of [[sheet metal]] in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and [[thermodynamic]] patterns were made visible by this setup.

In the mid 1980s, visual artist [[Ron Rocco]], who also developed his work at CAVS, employed mirrors mounted to tiny [[servo motor]]s, driven by the audio signal of a synthesizer and amplified by a tube amp to reflect the beam of a laser. This created light patterns which corresponded to the audio's frequency and amplitude. Using this beam to generate video feedback and computers to process the feedback signal, Rocco created his "Andro-media" series of installations. Rocco later formed a collaboration with musician David Hykes, who practiced a form of Mongolian overtone chanting with The Harmonic Choir, to generate cymatic images from a pool of liquid mercury, which functioned as a liquid mirror to modulate the beam of a Helium-Neon [[laser]] from the sound thus generated. Photographs of this work can be found in the [[Ars Electronica]] catalog of 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/In_Light_of_Sound_%28study_1%29.jpg "In Light of Sound study 1" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary German photographer and philosopher [[Alexander Lauterwasser]] has brought cymatics into the 21st century using finely crafted [[frequency modulation synthesis|crystal oscillator]]s to resonate steel plates covered with fine sand and to vibrate small samples of water in [[Petri dish]]es. His first book, ''Water Sound Images'',&lt;ref name="Lauterwasser"&gt;Lauterwasser, Alexander (2006). ''Water Sound Images.'' {{ISBN|1-888138-09-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated into English in 2006, features imagery of light reflecting off the surface of water set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure [[sine wave]]s to music by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] group ''Kymatik'' (who often record in [[ambisonics|ambisonic]] surround sound) and [[overtone singing]]. The resulting photographs of standing wave patterns are striking. Lauterwasser's book focused on creating detailed visual analogues of natural patterns ranging from the distribution of spots on a leopard to the geometric patterns found in plants and flowers, to the shapes of jellyfish and the intricate patterns found on the shell of a tortoise.

Composer [[Stuart Mitchell]] and his father T.J. Mitchell claimed that [[Rosslyn Chapel]]'s carvings supposedly contain references to cymatics patterns. In 2005 they created a work called ''The Rosslyn Motet'' realised by attempting to match various [[Chladni]] patterns to 13 geometric symbols carved onto the faces of cubes emanating from 14 arches.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Chris (May 19, 2011). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110623063324/http://www.slate.com/id/2294490/ The Rosslyn Code: Is a Scottish Da Vinci responsible for the Rosslyn melodies?]", ''Slate.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many claims in the cymatics community, the hypothesis that the carvings represent Chladni patterns is not supported by scientific or historical evidence. One of the problems is that many of the 'box' carvings are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century following damage by erosion.

The musical group, "The Glitch Mob" used cymatics to produce the music video "Becoming Harmonious (ft. Metal Mother)".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/theglitchmobmusic/videos/10153925995807733/&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Yantra]] diagrams and cymatics, artist and fashion designer [[Mandali Mendrilla]] created a sculpture dress called "Kamadhenu (Wish Tree Dress III)" the pattern of which is based 
on a Yantra diagram depicting goddess [[Kamadhenu]].
&lt;ref&gt;https://atma.hr/dizajnerica-mandali-predstavila-zagrebu-carobnu-haljinu-jeste-li-i-vi-vezali-svoju-zelju/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://mendrilla.wordpress.com/2016/07/08/kamadhenu-wish-tree-dress-iii-on-sound-in-ether-and-artistic-inspiration/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aphex Twin]] suggests learning more about cymatics (linking to this article) in reference to 'master tuning of [[A440_(pitch_standard)|440&amp;nbsp;Hz]]' in a conversation with synth-maker [[Tatsuya Takahashi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://item.warp.net/interview/aphex-twin-speaks-to-tatsuya-takahashi&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the art collective Analema Group creates participatory performances in which cymatic patterns are produced digitally in real-time by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.analemagroup.com|title=ANALEMA GROUP|website=ANALEMA GROUP|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences in engineering==
Inspired by periodic and symmetrical patterns at the air-liquid interface created by sound vibration, P. Chen and coworkers developed a method to engineer diverse structures from microscale materials using liquid-based templates.&lt;ref&gt;P. Chen, Z. Luo, S. Guven, S. Tasoglu, A. Weng, A. V. Ganesan, U. Demirci, Advanced Materials 2014, 10.1002/adma.201402079. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201402079/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured by tuning vibration frequency and acceleration.

[[File:Dinitrogen-3D-vdW.png|thumb|200px|A [[space-filling model]] of the diatomic molecule dinitrogen, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

'''Diatomic molecules''' are [[molecule]]s composed of only two [[atom]]s, of the same or different [[chemical element]]s. The prefix ''di-'' is of Greek origin, meaning "two". If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then it is said to be [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]]. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) or [[nitric oxide]] (NO), the molecule is said to be [[heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear]].

[[File:Diatomic molecules periodic table.svg|thumb|450px|A [[periodic table]] showing the elements that exist as [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]] diatomic molecules under typical laboratory conditions.]]

The only [[chemical element]]s that form stable [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]] diatomic molecules at [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP) (or typical laboratory conditions of 1 [[bar (pressure)|bar]] and 25&amp;nbsp;°C) are the [[gas]]es [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[fluorine]] (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=C.R.|title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|year=2012 |url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com//articles/04_01_91.pdf|chapter=Section 4: Properties of the Elements and Inorganic Compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[noble gas]]es ([[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]], and [[radon]]) are also gases at STP, but they are [[monatomic]]. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called "elemental gases" or "molecular gases", to distinguish them from other gases that are [[chemical compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Emsley, J. |title= The Elements |publisher= Oxford: Clarendon Press |year= 1989 |pages= 22–23 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens [[bromine]] (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[iodine]] (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) also form diatomic gases.&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry|author=Whitten, Kenneth W.|author2=Davis, Raymond E.|author3=Peck, M. Larry|author4=Stanley, George G.|year=2010|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|pages=337–338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Zwu9-qT0qQC&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for [[astatine]], which is uncertain.

The mnemonics '''BrINClHOF''', pronounced "Brinklehof",{{cn|date=March 2018}} and '''HONClBrIF''', pronounced "Honkelbrif",&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Alan|title=Chemistry and Our Changing World|date=1992|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131315419|page=82|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ai8YAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=honclbrif&amp;dq=honclbrif&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivhIeFl6vZAhUCB8AKHS6IADwQ6AEIJzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''HOFBrINCl''' (pronouced as Hofbrinkle) have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements.

Other elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating ("cracking") elemental phosphorus gives [[diphosphorus]], P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Sulfur vapor is mostly [[disulfur]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Dilithium]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is known in the gas phase. Ditungsten (W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and dimolybdenum (Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) form with [[sextuple bond]]s in the gas phase. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar. [[Dirubidium]] (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is diatomic.

==Heteronuclear molecules==
All other diatomic molecules are [[chemical compound]]s of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form [[heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear]] diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.

Some examples include, gases [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), and [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl).

Many 1:1 [[binary compound]]s are not normally considered diatomic because they are [[polymer]]ic at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.

==Occurrence==
Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Huber, K. P. |author2=Herzberg, G. |title= Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules |publisher= New York: Van Nostrand: Reinhold |year= 1979 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in [[list of molecules in interstellar space|interstellar space]]. About 99% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of [[hydrogen|hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is, indeed, dominated by hydrogen atoms.

==Historical significance==
Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. [[John Dalton]]'s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq8aDsluyggC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Dalton+assumed+water's+formula+to+be+HO,+giving+the+atomic+weight+of+oxygen+as+eight+times+that+of+hydrogen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j6HocPDzoL&amp;sig=sHzjiYIh8MFNVf-KnmKG8-wrtLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinwJ_Z25HZAhUjTt8KHbq7BNMQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Dalton%20assumed%20water's%20formula%20to%20be%20HO,%20giving%20the%20atomic%20weight%20of%20oxygen%20as%20eight%20times%20that%20of%20hydrogen&amp;f=false|title=The Development of Chemical Principles|authorlink1=Cooper H. Langford|last=Langford|first=Cooper Harold|last2=Beebe|first2=Ralph Alonzo|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486683591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.

As early as 1805, [[Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt|von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.

At the 1860 [[Karlsruhe Congress]] on atomic weights, [[Cannizzaro]] resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the [[periodic law]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and [[Lothar Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ihde, Aaron J. |title= The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective |journal= Journal of Chemical Education |year= 1961 |volume= 38 |pages= 83–86 |url= http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |doi= 10.1021/ed038p83 |issue= 2 |bibcode= 1961JChEd..38...83I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excited electronic states==
Diatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments.&lt;ref name=gilmore1992/&gt; Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is [[metastability|metastable]]), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a [[photon]] is emitted. This emission is known as [[fluorescence]]. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.

In quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by
:&lt;math&gt;^{2S+1} \Lambda (v)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the total electronic spin quantum number, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the vibrational quantum number. &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; takes on values 0, 1, 2, …, which are represented by the electronic state symbols &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;,….
For example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (&lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;) of diatomic nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=laher1991/&gt; In the table, the subscripts and superscripts after &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state.

Note: The "energy" units in the above table are actually the reciprocal of the wavelength of a photon emitted in a transition to the lowest energy state. The actual energy can be found by multiplying the given statistic by the product of ''c'' (the speed of light) and ''h'' (Planck's constant), i.e., about 1.99 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; Joule metres, and then multiplying by a further factor of 100 to convert from cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The aforementioned [[fluorescence]] occurs in distinct regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], called "[[emission bands]]": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 μm (micrometres).&lt;ref name=gilmore1992/&gt; A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=levine1975/&gt; The &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; branch corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = +1&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; branch to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = -1&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; branch to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Bands are spread out even further by the limited [[spectral resolution]] of the [[spectrometer]] that is used to measure the [[spectrum]]. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's [[point spread function]].

==Energy levels==
The [[molecular term symbol]] is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also 
 [[eigenstate]]s of the electronic molecular [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies.

===Translational energies===
The translational energy of the molecule is given by the [[kinetic energy]] expression:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{trans}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the molecule and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is its velocity.

===Rotational energies===
Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is
::&lt;math&gt;E_{rot} = \frac{L^2}{2 I} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;L \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular momentum]]
::&lt;math&gt;I \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the molecule

For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by
::&lt;math&gt;L^2 = l(l+1) \hbar^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative integer and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is
::&lt;math&gt;I = \mu r_{0}^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\mu \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] of the molecule and
::&lt;math&gt;r_{0} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the average distance between the centers of the two atoms in the molecule.

So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into E&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:
::&lt;math style&gt;E_{rot} = \frac{l(l+1) \hbar^2}{2 \mu r_{0}^2} \ \ \ \ \ l=0,1,2,... \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vibrational energies===
Another type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate—or [[vibration|vibrate]]—along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{vib} = \left(n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega \ \ \ \ \ n=0,1,2,.... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer
::&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and
::&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the vibration.

===Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings===
The spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between [[rotational energy]] levels.

==Hund's cases==
{{Main|Hund's cases}}
The [[good quantum number]]s for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using [[Hund's cases]].

'''Eiffel''' is an [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[programming language]] designed by [[Bertrand Meyer]] (an object-orientation proponent and author of ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]'') and [[Eiffel Software]]. Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berenddeboer.net/eiffel/archive/halstenbach_eiffel_history.html|title=Eiffel — the Language|last1= |first1= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first version becoming available in 1986. In 2005, Eiffel became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-standardized language.

The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including [[design by contract]], [[command–query separation]], the [[Uniform access principle|uniform-access principle]], the [[Single choice principle|single-choice principle]], the [[Open/closed principle|open–closed principle]], and [[option–operand separation]].

Many concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Formal Specification Languages: Eiffel, Denotational Semantics, Vienna Development Method, Abstract Machine Notation, Petri Net, General Books, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; New language design ideas, particularly through the [[Ecma International|Ecma]]/[[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language.

==Characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The key characteristics of the Eiffel language include:

* An object-oriented program structure in which a class serves as the basic unit of decomposition.
* [[Design by contract]] tightly integrated with other language constructs.
* Automatic memory management, typically implemented by [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].
* [[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]], including [[multiple inheritance]], [[wikt:renaming|renaming]], [[Method overriding|redefinition]], "select", [http://docs.eiffel.com/book/method/et-inheritance#Non-conforming_inheritance non-conforming inheritance], and other mechanisms intended to make inheritance safe.
* Constrained and unconstrained [[generic programming]]
* A uniform type system handling both value and reference semantics in which all types, including basic types such as INTEGER, are class-based.
* [[Static typing]]
* Void safety, or static protection against calls on null references, through the attached-types mechanism.
* Agents, or objects that wrap computations, closely connected with [[Closure (computer science)|closure]]s and [[lambda calculus]].
* ''Once'' routines, or routines evaluated only once, for object sharing and decentralized initialization.
* Keyword-based syntax in the [[ALGOL]]/[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tradition but separator-free, insofar as semicolons are optional, with operator syntax available for routines.
* Case insensitivity
* Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming ([[SCOOP (software)|SCOOP]]) facilitates creation of multiple, concurrently active execution vehicles at a level of abstraction above the specific details of these vehicles (e.g. multiple threads without specific mutex management).

==Design goals==
Eiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.

Eiffel shuns coding tricks or coding techniques intended as [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] hints to the compiler. The aim is not only to make the code more readable, but also to allow programmers to concentrate on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. Eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. Compilers for computer programs written in Eiffel provide extensive optimization techniques, such as automatic in-lining, that relieve the programmer of part of the optimization burden.

===Background===
Eiffel was originally developed by [[Eiffel Software]], a company founded by [[Bertrand Meyer]]. ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]'' contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to Eiffel's design.&lt;ref&gt;''Object-Oriented Software Construction'', Second Edition, by [[Bertrand Meyer]], Prentice Hall, 1997, {{ISBN|0-13-629155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design goal behind the Eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. Eiffel supports [[multiple inheritance]], [[genericity]], [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]], type-safe conversions, and [[parameter covariance]]. Eiffel's most important contribution to [[software engineering]] is [[design by contract]] (DbC), in which [[assertion (computing)|assertions]], [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s, and [[class invariant]]s are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.

Eiffel's design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. Eiffel formally supports [[abstract data type]]s. Under Eiffel's design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the "Abstract Data Type".

===Implementations and environments===
[[EiffelStudio]] is an [[integrated development environment]] available under either an [[Open-source license|open source]] or a commercial license. It offers an object-oriented environment for [[software engineering]]. EiffelEnvision is a plug-in for [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that allows users to edit, compile, and debug Eiffel projects from within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Five other [[Open-source software|open source]] implementations are available: [http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tecomp "The Eiffel Compiler" tecomp]; Gobo Eiffel; [[SmartEiffel]], the GNU implementation, based on an older version of the language; [[LibertyEiffel]], based on the SmartEiffel compiler; and [[Visual Eiffel]].

Several other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in Eiffel. [[Sather]], for example, was originally based on Eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several [[functional programming]] features. The interactive-teaching language [[Blue (programming language)|Blue]], forerunner of [[BlueJ]], is also Eiffel-based. The [[Apple Media Tool]] includes an Eiffel-based Apple Media Language.

===Specifications and standards===
The Eiffel language definition is an international standard of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The standard was developed by [[European Computer Manufacturers Association|ECMA International]], which first approved the standard on 21 June 2005 as Standard ECMA-367, &lt;cite&gt;Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language&lt;/cite&gt;. In June 2006, ECMA and ISO adopted the second version. In November 2006, ISO first published that version. The standard can be found and used free of charge on the ECMA site.&lt;ref&gt;ECMA International: &lt;cite&gt;Standard ECMA-367 —Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language 2nd edition (June 2006)&lt;/cite&gt;; available online at [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO version&lt;ref&gt;International Organisation for Standardisation: &lt;cite&gt;Standard ISO/IEC DIS 25436&lt;/cite&gt;, available online at [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=42924&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=]&lt;/ref&gt; is identical in all respects except formatting.

Eiffel Software, "The Eiffel Compiler" tecomp and Eiffel-library-developer Gobo have committed to implementing the standard; Eiffel Software's EiffelStudio 6.1 and "The Eiffel Compiler" tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms—in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. The [[SmartEiffel]] team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of Eiffel. Object Tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its Eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. [[LibertyEiffel]] implements a dialect somewhere in between the [[SmartEiffel]] language and the standard.

The standard cites the following, predecessor Eiffel-language specifications:

* Bertrand Meyer: &lt;cite&gt;Eiffel: The Language&lt;/cite&gt;, Prentice Hall, second printing, 1992 (first printing: 1991)
* Bertrand Meyer: &lt;cite&gt;Standard Eiffel&lt;/cite&gt; (revision of preceding entry), ongoing, 1997–present, at [http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl &lt;cite&gt;Bertrand Meyer's ETL3 page&lt;/cite&gt;], and

The current version of the standard from June 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The ECMA committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.

==Syntax and semantics==

===Overall structure===
An Eiffel "system" or "program" is a collection of ''classes''. Above the level of classes, Eiffel defines ''cluster'', which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of ''subclusters'' (nested clusters). Clusters are not a syntactic [[language construct]], but rather a standard organizational convention. Typically an Eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. In this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. For example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, &lt;code&gt;x.e&lt;/code&gt; might be the name of a file that defines a class called X.

A class contains ''features'', which are similar to "routines", "members", "attributes" or "methods" in other object-oriented programming languages. A class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a "notes" section for documentation and metadata. Eiffel's standard data types, such as &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ARRAY&lt;/code&gt;, are all themselves classes.

Every system must have a class designated as "root", with one of its creation procedures designated as "root procedure". Executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. Generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.

Eiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. Eiffel's control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.

====Scoping====
Unlike many object-oriented languages, but like [[Smalltalk]], Eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of [[information hiding]] or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. To put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all Eiffel attributes are "protected", and "setters" are needed for client objects to modify values. An upshot of this is that "setters" can, and normally do, implement the invariants for which Eiffel provides syntax.

While Eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an "assigner command", such as:

    &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;SOME_TYPE&lt;/span&gt; '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;''' set_some_attribute
    
    &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;set_some_attribute&lt;/span&gt; (v: &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;VALUE_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;)
                &lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;-- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.&lt;/span&gt;
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;'''
                some_attribute := v
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;'''

While a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the Information Hiding Principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a "setter" being used. In practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like &lt;code&gt;some_attribute&lt;/code&gt; as in the example code above.

Unlike other languages, having notions of "public", "protected", "private" and so on, Eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. Feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. For example, (below), the "{NONE}" is similar to "protected" in other languages. Scope applied this way to a "feature set" (e.g. everything below the 'feature' keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the "export" keyword.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
feature {NONE} -- Initialization
	default_create
			-- Initialize a new `zero' decimal instance.
		do
			make_zero
		end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Alternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {ANY} and is similar to the "public" scoping of other languages.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
feature -- Constants
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Finally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the Eiffel project universe, such as:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
feature {DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER} -- Access
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER&lt;/tt&gt;).

===="Hello, world!"====
A programming language's look and feel is often conveyed using a [[Hello world program|"Hello, world!"]] program. Such a program written in Eiffel might be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
class
    HELLO_WORLD
create
    make
feature
    make
        do
            print ("Hello, world!%N")
        end
end 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This program contains the class &lt;code&gt;HELLO_WORLD&lt;/code&gt;. The constructor (create routine) for the class, named &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, invokes the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; system library routine to write a &lt;code&gt;"Hello,&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;world!"&lt;/code&gt; message to the output.

===Design by contract===
{{Main article|Design by contract}}
The concept of Design by Contract is central to Eiffel. The contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). Class Invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). Moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.

The Eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. EiffelStudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the "Workbench mode." When an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ECF file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. Thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. Moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the [http://docs.eiffel.com/book/eiffelstudio/autotest Auto-Test] feature found in EiffelStudio.

The Design by Contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:

* Routine precondition: The precondition may only be weakened by inheritance; any call that meets the requirements of the ancestor meets those of the descendant.
* Routine postcondition: The postcondition can only be strengthened by inheritance; any result guaranteed by the ancestor is still provided by the descendant.
* Class invariant: Conditions that must hold true after the object's creation and after any call to an exported class routine. Because the invariant is checked so often, it makes it simultaneously the most expensive and most powerful form of condition or contract.

In addition, the language supports a "check instruction" (a kind of "assert"), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).

===Void-safety===
[[Void safety|Void-safety]], like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. Void-safe software is protected from run time errors caused by calls to [[null reference|void references]], and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. The analogy to static typing is a useful one. In fact, void-safe capability could be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void-safety is integrated into the type system.

The guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). The void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:

    &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;: '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;detachable&lt;/span&gt;''' &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;SOME_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;use_some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;-- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.&lt;/span&gt;
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;'''
                if '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;attached&lt;/span&gt;''' some_attribute '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;''' l_attribute '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;'''
                    do_something (l_attribute)
                end
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;'''
    
    &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;do_something&lt;/span&gt; (a_value: SOME_TYPE)
                &lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;-- Do something with `a_value'.&lt;/span&gt;
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;'''
               ... doing something with `a_value' ...
            '''&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;'''

The code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether &lt;code&gt;some_attribute&lt;/code&gt; will be attached or detached at the point it is used. Notably, the &lt;code&gt;attached&lt;/code&gt; keyword allows for an "attachment local" (e.g. &lt;code&gt;l_attribute&lt;/code&gt;), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. Thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. &lt;code&gt;l_attribute&lt;/code&gt;) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void-safe).

===Features: commands and queries===
The primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or "instances", a feature is an operation on these objects. There are two kinds of features: queries and commands. A query provides information about an instance. A command modifies an instance.

The command-query distinction is important to the Eiffel method. In particular:

* [[Uniform-Access Principle]]: from the point of view of a software client making a call to a class feature, whether a query is an attribute (field value) or a function (computed value) should not make any difference. For example, &lt;code&gt;a_vehicle.speed&lt;/code&gt; could be an attribute accessed on the object &lt;code&gt;a_vehicle&lt;/code&gt;, or it could be computed by a function that divides distance by time. The notation is the same in both cases, so that it is easy to change the class's implementation without affecting client software.
* [[Command-Query Separation|Command-Query Separation Principle]]: Queries must not modify the instance. This is not a language rule but a methodological principle. So in good Eiffel style, one does not find "get" functions that change something and return a result; instead there are commands (procedures) to change objects, and queries to obtain information about the object, resulting from preceding changes.

===Overloading===
Eiffel does not allow argument [[Method overloading|overloading]]. Each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. One name, within one class, means one thing. This design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. It also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes Eiffel's multiple inheritance mechanism possible.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Meyer: Overloading vs Object Technology, in Journal of Object-Oriented Programming (JOOP), vol. 14, no. 4, October–November 2001, available [http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/joop/overloading.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Names can, of course, be reused in different classes. For example, the feature &lt;tt&gt;plus&lt;/tt&gt; (along with its infix [[#Operator and bracket syntax, assigner commands|alias]] &lt;tt&gt;"+"&lt;/tt&gt;) is defined in several classes: &lt;tt&gt;INTEGER&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;REAL&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.

===Genericity===
{{See also|Generic programming#Genericity in Eiffel}}

A generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. LIST [PHONE], a list of phone numbers; ACCOUNT [G-&gt;ACCOUNT_TYPE], allowing for ACCOUNT [SAVINGS] and ACCOUNT [CHECKING], etc.). Classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. Generic parameters appear in square brackets:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
class LIST [G] ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

G is known as a "formal generic parameter". (Eiffel reserves "argument" for routines, and uses "parameter" only for generic classes.) With such a declaration G represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type G, and a routine can take an argument of that type:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
item: G do ... end
put (x: G) do ... end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;LIST [INTEGER]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LIST [WORD]&lt;/code&gt; are "generic derivations" of this class. Permitted combinations (with &lt;code&gt;n: INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;w: WORD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;il: LIST [INTEGER]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wl: LIST [WORD]&lt;/code&gt;) are:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
n := il.item
wl.put (w)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; are the "actual generic parameters" in these generic derivations.

It is also possible to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the "constraint". For example, in

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   class HASH_TABLE [G, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

a derivation &lt;code&gt;HASH_TABLE [INTEGER, STRING]&lt;/code&gt; is valid only if &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; inherits from &lt;code&gt;HASHABLE&lt;/code&gt; (as it indeed does in typical Eiffel libraries). Within the class, having &lt;code&gt;KEY&lt;/code&gt; constrained by &lt;code&gt;HASHABLE&lt;/code&gt; means that for &lt;code&gt;x: KEY&lt;/code&gt; it is possible to apply to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; all the features of &lt;code&gt;HASHABLE&lt;/code&gt;, as in &lt;code&gt;x.hash_code&lt;/code&gt;.

===Inheritance basics===
To inherit from one or more others, a class will include an &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt; clause at the beginning:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
class C inherit
   A
   B

-- ... Rest of class declaration ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. This must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a &lt;code&gt;redefine&lt;/code&gt; subclause of the inheritance clause, as in

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
class C inherit
    A
        redefine f, g, h end
    B
        redefine u, v end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

See&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/online/eiffel50/intro/language/tutorial-10.html |title=9 INHERITANCE |publisher=Archive.eiffel.com |date=1997-03-23 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a complete discussion of Eiffel inheritance.

===Deferred classes and features===
Classes may be defined with &lt;code&gt;deferred class&lt;/code&gt; rather than with &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. Non-instantiatable classes are called [[abstract class]]es in some other object-oriented programming languages. In Eiffel parlance, only an "effective" class can be instantiated (it may be a descendent of a deferred class). A feature can also be deferred by using the &lt;code&gt;deferred&lt;/code&gt; keyword in place of a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; clause. If a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.

Deferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as Java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to Java's lack of multiple inheritance (which Eiffel has).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artima.com/intv/abcs.html |title=Multiple Inheritance and Interfaces |publisher=Artima.com |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil |title=Multiple Inheritance Is Not Evil |publisher=C2.com |date=2007-04-28 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaming===
A class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. It may, however, change their names through &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; clauses. This is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.

===Tuples===
Tuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding "setter" procedure. A typical tuple type reads

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   TUPLE [name: STRING; weight: REAL; date: DATE]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

and could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. An instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   ["Brigitte", 3.5, Last_night]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Components of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; has been assigned the above tuple then &lt;code&gt;t.weight&lt;/code&gt; has value 3.5.

Thanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   t.weight := t.weight + 0.5
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [STRING, REAL, DATE]&lt;/code&gt;. (In some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ECMA standard.)

The precise specification of e.g. &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [A, B, C]&lt;/code&gt; is that it describes sequences of ''at least'' three elements, the first three being of types &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; respectively. As a result, &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [A, B, C]&lt;/code&gt; conforms to (may be assigned to) &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [A, B]&lt;/code&gt;, to &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [A]&lt;/code&gt; and to &lt;code&gt;TUPLE&lt;/code&gt; (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.

===Agents===
Eiffel's "agent" mechanism wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be used for iteration, [[event-driven programming]], and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize [[functional programming]], allow a similar pattern using [[continuations]], [[closure (computer science)|closures]], or [[generator (computer science)|generators]]; Eiffel's agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in [[Smalltalk]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].

For example, to execute the &lt;code&gt;my_action&lt;/code&gt; block for each element of &lt;code&gt;my_list&lt;/code&gt;, one would write:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   my_list.do_all (agent my_action)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To execute &lt;code&gt;my_action&lt;/code&gt; only on elements satisfying &lt;code&gt;my_condition&lt;/code&gt;, a limitation/filter can be added:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   my_list.do_if (agent my_action, agent my_condition)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In these examples, &lt;code&gt;my_action&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;my_condition&lt;/code&gt; are routines. Prefixing them with &lt;code&gt;agent&lt;/code&gt; yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. So if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; represents that object (for example because &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the argument to &lt;code&gt;do_all&lt;/code&gt;), the instruction

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   a.call ([x])
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

will call the original routine with the argument &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, as if we had directly called the original routine: &lt;code&gt;my_action (x)&lt;/code&gt;. Arguments to &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; are passed as a tuple, here &lt;code&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt;.

It is possible to keep some arguments to an agent '''open''' and make others '''closed'''. The open arguments are passed as arguments to &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt;: they are provided at the time of ''agent use''. The closed arguments are provided at the time of agent ''definition''. For example, if &lt;code&gt;action2&lt;/code&gt; has two arguments, the iteration

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   my_list.do_all (agent action2 (?, y))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

iterates &lt;code&gt;action2 (x, y)&lt;/code&gt; for successive values of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, where the second argument remains set to &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. The question mark &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; indicates an open argument; &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is a closed argument of the agent. Note that the basic syntax &lt;code&gt;agent f&lt;/code&gt; is a shorthand for &lt;code&gt;agent f (?, ?, ...)&lt;/code&gt; with all arguments open. It is also possible to make the ''target'' of an agent open through the notation &lt;code&gt;{T}?&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is the type of the target.

The distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in [[lambda calculus]]. An agent expression such as &lt;code&gt;action2 (?, y)&lt;/code&gt; with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation ''[[currying|curried]]'' on the closed operands.

The agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as &lt;code&gt;my_action&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;my_condition&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;action2&lt;/code&gt;), through inline agents as in

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
my_list.do_all (agent (s: STRING)
     require
         not_void: s /= Void
     do
         s.append_character (',')
     ensure
         appended: s.count = old s.count + 1
     end)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. This avoids defining routines when all that's needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. This is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   my_list.for_all (agent (x: INTEGER): BOOLEAN do Result := (x &gt; 0) end)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with ''n'' arguments is passed to an agent expecting ''m'' arguments with ''m'' &lt; ''n''). This can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition &lt;code&gt;valid_arguments&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt;. Several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by Ribet et al.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Ribet, Cyril Adrian, Olivier Zendra, Dominique Colnet: ''Conformance of agents in the Eiffel language'', in ''[[JOT: Journal of Object Technology|Journal of Object Technology]]'', vol. 3, no. 4, April 2004, Special issue: TOOLS USA 2003, pp. 125-143. Available on line from the [http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2004_04/article7 JOT article page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Once routines===
A routine's result can be cached using the &lt;code&gt;once&lt;/code&gt; keyword in place of &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;. Non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. A common pattern for "once functions" is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. The typical scheme is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
shared_object: SOME_TYPE
    once
        create Result.make (args)
             -- This creates the object and returns a reference to it through `Result'.
    end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The returned object—&lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; in the example—can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.

Often "once routines" perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. Using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. "Once routines" are similar in purpose and effect to the [[singleton pattern]] in many programming languages, and to the [[b:Computer Science Design Patterns/Singleton#Python|Borg pattern]] used in Python.

By default, a "once routine" is called ''once per thread''. The semantics can be adjusted to ''once per process'' or ''once per object'' by qualifying it with a "once key", e.g. &lt;code&gt;once ("PROCESS")&lt;/code&gt;.

===Conversions===
Eiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. The mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. To avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:

: '''(Conversion principle) A type may not both conform and convert to another.'''

For example, &lt;code&gt;NEWSPAPER&lt;/code&gt; may conform to &lt;code&gt;PUBLICATION&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; converts to &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; (and does not inherit from it).

The conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. For example, a &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; class may be declared to convert to &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt;; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   my_string := my_date
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
as a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   create my_string.make_from_date (my_date)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
To make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) &lt;code&gt;make_from_date&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt; clause at the beginning of the class.

As another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from &lt;code&gt;TUPLE [day: INTEGER; month: STRING; year: INTEGER]&lt;/code&gt;, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
      Bastille_day := [14, "July", 1789]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Exception handling===
[[Exception handling]] in Eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. For example, an exception occurs when a routine's caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. In Eiffel, exception handling is not used for [[control flow]] or to correct data-input mistakes.

An Eiffel exception handler is defined using the &lt;tt&gt;rescue&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Within the &lt;tt&gt;rescue&lt;/tt&gt; section, the &lt;tt&gt;retry&lt;/tt&gt; keyword executes the routine again. For example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
connect_to_server (server: SOCKET)
      -- Connect to a server or give up after 10 attempts.
    require
        server /= Void and then server.address /= Void
    local
        attempts: INTEGER
    do
        server.connect
    ensure
      connected: server.is_connected
    rescue
        if attempts &lt; 10 then
            attempts := attempts + 1
            retry
        end
    end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. For most programs a routine name like &lt;tt&gt;attempt_connecting_to_server&lt;/tt&gt; would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.

===Concurrency===
A number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as EiffelNet and EiffelThreads. A concurrency model for Eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is [[SCOOP (software)|SCOOP]], or ''Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming'', not yet part of the official language definition but available in [[EiffelStudio]].
CAMEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke|first=Phillip|author2=Richard Paige|title=Cameo: An Alternative Model of Concurrency for Eiffel|journal=Formal Aspects of Computing|publisher=Springer|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s00165-008-0096-1|volume=21|issue=4|pages=363–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an (unimplemented) variation of SCOOP for Eiffel.
Concurrency also interacts with exceptions. Asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke|first=Phillip|author2=Richard Paige|title=Exceptions in Concurrent Eiffel|journal=Journal of Object Technology|volume=6|issue=10|year=2007|url=http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2007_11/article4/|pages=111–126|doi=10.5381/jot.2007.6.10.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operator and bracket syntax, assigner commands===
Eiffel's view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the "target". So for example an addition such as

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
a + b
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is conceptually understood as if it were the method call

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
a.plus (b)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

with target &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, feature &lt;code&gt;plus&lt;/code&gt; and argument &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.

Of course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. Operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
plus alias "+" (other: INTEGER): INTEGER
        -- ... Normal function declaration...
    end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The range of operators that can be used as "alias" is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as "+" but also "free operators" made of non-alphanumeric symbols. This makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.

Every class may in addition have ''one'' function aliased to "[]", the "bracket" operator, allowing the notation &lt;code&gt;a [i, ...]&lt;/code&gt; as a synonym for &lt;code&gt;a.f (i, ...)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is the chosen function. This is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. For example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   number := phone_book ["JILL SMITH"]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

"Assigner commands" are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. Assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call "setter" procedures. An assignment proper can never be of the form &lt;code&gt;a.x := v&lt;/code&gt; as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). For example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
item alias "[]" (key: STRING): ELEMENT         [3]
      -- The element of key `key'.
      -- ("Getter" query)
    do
        ...
    end

put (e: ELEMENT; key: STRING)
      -- Insert the element `e', associating it with the key `key'.
      -- ("Setter" command)
    do
        ...
    end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   [4] phone_book.put (New_person, "JILL SMITH")
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It is possible to write this equivalently as

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   [5] phone_book ["JILL SMITH"] := New_person
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

(in the same way that &lt;code&gt;phone_book ["JILL SMITH"]&lt;/code&gt; is a synonym for &lt;code&gt;number := phone_book.item ("JILL SMITH")&lt;/code&gt;), provided the declaration of &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; now starts (replacement for [3]) with

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
   item alias "[]" (key: STRING): ELEMENT assign put
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This declares &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; as the assigner command associated with &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (It could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as &lt;code&gt;phone_book.item ("JILL SMITH") := New_person&lt;/code&gt;.

note: The argument list of a's assigner is constrained to be: (a's return type;all of a's argument list...)

===Lexical and syntax properties===
Eiffel is not case-sensitive. The tokens &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;maKe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAKE&lt;/code&gt; all denote the same identifier. See, however, the "style rules" below.

Comments are introduced by &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.

The semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. Most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. This results in less clutter on the program page.

There is no nesting of feature and class declarations. As a result, the structure of an Eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.

It is customary to group features into separate "feature clauses" for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
class HASH_TABLE [ELEMENT, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE] inherit TABLE [ELEMENT]

    feature -- Initialization
         -- ... Declarations of initialization commands (creation procedures/constructors) ...

    feature -- Access
         -- ... Declarations of non-boolean queries on the object state, e.g. item ...

    feature -- Status report
         -- ... Declarations of boolean queries on the object state, e.g. is_empty ...

    feature -- Element change
         -- ... Declarations of commands that change the structure, e.g. put ...

    -- etc.
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In contrast to most [[curly bracket programming language]]s, Eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. This is in line with the [[Command-Query Separation]] principle of the Eiffel method.

===Style conventions===
Much of the documentation of Eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. Some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of Eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.

While the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (&lt;code&gt;LIST&lt;/code&gt;), all-lower-case for feature names (&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;), and initial capitals for constants (&lt;code&gt;Avogadro&lt;/code&gt;). The recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in &lt;code&gt;average_temperature&lt;/code&gt;.

The specification of Eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in ''&lt;code&gt;italics&lt;/code&gt;'', comments, operators, and punctuation marks in &lt;code&gt;Roman&lt;/code&gt;, with program text in &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. For example, the "Hello, world!" program given above would be rendered as below in Eiffel documentation:

 &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''class'''
     ''HELLO_WORLD''
 '''create'''
     ''make''
 '''feature'''
    ''make''
       '''do'''
          ''print'' ("Hello, world!")
       '''end'''
 '''end'''&lt;/span&gt;

===Interfaces to other tools and languages===
Eiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an [[open architecture]] for interfacing with "external" software in any other programming language.

It is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Eiffel provides a straightforward interface to C routines, including support for "inline C" (writing the body of an Eiffel routine in C, typically for short machine-level operations).

Although there is no direct connection between Eiffel and C, many Eiffel [[compiler]]s ([[Visual Eiffel]] is one exception) output C [[source code]] as an [[intermediate language]], to submit to a C compiler, for [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizing]] and [[Porting|portability]]. As such, they are examples of [[transcompiler]]s. The Eiffel Compiler tecomp can execute Eiffel code directly (like an interpreter) without going via an intermediate C code or emit C code which will be passed to a C compiler in order to obtain optimized native code. On .NET, the [[EiffelStudio]] compiler directly generates [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]] (Common Intermediate Language) code. The [[SmartEiffel]] compiler can also output [[Java bytecode]].

The yellow sheet is the prism of a half-hyperbola corresponding to ν=-45°, whereas the red tube is an elliptical prism corresponding to μ=1.  The blue sheet corresponds to ''z''=1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (2.182, -1.661, 1.0).  The foci of the ellipse and hyperbola lie at ''x'' = ±2.0.]]

'''Elliptic cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  Hence, the [[coordinate surfaces]] are [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] of confocal [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]e.  The two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] 
&lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are generally taken to be fixed at &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Basic definition==

The most common definition of elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = z
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;. 

These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae.  The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[ellipse]]s, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form [[hyperbola]]e.

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the remaining scale factor &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  
Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = \frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} \left( \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \mu^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \nu^{2}} \right) + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperbolae.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; 
coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the (x,y) plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) 

A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]
:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are 

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and, of course, &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}} d\sigma d\tau dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - \tau^{2} \right) }
\left[
\sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} 
\left( \sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma} \right) + 
\sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} 
\left( \sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau} \right)
\right] + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of elliptic cylindrical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which elliptic cylindrical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding a 
flat conducting plate of width &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.

The three-dimensional [[wave equation]], when expressed in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, may be solved by separation of variables, leading to the [[Mathieu differential equation]]s.

The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful.  A typical example might involve 
an integration over all pairs of vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
that sum to a fixed vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;, where the integrand 
was a function of the vector lengths &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{p} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{q} \right|&lt;/math&gt;.  (In such a case, one would position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; between the two foci and aligned with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = 2a \mathbf{\hat{x}}&lt;/math&gt;.)  For concreteness,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; could represent the [[momentum|momenta]] of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8548">The '''Euclid–Euler theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in mathematics that relates [[perfect number]]s to [[Mersenne prime]]s. It states that every even perfect number has the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), where 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is a prime number. The prime numbers of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 are known as Mersenne primes, and require ''n'' itself to be prime.

It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. Although the truth of this conjecture remains unknown, it is equivalent, by the Euclid–Euler theorem, to the conjecture that there are infinitely many even perfect numbers. However it is also unknown whether there exists even a single odd perfect number.&lt;ref name="stillwell"/&gt;

==Statement==
A perfect number is a [[natural number]] that equals the sum of its proper [[divisor]]s, the numbers that are less than it and divide it evenly. For instance, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, which sum to 6, so 6 is perfect.
A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1; for a number of this form to be prime, ''p'' itself must also be prime.
The Euclid–Euler theorem states that an even natural number is perfect if and only if it has the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Mersenne prime.&lt;ref name="stillwell"&gt;{{citation|title=Mathematics and Its History|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9781441960528|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7mxZqjs5yUC&amp;pg=PA40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Euclid]] proved that {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} is an even perfect number whenever {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime (Euclid, Prop. IX.36). This is the final result on [[number theory]] in ''[[Euclid's Elements]]''; the later books in the ''Elements'' instead concern [[irrational number]]s, [[solid geometry]], and the [[golden ratio]]. Euclid expresses the result by stating that if a finite [[geometric series]] beginning at&amp;nbsp;1 with ratio&amp;nbsp;2 has a prime sum ''P'', then this sum multiplied by the last term ''T'' in the series is perfect. Expressed in these terms, the sum ''P'' of the finite series is the Mersenne prime {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} and the last term ''T'' in the series is the power of two {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Euclid proves that ''PT'' is perfect by observing that the geometric series with ratio&amp;nbsp;2 starting at ''P'', with the same number of terms, is proportional to the original series; therefore, since the original series sums to ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''T''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the second series sums to ''P''(2''T''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''PT''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''P'', and both series together add to 2''PT'', two times the supposed perfect number. However, these two series are disjoint from each other and (by the primality of ''P'') exhaust all the divisors of ''PT'', so ''PT'' has divisors that sum to 2''PT'', showing that it is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Euclid]]|title=The Thirteen Books of The Elements, Translated with introduction and commentary by Sir Thomas L. Heath, Vol. 2 (Books III–IX)|edition=2nd|publisher=Dover|year=1956|pages=421–426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a millennium after Euclid, [[Alhazen]] {{circa|1000 CE}} conjectured that ''every'' even perfect number is of the form {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} where {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime, but he was not able to prove this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 18th century that [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that the formula {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} will yield all the even perfect numbers.&lt;ref name="stillwell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Leonhard|last=Euler|authorlink=Leonhard Euler|chapter=De numeris amicibilibus|trans-chapter=On amicable numbers|language=Latin|contribution-url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E798.html|title=Commentationes arithmeticae|volume=2|year=1849|pages=627–636}}. Originally read to the Berlin Academy on February 23, 1747, and published posthumously. See in particular section 8, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes; each Mersenne prime generates one even perfect number, and vice versa.

==Proof==
Euler's proof is short&lt;ref name="stillwell"/&gt; and depends on the fact that the [[Divisor function|sum of divisors]] function σ is [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]]; that is, if ''a'' and ''b'' are any two [[relatively prime]] integers, then {{nowrap|1=σ(''ab'') = σ(''a'')σ(''b'').}} For this formula to be valid, the sum of divisors of a number must include the number itself, not just the proper divisors. A number is perfect if and only if its sum of divisors is twice its value.

One direction of the theorem (the part already proved by Euclid) immediately follows from the multiplicative property: Every Mersenne prime gives rise to an even perfect number. When {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime, {{nowrap|1=σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)) =}} {{nowrap|1=σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;)σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}}. The sum of divisors for {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, e.g. for {{nowrap|1=p=5}} we get 16 ({{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;5 − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and the sum of its divisors is 31 ({{nowrap|1= 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}). {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} being a prime implies that the sum of its divisors is {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} since its constituents are the number itself and 1 so {{nowrap|1=σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) = (2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) + 1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Taking this into account leads to:

{{nowrap|1=σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;)σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)=}}{{nowrap|1=(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; =}} {{nowrap|1=2(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)).}} Therefore, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} is perfect.&lt;ref name="imsp"&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to Mathematical Structures and Proofs|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Larry|last=Gerstein|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9781461442653|at=Theorem 6.94, p.&amp;nbsp;339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qK9y768b1NQC&amp;pg=PA339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;{{citation|title=A proof that all even perfect numbers are a power of two times a Mersenne prime|website=Prime Pages|url=https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html|accessdate=2014-12-02|first=Chris K.|last=Caldwell}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntfagd"&gt;{{citation|title=Number Theory, Fourier Analysis and Geometric Discrepancy|volume=81|series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts|first=Giancarlo|last=Travaglini|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107044036|pages=26–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIaYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other direction, suppose that an even perfect number has been given, and partially factor it as 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x'', where ''x'' is odd. For {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''}} to be perfect,  its sum of divisors must be twice its value:
{{NumBlk|:|{{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' = σ(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x'') = (2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)σ(''x'').}}|∗}}
The odd factor {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} on the right side of '''(∗)''' is at least 3, and it must divide or equal&amp;nbsp;''x'', the only odd factor on the left side, so
{{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''/(2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} is a proper divisor of ''x''. Dividing both sides of '''(∗)''' by the common factor {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} and taking into account the known divisors ''x'' and ''y'' of ''x'' gives
:{{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' =}} {{nowrap|1=σ(''x'') =}} {{nowrap|1=''x'' + ''y'' + other divisors =}} {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' + other divisors.}}
For this equality to be true, there can be no other divisors. Therefore, ''y'' must be&amp;nbsp;1, and ''x'' must be a prime of the form {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1.&lt;ref name="imsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntfagd"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8265">The '''Fermi&amp;ndash;Ulam model (FUM)''' is a [[dynamical system]] that was introduced by [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematician]] [[Stanislaw Ulam]] in 1961.

FUM is a variant of [[Enrico Fermi|Enrico Fermi's]] primary work on acceleration of [[cosmic ray]]s, namely [[Fermi acceleration]]. The system consists of a particle that collides elastically between a fixed wall and a moving one, each of infinite mass.  The walls represent the [[magnetic mirror]]s with which the [[cosmic rays|cosmic particles]] collide.

A. J. Lichtenberg  and M. A. Lieberman provided a simplified version of [[Fermi-Ulam model|FUM]] (SFUM) that derives from the
[[Poincaré map|Poincaré surface of section]] &lt;math&gt;x=const.&lt;/math&gt; and writes

: &lt;math&gt;u_{n+1}=|u_n+U_\mathrm{wall}(\varphi_n)| &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between two [[TeX]] displays for legibility --&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{n+1}=\varphi_n+\frac{kM}{u_{n+1}} \pmod k,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_n&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle after the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th collision with the fixed wall, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding phase of the moving wall, &lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{wall}&lt;/math&gt;  is the velocity law of the moving wall and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the stochasticity parameter of the system.

If the velocity law of the moving wall is differentiable enough,  according to [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|KAM theorem]] invariant curves in the phase space &lt;math&gt;(\varphi,u)&lt;/math&gt; exist. These invariant curves act as barriers that do not allow for a particle to further accelerate and the average velocity of a population of particles saturates after finite iterations of the map. For instance, for sinusoidal velocity law of the moving wall such curves exist, while they do not for sawtooth velocity law that is discontinuous. Consequently, at the first case particles cannot accelerate infinitely, reversely to what happens at the last one.

FUM became over the years a prototype model for studying non-linear dynamics and [[Map (mathematics)|coupled mappings]].

The rigorous solution of the Fermi-Ulam problem (the velocity and energy of the particle are bounded) was given first by L. D. Pustyl'nikov in &lt;ref&gt;L.D. Pustyl'nikov, (1983). On a problem of Ulam. Teoret. Mat.Fiz.57, 128-132. Engl. transl. in Theoret. Math. Phys. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. D.

In spite of these negative results, if one considers the Fermi–Ulam model in the framework of the special theory of relativity, then  under some general conditions the energy of the particle tends to infinity for an open set of initial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.

==2D generalization==

Though the 1D FUM does not lead to acceleration for smooth oscillations, unbounded energy growth has been observed in 2D [[Dynamical billiards|billiards]] with oscillating boundaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loskutov A., Ryabov A.

Strongly chaotic billiard with oscillating boundary can serve as a paradigm for driven chaotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Driven chaotic mesoscopic systems,dissipation and decoherence'', in Proceedings of the 38th Karpacz Winter School of Theoretical Physics, Edited by P. Garbaczewski and R. Olkiewicz (Springer, 2002). https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403061&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2882">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[set theory]], '''Fodor's lemma''' states the following:

If &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Regular cardinal|regular]], [[uncountable]] [[Cardinal number|cardinal]], &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stationary set|stationary subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f:S\rightarrow\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is regressive (that is, &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;) then there is some &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and some stationary &lt;math&gt;S_0\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)=\gamma&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in S_0&lt;/math&gt;. In modern parlance, the nonstationary ideal is ''normal''.

The lemma was first proved by the Hungarian set theorist, [[Géza Fodor (mathematician)|Géza Fodor]] in 1956.  It is sometimes also called "The Pressing Down Lemma".

==Proof==
We can assume that &lt;math&gt;0\notin S&lt;/math&gt; (by removing 0, if necessary).
If Fodor's lemma is false, for every &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; there is some [[club set]] &lt;math&gt;C_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;C_\alpha\cap f^{-1}(\alpha)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;C=\Delta_{\alpha&lt;\kappa} C_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The club sets are closed under [[diagonal intersection]], so &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is also club and therefore there is some &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in S\cap C&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and so there can be no &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in f^{-1}(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)\geq\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, a [[contradiction]].

Fodor's lemma also holds for [[Thomas Jech]]'s notion of stationary sets as well as for the [[Stationary set#Generalized notion|general notion]] of stationary set.

== Fodor's lemma for trees ==
Another related statement, also known as Fodor's lemma (or Pressing-Down-lemma), is the following:

For every non-special tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and regressive mapping &lt;math&gt;f:T\rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;t&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the order on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt;), there is a non-special subtree &lt;math&gt;S\subset T&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

{{one source|date=November 2011}}
In [[number theory]], '''friendly numbers''' are two or more [[natural number]]s with a common '''[[Abundant number|abundancy]] index''', the ratio between the sum of [[divisor]]s of a number and the number itself. Two numbers with the same abundancy form a '''friendly pair'''; ''n'' numbers with the same abundancy form a '''friendly ''n''-tuple'''.

Being mutually friendly is an [[equivalence relation]], and thus induces a [[partition (set theory)|partition]] of the positive naturals into '''clubs''' ([[equivalence class]]es) of mutually friendly numbers.

A number that is not part of any friendly pair is called '''solitary'''.

The abundancy index of ''n'' is the [[rational number]] σ(''n'') / ''n'', in which σ denotes the [[divisor function|sum of divisors function]]. A number ''n'' is a friendly number if there exists ''m'' ≠ ''n'' such that σ(''m'') / ''m'' = σ(''n'') / ''n''. Note that abundancy is not the same as [[abundant number|abundance]], which is defined as σ(''n'') − 2''n''.

Abundancy may also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{-\!1}(n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes a divisor function with &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{k}(n)&lt;/math&gt; equal to the sum of the ''k''-th powers of the divisors of ''n''.

The numbers 1 through 5 are all solitary. The smallest friendly number is 6, forming for example the friendly pair 6 and 28 with abundancy σ(6) / 6 = (1+2+3+6) / 6 = 2, the same as σ(28) / 28 = (1+2+4+7+14+28) / 28 = 2. The shared value 2 is an integer in this case but not in many other cases. Numbers with abundancy 2 are also known as [[perfect numbers]]. There are several unsolved problems related to the friendly numbers.

In spite of the similarity in name, there is no specific relationship between the friendly numbers and the [[amicable number]]s or the [[sociable number]]s, although the definitions of the latter two also involve the divisor function.

== Examples ==
As another example, 30 and 140 form a friendly pair, because 30 and 140 have the same abundancy:
:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{\sigma(30)}{30} = \tfrac{1+2+3+5+6+10+15+30}{30} =\tfrac{72}{30} = \tfrac{12}{5}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{\sigma(140)}{140} = \tfrac{1+2+4+5+7+10+14+20+28+35+70+140}{140} = \tfrac{336}{140} = \tfrac{12}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers 2480, 6200 and 40640 are also members of this club, as they each have an abundancy equal to 12/5.

For an example of [[parity (mathematics)|odd]] numbers being friendly, consider 135 and 819 (abundancy 16/9). There are also cases of even being friendly to odd, like 42 and 544635 (abundancy 16/7).

A [[square number]] can be friendly, for instance both 693479556 (the square of 26334) and 8640 have abundancy 127/36 (this example is due to Dean Hickerson).

=== Status for small ''n'' ===
{{color|blue|Blue numbers}} are ''proved'' friendly {{OEIS|id=A074902}}, {{color|red|red numbers}} are ''proved'' solitary {{OEIS|id=A095739}}, numbers ''n'' such that ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)&lt;/math&gt; are [[coprime]] {{OEIS|id=A014567}} are not coloured here, though they are known to be solitary. Other numbers have unknown status and are {{background color|yellow|yellow}}.

== Solitary numbers ==

A number that belongs to a singleton club, because no other number is friendly with it, is a solitary number. All prime numbers are known to be solitary, as are powers of prime numbers. More generally, if the numbers ''n'' and σ(''n'') are [[coprime]] – meaning that the [[greatest common divisor]] of these numbers is 1, so that σ(''n'')/''n'' is an irreducible fraction – then the number ''n'' is solitary {{OEIS|id=A014567}}. For a prime number ''p'' we have σ(''p'') = ''p'' + 1, which is coprime with ''p''.

No general method is known for determining whether a number is friendly or solitary. The smallest number whose classification is unknown (as of 2009) is 10; it is conjectured to be solitary; if not, its smallest friend is a fairly large number, like the status for the number 24, although 24 is friendly, its smallest friend is 91,963,648. There are no friendly numbers for 10 that are less than 2,000,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cemra|first1=Jason|title=10 Solitary Check|url=https://github.com/CemraJC/solidarity|website=Github/CemraJC/Solidarity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large clubs==
It is an open problem whether there are infinitely large clubs of mutually friendly numbers. The [[perfect number]]s form a club, and it is conjectured that there are infinitely many [[perfect number]]s (at least as many as there are [[Mersenne prime]]s), but no proof is known. {{As of|2018|2}}, 50 perfect numbers are known, the largest of which has more than 46 million digits in [[decimal]] notation.  There are clubs with more known members, in particular those formed by [[multiply perfect number]]s, which are numbers whose abundancy is an integer.  As of early 2013, the club of friendly numbers with abundancy equal to 9 has 2094 known members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flammenkamp |first=Achim |title=The Multiply Perfect Numbers Page|url= http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/mpn.html |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some are known to be quite large, clubs of multiply perfect numbers (excluding the perfect numbers themselves) are conjectured to be finite.

The '''fundamental theorems of asset pricing''' (also: '''of arbitrage''', '''of finance''')  provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a market to be [[arbitrage|arbitrage free]] and for a market to be [[Complete market|complete]]. An arbitrage opportunity is a way of making money with no initial investment without any possibility of loss. Though arbitrage opportunities do exist briefly in real life, it has been said that any sensible market model must avoid this type of profit.&lt;ref name=Pasc&gt;Pascucci, Andrea (2011) ''PDE and Martingale Methods in Option Pricing''. Berlin: [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} The first theorem is important in that it ensures a fundamental property of market models. Completeness is a common property of market models (for instance the [[Black–Scholes model]]). A complete market is one in which every [[contingent claim]] can be [[Replicating strategy|replicated]]. Though this property is common in models, it is not always considered desirable or realistic.&lt;ref name=Pasc /&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Discrete markets==
In a discrete (i.e. finite state) market, the following hold:&lt;ref name=Pasc /&gt;
#'''The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing''': A discrete market, on a discrete [[probability space]] (Ω, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;), is [[arbitrage|arbitrage-free]] if, and only if, there exists at least one [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] that is [[Equivalence (measure theory)|equivalent]] to the original probability measure, ''P''.
#'''The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing''': An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks ''S'' and a [[risk-free bond]] ''B'' is [[Complete market|complete]] if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to ''P'' and has [[numeraire]] ''B''.

==In more general markets==

When stock price returns follow a single [[Brownian motion]], there is a unique risk neutral measure.   When the stock price process is assumed to follow a more general [[sigma-martingale]] or [[semimartingale]], then the concept of arbitrage is too narrow, and a stronger concept such as [[no free lunch with vanishing risk]] must be used to describe these opportunities in an infinite dimensional setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What is... a Free Lunch?|first1=Freddy|last1=Delbaen|first2=Walter|last2=Schachermayer|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=51|number=5|pages=526–528|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200405/what-is.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24969">'''Gleason's theorem''' (named after [[Andrew M. Gleason]]) is a mathematical result which shows that the rule one uses to calculate [[probability|probabilities]] in [[quantum physics]] follows logically from particular assumptions about how measurements are represented mathematically.  More specifically, it proves that the [[Born rule]] for the probability of obtaining specific results for a given measurement follows naturally from the structure formed by the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of events in a [[Real number|real]] or [[Complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]].  This result is of particular importance for the field of [[quantum logic]].  Furthermore, it was historically significant for the role it played in showing that [[local hidden variable theory|local hidden variable theories]] are inconsistent with quantum physics.  The theorem states:

:'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''H'' is a [[separable Hilbert space]]. A ''measure'' on ''H'' is a function ''f'' that assigns a nonnegative real number to each closed subspace of ''H'' in such a way that, if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\{A_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is a countable collection of mutually orthogonal subspaces of ''H,'' and the closed [[linear span]] of this collection is ''B,'' then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(B) = \sum_i f(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;. If the Hilbert space ''H'' has dimension at least three, then every measure ''f'' can be written in the form &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(A) = \mathrm{Tr}(W P_A)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is a [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semidefinite]] [[trace class]] operator and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P_A&lt;/math&gt; is the orthogonal projection onto ''A.''

The trace-class operator ''W'' can be interpreted as the [[density matrix]] of a [[quantum state]]. Effectively, the theorem says that any legitimate probability measure on the space of measurement outcomes is generated by some quantum state.

== Overview ==
Consider a quantum system with a Hilbert space of dimension 3 or larger, and suppose that there exists some function that assigns a probability to each outcome of any possible measurement upon that system.  The probability of any such outcome must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive, and in order to be consistent, for any individual measurement the probabilities of the different possible outcomes must add up to 1.  Gleason's theorem shows that any such function&amp;mdash;that is, any consistent assignment of probabilities to measurement outcomes&amp;mdash;must be expressible in terms of a quantum-mechanical [[density operator]] and the [[Born rule]].  In other words, given that each quantum system is associated with a Hilbert space, and given that measurements are described by particular mathematical entities defined on that Hilbert space, both the structure of quantum state space and the rule for calculating probabilities from a quantum state then follow.

For simplicity, we can assume that the dimension of the Hilbert space is finite. A quantum-mechanical [[observable]] is a [[self-adjoint operator]] on that Hilbert space. Equivalently, we can say that a measurement is defined by an [[orthonormal basis]], with each possible outcome of that measurement corresponding to one of the vectors comprising the basis. A density operator is a [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-semidefinite operator]] whose [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] is equal to 1. In the language of [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|von Weizsäcker]], a density operator is a "catalogue of probabilities": for each measurement that can be defined, we can compute the probability distribution over the outcomes of that measurement from the density operator.&lt;ref&gt;Dreischner, Görnitz and von Weizsäcker (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; We do so by applying the Born rule, which states that&lt;math display="block"&gt;P(x_i) = \mathrm{Tr}(\Pi_i W),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the density operator and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Pi_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operator]] onto the basis vector associated with the measurement outcome &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a function from projection operators to the [[unit interval]] with the property that, if a set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\{\Pi_i\}&lt;/math&gt; of projection operators sum to the [[identity matrix]]—that is, if they correspond to an orthonormal basis—then&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_i f(\Pi_i) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;Such a function expresses an assignment of probability values to the outcomes of measurements, an assignment that is "noncontextual" in the sense that the probability for an outcome does not depend upon which measurement that outcome is embedded within, but only upon the mathematical representation of that specific outcome, i.e., its projection operator.&lt;ref&gt;Barnum ''et al.'' (2000); Pitowsky (2003), §1.3; Pitowsky (2006), §2.1; Kunjwal and Spekkens (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Gleason's theorem states that for any such function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a positive semidefinite operator with unit trace &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;math display="block"&gt;f(\Pi_i) = \mathrm{Tr}(\Pi_i W).&lt;/math&gt;Both the Born rule and the fact that "catalogues of probability" are positive semidefinite operators of unit trace follow from the assumptions that measurements are represented by orthonormal bases, and that probability assignments are "noncontextual".  In order for Gleason's theorem to be applicable, the space on which measurements are defined must be a real or complex Hilbert space, or a quaternionic [[Module (mathematics)|module]].&lt;ref&gt;Piron (1972), §6; Drisch (1979); Horwitz ''et al.'' (1984); Razon ''et al.'' (1991); Varadarajan (2007), pp. 83 ff.; Cassinelli and Lahti (2017), §2&lt;/ref&gt;  (Gleason's argument is inapplicable if, for example, one tries to construct an [[p-adic quantum mechanics|analogue of quantum mechanics using ''p''-adic numbers]].)

Another way of phrasing the theorem uses the terminology of [[quantum logic]], which makes heavy use of [[lattice theory]].  Quantum logic treats quantum events (or measurement outcomes) as [[propositional logic|logical propositions]], and studies the relationships and structures formed by these events, with specific emphasis on [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].  In quantum logic, the logical propositions that describe events are organized into a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] in which the [[distributive law]], valid in classical logic, is weakened, to reflect the fact that in quantum physics, not all pairs of quantities can be [[uncertainty principle|measured simultaneously]].&lt;ref&gt;Dvurecenskij (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''representation theorem'' in quantum logic shows that such a lattice is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the lattice of [[Space (mathematics)|subspaces]] of a [[vector space]] with a [[scalar product]].&lt;ref&gt;Pitowsky (2006), §2&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains an open problem in quantum logic to constrain the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' over which the vector space is defined.  [[Solèr's theorem]] implies that, granting certain hypotheses, the field ''K'' must be either the [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s, or the [[quaternion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Baez (2010); Cassinelli and Lahti (2017), §3&lt;/ref&gt;

We let ''A'' represent an observable with finitely many potential outcomes: the eigenvalues of the [[Hermitian operator]] ''A'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \ldots, \alpha_n &lt;/math&gt;.  An "event", then, is a proposition &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, which in natural language can be rendered "the outcome of measuring ''A'' on the system is &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;".  Let ''H'' denote the Hilbert space associated with the physical system, and let ''L'' denote the lattice of subspaces of ''H.'' The events &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; generate a sublattice of ''L'' which is a finite [[Boolean algebra]], and if ''n'' is the dimension of the Hilbert space, then each event is an [[Atom (order theory)|atom]] of the lattice ''L.''

A ''quantum probability function'' over ''H'' is a [[real function]] ''P'' on the atoms in ''L'' that has the following properties:
# &lt;math&gt;P(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P(y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y \in L&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n P(x_j) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal atoms

This means for every lattice element ''y'', the probability of obtaining ''y'' as a measurement outcome is known, since it may be expressed as the union of the atoms under ''y'': &lt;math display="block"&gt;P(y) = \sum \{ P(x_j) \mid x_j \le y \}. &lt;/math&gt;

In this context, Gleason's theorem states:

:''Given a quantum probability function P over a space of dimension &lt;math&gt;\ge 3 &lt;/math&gt;, there is an Hermitian, non-negative operator W on H, whose trace is unity, such that &lt;math&gt;P(x) = \langle \mathbf{x}, W \mathbf{x} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; for all atoms &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \langle\,  ,\, \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the inner product, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

As one consequence: if some &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;P(x_0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''W'' is the projection onto the complex line spanned by &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P(x) = \left| \langle\mathbf{x_0}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \right|^2&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt;.

== Implications ==
Gleason's theorem highlights a number of fundamental issues in quantum measurement theory. [[QBism|Fuchs]] argues that the theorem "is an extremely powerful result," because "it indicates the extent to which the Born probability rule and even the state-space structure of density operators are ''dependent'' upon the theory's other postulates."  As a consequence, quantum theory is "a tighter package than one might have first thought."&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;94&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem is often taken to rule out the possibility of [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] in quantum mechanics. This is because the theorem implies that there can be no [[Bivalence|bivalent]] probability measures, i.e. probability measures having only the values 1 and 0. To see this, note that the mapping &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow \langle Wu, u \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the [[unit sphere]] of the Hilbert space for any density operator ''W''. Since this unit sphere is [[Connected (topology)|connected]], no continuous function on it can take only the values of 0 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;Wilce (2017), §1.3&lt;/ref&gt; But, a hidden variable theory which is [[determinism|deterministic]] implies that the probability of a given outcome is ''always'' either 0 or 1: either the electron's spin is up, or it isn't (which accords with [[Classical mechanics|classical]] intuitions). Gleason's theorem therefore seems to hint that quantum theory represents a deep and fundamental departure from the classical way of looking at the world. (This has been argued to support a variety of philosophical [[perspectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Gleason's theorem motivated later work by [[John Stuart Bell]], [[Ernst Specker]] and [[Simon Kochen]] that led to the result often called the [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], which rules out a broad class of hidden-variable models. As noted above, Gleason's theorem shows that there is no bivalent probability measure over the rays of a Hilbert space (as long as the dimension of that space exceeds 2). The Kochen–Specker theorem refines this statement by constructing a specific finite subset of rays on which no bivalent probability measure can be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Peres (1991); Mermin (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

A density operator that is a rank-1 projection is known as a ''pure'' quantum state, and all quantum states that are not pure are designated ''mixed.'' Assigning a pure state to a quantum system implies certainty about the outcome of some measurement on that system (i.e., &lt;math&gt;P(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for some outcome ''x''). Any mixed state can be written as a [[convex combination]] of pure states, though not in a unique way. Because Gleason's theorem yields the set of all quantum states, pure and mixed, it can be taken as an argument that pure and mixed states should be treated on the same conceptual footing, rather than viewing pure states as more fundamental conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

To some researchers, such as Pitowsky, the result is convincing enough to conclude that quantum mechanics represents a new theory of probability. Alternatively, such approaches as [[relational quantum mechanics]] make use of Gleason's theorem as an essential step in deriving the quantum formalism from [[Information theory|information-theoretic]] postulates.&lt;ref&gt;Wilce (2017), §1.4; Cassinelli and Lahti (2017), §2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outline of Gleason's proof ==

Gleason's original proof proceeds in three stages.&lt;ref&gt;Hrushovski and Pitowsky (2004), §2&lt;/ref&gt; In Gleason's terminology, a frame function that is derived in the standard way&amp;mdash;i.e., by the Born rule from a quantum state&amp;mdash;is ''regular.'' Gleason derives a sequence of [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s concerning when a frame function is necessarily regular, culminating in the final theorem. First, he establishes that every frame function on the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Then, he proves the theorem for the special case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, he shows that the general problem can be reduced to this special case.

== Generalizations ==

Gleason originally proved the theorem assuming that the measurements applied to the system are of the [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] type, i.e., that each possible measurement corresponds to an [[orthonormal basis]] of the Hilbert space. Later, Busch, and independently [[Carlton M. Caves|Caves]] ''et al.,'' proved an analogous result for a more general class of measurements, known as [[POVM|positive operator valued measures]] (POVMs).  The proof of this result is simpler than that of Gleason's, and unlike the original theorem of Gleason, the generalized version using POVMs also applies to the case of a single [[qubit]], for which the dimension of the Hilbert space equals 2.&lt;ref&gt;Busch (2003); Caves ''et al.'' (2004); Fuchs (2011), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as showing that the probabilities for outcomes of measurements upon a single qubit cannot be explained in terms of hidden variables, provided that the class of allowed measurements is sufficiently broad.&lt;ref&gt;Spekkens (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason's theorem, in its original version, does not hold if the Hilbert space is defined over the [[rational number]]s, i.e., if the components of vectors in the Hilbert space are restricted to be rational numbers, or complex numbers with rational parts. However, when the set of allowed measurements is the set of all POVMs, the theorem holds.&lt;ref&gt;Caves ''et al.'' (2004), §3.D&lt;/ref&gt;

The original proof by Gleason was not [[Constructive proof|constructive]]: one of the ideas on which it depends is the fact that every continuous function defined on a [[compact space]] obtains its [[minimum]]. Because one cannot in all cases explicitly show where the minimum occurs, a proof that relies upon this principle will not be a constructive proof. However, the theorem can be reformulated in such a way that a constructive proof can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Richman and Bridges (1999); Hrushovski and Pitowsky (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason's theorem can be extended to some cases where the observables of the theory form a [[von Neumann algebra]]. Specifically, an analogue of Gleason's result can be shown to hold if the algebra of observables has no direct summand that is representable as the algebra of two-by-two matrices over a commutative von Neumann algebra (i.e., no direct summand of type I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In essence, the only barrier to proving the theorem is the fact that Gleason's original result does not hold when the Hilbert space is that of a qubit.&lt;ref&gt;Hamhalter (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=February 2018}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''harmonic divisor number''', or '''Ore number''' (named after [[Øystein Ore]] who defined it in 1948), is a positive integer whose [[divisor]]s have a [[harmonic mean]] that is an [[integer]]. The first few harmonic divisor numbers are

:[[1 (number)|1]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[28 (number)|28]], [[140 (number)|140]], [[270 (number)|270]], [[496 (number)|496]], 672, 1638, 2970, 6200, [[8128 (number)|8128]], 8190 {{OEIS|id=A001599}}.

==Examples==
For example, the harmonic divisor number 6 has the four divisors 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their harmonic mean is an integer:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{4}{\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}=2.&lt;/math&gt;

The number 140 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, and 140. Their harmonic mean is:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{12}{\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{10}
+\frac{1}{14}+\frac{1}{20}+\frac{1}{28}+\frac{1}{35}+\frac{1}{70}+\frac{1}{140}}=5
&lt;/math&gt;

5 is an integer, making 140 a harmonic divisor number.

==Factorization of the harmonic mean==
The harmonic mean {{math|''H''(''n'')}} of the divisors of any number {{mvar|n}} can be expressed as the formula
:&lt;math&gt;H(n) = \frac{n\sigma_0(n)}{\sigma_1(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}} is the [[divisor function|sum of {{mvar|i}}th powers of the divisors]] of {{mvar|n}}: {{math|''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of divisors, and {{math|''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the sum of divisors {{harv|Cohen|1997}}.
All of the terms in this formula are [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]], but not [[Completely multiplicative function|completely multiplicative]].
Therefore, the harmonic mean {{math|''H''(''n'')}} is also multiplicative.
This means that, for any positive integer {{mvar|n}}, the harmonic mean {{math|''H''(''n'')}} can be expressed as the product of the harmonic means for the [[prime power]]s in the [[Integer factorization|factorization]] of {{mvar|n}}.

For instance, we have
:&lt;math&gt;H(4) = \frac{3}{1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}}=12/7&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H(5) = \frac{2}{1+\frac{1}{5}} = 5/3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H(7) = \frac{2}{1+\frac{1}{7}} = 7/4,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;H(140) = H(4 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) = H(4)\cdot H(5)\cdot H(7) = \frac{12}{7}\cdot \frac{5}{3}\cdot \frac{7}{4} = 5.&lt;/math&gt;

== Harmonic divisor numbers and perfect numbers ==
[[File:Perfect number Cuisenaire rods 6.png|thumb|Demonstration, with [[Cuisenaire rod]]s, of the perfection of the number 6]]

For any integer ''M'', as Ore observed, the product of the harmonic mean and [[arithmetic mean]] of its divisors equals ''M'' itself, as can be seen from the definitions. Therefore, ''M'' is harmonic, with harmonic mean of divisors ''k'', if and only if the average of its divisors is the product of ''M'' with a [[unit fraction]] 1/''k''.

Ore showed that every [[perfect number]] is harmonic. To see this, observe that the sum of the divisors of a perfect number ''M'' is exactly ''2M''; therefore, the average of the divisors is ''M''(2/τ(''M'')), where τ(''M'') denotes the [[Divisor function|number of divisors]] of ''M''. For any ''M'', τ(''M'') is odd if and only if ''M'' is a [[square number]], for otherwise each divisor ''d'' of ''M'' can be paired with a different divisor ''M''/''d''. But, no perfect number can be a square: this follows from the known form of even perfect numbers and from the fact that odd perfect numbers (if they exist) must have a factor of the form ''q''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; where α ≡ 1 (mod 4). Therefore, for a perfect number ''M'', τ(''M'') is even and the average of the divisors is the product of ''M'' with the unit fraction 2/τ(''M''); thus, ''M'' is a harmonic divisor number.

Ore conjectured that no odd harmonic divisor numbers exist other than 1. If the conjecture is true, this would imply the nonexistence of [[perfect number#Odd perfect numbers|odd perfect number]]s.

== Bounds and computer searches ==

W. H. Mills (unpublished; see Muskat) showed that any odd harmonic divisor number above 1 must have a prime power factor greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cohen showed that any such number must have at least three different prime factors. {{harvtxt|Cohen|Sorli|2010}} showed that there are no odd harmonic divisor numbers smaller than 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.

Cohen, Goto, and others starting with Ore himself have performed computer searches listing all small harmonic divisor numbers. From these results, lists are known of all harmonic divisor numbers up to 2×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, and all harmonic divisor numbers for which the harmonic mean of the divisors is at most 300.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6426">In [[mathematics]], '''Hilbert's fourth problem''' in the 1900 [[Hilbert problems]] is a foundational question in [[geometry]]. In one statement derived from the original, it was to find [[geometry|geometries]] whose [[axioms]] are closest to those of [[Euclidean geometry]] if the [[Ordering (geometry)|order]]ing and [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence]] axioms are retained, the [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] axioms weakened, and the equivalent of the [[parallel postulate]] omitted. The original statement of Hilbert has been judged too vague to admit a definitive answer. Nevertheless, a solution was sought with the German mathematician [[Georg Hamel]] being the first who tried to solve the problem. A recognized solution for dimensions 2 and 3 was given by Armenian mathematician [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]].

==Original statement==

Hilbert discusses the existence of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[non-Archimedean geometry]], as well as the idea that a 'straight line' is defined as the shortest path between two points. He mentions how congruence of triangles is necessary for Euclid's proof that a straight line in the plane is the shortest distance between two points. He summarizes as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theorem of the straight line as the shortest distance between two points and the essentially equivalent theorem of Euclid about the sides of a triangle, play an important part not only in number theory but also in the theory of surfaces and in the calculus of variations. For this reason, and because I believe that the thorough investigation of the conditions for the validity of this theorem will throw a new light upon the idea of distance, as well as upon other elementary ideas, e. g., upon the idea of the plane, and the possibility of its definition by means of the idea of the straight line, ''the construction and systematic treatment of the geometries here possible seem to me desirable.''&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, David, "Mathematische Probleme" [[Göttinger Nachrichten]], (1900), pp. 253–297, and in [[Archiv der Mathematik und Physik]], (3) '''1''' (1901), 44–63 and 213–237. Published in English translation by Dr. Maby Winton Newson, [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] '''8''' (1902), 437–479 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html#prob23] [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf] {{doi|10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3}} . [A fuller title of the journal Göttinger Nachrichten is Nachrichten von der Königl. Gesellschaft der Wiss. zu Göttingen.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpretations==
One popular interpretation of this problem is that it is asking for all metrics on convex portions of the plane where the [[geodesic]]s are straight Euclidean lines.&lt;ref&gt;Paiva, JC Álvarez. "Hilbert’s fourth problem in two dimensions." MASS selecta (2003): 165–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hilbert's fourth problem in dimension 3==

The solution of Hilbert's fourth problem in dimension 2 was obtained&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian, A note on pseudo-metrics on the plane, Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete
1976, Volume 37, Issue 2, pp 145–155&lt;/ref&gt; in 1976 by Rouben V. Ambartzumian in the framework of his theory of combinatorial integral geometry&lt;ref&gt;by R. V. Ambartzumian, Combinatorial integral geometry with applications to mathematical stereology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1982, {{ISBN|0-4712-7977-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; by application of measure continuation starting from "Buffonic" valuations in the space of lines in the plane. Recently (2014) an attempt was made by Ambartzumian to apply the same techniques starting from similar valuations that live in the space of planes in 3 dimensional Euclidean space. The paper&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian, Remarks on Combinatorics of Planes in Euclidean Three Dimensions, SOP Transactions on Applied Mathematics, Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 29–43, 2014. [http://www.scipublish.com/journals/AM/papers/262]&lt;/ref&gt; puts forward the concept of ''wedge metrics'' and formulates some conditions for a wedge metric to generate a measure in the space of planes. The definition of a wedge metrics is based on certain tetrahedral inequalities of combinatorial nature. The latter inequalities replace the usual triangle inequality.

==Examples==

===Gnomonic projection===
{{main|Gnomonic projection}}
[[Image:Gnomonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Great circles transform to straight lines via gnomonic projection]]

A '''gnomonic [[map projection]]''' of the sphere displays all [[great circle]]s as straight lines, resulting in any line segment on a gnomonic map showing the shortest route between the segment's two endpoints. This is achieved by casting surface points of the sphere onto a [[tangent]] plane, each landing where a ray from the center of the earth passes through the point on the surface and then on to the plane.

This projection allows one to give a spherical metric to the portion of the plane it maps onto.

===Klein disk model===

[[File:Uniform tiling 73-t1 klein.png|thumb|240px|A hyperbolic [[triheptagonal tiling]] in a Beltrami–Klein model projection]]
In geometry, the '''Klein disk model''' is a model of 2-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]] in which points are represented by the points in the interior of the [[unit disk]] and lines are represented by the [[chord (geometry)|chord]]s, straight line segments with endpoints on the boundary circle.

In [[abstract algebra]], the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] of '''hyperbolic quaternions''' is a [[nonassociative algebra]] over the [[real numbers]] with elements of the form
:&lt;math&gt;q = a + bi + cj + dk, \quad a,b,c,d \in \Bbb{R} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where multiplication is determined with rules that are similar to multiplication in the [[quaternions]].

The four-dimensional algebra of hyperbolic quaternions incorporates some of the features of the older and larger algebra of [[biquaternion]]s. They both contain subalgebras isomorphic to the [[split-complex number]] plane. Furthermore, just as the quaternion algebra '''H''' can be viewed as a [[quaternion#H as a union of complex planes|union of complex planes]], so the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is a union of split-complex number planes sharing the same [[real line#In real algebras|real line]].

It was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who promoted this concept in the 1890s as his ''Algebra of Physics'', first through the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1891, then through his 1894 book of five ''Papers in Space Analysis'', and in a series of lectures at [[Lehigh University]] in 1900.

==Algebraic structure==
Like the [[quaternions]], the set of hyperbolic quaternions form a [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]] of [[dimension]] 4.  A [[linear combination]]

:&lt;math&gt;q = a+bi+cj+dk&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''hyperbolic quaternion''' when  &lt;math&gt;a, b, c,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers and the basis set &lt;math&gt;\{1,i,j,k\}&lt;/math&gt; has these products:

:&lt;math&gt;ij=k=-ji&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;jk=i=-kj&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ki=j=-ik&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^2=+1=j^2=k^2&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[distributive property]], these relations can be used to multiply any two hyperbolic quaternions.

Unlike the ordinary quaternions, the hyperbolic quaternions are not [[associative]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;(ij)j = kj = -i&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;i(jj) = i&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, this example shows that the hyperbolic quaternions are not even an [[alternative algebra]].

The first three relations show that products of the (non-real) basis elements are [[anti-commutative]].  Although this basis set does not form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the set

:&lt;math&gt;\{1,i,j,k,-1,-i,-j,-k\}&lt;/math&gt;

forms a [[quasigroup]]. One also notes that any subplane of the set ''M'' of hyperbolic quaternions that contains the real axis forms a plane of [[split-complex number]]s. If

:&lt;math&gt;q^*=a-bi-cj-dk&lt;/math&gt;

is the conjugate of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, then the product

:&lt;math&gt;q(q^*)=a^2-b^2-c^2-d^2&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[quadratic form]] used in [[spacetime]] theory. In fact, for events ''p'' and ''q'', the [[bilinear form]] 
: &lt;math&gt;\eta (p,q) = -p_0q_0 + p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 + p_3q_3 &lt;/math&gt;
arises as the negative of the real part of the hyperbolic quaternion product ''pq''*, and is used in [[Minkowski space#Minkowski metric|Minkowski space]].

Note that the set of [[unit (ring theory)|units]] U = {''q'' : ''qq''* ≠ 0 } is ''not'' closed under multiplication. See the references (external link) for details.

==Discussion==

The hyperbolic quaternions form a [[nonassociative ring]]; the failure of [[associativity]] in this algebra curtails the facility of this algebra in transformation theory. Nevertheless, 
this algebra put a focus on analytical kinematics by suggesting a [[mathematical model]]:
When one selects a unit vector ''r'' in the hyperbolic quaternions, then ''r'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +1. The plane &lt;math&gt;D_r = \lbrace t + x r : t, x \in R \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; with hyperbolic quaternion multiplication is a commutative and associative subalgebra isomorphic to the split-complex number plane.
The [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] &lt;math&gt;\exp(a r) = \cosh(a)  + r \ \sinh(a) &lt;/math&gt; transforms D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; t + x r \quad \mapsto \quad \exp(a r) (t + x r) = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\cosh(a) t + x \sinh(a)) + (\sinh(a) t + x \cosh(a)) r . \!&lt;/math&gt;
Since the direction ''r'' in space is arbitrary, this hyperbolic quaternion multiplication can express any [[Lorentz boost]] using the parameter ''a'' called [[rapidity]]. However, the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is deficient for representing the full [[Lorentz group]] (see [[biquaternion]] instead).

Writing in 1967 about the dialogue on vector methods in the 1890s, a historian commented
:''The introduction of another system of vector analysis, even a sort of compromise system such as Macfarlane's, could scarcely be well received by the advocates of the already existing systems and moreover probably acted to broaden the question beyond the comprehension of the as-yet uninitiated reader.''&lt;ref name=Crowe&gt;{{cite book |first=M.J. |last=Crowe |title=[[A History of Vector Analysis]] |publisher=University of Notre Dame |year=1967 |isbn= |page=191 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometry==
Later, Macfarlane published an article in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'' in 1900. In it he treats a model for [[hyperbolic space]] H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[hyperboloid]]

:&lt;math&gt;H^3 = \{ q \in M: q(q^*)=1 \} \!&lt;/math&gt;.

This [[isotropic]] model is called the [[hyperboloid model]] and consists of all the [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versors]] in the ring of hyperbolic quaternions.

==Historical review==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Quasigroup]] --&gt;
The 1890s felt the influence of the posthumous publications of [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]] and the ''continuous groups'' of [[Sophus Lie]]. An example of a [[one-parameter group]] is the [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] with the [[hyperbolic angle]] parameter. This parameter is part of the [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] of a split-complex number. But it is a startling aspect of finite mathematics that makes the hyperbolic quaternion ring different:

The basis &lt;math&gt;\{1,\,i,\,j,\,k\}&lt;/math&gt; of the vector space of hyperbolic quaternions is not [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under multiplication: for example, &lt;math&gt;ji=-\!k&lt;/math&gt;. Nevertheless, the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\,i,\,j,\,k,\,-\!1,\,-\!i,\,-\!j,\,-\!k\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under multiplication. It satisfies all the properties of an abstract group except the associativity property; being finite, it is a [[Latin square]] or [[quasigroup]], a peripheral [[mathematical structure]]. Loss of  the associativity property of multiplication as found in quasigroup theory is not consistent with [[linear algebra]] since all linear transformations compose in an associative manner. Yet physical scientists were calling in the 1890s for mutation of the squares of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; :
The [[Yale University]] physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] had pamphlets with the plus one square in his three-dimensional vector system. [[Oliver Heaviside]] in England wrote columns in the ''Electrician'', a trade paper, advocating the positive square. In 1892 he brought his work together in ''Transactions of the Royal Society A''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heaviside|1892|pp=427–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he says his vector system is
:simply the elements of Quaternions without quaternions, with the notation simplified to the uttermost, and with the very inconvenient ''minus'' sign before scalar product done away with.

So the appearance of Macfarlane's hyperbolic quaternions had some motivation, but the disagreeable non-associativity precipitated a reaction. [[Cargill Gilston Knott]] was moved to offer the following:

'''Theorem''' (Knott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.G. |last=Knott |title=Recent Innovations in Vector Theory |journal=Nature |volume=47 |issue=1225 |pages=590–3 |year=1893 |doi=10.1038/047590b0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v47/n1225/pdf/047590b0.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=1893Natur..47R.590. }} read before the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 19 December 1892 and published in ''Proceedings''&lt;/ref&gt; 1892)
:If a 4-algebra on basis &lt;math&gt;\{1,\,i,\,j,\,k\}&lt;/math&gt; is associative and off-diagonal products are given by Hamilton's rules, then &lt;math&gt;i^2=-\!1=j^2=k^2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
:&lt;math&gt;j = ki = (-ji)i = -j(ii)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Cycle the letters &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1=j^2=k^2&lt;/math&gt;. ''QED''.

This theorem needed statement to justify resistance to the call of the physicists and the ''Electrician''. The quasigroup stimulated a considerable stir in the 1890s: the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' was especially conducive to an exhibit of what was known by giving two digests of Knott's work as well as those of several other vector theorists. Michael J. Crowe devotes chapter six of his book ''[[A History of Vector Analysis]]'' to the various published views, and notes the hyperbolic quaternion:

:''Macfarlane constructed a new system of vector analysis more in harmony with Gibbs–Heaviside system than with the quaternion system. ...he...defined a full product of two vectors which was comparable to the full quaternion product except that the scalar part was positive, not negative as in the older system.''&lt;ref name=Crowe/&gt;

In 1899 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] noted the hyperbolic quaternion and the non-associativity property&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= |last=Hamilton |title=Elements of Quaternions |publisher= |location= |year=1899 |isbn= |page=163 |url= |edition=2nd |editor-first=C.J. |editor-last=Joly }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ascribing its origin to Oliver Heaviside.

The hyperbolic quaternions, as the ''Algebra of Physics'', undercut the claim that ordinary quaternions made on physics. As for mathematics, the hyperbolic quaternion is another [[hypercomplex number]], as such structures were called at the time. By the 1890s [[Richard Dedekind]] had introduced the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] concept into commutative algebra, and the [[vector space]] concept was being abstracted by [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In 1899 [[Alfred North Whitehead]] promoted [[Universal algebra]], advocating for inclusivity. The concepts of quasigroup and [[algebra over a field]] are examples of [[mathematical structure]]s describing hyperbolic quaternions.

==Macfarlane's hyperbolic quaternion paper of 1900==
The ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'' published "Hyperbolic Quaternions" 
in 1900, a paper in which Macfarlane regains associativity for multiplication by reverting 
to [[biquaternion|complexified quaternions]]. While there he used some expressions later 
made famous by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]: where Macfarlane wrote
:&lt;math&gt;ij=k\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;jk=i\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ki=j\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
the [[Pauli matrices]] satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\sigma_2=\sigma_3\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_2\sigma_3=\sigma_1\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_3\sigma_1=\sigma_2\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
while referring to the same complexified quaternions.

The opening sentence of the paper is "It is well known that quaternions are intimately connected with [[spherical trigonometry]] and in fact they reduce the subject to a branch of algebra." This statement may be verified by reference to the contemporary work ''[[Vector Analysis]]'' which works with a reduced quaternion system based on [[dot product]] and [[cross product]]. In Macfarlane's paper there is an effort to produce "trigonometry on the surface of the equilateral hyperboloids" through the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions, now re-identified in an associative ring of eight real dimensions. The effort is reinforced by a plate of nine figures on page 181.  They illustrate the descriptive power of his "space analysis" method. For example, figure 7 is the 
common [[Minkowski diagram]] used today in [[special relativity]] to discuss change of velocity of a frame of reference and [[relativity of simultaneity]].

On page 173 Macfarlane expands on his greater theory of quaternion variables. By way of contrast he notes that [[Felix Klein]] appears not to look beyond the theory of [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]].

Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-00404-7|pages=39|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''independence axiom''', is an [[axiom]] of [[decision theory]] and various [[social sciences]]. The term is used with different meanings in different contexts; although they all attempt to provide an account of rational individual behavior or aggregation of individual preferences, the exact formulations differ from context to context.

In [[rational choice theory|individual choice theory]], IIA sometimes refers to [[Herman Chernoff|Chernoff]]'s condition or [[Sen's property α]] (alpha):
if an alternative ''x'' is chosen from a set ''T'', and ''x'' is also an element of a subset ''S'' of ''T'', then ''x'' must be chosen from ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, 1970, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- A choice function ''C'' (which maps each subset ''S'' of alternatives into a subset &lt;math&gt;C(S)\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;)
satisfies ''property α'' if for any &lt;math&gt;s\in S\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x \in C(T)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in C(S)&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt; That is, eliminating some of the unchosen alternatives shouldn't affect the selection of ''x'' as the best option.

In [[social choice theory]], Arrow's IIA is one of the conditions in [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]], which states that it is impossible to aggregate individual rank-order preferences ("votes") satisfying IIA in addition to certain other reasonable conditions. Arrow defines IIA thus:
:The social preferences between alternatives ''x'' and ''y'' depend only on the individual preferences between ''x'' and ''y''.{{sfn|Arrow|1963|page=28}}

Another expression of the principle:
:If ''A'' is preferred to ''B'' out of the choice set {''A'',''B''}, introducing a third option ''X'', expanding the choice set to {''A'',''B'',''X''}, must not make ''B'' preferable to ''A''.
In other words, preferences for ''A'' or ''B'' should not be changed by the inclusion of ''X'', i.e., ''X'' is irrelevant to the choice between ''A'' and ''B''. This formulation appears in [[Nash bargaining game|bargaining theory]], theories of [[decision theory|individual choice]], and [[voting theory]]. Some theorists find it too strict an axiom; experiments have shown that human behavior rarely adheres to this axiom (see {{section link||Criticisms of the IIA assumption}}).  

In [[social choice theory]], IIA is also defined as:
:If ''A'' is selected over ''B'' out of the choice set {''A'',''B''} by a voting rule for given voter preferences of ''A'', ''B'', and an unavailable third alternative ''X'', then if only preferences for ''X'' change, the voting rule must not lead to ''B'''s being selected over ''A''.
In other words, whether ''A'' or ''B'' is selected should not be affected by a change in the vote for an unavailable ''X'', which is irrelevant to the choice between ''A'' and ''B''.

==Voting theory==
In [[voting systems]], independence from irrelevant alternatives is often interpreted as, if one candidate (''X'') would win an election, and if a new candidate (''Y'') were added to the ballot, then either ''X'' or ''Y'' would win the election.

[[Approval voting]], [[range voting]], and [[majority judgment]] satisfy the IIA criterion if it is assumed that voters rate candidates individually and independently of knowing the available alternatives in the election, using their own absolute scale. This assumption implies that some voters having meaningful preferences in an election with only two alternatives will necessarily cast a vote which has little or no voting power, or necessarily abstain. If it is assumed to be at least possible that any voter having preferences might not abstain, or vote their favorite and least favorite candidates at the top and bottom ratings respectively, then these systems fail IIA. Allowing either of these conditions alone causes failure. Another cardinal system, [[cumulative voting]], does not satisfy the criterion regardless of either assumption.

An anecdote that illustrates a violation of IIA has been attributed to [[Sidney Morgenbesser]]:

:After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."

All voting systems have some degree of inherent susceptibility to [[strategic nomination]] considerations. Some regard these considerations as less serious unless the voting system fails the easier-to-satisfy [[independence of clones criterion]].

===Local independence ===
A criterion weaker than IIA proposed by H. Peyton Young and A. Levenglick is called '''local independence from irrelevant alternatives''' (LIIA).&lt;ref name="Young1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=H. Peyton|title=Equity: In Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IQ0PKZ4WYC|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-04464-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LIIA requires that both of the following conditions always hold:
*If the option that finished in last place is deleted from all the votes, then the order of finish of the remaining options must not change. (The winner must not change.)
*If the winning option is deleted from all the votes, the order of finish of the remaining options must not change. (The option that finished in second place must become the winner.)

An equivalent way to express LIIA is that if a subset of the options are in consecutive positions in the order of finish, then their relative order of finish must not change if all other options are deleted from the votes. For example, if all options except those in 3rd, 4th and 5th place are deleted, the option that finished 3rd must win, the 4th must finish second, and 5th must finish 3rd.

Another equivalent way to express LIIA is that if two options are consecutive in the order of finish, the one that finished higher must win if all options except those two are deleted from the votes.

LIIA is weaker than IIA because satisfaction of IIA implies satisfaction of LIIA, but not vice versa.

Despite being a weaker criterion (i.e. easier to satisfy) than IIA, LIIA is satisfied by very few voting methods. These include [[Kemeny–Young method|Kemeny-Young]] and [[ranked pairs]], but not [[Schulze method|Schulze]]. Just as with IIA, LIIA compliance for rating methods such as [[approval voting]], [[range voting]], and [[majority judgment]] require the assumption that voters rate each alternative individually and independently of knowing any other alternatives, on an absolute scale (calibrated prior to the election), even when this assumption implies that voters having meaningful preferences in a two candidate election will necessarily abstain.

===Criticism of IIA===
IIA is too strong to be satisfied by any voting method capable of majority rule unless there are only two alternatives.

Consider a scenario in which there are three candidates ''A'', ''B'', &amp; ''C'', and the voters' preferences are as follows:
:25% of the voters prefer ''A'' over ''B'', and ''B'' over ''C''. (''A''&gt;''B''&gt;''C'')
:40% of the voters prefer ''B'' over ''C'', and ''C'' over ''A''. (''B''&gt;''C''&gt;''A'')
:35% of the voters prefer ''C'' over ''A'', and ''A'' over ''B''. (''C''&gt;''A''&gt;''B'')
(These are preferences, not votes, and thus are independent of the voting method.)

75% prefer ''C'' over ''A'', 65% prefer ''B'' over ''C'', and 60% prefer ''A'' over ''B''. The presence of this societal [[intransitivity]] is the [[voting paradox]]. Regardless of the voting method and the actual votes, there are only three cases to consider:
*Case 1: ''A'' is elected. IIA is violated because the 75% who prefer ''C'' over ''A'' would elect ''C'' if ''B'' were not a candidate.
*Case 2: ''B'' is elected. IIA is violated because the 60% who prefer ''A'' over ''B'' would elect ''A'' if ''C'' were not a candidate.
*Case 3: ''C'' is elected. IIA is violated because the 65% who prefer ''B'' over ''C'' would elect ''B'' if ''A'' were not a candidate.

To show failure, it is only assumed at least possible that enough voters in the majority might cast a minimally positive vote for their preferred candidate when there are only two candidates, rather than abstain. Most ranked ballot methods and Plurality voting satisfy the Majority Criterion, and therefore fail IIA automatically by the example above. Meanwhile, passage of IIA by Approval and Range voting requires in certain cases that voters in the majority are necessarily excluded from voting (they are assumed to necessarily abstain in a two candidate race, despite having a meaningful preference between the alternatives).

So even if IIA is desirable, requiring its satisfaction seems to allow only voting methods that are undesirable in some other way, such as treating one of the voters as a dictator. Thus the goal must be to find which voting methods are best, rather than which are perfect.

An argument can be made that IIA is itself undesirable. IIA assumes that when deciding whether ''A'' is likely to be better than ''B'', information about voters' preferences regarding ''C'' is irrelevant and should not make a difference. However, the heuristic that leads to majority rule when there are only two options is that the larger the number of people who think one option is better than the other, the greater the likelihood that it is better, all else being equal (see [[Condorcet's Jury Theorem]]). A majority is more likely than the opposing minority to be right about which of the two candidates is better, all else being equal, hence the use of majority rule.

The same heuristic implies that the larger the majority, the more likely it is that they are right. It would seem to also imply that when there is more than one majority, larger majorities are more likely to be right than smaller majorities. Assuming this is so, the 75% who prefer ''C'' over ''A'' and the 65% who prefer ''B'' over ''C'' are more likely to be right than the 60% who prefer ''A'' over ''B'', and since it is not possible for all three majorities to be right, the smaller majority (who prefer ''A'' over ''B'') are more likely to be wrong, and less likely than their opposing minority to be right. Rather than being irrelevant to whether ''A'' is better than ''B'', the additional information about the voters' preferences regarding ''C'' provides a strong hint that this is a situation where all else is not equal.

===In social choice===
From Kenneth Arrow,{{sfn|Arrow|1951|pp=15, 23, 27}} each "voter" ''i'' in the society has an ordering R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that ranks the (conceivable) objects of [[social choice theory|social choice]]—''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in simplest case&amp;mdash;from high to low.
An ''aggregation rule'' (''voting rule'') in turn maps each ''profile'' or [[tuple]] (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) of voter preferences (orderings)
to a ''social ordering'' '''R''' that determines the social preference (ranking) of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.

Arrow's IIA requires that whenever a pair of alternatives is ranked the same way in two preference profiles (over the same choice set), then the aggregation rule must order these alternatives identically across the two profiles.&lt;ref&gt;More formally, an aggregation rule (social welfare function) ''f'' is ''pairwise independent'' if for any profiles &lt;math&gt;p=(R_1, \ldots, R_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p'=(R'_1, \ldots, R'_n)&lt;/math&gt; of preferences and for any alternatives x, y, if &lt;math&gt;R_i\cap\{x,y\}^2=R'_i\cap \{x,y\}^2&lt;/math&gt; for all i, then &lt;math&gt;f(p)\cap\{x,y\}^2=f(p')\cap \{x,y\}^2&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the definition of Arrow's IIA adopted in the context of Arrow's theorem in most textbooks and surveys (Austen-Smith and Banks, 1999, page 27; Campbell and Kelly, 2002, in Handbook of SCW, page 43; Feldman and Serrano, 2005, Section 13.3.5; Gaertner, 2009, page 20; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston, Green, 1995, page 794; Nitzan, 2010, page 40; Tayor, 2005, page 18; see also Arrow, 1963, page 28 and Sen, 1970, page 37).
This formulation does not consider addition or deletion of options, since the set of options is fixed, and this is a condition involving two profiles.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, suppose an aggregation rule ranks ''a'' above ''b'' at the profile given by 
*(''acbd'', ''dbac''),
(i.e., the first individual prefers ''a'' first, ''c'' second, ''b'' third, ''d'' last; the second individual prefers ''d'' first, ..., and ''c'' last). Then, if it satisfies IIA, it must rank ''a'' above ''b'' at the following three profiles:
*(''abcd'', ''bdca'')
*(''abcd'', ''bacd'')
*(''acdb'', ''bcda'').
The last two forms of profiles (placing the two at the top; and placing the two at the top and bottom) are especially useful
in the proofs of theorems involving IIA.

Arrow's [[Social Choice and Individual Values#Conditions and theorem|IIA]] does not imply an IIA similar to those different from this at the top of this article nor conversely.{{sfn|Ray|1973}}

In the first edition of his book, Arrow misinterpreted IIA by considering the removal of a choice from the consideration set. Among the objects of choice, he distinguished those that by hypothesis are specified as ''feasible'' and ''infeasible''. Consider two possible sets of voter orderings (''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, ...,&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; '') and (''&lt;math&gt;R_1'&lt;/math&gt;, ...,&lt;math&gt;R_n'&lt;/math&gt;'') such that the ranking of ''X'' and ''Y'' for each voter ''i'' is the same for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_i'&lt;/math&gt;''. The voting rule generates corresponding social orderings ''R'' and ''R'.'' Now suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are feasible but ''Z'' is infeasible (say, the candidate is not on the ballot or the social state is outside the [[production possibility frontier|production possibility curve]]). Arrow required that the voting rule that ''R'' and ''R' ''select the same (top-ranked) ''social choice'' from the feasible set (X, Y), and that this requirement holds no matter what the ranking is of infeasible ''Z'' relative to ''X'' and ''Y'' in the two sets of orderings. IIA does not allow "removing" an alternative from the available set (a candidate from the ballot), and it says nothing about what would happen in such a case: all options are assumed to be "feasible."

=== Examples ===

==== Borda count ====
{{Main|Borda count}}
In a [[Borda count]] election, 5 voters rank 5 alternatives [''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E''].

3 voters rank [''A''&gt;''B''&gt;''C''&gt;''D''&gt;''E''].
1 voter ranks [''C''&gt;''D''&gt;''E''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''].
1 voter ranks [''E''&gt;''C''&gt;''D''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''].

Borda count (''a''=0, ''b''=1): ''C''=13, ''A''=12, ''B''=11, ''D''=8, ''E''=6. ''C'' wins.

Now, the voter who ranks [''C''&gt;''D''&gt;''E''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''] instead ranks [''C''&gt;''B''&gt;''E''&gt;''D''&gt;''A'']; and the voter who ranks [''E''&gt;''C''&gt;''D''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''] instead ranks [''E''&gt;''C''&gt;''B''&gt;''D''&gt;''A'']. They change their preferences only over the pairs [''B'', ''D''], [''B'', ''E''] and [''D'', ''E''].

The new Borda count: ''B''=14, ''C''=13, ''A''=12, ''E''=6, ''D''=5. ''B'' wins.

The social choice has changed the ranking of [''B'', ''A''] and [''B'', ''C'']. The changes in the social choice ranking are dependent on irrelevant changes in the preference profile. In particular, ''B'' now wins instead of ''C'', even though no voter changed their preference over [''B'', ''C''].

=====Borda count and strategic voting=====
Consider an election in which there are three candidates, ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', and only two voters. Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference. The highest ranked candidate in a voter's preference is given 2 points, the second highest 1, and the lowest ranked 0; the overall ranking of a candidate is determined by the total score it gets; the highest ranked candidate wins.

We consider two profiles:
*In profiles 1 and 2, the first voter casts his votes in the order ''BAC'', so ''B'' receives 2 points, ''A'' receives 1, and ''C'' receives 0 from this voter.
*In profile 1, the second voter votes ''ACB'', so ''A'' will win outright (the total scores: ''A'' 3, ''B'' 2, ''C'' 1).
*In profile 2, the second voter votes ''ABC'', so ''A'' and ''B'' will tie (the total scores: ''A'' 3, ''B'' 3, ''C'' 0).

Thus, if the second voter wishes ''A'' to be elected, he had better vote ''ACB'' regardless of his actual opinion of ''C'' and ''B''. This violates the idea of "independence from irrelevant alternatives" because the voter's comparative opinion of ''C'' and ''B'' affects whether ''A'' is elected or not. In both profiles, the rankings of ''A'' relative to ''B'' are the same for each voter, but the social rankings of ''A'' relative to ''B'' are different.

==== Copeland ====
{{Main|Copeland's method}}

This example shows that Copeland's method violates IIA. Assume four candidates A, B, C and D with 6 voters with the following preferences:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 1           || A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D
|-
| 1           || A &gt; C &gt; B &gt; D
|-
| 2           || B &gt; D &gt; A &gt; C
|-
| 2           || C &gt; D &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1

| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''1-0-2''
|}

* [X] indicates voters who preferred the candidate in the column caption to the one in the row caption
* [Y] indicates voters who preferred the candidate in the row caption to the one in the column caption

'''Result''': A has two wins and one defeat, while no other candidate has more wins than defeats. Thus, '''A''' is elected Copeland winner.

===== Change of irrelevant preferences =====
Now, assume all voters would raise D over B and C without changing the order of A and D. The preferences of the voters would now be:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 1   || A &gt; D &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| 1   || A &gt; D &gt; C &gt; B
|-
| 2   || D &gt; B &gt; A &gt; C
|-
| 2   || D &gt; C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1
|+ Pairwise Preferences
|-
| colspan=2 rowspan=2 | 
| colspan=4 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" align=center | X
|-
| bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | A

|-
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" | C
| bgcolor="#e0e0ff" | [X] 4 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 2
| bgcolor="#c0c0c0" | [X] 3 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 3
|
| bgcolor="#e0e0ff" | [X] 6 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 0
|-
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" | D
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 2 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 4
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 0 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 6
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 0 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 6
|
|-
| colspan=2 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | Pairwise election results (won-tied-lost):
| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''2-0-1''
| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''0-1-2''
| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''0-1-2''
| bgcolor=#bbffbb|'''3-0-0'''
|}

'''Result''': D wins against all three opponents. Thus, '''D''' is elected Copeland winner.

===== Conclusion =====
The voters changed only their preference orders over B, C and D. As a result, the outcome order of D and A changed. A turned from winner to loser without any change of the voters' preferences regarding A. Thus, Copeland's method fails the IIA criterion.

==== Instant-runoff voting ====
{{Main|Instant-runoff voting}}
In an [[Instant-runoff voting|instant-runoff]] election, 5 voters rank 3 alternatives [''A'', ''B'', ''C''].

2 voters rank [''A''&gt;''B''&gt;''C''].
2 voters rank [''C''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''].
1 voter ranks [''B''&gt;''A''&gt;''C''].

Round 1: ''A''=2, ''B''=1, ''C''=2; ''B'' eliminated.
Round 2: ''A''=3, ''C''=2; ''A'' wins.

Now, the two voters who rank [''C''&gt;''B''&gt;''A''] instead rank [''B''&gt;''C''&gt;''A'']. They change only their preferences over ''B'' and ''C''.

Round 1: ''A''=2, ''B''=3, ''C''=0; ''B'' wins with a majority of the vote.

The social choice ranking of [''A'', ''B''] is dependent on preferences over the irrelevant alternatives [''B'', ''C''].

==== Kemeny–Young method ====
{{Main|Kemeny–Young method}}

This example shows that the Kemeny–Young method violates the IIA criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and C with 7 voters and the following preferences:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 3           || A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| '''2'''     || '''B &gt; C &gt; A'''
|-
| 2           || C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The Kemeny–Young method arranges the pairwise comparison counts in the following tally table:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

The ranking scores of all possible rankings are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Preferences !! 1. vs 2. !! 1. vs 3. !! 2. vs 3. !! Total
|-

|-
| C &gt; B &gt; A   ||  2       ||  4       ||  2       || bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''8''
|}

'''Result''': The ranking A &gt; B &gt; C has the highest ranking score. Thus, '''A''' wins ahead of B and C.

===== Change of irrelevant preferences =====
Now, assume the two voters (marked bold) with preferences B &gt; C &gt; A would change their preferences over the pair B and C. The preferences of the voters would then be in total:

| A &gt; C &gt; B   ||  3       ||  5       ||  4       || bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''12''
|-
| B &gt; A &gt; C   ||  2       ||  3       ||  3       || bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''8''

|-
| C &gt; B &gt; A   ||  4       ||  4       ||  2       || bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''10''
|}

'''Result''': The ranking C &gt; A &gt; B has the highest ranking score. Thus, '''C''' wins ahead of A and B.

===== Conclusion =====
The two voters changed only their preferences over B and C, but this resulted in a change of the order of A and C in the result, turning A from winner to loser without any change of the voters' preferences regarding A. Thus, the Kemeny-Young method fails the IIA criterion.

==== Minimax ====
{{Main|Minimax Condorcet}}

This example shows that the Minimax method violates the IIA criterion. Assume four candidates A, B and C and 13 voters with the following preferences:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| '''2'''     || '''B &gt; A &gt; C'''
|-
| 4           || A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| 3           || B &gt; C &gt; A
|-
| 4           || C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

Since all preferences are strict rankings (no equals are present), all three Minimax methods (winning votes, margins and pairwise opposite) elect the same winners.

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1
|+ Pairwise election results

|}

* [X] indicates voters who preferred the candidate in the column caption to the one in the row caption
* [Y] indicates voters who preferred the candidate in the row caption to the one in the column caption

'''Result''': A has the closest biggest defeat. Thus, '''A''' is elected Minimax winner.

===== Change of irrelevant preferences =====
Now, assume the two voters (marked bold) with preferences B &gt; A &gt; C change the preferences over the pair A and C. The preferences of the voters would then be in total:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 4           || A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| 5           || B &gt; C &gt; A
|-
| 4           || C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1
|+ Pairwise election results
|-
| colspan=2 rowspan=2 | 
| colspan=3 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" align=center | X
|-
| bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | A

|-
| colspan=2 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | worst pairwise opposition:
| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''9''
| bgcolor=#bbffbb|'''8'''
| bgcolor=#ffbbbb|''9''
|}

'''Result''': Now, B has the closest biggest defeat. Thus, '''B''' is elected Minimax winner.

===== Conclusion =====
So, by changing the order of A and C in the preferences of some voters, the order of A and B in the result changed. B is turned from loser to winner without any change of the voters' preferences regarding B. Thus, the Minimax method fails the IIA criterion.

==== Plurality voting system ====
{{Main|Plurality voting system}}
In a [[plurality voting system]] 7 voters rank 3 alternatives (''A'', ''B'', ''C'').

*3 voters rank (''A''&gt;''B''&gt;''C'')
*2 voters rank (''B''&gt;''A''&gt;''C'')
*2 voters rank (''C''&gt;''B''&gt;''A'')

In an election, initially only ''A'' and ''B'' run: ''B'' wins with 4 votes to ''A'''s 3, but the entry of ''C'' into the race makes ''A'' the new winner.

The relative positions of ''A'' and ''B'' are reversed by the introduction of ''C'', an "irrelevant" alternative.

==== Ranked pairs ====
{{Main|Ranked pairs}}

This example shows that the Ranked pairs method violates the IIA criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and C and 7 voters with the following preferences:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 3           || A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| '''2'''     || '''B &gt; C &gt; A'''
|-
| 2           || C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1
|+ Pairwise election results
|-
| colspan=2 rowspan=2 | 
| colspan=3 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" align=center | X
|-
| bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | A

|-
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" rowspan=3 | Y
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" | A
|
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 2 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 5

|-
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" | B
| bgcolor="#e0e0ff" | [X] 5 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 2
| 
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 2 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 5
|-
| bgcolor="#ffc0c0" | C
| bgcolor="#ffe0e0" | [X] 3 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 4
| bgcolor="#e0e0ff" | [X] 5 &lt;br&gt;[Y] 2
|
|-
| colspan=2 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | Pairwise election results (won-tied-lost):
| 1-0-1
| 1-0-1
| 1-0-1
|}

The sorted list of victories would be:
{| class="wikitable"
! Pair !! Winner
|-
| A (5) vs. B (2) || bgcolor=#ddffdd|A 5
|-
| B (5) vs. C (2) || bgcolor=#ddffdd|B 5
|-
| A (3) vs. C (4) || bgcolor=#ffdddd|C 4
|}

'''Result''': A &gt; B and B &gt; C are locked in (and C &gt; A cannot be locked in after that), so the full ranking is A &gt; B &gt; C. Thus, '''A''' is elected Ranked pairs winner.

===== Change of irrelevant preferences =====
Now, assume the two voters (marked bold) with preferences B &gt; C &gt; A change their preferences over the pair B and C. The preferences of the voters would then be in total:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 3   || A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| '''2'''  || '''C &gt; B &gt; A'''
|-
| 2   || C &gt; A &gt; B
|}

The results would be tabulated as follows:
{| class=wikitable border=1
|+ Pairwise election results
|-

|-
| bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | A

|
|-
| colspan=2 bgcolor="#c0c0ff" | Pairwise election results (won-tied-lost):
| 1-0-1
| 0-0-2
| 2-0-0
|}

The sorted list of victories would be:
{| class="wikitable"
! Pair !! Winner
|-
| A (5) vs. B (2) || bgcolor=#ddffdd|A 5
|-
| B (3) vs. C (4) || bgcolor=#ddffdd|C 4
|-
| A (3) vs. C (4) || bgcolor=#ddffdd|C 4
|}

'''Result''': All three duels are locked in, so the full ranking is C &gt; A &gt; B. Thus, the Condorcet winner '''C''' is elected Ranked pairs winner.

===== Conclusion =====
So, by changing their preferences over B and C, the two voters changed the order of A and C in the result, turning A from winner to loser without any change of the voters' preferences regarding A. Thus, the Ranked pairs method fails the IIA criterion.

==== Schulze method ====
{{Main|Schulze method}}

This example shows that the Schulze method violates the IIA criterion. Assume four candidates A, B, C and D and 12 voters with the following preferences:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 4           || A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D
|-
| '''2'''     || '''C &gt; B &gt; D &gt; A'''
|-
| 3           || C &gt; D &gt; A &gt; B
|-
| 2           || D &gt; A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| 1           || D &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A
|}

The pairwise preferences would be tabulated as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Matrix of pairwise preferences
|-
! !! d[*,A] !! d[*,B] !! d[*,C] !! d[*,D]
|-
! d[A,*]
| || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|4
|-
! d[B,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|3 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|7 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6
|-
! d[C,*]
| bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|5 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[D,*]
| bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|3
|}

Now, the strongest paths have to be identified, e.g. the path D &gt; A &gt; B is stronger than the direct path D &gt; B (which is nullified, since it is a tie).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Strengths of the strongest paths
|-
! !! d[*,A] !! d[*,B] !! d[*,C] !! d[*,D]
|-
! d[A,*]
| || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|7 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|7
|-
! d[B,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|7 || || bgcolor=#ffdddd|7 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|7
|-
! d[C,*]
| bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[D,*]
| bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|7
|}

'''Result''': The full ranking is C &gt; D &gt; A &gt; B. Thus, '''C''' is elected Schulze winner and D is preferred over A.

===== Change of irrelevant preferences =====
Now, assume the two voters (marked bold) with preferences C &gt; B &gt; D &gt; A change their preferences over the pair B and C. The preferences of the voters would then be in total:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! # of voters !! Preferences
|-
| 4           || A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D
|-
| '''2'''     || '''B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; A'''
|-
| 3           || C &gt; D &gt; A &gt; B
|-
| 2           || D &gt; A &gt; B &gt; C
|-
| 1           || D &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A
|}

Hence, the pairwise preferences would be tabulated as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Matrix of pairwise preferences
|-
! !! d[*,A] !! d[*,B] !! d[*,C] !! d[*,D]
|-
! d[A,*]
| || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|4
|-
! d[B,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|3 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6
|-
! d[C,*]
| bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|3 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[D,*]
| bgcolor=#ddffdd|8 || bgcolor=#cccccc|6 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|3
|}

Now, the strongest paths have to be identified:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Strengths of the strongest paths
|-
! !! d[*,A] !! d[*,B] !! d[*,C] !! d[*,D]
|-
! d[A,*]
| || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[B,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|8 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9 || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[C,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|8 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|8 || || bgcolor=#ddffdd|9
|-
! d[D,*]
| bgcolor=#ffdddd|8 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|8 || bgcolor=#ffdddd|8
|}

'''Result''': Now, the full ranking is A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. Thus, '''A''' is elected Schulze winner and is preferred over D.

===== Conclusion =====
So, by changing their preferences over B and C, the two voters changed the order of A and D in the result, turning A from loser to winner without any change of the voters' preferences regarding A. Thus, the Schulze method fails the IIA criterion.

==== Two-round system ====
{{Main|Two-round system}}
A probable example of the two-round system failing this criterion was the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 French presidential election]]. Polls leading up to the election have suggested a runoff between centre-right candidate [[Jacques Chirac]] and centre-left candidate [[Lionel Jospin]], in which Jospin has been expected to win. However, the first round was contested by an unprecedented 16 candidates, including left-wing candidates who intended to support Jospin in the runoff, eventually resulting in the far-right candidate, [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], finishing second and entering the runoff instead of Jospin, which Chirac won by a large margin. Thus, the presence of many candidates who did not intend to win in the election changed which of the candidates won.

==Criticisms of the IIA assumption==

IIA implies that adding another option or changing the characteristics of a third option does not affect the relative odds between the two options considered. This implication is not realistic for applications with similar options. Many examples have been constructed to illustrate this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Beethoven/Debussy (Debreu 1960; Tversky 1972), Bicycle/Pony (Luce and Suppes 1965), and Red Bus/Blue Bus (McFadden 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the Red Bus/Blue Bus example. Commuters face a decision between car and red bus. Suppose that a commuter chooses between these two options with equal probability, 0.5, so that the odds ratio equals 1:1. Now suppose a third mode, blue bus, is added. Assuming bus commuters do not care about the color of the bus, they are expected to choose between bus and car still with equal probability, so the probability of car is still 0.5, while the probability of each of the two bus types is 0.25. But IIA implies that this is not the case: for the odds ratio between car and red bus to be preserved, and the odds of red and blue bus to be equal (in other words, the commuter is indifferent to color), the new probabilities must be car 0.33; red bus 0.33; blue bus 0.33.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge 2002, pp. 501-2&lt;/ref&gt; The blue bus is of course not irrelevant if it is chosen, but it must be treated as irrelevant when it is not chosen, leading to a decreased overall probability of car travel, which does not make sense for a commuter who does not care about colors. In intuitive terms, the problem with the IIA axiom is that it leads to a failure to take account of the fact that red bus and blue bus are very similar, and are "perfect substitutes".

==In econometrics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Rational choice theory]] --&gt;
IIA is a property assumed by the [[multinomial logit]] and the conditional logit models in [[econometrics]]. If these models are used in situations which in fact violate independence (such as multicandidate elections in which preferences exhibit [[voting paradox|cycling]] or situations mimicking the Red Bus/Blue Bus example given above) then these [[estimators]] become invalid.

Many modeling advances have been motivated by a desire to alleviate the concerns raised by IIA. [[Generalized extreme value distribution|Generalized extreme value]],&lt;ref&gt;McFadden 1978&lt;/ref&gt; [[multinomial probit]] (also called [[conditional probit]]) and [[mixed logit]] are models for nominal outcomes that relax IIA, but they often have assumptions of their own that may be difficult to meet or are computationally infeasible. The multinomial probit model has as a disadvantage that it makes calculation of [[maximum likelihood]] infeasible for more than five options as it involves multiple integrals. IIA can be relaxed by specifying a hierarchical model, ranking the choice alternatives. The most popular of these is the [[nested logit]] model.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Generalized extreme value and multinomial probit models possess another property, the Invariant Proportion of Substitution,&lt;ref&gt;Steenburgh 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests similarly counterintuitive individual choice behavior.

==Choice under uncertainty==
In the [[expected utility]] theory of [[von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem#The axioms|von Neumann and Morgenstern]], four axioms together imply that individuals act in situations of risk as if they maximize the expected value of a [[utility function]]. One of the axioms is an independence axiom analogous to the IIA axiom:

:If &lt;math&gt;\,L\prec M&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;\,N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,p\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, 
::&lt;math&gt;\,pL+(1-p)N \prec pM+(1-p)N,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is a probability, ''pL''+(1-''p'')''N'' means  a gamble with probability ''p'' of yielding ''L'' and probability (1-''p'') of yielding ''N'', and &lt;math&gt;\,L\prec M&lt;/math&gt; means that ''M'' is preferred over ''L''. This axiom says that if one outcome (or lottery ticket) ''L'' is considered to be not as good as another (''M''), then having a chance with probability ''p'' of receiving ''L'' rather than ''N'' is considered to be not as good as having a chance with probability ''p'' of receiving ''M'' rather than ''N''.

[[Natural selection]] can favor animals' non-IIA-type choices, thought to be due to occasional availability of foodstuffs, according to a study published in January 2014.&lt;ref name="McNamaraTrimmer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara |first1=J.

[[File:Interval0.png|thumb|400|The addition ''x'' + ''a'' on the number line. All numbers greater than ''x'' and less than ''x'' + ''a'' fall within that open interval.]]In [[mathematics]], a ('''real''') '''interval''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set.  For example, the set of all numbers {{mvar|x}} satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}} is an interval which contains {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}, as well as all numbers between them. Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all negative real numbers, and the [[empty set]].

Real intervals play an important role in the theory of [[Integral|integration]], because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define.  The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the [[Borel measure]] and eventually to the [[Lebesgue measure]].

Intervals are central to [[interval arithmetic]], a general [[numerical method|numerical computing]] technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and [[rounding error|arithmetic roundoff]].

Intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary [[total order|totally ordered]] set, such as [[integers]] or [[rational numbers]]. The notation of integer intervals is considered [[#Integer intervals|in the special section below]].

==Terminology==
An '''open interval''' does not include its endpoints, and is indicated with parentheses. For example, {{open-open|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}. A '''closed interval''' is an interval which includes all its limit points, and is denoted with square brackets. For example, {{closed-closed|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}. A '''half-open interval''' includes only one of its endpoints, and is denoted by mixing the notations for open and closed intervals. {{open-closed|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}, while {{closed-open|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}.

A '''degenerate interval''' is any [[singleton set|set consisting of a single real number]].  Some authors include the empty set in this definition.  A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be  '''proper''', and has infinitely many elements.

An interval is said to be '''left-bounded''' or '''right-bounded''' if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements.  An interval is said to be '''bounded''' if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be '''unbounded''' otherwise.  Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be '''half-bounded'''. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends.  Bounded intervals are also commonly known as '''finite intervals'''.

Bounded intervals are  [[bounded set]]s, in the sense that their [[diameter]] (which is equal to the [[absolute difference]] between the endpoints) is finite.  The diameter may be called the '''length''', '''width''', '''measure''', or '''size''' of the interval.  The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as {{math|+∞}}, and the size of the empty interval may be defined as {{math|0}} or left undefined.

The '''centre''' ([[midpoint]]) of bounded interval with endpoints {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, and its '''radius''' is the half-length {{math|{{mabs|''a'' − ''b''}}/2}}.  These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.

An interval is said to be '''left-open''' if and only if it contains no [[minimum]] (an element that is smaller than all other elements);  '''right-open''' if it contains no [[maximum]]; and '''open''' if it has both properties.  The interval {{closed-open|0,1}}&amp;nbsp;= {{mset|''x'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' &amp;lt; 1}}, for example, is left-closed and right-open.  The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, for example, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals coincide with the [[open set]]s of the real line in its standard [[point-set topology|topology]].

An interval is said to be '''left-closed''' if it has a minimum element, '''right-closed''' if it has a maximum, and simply '''closed''' if it has both.  These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and to the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with [[closed set]]s in that topology.

The '''interior''' of an interval {{mvar|I}} is the largest open interval that is contained in {{mvar|I}}; it is also the set of points in {{mvar|I}} which are not endpoints of {{mvar|I}}.  The '''closure''' of {{mvar|I}} is the smallest closed interval that contains {{mvar|I}}; which is also the set {{mvar|I}} augmented with its finite endpoints.

For any set {{mvar|X}} of real numbers, the '''interval enclosure''' or '''interval span''' of {{mvar|X}} is the unique interval that contains {{mvar|X}} and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains {{mvar|X}}.

=== Note on conflicting terminology ===
The terms '''''segment''''' and '''''interval''''' have been employed in the literature in two essentially opposite ways, resulting in ambiguity when these terms are used.  The ''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|title=Interval and segment - Encyclopedia of Mathematics|website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org|access-date=2016-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226211146/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|archivedate=2014-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''interval'' (without a qualifier) to exclude both endpoints (i.e., open interval) and ''segment'' to include both endpoints (i.e., closed interval), while Rudin's ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=31|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls sets of the form [''a'', ''b''] ''intervals'' and sets of the form (''a'', ''b'') ''segments'' throughout.  These terms tend to appear in older works; modern texts increasingly favor the term ''interval'' (qualified by ''open'', ''closed'', or ''half-open''), regardless of whether endpoints are included.

==Notations for intervals==
The interval of numbers between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, is often denoted {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}}. The two numbers are called the ''endpoints'' of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a [[decimal comma]], a [[semicolon]] may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity.

===Including or excluding endpoints===
To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in [[International standard]] [[ISO 31-11]].  Thus, in [[set builder notation]],
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
{\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\color{RedOrange})}  = \mathopen{\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{RedOrange}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}x{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\color{RedOrange})}  = \mathopen{\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{RedOrange}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{OliveGreen}\le} x{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\color{OliveGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{OliveGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}x{\color{OliveGreen}\le} b\}, \\{}
{\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\color{OliveGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{OliveGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{OliveGreen}\le} x{\color{OliveGreen}\le} b\}.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
Note that {{open-open|''a'', ''a''}}, {{closed-open|''a'', ''a''}}, and {{open-closed|''a'', ''a''}} each represents the [[empty set]], whereas {{closed-closed|''a'', ''a''}} denotes the set&amp;nbsp;{{math|{''a''}{{null}}}}.  When {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}, all four notations are usually taken to represent the empty set.

Both notations may overlap with other uses of parentheses and brackets in mathematics.  For instance, the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is often used to denote an [[tuple|ordered pair]] in set theory, the [[coordinates]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], or (sometimes) a [[complex number]] in [[algebra]].  That is why [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] introduced the notation {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the open interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/193|title=Why is American and French notation different for open intervals (x, y) vs. ]x, y[?|author=|date=|website=hsm.stackexchange.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} too is occasionally used for ordered pairs, especially in [[computer science]].

Some authors use {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the complement of the interval&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''a'', ''b''}}; namely, the set of all real numbers that are either less than or equal to {{mvar|a}}, or greater than or equal to {{mvar|b}}.

===Infinite endpoints===
In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the [[extended real number line|extended real numbers]], the set of all real numbers augmented with {{math|−∞}} and {{math|+∞}}.

In this interpretation, the notations {{closed-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{open-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{closed-closed|''a'', +∞}} , and {{closed-open|''a'', +∞}} are all meaningful and distinct.  In particular, {{open-open|−∞, +∞}} denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while {{closed-closed|−∞, +∞}} denotes the extended reals. 

Even in the context of the ordinary reals, one may use an [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] endpoint to indicate that there is no bound in that direction.  For example, {{open-open|0, +∞}} is the set of [[positive real numbers]] also written ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The context affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval {{open-open|−∞, +∞}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.

===Integer intervals===
The notation {{closed-closed|''a'' .. ''b''}} when {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are [[integer]]s, or {{math|{''a'' .. ''b''}{{null}}}}, or just {{math|''a'' .. ''b''}} is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all ''integers'' between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including both.  This notation is used in some [[programming language]]s; in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid [[Indexed family|indices]] of an [[Array data type|array]].

An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint.  Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing {{math|''a'' .. ''b'' − 1}} ,  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b''}} , or  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b'' − 1}}.  Alternate-bracket notations like {{closed-open|''a'' .. ''b''}} or {{math|[''a'' .. ''b''[}} are rarely used for integer intervals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Classification of intervals==
The intervals of real numbers can be classified into the eleven different types listed below{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;:

: Empty: &lt;math&gt;[b,a] = (b,a) = [b,a) = (b,a] = (a,a) = [a,a) = (a,a] = \{ \} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
: Degenerate: &lt;math&gt;[a,a] = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Proper and bounded:
:: Open: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = \{x\mid a &lt; x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,b] = \{x\mid a \leq x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed, right-open: &lt;math&gt;[a,b) = \{x\mid a \leq x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-open, right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(a,b] = \{x\mid a &lt; x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-bounded and right-unbounded:
:: Left-open: &lt;math&gt;(a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x \geq a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-unbounded and right-bounded:
:: Right-open: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b) = \{x\mid x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b] = \{x\mid x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Unbounded at both ends (simultaneously open and closed):  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,+\infty) = \R&lt;/math&gt;:

==Properties of intervals==
The intervals are precisely the [[connectedness|connected]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the image of an interval by any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function is also an interval. This is one formulation of the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The intervals are also the [[convex set|convex subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;.  The interval enclosure of a subset &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \R&lt;/math&gt; is also the [[convex hull]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval.  The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g., &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \cup [b,c] = (a,c]&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a [[metric space]], its [[open ball]]s are the open bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}, and its [[closed ball]]s are the closed bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}.

Any element&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} of an interval&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} defines a partition of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} into three disjoint intervals {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: respectively, the elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} that are less than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the singleton&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;[x,x] = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the elements that are greater than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.  The parts {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors) if and only if {{mvar|x}} is in the interior of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}}.  This is an interval version of the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy principle]].

==Dyadic intervals==

A ''dyadic interval'' is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{j}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math  display="inline"&gt;\frac{j+1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are integers.   Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.

Dyadic intervals have the following properties:

* The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.
* Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.
* Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.
* If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.

The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite [[binary tree]].

Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including [[adaptive mesh refinement]], [[multigrid methods]] and [[wavelet|wavelet analysis]]. Another way to represent such a structure is [[p-adic analysis]] (for {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Sergey |year=2002 |title=Wavelet theory as {{mvar|p}}-adic spectral analysis |journal=[[Izvestiya: Mathematics|Izvestiya RAN. Ser. Mat.]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=149–158 |doi=10.1070/IM2002v066n02ABEH000381 |url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/izv/v66/i2/p149 |accessdate=2012-04-05|arxiv=math-ph/0012019 |bibcode=2002IzMat..66..367K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Multi-dimensional intervals ===
In many contexts, an '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional interval''' is defined as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; that is the [[Cartesian product]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals, &lt;math&gt;I = I_1\times I_2 \times \cdots \times I_n&lt;/math&gt;, one on each [[coordinate]] axis.

For &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as region bounded by  a [[square]] or [[rectangle]] whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, depending on whether the width of the intervals are the same or not; likewise, for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as a region bounded by an axis-aligned [[cube]] or a [[rectangular cuboid]].  
In higher dimensions, the Cartesian product of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals is bounded by an [[N-dimensional space|n-dimensional]] [[hypercube]] or [[hyperrectangle]].

A '''facet''' of such an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the result of replacing any non-degenerate interval factor &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; by a degenerate interval consisting of a finite endpoint of &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''faces''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; comprise &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; itself and all faces of its facets.  The '''corners''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are the faces that consist of a single point of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Complex intervals===
Intervals of [[complex number]]s can be defined as regions of the [[complex plane]], either [[rectangle|rectangular]] or [[disk (mathematics)|circular]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtqk6WgttzcC Complex interval arithmetic and its applications], Miodrag Petković, Ljiljana Petković, Wiley-VCH, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-527-40134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topological algebra==
Intervals can be associated with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can be associated with [[region (mathematical analysis)|region]]s of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (''x,y'') taken from the [[direct product]] R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that ''y'' &gt; ''x''. For purposes of [[mathematical structure]], this restriction is discarded,&lt;ref&gt;Kaj Madsen (1979) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/586220.pdf Review of "Interval analysis in the extended interval space" by Edgar Kaucher]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "reversed intervals" where ''y'' &amp;minus; ''x'' &lt; 0 are allowed. Then the collection of all intervals [''x,y''] can be identified with the [[topological ring]] formed by the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of R with itself where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise.

The direct sum algebra &lt;math&gt;( R \oplus R, +, \times)&lt;/math&gt; has two [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, { [''x'',0] : ''x'' ∈ R } and { [0,''y''] : ''y'' ∈ R }. The [[identity element]] of this algebra is the condensed interval [1,1]. If interval [''x,y''] is not in one of the ideals, then it has [[multiplicative inverse]] [1/''x'', 1/''y'']. Endowed with the usual [[topology]], the algebra of intervals forms a [[topological ring]].  The [[group of units]] of this ring consists of four [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]s determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The [[identity component]] of this group is quadrant I.

Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its [[midpoint]].  In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of "balanced intervals" [''x'', &amp;minus;''x''] is used along with the axis of intervals [''x,x''] that reduce to a point.
Instead of the direct sum &lt;math&gt;R \oplus R&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of intervals has been identified&lt;ref&gt;[[D. H. Lehmer]] (1956) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/81372.pdf Review of "Calculus of Approximations"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Mathematical Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[split-complex number]] plane by M. Warmus and [[D. H. Lehmer]] through the identification
: ''z'' = (''x'' + ''y'')/2 + j (''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'')/2.
This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a [[ring isomorphism]], provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]].

In [[linear algebra]], an ''n''-by-''n'' [[square matrix]] '''A''' is called '''invertible''' (also '''nonsingular''' or '''nondegenerate''') if there exists an ''n''-by-''n'' square matrix '''B''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{BA} = \mathbf{I}_n \  &lt;/math&gt;

where '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]] and the multiplication used is ordinary [[matrix multiplication]]. If this is the case, then the matrix '''B''' is uniquely determined by '''A''' and is called the '''''inverse''''' of '''A''', denoted by '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A square matrix that is '''not''' invertible is called '''singular''' or '''degenerate'''. A square matrix is singular [[if and only if]] its [[determinant]] is 0. Singular matrices are rare in the sense that a square matrix randomly selected from a [[continuous uniform distribution]] on its entries will [[almost never]] be singular.

Non-square matrices (''m''-by-''n'' matrices for which {{nowrap|''m'' ≠ ''n''}}) do not have an inverse.  However, in some cases such a matrix may have a [[Inverse element#Matrices|left inverse]] or [[Inverse element#Matrices|right inverse]].  If '''A''' is ''m''-by-''n'' and the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of '''A''' is equal to ''n'', then '''A''' has a left inverse: an ''n''-by-''m'' matrix '''B''' such that {{nowrap|1='''BA''' = '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  If '''A''' has rank ''m'', then it has a right inverse: an ''n''-by-''m'' matrix '''B''' such that {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Matrix inversion''' is the process of finding the matrix '''B''' that satisfies the prior equation for a given invertible matrix '''A'''.

While the most common case is that of matrices over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers, all these definitions can be given for matrices over any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. However, in the case of the ring being commutative, the condition for a square matrix to be invertible is that its determinant is invertible in the ring, which in general is a stricter requirement than being nonzero. For a noncommutative ring, the usual determinant is not defined.  The conditions for existence of left-inverse or right-inverse are more complicated since a notion of rank does not exist over rings.

The set of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} invertible matrices together with the operation of matrix multiplication form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n''.

== Properties ==

=== The invertible matrix theorem ===
Let '''A''' be a square ''n'' by ''n'' matrix over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' (for example the field '''R''' of real numbers). The following statements are equivalent, i.e., for any given matrix they are either all true or all false:

: '''A''' is invertible, i.e., '''A''' has an inverse, is nonsingular, or is nondegenerate.
: '''A''' is [[Row equivalence|row-equivalent]] to the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]] '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
: '''A''' is [[Row equivalence|column-equivalent]] to the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]] '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
: '''A''' has ''n'' [[pivot position]]s.
: {{nowrap|[[determinant|det]] '''A''' ≠ 0}}.  In general, a square matrix over a [[commutative ring]] is invertible if and only if its [[determinant]] is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in that ring.
: '''A''' has full rank; that is, {{nowrap|1=[[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] '''A''' = ''n''}}.
: The equation {{nowrap|1='''Ax''' = '''0'''}} has only the trivial solution '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''0'''.
: The [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of '''A''' is trivial, i.e., it contains only the null vector as an element, ''ker('''''A''''')'' = {'''0'''}.
: {{nowrap|1=[[null space|Null]] '''A''' = {0}{{null}}}}.
: The equation '''Ax''' = '''b''' has exactly one solution for each '''b''' in ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.
: The columns of '''A''' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]].
: The columns of '''A''' [[linear span|span]] ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.
: {{nowrap|1=[[Row and column spaces|Col]] '''A''' = ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.
: The columns of '''A''' form a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.
: The linear transformation mapping '''x''' to '''Ax'''  is a [[bijection]] from ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' to ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.
: There is an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix '''B''' such that {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''BA'''}}.
: The [[transpose]] '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is an invertible matrix (hence rows of '''A''' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]], span ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', and form a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
: The number 0 is not an [[eigenvalue]] of '''A'''.
: The matrix '''A''' can be expressed as a finite product of [[elementary matrix|elementary matrices]].
: The matrix '''A''' has a left inverse (i.e., there exists a '''B''' such that {{nowrap|1='''BA''' = '''I'''}}) ''or'' a right inverse (i.e. there exists a '''C''' such that {{nowrap|1='''AC''' = '''I'''}}), in which case both left and right inverses exist and {{nowrap|1='''B''' = '''C''' = '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== Other properties ===
Furthermore, the following properties hold for an invertible matrix '''A''':

* ('''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = '''A''';
* (''k'''''A''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for nonzero scalar ''k'';
* ('''Ax''')&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; where &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]] and '''x''' is a vector;
* ('''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ('''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;;
* For any invertible ''n''-by-''n'' matrices '''A''' and '''B''', ('''AB''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  More generally, if '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are invertible ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, then ('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = '''A'''{{su|b=''k''|p=−1}}'''A'''{{su|b=''k''−1|p=−1}}⋯'''A'''{{su|b=2|p=−1}}'''A'''{{su|b=1|p=−1}};
* det '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (det '''A''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A matrix that is its own inverse, i.e. such that {{nowrap|1='''A''' = '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1='''A'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''I'''}}, is called an [[Involutory matrix|involutory matrix]].

=== In relation to its adjugate ===
The [[Adjugate matrix|adjugate]] of a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be used to find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; invertible matrix, then
: &lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \operatorname{adj}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In relation to the identity matrix ===
It follows from the associativity of matrix multiplication that if
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{I} \ &lt;/math&gt;

for ''finite square'' matrices '''A''' and '''B''', then also

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{BA} = \mathbf{I}\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Horn | first1=Roger A. | last2=Johnson | first2=Charles R. | title=Matrix Analysis | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-38632-6 | year=1985 | page=14 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Density ===
Over the field of real numbers, the set of singular ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, considered as a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;times;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is a [[null set]], i.e., has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. This is true because singular matrices are the roots of the polynomial function in the entries of the matrix given by the [[determinant]]. Thus in the language of [[measure theory]], [[almost all]] ''n''-by-''n'' matrices are invertible.

Furthermore, the ''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices are a [[dense set|dense]] [[open set]] in the [[topological space]] of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices.  Equivalently, the set of singular matrices is [[closed set|closed]] and [[nowhere dense]] in the space of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices.

In practice however, one may encounter non-invertible matrices. And in [[numerical analysis|numerical calculations]], matrices which are invertible, but close to a non-invertible matrix, can still be problematic; such matrices are said to be [[Condition number#Matrices|ill-conditioned]].

== Examples ==
Consider the following ''2''-by-''2'' matrix:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}-1 &amp; \tfrac{3}{2} \\ 1  &amp; -1\end{pmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; is invertible. To check this, one can compute that &lt;math&gt; \det \mathbf{A} = -1/2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is non-zero. 

As an example of a non-invertible, or singular, matrix, consider the matrix
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; \tfrac{3}{2} \\ \tfrac{2}{3} &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;
The determinant of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; is 0, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix to be non-invertible.

== Methods of matrix inversion ==

=== Gaussian elimination ===
[[Gaussian elimination#Finding the inverse of a matrix|Gauss-Jordan elimination]] is an [[algorithm]] that can be used to determine whether a given matrix is invertible and to find the inverse. An alternative is the [[LU decomposition]] which generates upper and lower triangular matrices which are easier to invert.

=== Newton's method ===
A generalization of [[Newton's method]] as used for a [[Multiplicative inverse#Algorithms|multiplicative inverse algorithm]] may be convenient, if it is convenient to find a suitable starting seed:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{k+1} = 2X_k - X_k A X_k.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Victor Pan]] and [[John Reif]] have done work that includes ways of generating a starting seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Newton's method is particularly useful when dealing with families of related matrices that behave enough like the sequence manufactured for the homotopy above: sometimes a good starting point for refining an approximation for the new inverse can be the already obtained inverse of a previous matrix that nearly matches the current matrix, e.g. the pair of sequences of inverse matrices used in obtaining [[Matrix square root#By Denman.E2.80.93Beavers iteration|matrix square roots by Denman-Beavers iteration]]; this may need more than one pass of the iteration at each new matrix, if they are not close enough together for just one to be enough. Newton's method is also useful for "touch up" corrections to the Gauss–Jordan algorithm which has been contaminated by small errors due to [[Round-off error|imperfect computer arithmetic]].

=== Cayley–Hamilton method ===
The [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] allows the inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be expressed in terms of det(&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;), traces and powers of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;A proof can be found in the Appendix B of {{cite journal | last1 = Kondratyuk | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Krivoruchenko | first2 = M.

: &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det (\mathbf{A})}\sum_{s=0}^{n-1}\mathbf{A}^{s}\sum_{k_1,k_2,\ldots ,k_{n-1}}\prod_{l=1}^{n-1} \frac{(-1)^{k_l+1}}{l^{k_l}k_{l}!}\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}^l)^{k_l},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is dimension of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given by the sum of the main diagonal.  The sum is taken over &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and the sets of all &lt;math&gt;k_l \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;  satisfying the linear [[Diophantine equation]] 
: &lt;math&gt;s+\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}lk_{l} = n - 1.&lt;/math&gt;
The formula can be rewritten in terms of complete [[Bell polynomials]] of arguments 
&lt;math&gt;t_l = - (l - 1)! \mathrm{tr}(A^l)&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det (\mathbf{A})}\sum_{s=1}^{n}\mathbf{A}^{s - 1} \frac{(-1)^{n - 1}}{(n - s)!} B_{n-s}(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{n-s}).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Eigendecomposition ===
{{Main article|Eigendecomposition of a matrix}}
If matrix '''A''' can be eigendecomposed and if none of its eigenvalues are zero, then '''A''' is invertible and its inverse is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}^{-1}  &lt;/math&gt;
where '''Q''' is the square (''N''&amp;times;''N'') matrix whose ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column is the eigenvector &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; of '''A''' and '''Λ''' is the [[diagonal matrix]] whose diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{ii}=\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, because '''Λ''' is a diagonal matrix, its inverse is easy to calculate:
: &lt;math&gt;\left[\Lambda^{-1}\right]_{ii}=\frac{1}{\lambda_i}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Cholesky decomposition ===
{{Main article|Cholesky decomposition}}
If matrix '''A''' is [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite]], then its inverse can be obtained as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1} = (\mathbf{L}^{*})^{-1} \mathbf{L}^{-1} , &lt;/math&gt;
where '''L''' is the lower triangular [[Cholesky decomposition]] of '''A''', and '''L*''' denotes the conjugate transpose of '''L'''.

=== Analytic solution ===
{{Main article|Cramer's rule}}
Writing the transpose of the [[matrix of cofactors]], known as an [[adjugate matrix]], can also be an efficient way to calculate the inverse of ''small'' matrices, but this recursive method is inefficient for large matrices. To determine the inverse, we calculate a matrix of cofactors:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}={1 \over \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf{A}\end{vmatrix}}\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{T}}={1 \over \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf{A}\end{vmatrix}}
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{C}_{11} &amp; \mathbf{C}_{21} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{C}_{n1} \\
\mathbf{C}_{12} &amp; \mathbf{C}_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{C}_{n2} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\mathbf{C}_{1n} &amp; \mathbf{C}_{2n} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{C}_{nn} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so that
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)_{ij}={1 \over \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf{A}\end{vmatrix}}\left(\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{T}}\right)_{ij}={1 \over \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf{A}\end{vmatrix}}\left(\mathbf{C}_{ji}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where |'''A'''| is the [[determinant]] of '''A''', '''C''' is the [[matrix of cofactors]], and '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; represents the matrix [[transpose]].

==== Inversion of 2 × 2 matrices ====
The ''cofactor equation'' listed above yields the following result for {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices. Inversion of these matrices can be done as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Introduction to linear algebra
|edition=3rd

|last1=Strang
|publisher=SIAM

&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \\ 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} =
\frac{1}{\det \mathbf{A}} \begin{bmatrix}
\,\,\,d &amp; \!\!-b \\ -c &amp; \,a \\ 
\end{bmatrix} =
\frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix}
\,\,\,d &amp; \!\!-b \\ -c &amp; \,a \\ 
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is possible because {{nowrap|1/(''ad'' − ''bc'')}} is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix in question, and the same strategy could be used for other matrix sizes.

The Cayley–Hamilton method gives
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det \mathbf{A}} \left[ \left( \operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A} \right) \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A} \right] .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Inversion of 3 × 3 matrices ====
A computationally efficient {{nowrap|3 × 3}} matrix inversion is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b &amp; c\\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i\\
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} =
\frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})} \begin{bmatrix}
\, A &amp; \, B &amp; \,C \\ \, D &amp; \, E &amp; \, F \\ \, G &amp; \, H &amp; \, I\\
\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T} =
\frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})} \begin{bmatrix}
\, A &amp; \, D &amp; \,G \\ \, B &amp; \, E &amp; \,H \\ \, C &amp; \,F &amp; \, I\\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
(where the scalar ''A'' is not to be confused with the matrix '''A''').
If the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible, with the elements of the intermediary matrix on the right side above given by
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A = (ei-fh)  &amp; D = -(bi-ch) &amp; G = (bf-ce)  \\
B = -(di-fg) &amp; E = (ai-cg)  &amp; H = -(af-cd) \\
C = (dh-eg)  &amp; F = -(ah-bg) &amp; I = (ae-bd)  \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The determinant of '''A''' can be computed by applying the [[rule of Sarrus]] as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf{A}) = aA+bB+cC.&lt;/math&gt;

The Cayley–Hamilton decomposition gives
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det (\mathbf{A})}\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( (\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A})^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}^{2}\right) \mathbf{I} -\mathbf{A}\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{A}^{2}\right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Inversion of 3×3 matrices based on vector products}}
The general {{nowrap|3 × 3}} inverse can be expressed concisely in terms of the [[cross product]] and [[triple product]]. If a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\left[\mathbf{x}_0,\;\mathbf{x}_1,\;\mathbf{x}_2\right]&lt;/math&gt; (consisting of three column vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_2&lt;/math&gt;) is invertible, its inverse is given by 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det(\mathbf A)}\begin{bmatrix}
{(\mathbf{x_1}\times\mathbf{x_2})}^\mathrm{T} \\
{(\mathbf{x_2}\times\mathbf{x_0})}^\mathrm{T} \\
{(\mathbf{x_0}\times\mathbf{x_1})}^\mathrm{T} \\
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;\det(A)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the triple product of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;—the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the rows or columns: 
: &lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf{A})=\mathbf{x}_0\cdot(\mathbf{x}_1\times\mathbf{x}_2).&lt;/math&gt;
The correctness of the formula can be checked by using cross- and triple-product properties and by noting that for groups, left and right inverses always coincide. Intuitively, because of the cross products, each row of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to the non-corresponding two columns of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (causing the off-diagonal terms of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; be zero). Dividing by 
: &lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf{A})=\mathbf{x}_0\cdot(\mathbf{x}_1\times\mathbf{x}_2)&lt;/math&gt;
causes the diagonal elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; to be unity. For example, the first diagonal is:
: &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1}{\mathbf{x_0}\cdot(\mathbf{x}_1\times\mathbf{x}_2)} \mathbf{x_0}\cdot(\mathbf{x}_1\times\mathbf{x}_2).&lt;/math&gt;

==== Inversion of 4 × 4 matrices ====
With increasing dimension, expressions for the inverse of '''A''' get complicated. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, the Cayley–Hamilton method leads to an expression that is still tractable:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det (\mathbf{A})}\left[ \frac{1}{6}\left( (\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A})^{3}-3\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}^{2}+2\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}^{3}\right) \mathbf{I} -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{A}\left( (\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A})^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}^{2}\right) +\mathbf{A}^{2}\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A}^{3}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Blockwise inversion ===
Matrices can also be ''inverted blockwise'' by using the following analytic inversion formula:
{{NumBlk|
: | &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\ \mathbf{C} &amp; \mathbf{D} \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A}^{-1}+\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{CA}^{-1} &amp; -\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1} \\ -(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{CA}^{-1} &amp; (\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1} \end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|1}} 
}}
where '''A''', '''B''', '''C''' and '''D''' are [[block matrix|matrix sub-blocks]] of arbitrary size. ('''A''' must be square, so that it can be inverted. Furthermore, '''A''' and {{math|'''D''' &amp;minus; '''CA'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''B'''}} must be nonsingular.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Bernstein
  | first = Dennis
  | title = Matrix Mathematics
  | publisher = Princeton University Press
  | year = 2005
  | pages = 44
  | isbn = 978-0-691-11802-4 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;) This strategy is particularly advantageous if '''A''' is diagonal and {{math|'''D''' &amp;minus; '''CA'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''B'''}} (the [[Schur complement]] of '''A''') is a small matrix, since they are the only matrices requiring inversion.

This technique was reinvented several times and is due to [[Hans Boltz]] (1923),{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;!--Surely this was already known by the end of the 19th century.--&gt; who used it for the inversion of [[geodesy|geodetic]] matrices, and [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] (1937), who generalized it and proved its correctness.

The [[nullity theorem]] says that the nullity of '''A''' equals the nullity of the sub-block in the lower right of the inverse matrix, and that the nullity of '''B''' equals the nullity of the sub-block in the upper right of the inverse matrix.

The inversion procedure that led to Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) performed matrix block operations that operated on '''C''' and '''D''' first. Instead, if '''A''' and '''B''' are operated on first, and provided '''D''' and {{math|'''A''' &amp;minus; '''BD'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''C'''}} are nonsingular,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

  | publisher = Princeton University Press
  | year = 2005
  | pages = 45
  | isbn = 978-0-691-11802-4 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; the result is
{{NumBlk|
: | &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\ \mathbf{C} &amp; \mathbf{D} \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} (\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1} &amp; -(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1}\mathbf{BD}^{-1} \\ -\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1} &amp; \quad \mathbf{D}^{-1}+\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1}\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|2}}
}}
Equating Equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) leads to
{{NumBlk|
: | &lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}+\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|3}}
}}
: &lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1}\mathbf{BD}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1} = (\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{D}^{-1}+\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\mathbf{C})^{-1}\mathbf{BD}^{-1} = (\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
where Equation ({{EquationNote|3}}) is the [[Woodbury matrix identity]], which is equivalent to the [[binomial inverse theorem]].

Since a blockwise inversion of an {{math|{{var|n}} × {{var|n}}}} matrix requires inversion of two half-sized matrices and 6 multiplications between two half-sized matrices, it can be shown that a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that uses blockwise inversion to invert a matrix runs with the same time complexity as the matrix multiplication algorithm that is used internally.&lt;ref&gt;T.

=== By Neumann series ===
If a matrix '''A''' has the property that

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} (\mathbf I - \mathbf A)^n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

then '''A''' is nonsingular and its inverse may be expressed by a [[Neumann series]]:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (\mathbf I - \mathbf A)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Truncating the sum results in an "approximate" inverse which may be useful as a [[preconditioner]]. Note that a truncated series can be accelerated exponentially by noting that the Neumann series is a [[geometric sum]]. As such, it satisfies 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{2^L-1} (\mathbf I -\mathbf A)^n=\prod_{l=0}^{L-1}(\mathbf I + (\mathbf I -\mathbf A)^{2^l})&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, only &lt;math&gt;2L-2&lt;/math&gt; matrix multiplications are needed to compute &lt;math&gt;2^L&lt;/math&gt; terms of the sum.

More generally, if '''A''' is "near" the invertible matrix '''X''' in the sense that
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} (\mathbf I - \mathbf X^{-1} \mathbf A)^n = 0 \mathrm{~~or~~} \lim_{n \to \infty} (\mathbf I - \mathbf A \mathbf X^{-1})^n = 0&lt;/math&gt;
then '''A''' is nonsingular and its inverse is
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left(\mathbf X^{-1} (\mathbf X - \mathbf A)\right)^n \mathbf X^{-1}~.&lt;/math&gt;
If it is also the case that {{nowrap|'''A''' − '''X'''}} has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 1 then this simplifies to
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^{-1} = \mathbf X^{-1} - \frac{\mathbf X^{-1} (\mathbf A - \mathbf X) \mathbf X^{-1}}{1+\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf X^{-1} (\mathbf A - \mathbf X))}~.&lt;/math&gt;

=== ''P''-adic approximation ===
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
If ''A'' is a matrix with integer or rational coefficients and we seek a solution in [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary-precision]] rationals, then a [[p-adic]] approximation method converges to an exact solution in &lt;math&gt;O(n^4 \log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt;, assuming standard &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; matrix multiplication is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cam.2008.07.044 | volume=225 | title=A p-adic algorithm for computing the inverse of integer matrices | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=320–322| year=2009 | last1=Haramoto | first1=H. | last2=Matsumoto | first2=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method relies on solving ''n'' linear systems via Dixon's method of ''p''-adic approximation (each in &lt;math&gt;O(n^3 \log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt;) and is available as such in software specialized in arbitrary-precision matrix operations, e.g. in IML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml.html|title=IML - Integer Matrix Library|author=|date=|website=cs.uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivative of the matrix inverse ==
Suppose that the invertible matrix '''A''' depends on a parameter ''t''. Then the derivative of the inverse of '''A''' with respect to ''t'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{-1}}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{A}^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

To derive the above expression for the derivative of the inverse of '''A''', one can differentiate the definition of the matrix inverse &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; and then solve for the inverse of '''A''':
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}
=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{-1}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{A}
+\mathbf{A}^{-1}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}
=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{I}}{\mathrm{d}t}
=\mathbf{0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Subtracting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; from both sides of the above and multiplying on the right by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; gives the correct expression for the derivative of the inverse:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{-1}}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \mathbf{A}^{-1} \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{A}^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a small number then
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A} + \epsilon\mathbf{X}\right)^{-1}
= \mathbf{A}^{-1}
- \epsilon \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{X} \mathbf{A}^{-1} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if

: &lt;math&gt; 
\frac { \mathrm{d}f(\mathbf{A})}{ \mathrm{d}t}=\sum_i g_i (\mathbf{A}) \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}h_i (\mathbf{A}),
&lt;/math&gt;

then,

: &lt;math&gt; f (\mathbf{A}+\epsilon\mathbf{X})= f (\mathbf{A})+\epsilon\sum_i g_i (\mathbf{A})
\mathbf{X}
h_i (\mathbf{A})+ \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).
&lt;/math&gt;

Given a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{n}}{ \mathrm{d}t}&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{A}^{i-1}\frac{ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{ \mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{A}^{n-i},\\
\frac{ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}^{-n}}{ \mathrm{d}t}&amp;=-\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{A}^{-i}\frac{ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{ \mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{A}^{-(n+1-i)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
(\mathbf{A}+\epsilon \mathbf{X})^{n}&amp;=\mathbf{A}^{n}+\epsilon \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{A}^{i-1}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{A}^{n-i}+ \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2),\\
(\mathbf{A}+\epsilon \mathbf{X})^{-n}&amp;=\mathbf{A}^{-n}-\epsilon \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{A}^{-i}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{A}^{-(n+1-i)}+ \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized inverse ==
Some of the properties of inverse matrices are shared by [[generalized inverse]]s (e.g., the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]]), which can be defined for any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix.

== Applications ==
For most practical applications, it is ''not'' necessary to invert a matrix to solve a [[system of linear equations]]; however, for a unique solution, it ''is'' necessary that the matrix involved be invertible.

Decomposition techniques like [[LU decomposition]] are much faster than inversion, and various fast algorithms for special classes of linear systems have also been developed.

=== [[regression analysis|Regression]]/[[least squares]] ===
Although an explicit inverse is not necessary to estimate the vector of unknowns, it is unavoidable to estimate their precision, found in the diagonal of the posterior covariance matrix of the vector of unknowns.

=== Matrix inverses in real-time simulations ===
Matrix inversion plays a significant role in [[computer graphics]], particularly in [[3D graphics]] rendering and 3D simulations. Examples include screen-to-world ray casting, world-to-subspace-to-world object transformations, and physical simulations.

=== Matrix inverses in MIMO wireless communication ===
Matrix inversion also plays a significant role in the [[MIMO]] (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix '''H'''. It is crucial for the matrix '''H''' to be invertible for the receiver to be able to figure out the transmitted information.

In [[geometry]], the '''Japanese theorem''' states that the centers of the [[incircle]]s of certain [[triangles]] inside a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] are vertices of a [[rectangle]].

Triangulating an arbitrary cyclic quadrilateral by its diagonals yields four overlapping triangles (each diagonal creates two triangles). The centers of the incircles of those triangles form a rectangle.

Specifically, let {{math|□''ABCD''}} be an arbitrary cyclic quadrilateral and let {{math|''M''{{sub|1}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|2}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|3}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|4}}}} be the incenters of the triangles {{math|△''ABD''}}, {{math|△''ABC''}}, {{math|△''BCD''}}, {{math|△''ACD''}}. Then the quadrilateral formed by {{math|''M''{{sub|1}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|2}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|3}}}}, {{math|''M''{{sub|4}}}} is a rectangle.

Note that this theorem is easily extended to prove the [[Japanese theorem for cyclic polygons]]. To prove the quadrilateral case, simply construct the parallelogram tangent to the corners of the constructed rectangle, with sides parallel to the diagonals of the quadrilateral. The construction shows that the parallelogram is a rhombus, which is equivalent to showing that the sums of the radii of the incircles tangent to each diagonal are equal.

The quadrilateral case immediately proves the general case by induction on the set of triangulating partitions of a general polygon.

[[File:John Rigby Vanity Fair 1901-03-28.jpeg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;"a blunt Lord Justice"&lt;br&gt;As caricatured by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], March 1901&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Sir John Rigby''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (8 January 1834 &amp;ndash; 26 July 1903), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] judge and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] between 1885 and 1894.

==Background and education==
Rigby was born in Runcorn, Cheshire, the son of Thomas Rigby of [[Halton, Cheshire]], and his wife Elizabeth Kendal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/debrettshouseo1886londuoft Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886]&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Liverpool College]] before going to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1853. He graduated as [[Second Wrangler]] in 1856, also being placed second for the [[Smith's Prize]]. He became a fellow of Trinity in 1856 and was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|id=RGBY852J|name=Rigby, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Sir John Rigby |work=[[The Times]] |page=6 |date=27 July 1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
The story of how Rigby came to the Bar may be found on pg. 120 of the 1958 memoir “B-berry and I Look Back”, by [[Dornford Yates]].
In 1875 Rigby was appointed junior counsel to the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1881 he "took silk", becoming a [[Queen's Counsel]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He distinguished himself as an advocate, and was frequently involved in bringing appeals to the judicial committee of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Rigby was twice briefly a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] [[Member of Parliament]]. He was elected as MP for the [[Wisbech (UK Parliament constituency)|Wisbech division of Cambridgeshire]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], but lost the seat when another [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|election was held in 1886]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hansard-contribs | mr-john-rigby | Sir John Rigby }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892]] Rigby returned to parliament, when he was among a number of Liberals who gained seats from the government parties in [[Scotland]]. He was elected at [[Forfar (UK Parliament constituency)|Forfarshire]], unseating the [[Liberal Unionist]], [[James William Barclay|James Barclay]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] in [[Fourth Gladstone Ministry|William Gladstone's new government]], and received a [[knight bachelor|knighthood]] on 26 November 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26351 |date=6 December 1892 |page=7153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 1894 Rigby became [[Attorney General for England and Wales]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

On 19 October 1894 he vacated his Commons seat when he was appointed a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]], in succession to Sir [[Horace Davey]]. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] at the same time.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26563 |date=23 October 1894 |page=5928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the Court of Appeal until his retirement in 1901,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; when he was granted an annuity of £3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27372 |date=5 November 1901 |page=7144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgments===
*''[[The Satanita]]'' [1897] AC 59 - Contract law case atypical of the conventional offer &amp; acceptance pattern seen in English law. Rigby's decision at appeal affirmed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords#Appeal|House of Lords]].

==Personal life==
A few years before his retirement, Rigby had suffered a severe fall, and never fully recovered his health. He died aged 69, unmarried, at his home at [[Chelsea Embankment]], London in July 1903.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''José Fernando "Chepe" Escobar''' (born 20 December 1954, in [[Manizales]], [[Colombia]]) was a Colombian mathematician known for his work on [[differential geometry]] and [[partial differential equations]]. He was professor at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Marques, F. C. (2005). "On the mathematical work of José F. Escobar", ''Matemática Contemporânea'', Vol. 29, pp. 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;[https://www.math.cornell.edu/News/2003-2004/escobar.html Cornell University News, "José Escobar, Cornell mathematics professor, dies at age 49"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his mathematical undergraduate program at [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]], Colombia. He received a scholarship that permitted him to do a master in science studies in the [[Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada|Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics]] (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Escobar obtained his Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986, under the supervision of [[Richard Schoen]].&lt;ref name="MGP"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=32519}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his thesis he solved the problem known as "the boundary [[Yamabe problem]]", that had been previously settled only for the case of [[manifold]]s without boundary.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

He died from cancer on 3 January 2004, at the age 49.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

Among the awards he received for his work were "the Alfred Sloan Fellowship" and "the Presidential Faculty Fellowship" (received at the White House directly from the hands of the President of the United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/468/46809901.pdf Proceedings of the International Conference in Memory of Professor José Fernando Escobar]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8632">In [[mathematics]], '''Liouville's theorem''', originally formulated by [[Joseph Liouville]] in 1833 to 1841,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833c}}.&lt;/ref&gt; places an important restriction on [[antiderivative]]s that can be expressed as elementary functions.

The antiderivatives of certain [[elementary function]]s cannot themselves be expressed as elementary functions.  A standard example of such a function is &lt;math&gt;e^{-x^2},&lt;/math&gt; whose antiderivative is (with a multiplier of a constant) the [[error function]], familiar from [[statistics]].  Other examples include the functions &lt;math&gt; \frac{ \sin ( x ) }{ x }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x^x &lt;/math&gt;.

Liouville's theorem states that elementary antiderivatives, if they exist, must be in the same [[differential field]] as the function, plus possibly a finite number of logarithms.

== Definitions ==

For any differential field ''F'', there is a subfield

: Con(''F'') = {''f'' in ''F'' | ''Df'' = 0},

called the [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s of ''F''. Given two differential fields ''F'' and ''G'', ''G'' is called a '''logarithmic extension''' of ''F'' if ''G'' is a [[field extension|simple transcendental extension]] of ''F'' (i.e. ''G'' = ''F''(''t'') for some [[Transcendental element|transcendental]] ''t'') such that

: ''Dt'' = ''Ds''/''s'' for some ''s'' in ''F''.

This has the form of a [[logarithmic derivative]]. Intuitively, one may think of ''t'' as the [[logarithm]] of some element ''s'' of ''F'', in which case, this condition is analogous to the ordinary [[chain rule]].  But it must be remembered that ''F'' is not necessarily equipped with a unique logarithm; one might adjoin many "logarithm-like" extensions to ''F''.  Similarly, an '''exponential extension''' is a simple transcendental extension that satisfies

: ''Dt'' = ''t''&amp;nbsp;''Ds''.

With the above caveat in mind, this element may be thought of as an exponential of an element ''s'' of ''F''.  Finally, ''G'' is called an '''elementary differential extension''' of ''F'' if there is a finite chain of subfields from ''F'' to ''G'' where each extension in the chain is either algebraic, logarithmic, or exponential.

== Basic theorem ==

Suppose ''F'' and ''G'' are differential fields, with Con(''F'') = Con(''G''), and that ''G'' is an elementary differential extension of ''F''.  Let ''a'' be in ''F'', ''y'' in G, and suppose ''Dy'' = ''a'' (in words, suppose that ''G'' contains an antiderivative of ''a'').  Then there exist ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Con(''F''), ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v'' in ''F'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;a = c_1\frac{Du_1}{u_1}+\dotsb+c_n\frac{Du_n}{u_n} + Dv.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the only functions that have "elementary antiderivatives" (i.e. antiderivatives living in, at worst, an elementary differential extension of ''F'') are those with this form.  Thus, on an intuitive level, the theorem states that the only elementary antiderivatives are the "simple" functions plus a finite number of logarithms of "simple" functions.

A proof of Liouville's theorem can be found in section 12.4 of Geddes, et al.

== Examples ==

As an example, the field '''C'''(''x'') of [[rational function]]s in a single variable has a derivation given by the standard [[derivative]] with respect to that variable.  The constants of this field are just the [[complex number]]s '''C'''.

The function &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{x} &lt;/math&gt;, which exists in '''C'''(''x''), does not have an antiderivative in '''C'''(''x'').  Its antiderivatives ln&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C'' do, however, exist in the logarithmic extension '''C'''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;''x'').

Likewise, the function &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{x^2+1}&lt;/math&gt; does not have an antiderivative in '''C'''(''x'').  Its antiderivatives tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C'' do not seem to satisfy the requirements of the theorem, since they are not (apparently) sums of rational functions and logarithms of rational functions.  However, a calculation with [[Euler's formula]] &lt;math&gt;e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; shows that in fact the antiderivatives can be written in the required manner (as logarithms of rational functions).

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{2i \theta} &amp; = \frac{e^{i \theta}}{e^{-i \theta}} 
= \frac{\cos \theta + i \sin \theta}{\cos \theta - i \sin \theta} 
= \frac{1 + i \tan \theta}{1 - i \tan \theta} \\[8pt]
\theta &amp; 
= \frac{1}{2i} \ln \left( \frac{1 + i \tan \theta}{1 - i \tan \theta} \right) \\[8pt]
\tan^{-1} x &amp; 
= \frac{1}{2i} \ln \left(  \frac{1+ix}{1-ix} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship with differential Galois theory ==

Liouville's theorem is sometimes presented as a theorem in [[differential Galois theory]], but this is not strictly true.  The theorem can be proved without any use of Galois theory.  Furthermore, the Galois group of a simple antiderivative is either trivial (if no field extension is required to express it), or is simply the additive group of the constants (corresponding to the constant of integration).  Thus, an antiderivative's differential Galois group does not encode enough information to determine if it can be expressed using elementary functions, the major condition of Liouville's theorem.
&lt;!--
== Example of theorem ==
Suppose we want to know whether a function of the form f*e&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; has an elementary antiderivative, with ''f'' and ''g'' in ''C''(''x'') --&gt;

[[File:Hawaiian earrings.svg|thumb|The Hawaiian earring is not locally simply connected]]
The [[circle]] is an example of a locally simply connected space which is not simply connected. The [[Hawaiian earring]] is a space which is neither locally simply connected nor simply connected.  The [[cone (topology)|cone]] on the Hawaiian earring is [[contractible space|contractible]] and therefore simply connected, but still not locally simply connected.

All [[topological manifold]]s and [[CW complex]]es are locally simply connected. In fact, these satisfy the much stronger property of being [[locally contractible space|locally contractible]].

A strictly weaker condition is that of being [[semi-locally simply connected]]. Both locally simply connected spaces and simply connected spaces are semi-locally simply connected, but neither converse holds.

'''Maximal entropy random walk''' ('''MERW''') is a popular type of [[biased random walk on a graph]], in which transition probabilities are chosen accordingly to the [[principle of maximum entropy]], which says that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy. While standard [[random walk]] chooses for every vertex uniform probability distribution among its outgoing edges, locally maximizing [[entropy rate]], MERW maximizes it globally (average entropy production) by assuming uniform probability distribution among all paths in a given graph.

MERW is used in various fields of science. A direct application is choosing probabilities to maximize transmission rate through a constrained channel, analogously to [[Fibonacci coding]]. Its properties also made it useful for example in analysis of complex networks,&lt;ref name=Sinatra&gt;[http://www.robertasinatra.com/pdf/sinatra_maximal_entropy.pdf R. Sinatra, J. Gómez-Gardenes, R.

[[Image:General picture for Maximal Entropy Random Walk.png|thumb|upright=2.65|right|'''Left:''' basic concept of the generic random walk (GRW) and maximal entropy random walk (MERW)&lt;br&gt;'''Right:''' example of their evolution on the same inhomogeneous 2D lattice with cyclic boundary conditions – probability density after 10, 100 and 1000 steps while starting from the same vertex. The small boxes represent defects: all vertices but the marked ones have additional [[self-loop]] (edge to itself). For regular lattices (no defects), GRW and MERW are identical. While defects do not strongly affect the local beha&amp;shy;vior, they lead to a completely different global stationary probability here. While GRW (and based on it standard [[diffusion]]) leads to nearly uniform stationary density, MERW has strong localization property, imprisoning the walkers in entropic wells in analogy to electrons in defected lattice of [[semi-conductor]].]]

Imagine there is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, given by [[adjacency matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A \in \left\{0, 1\right\}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt; if there is an edge from vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, 0 otherwise. For simplicity assume it is an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graph]], what corresponds to symmetric &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; however, MERW can be also generalized for directed and [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Weighted graph|weighted graphs]] (getting [[Boltzmann distribution]] among paths instead of uniform).

We would like to choose a random walk as [[Markov process]] on this graph: for every vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and its outgoing edge to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, choose probability &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of the walker randomly using this edge after visiting &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, find a [[stochastic matrix]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;0\leq S_{ij} \leq A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i, j&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n S_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming this graph is connected and not [[Periodic graph (graph theory)|periodic]], [[ergodic theory]] says that evolution of this [[stochastic process]] leads to some stationary probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\rho S = \rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Using [[Shannon entropy]] for every vertex and averaging over probability of visiting this vertex (to be able to use its entropy), we get the following formula for average entropy production ([[entropy rate]]) of a stochastic process:

:&lt;math&gt;H(S)=\sum_{i=1}^n \rho_i \sum_{j=1}^n S_{ij} \log(1/S_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;

This definition turns out to be equivalent with asymptotic average entropy (per length) of the probability distribution in the space of paths for this stochastic process.

In the standard random walk, referred here as generic random walk (GRW), we naturally choose that each outgoing edge is equally probable:
:&lt;math&gt;S_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n A_{ik}}&lt;/math&gt;.
For a symmetric &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; it leads to a stationary probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n A_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j=1}^n A_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;.
It locally maximizes entropy production (uncertainty) for every vertex, but usually leads to a suboptimal averaged global entropy rate &lt;math&gt;H(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

MERW chooses the stochastic matrix which maximizes &lt;math&gt;H(S)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently assumes uniform probability distribution among all paths in a given graph. Its formula is obtained by first calculating the dominant [[eigenvalue]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and corresponding [[eigenvector]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of the adjacency matrix, i.e. the largest &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding &lt;math&gt;\psi \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi A = \lambda \psi&lt;/math&gt;. Then stochastic matrix and stationary probability distribution are given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\psi_j}{\psi_i}&lt;/math&gt;
for which every possible path of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex has probability
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda^l} \frac{\psi_j}{\psi_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
Its entropy rate is &lt;math&gt;\log(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and the stationary probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \frac{\psi_i^2}{\psi^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In contrast to GRW, the MERW transition probabilities generally depend on the structure of the entire graph (are nonlocal). Hence, they rather should not be imagined as directly applied by the walker – if randomly looking decisions are performed based on local situation, like a person would do, the GRW approach is rather more appropriate. MERW is based on the [[principle of maximum entropy]], making it the safest assumption when we don't have any additional knowledge about the system. For example, it would be appropriate for modelling our knowledge about an object performing some complex dynamics – not necessarily random, like a particle.

=== Sketch of derivation ===
Assume for simplicity that the considered graph is indirected, connected and aperiodic, allowing to conclude from the [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]] that the dominant eigenvector is unique. Hence &lt;math&gt;A^l&lt;/math&gt; can be asymptotically (&lt;math&gt;l\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;) approximated by &lt;math&gt;\lambda^l \psi \psi^T&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\lambda^l |\psi\rangle \langle \psi|&lt;/math&gt; in [[bra-ket notation]]).

MERW requires uniform distribution along paths. The number &lt;math&gt;m_{il}&lt;/math&gt; of paths with length &lt;math&gt;2l&lt;/math&gt; and vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the center is
:&lt;math&gt;m_{il} = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n \left(A^l\right)_{ji} \left(A^l\right)_{ik} \approx \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\lambda^l \psi \psi^\top\right)_{ji} \left(\lambda^l \psi \psi^\top\right)_{ik} = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda^{2l} \psi_j \psi_i \psi_i \psi_k  = \lambda^{2l} \psi_i^2 \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^n \psi_j \sum_{k=1}^n \psi_k}_{=: b}&lt;/math&gt;,
hence for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \frac{m_{il}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n m_{kl}} = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\lambda^{2l} \psi_i^2 b}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \lambda^{2l} \psi_k^2 b} = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\psi_i^2}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \psi_k^2} = \frac{\psi_i^2}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \psi_k^2} = \frac{\psi_i^2}{\psi^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously calculating probability distribution for two succeeding vertices, one obtains that the probability of being at the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex and next at the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\psi_i A_{ij} \psi_j}{\sum\limits_{i'=1}^n \sum\limits_{j'=1}^n \psi_{i'} A_{i'j'} \psi_{j'}} = \frac{\psi_i A_{ij} \psi_j}{\psi A \psi^\top} = \frac{\psi_i A_{ij} \psi_j}{\lambda \psi^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Dividing by the probability of being at the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, gives for the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex being next after the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex
:&lt;math&gt;S_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\psi_j}{\psi_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
[[Image:Examples of using MERW, Fibonacci coding(left) and 1D defected lattice (right).png|thumb|320px|right|Left: choosing the optimal probability after symbol 0 in [[Fibonacci coding]]. Right: one-dimensional defected lattice and its stationary density for length 1000 cycle (it has three defects). While in standard random walk the stationary density is proportional to degree of a vertex, leading to 3/2 difference here, in MERW density is nearly completely localized in the largest defect-free region, analogous to the [[ground state]] predicted by [[quantum mechanics]].]]

Let us first look at probably the simplest nontrivial situation: [[Fibonacci coding]], where we want to transmit a message as a sequence of 0/1, but not using two successive 1s – after 1 there has to be used 0. To maximize the amount of information transmitted in such sequence, we should assume uniform probability distribution in the space of all possible sequences fulfilling this constraint. To practically use such long sequences, after 1 we have to use 0, but there remains a freedom of choosing the probability of 0 after 0. Let us denote this probability by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, then [[entropy coding]] would allow to encode a message using this chosen probability distribution. The stationary probability distribution of symbols for a given &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be &lt;math&gt;\rho=(1/(2-q),1-1/(2-q)) &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, entropy production is &lt;math&gt;H(S)=\rho_0 \left(q\log(1/q)+(1-q)\log(1/(1-q))\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which is maximized for &lt;math&gt;q=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2\approx 0.618&lt;/math&gt;, known from [[golden ratio]]. In contrast, standard random walk would choose suboptimal &lt;math&gt;q=0.5&lt;/math&gt;. While choosing larger &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; reduces the amount of information produced after 0, it also reduces frequency of 1, after which we cannot write any information.

A more complex example is defected one-dimensional cyclic lattice: let say 1000 nodes connected in a ring, for which all nodes but the defects have self-loop (edge to itself). In standard random walk (GRW) the stationary probability distribution would have defect probability being 2/3 of probability of the remaining vertices – there is nearly no localization, also analogously for standard [[diffusion]], which is infinitesimal limit of GRW. For MERW we have to first find the dominant eigenvector of the adjacency matrix – maximizing &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda \psi)_x = (A\psi)_x = \psi_{x-1}+ (1-V_x) \psi_x +\psi_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;

for all positions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V_x=1&lt;/math&gt; for defects, 0 otherwise. Substituting &lt;math&gt;3\psi_x&lt;/math&gt; and multiplying the equation by −1 we get:

&lt;math&gt;E \psi_x =-(\psi_{x-1} -2 \psi_x +\psi_{x+1}) + V_x \psi_x&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E = 3-\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is minimized now, becoming the analog of energy. The formula inside the bracket is [[discrete Laplace operator]], making this equation a discrete analogue of stationary [[Schrodinger equation]]. Like in [[quantum mechanics]], MERW predicts that the probability distribution should lead exactly to the one of quantum [[ground state]]: &lt;math&gt;\rho_x \propto \psi_x^2&lt;/math&gt; with its strongly localized density (in contrast to standard diffusion). Performing [[infinitesimal]] limit, we can get standard continuous stationary Schrodinger equation (&lt;math&gt;E\psi=-C\psi_{xx}+V\psi&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;C=\hbar^2/2m&lt;/math&gt;) here.&lt;ref name=ext&gt;[http://www.fais.uj.edu.pl/documents/41628/d63bc0b7-cb71-4eba-8a5a-d974256fd065 J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3756">In geometry, the '''mean width''' is a measure of the "size" of a body; see [[Hadwiger's theorem]] for more about the available measures of bodies. In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, one has to consider &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional hyperplanes perpendicular to a given direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[n-sphere]] (the surface of a &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional sphere).
The "width" of a body in a given direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the closest pair of such planes, such that the body is entirely in between the two hyper planes (the planes only intersect 
with the boundary of the body).  The mean width is the average of this "width" over all &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Width in dir n for mean width.png|thumb|alt=width in dir n|The definition of the "width" of body B in direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; in 2 dimensions.]]

More formally, define a compact body B as being equivalent to set of points in its interior plus the points on the boundary (here, points denote elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;). The support function of body B is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;h_B(n)=\max\{ \langle n,x\rangle |x \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a direction and &lt;math&gt;\langle,\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  The mean width is then

: &lt;math&gt;b(B)=\frac{1}{S_{n-1}} \int_{S^{n-1}} h_B(\hat{n})+h_B(-\hat{n}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Note, that the mean width can be defined for any body (that is compact), but it is most
useful for convex bodies (that is bodies, whose corresponding set is a [[convex set]]).

==Mean widths of convex bodies in low dimensions==
===One dimension===
The mean width of a line segment ''L'' is the length (1-volume) of ''L''.

===Two dimensions===
The mean width ''w'' of any compact shape ''S'' in two dimensions is ''p''/π, where ''p'' is the perimeter of the [[convex hull]] of ''S''. So ''w'' is the diameter of a circle with the same perimeter as the convex hull.

===Three dimensions===
For convex bodies ''K'' in three dimensions, the mean width of ''K'' is related to the average of the [[mean curvature]], ''H'', over the whole surface of ''K''. In fact,

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\delta K} \frac{H}{2\pi} dS = b(K)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta K&lt;/math&gt; is the boundary of the convex body &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;
a surface integral element, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean curvature]] at the corresponding position
on &lt;math&gt;\delta K&lt;/math&gt;. Similar relations can be given between the other measures  
and the generalizations of the mean curvature, also for other dimensions 
.&lt;ref name=""&gt;

As the integral over the mean curvature is typically much easier to calculate
than the mean width, this is a very useful result.

The mean width is usually mentioned in any good reference on convex geometry, for instance, ''Selected topics in convex geometry'' by Maria Moszyńska (Birkhäuser, Boston 2006).  The relation between the mean width and the mean curvature is also derived in that reference.

The application of the mean width as one of the measures featuring in [[Hadwiger's theorem]]
is discussed in Beifang Chen in "A simplified elementary proof of Hadwiger's volume theorem." ''Geom. Dedicata'' 105 (2004), 107—120.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4622">In [[mathematics]], a '''Motzkin number''' for a given number {{mvar|n}} is the number of different ways of drawing non-intersecting [[Chord (geometry)|chords]]  between {{mvar|n}} points on a [[circle]] (not necessarily touching every point by a chord). The Motzkin numbers are named after [[Theodore Motzkin]] and have diverse applications in [[geometry]], [[combinatorics]] and [[number theory]].

The Motzkin numbers &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = 0, 1, \dots&lt;/math&gt; form the sequence:

: 1, [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[21 (number)|21]], [[51 (number)|51]], [[127 (number)|127]], 323, 835, 2188, 5798, 15511, 41835, 113634, 310572, 853467, 2356779, 6536382, 18199284, 50852019, 142547559, 400763223, 1129760415, 3192727797, 9043402501, 25669818476, 73007772802, 208023278209, 593742784829, ... {{OEIS|id=A001006}}

== Examples ==

The following figure shows the 9 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 4 points on a circle ({{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 9}}):

:[[Image:MotzkinChords4.svg]]

The following figure shows the 21 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 5 points on a circle ({{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 21}}):

:[[Image:MotzkinChords5.svg]]

== Properties ==

The Motzkin numbers satisfy the [[recurrence relation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;M_{n}=M_{n-1}+\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}M_iM_{n-2-i}=\frac{2n+1}{n+2}M_{n-1}+\frac{3n-3}{n+2}M_{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Motzkin numbers can be expressed in terms of [[binomial coefficient]]s and [[Catalan number]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;M_n=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} \binom{n}{2k} C_k.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Motzkin prime''' is a Motzkin number that is [[prime number|prime]]. {{Asof|2013|October}}, four such primes are known:

: 2, 127, 15511, 953467954114363 {{OEIS|id=A092832}}

== Combinatorial interpretations ==

The Motzkin number for {{mvar|n}} is also the number of positive integer sequences of length {{math|1=''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} in which the opening and ending elements are either 1 or 2, and the difference between any two consecutive elements is &amp;minus;1, 0 or 1. Equivalently, the Motzkin number for {{mvar|n}} is the number of positive integer sequences of length {{math|1=''n'' + 1}} in which the opening and ending elements are 1, and the difference between any two consecutive elements is &amp;minus;1, 0 or 1.

Also, the Motzkin number for {{mvar|n}} gives the number of routes on the upper right quadrant of a grid from coordinate (0, 0) to coordinate ({{mvar|n}}, 0) in {{mvar|n}} steps if one is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at each step but forbidden from dipping below the {{mvar|y}} = 0 axis.

For example, the following figure shows the 9 valid Motzkin paths from (0, 0) to (4, 0):

:[[Image:Motzkin4.svg]]

There are at least fourteen different manifestations of Motzkin numbers in different branches of mathematics, as enumerated by {{harvtxt|Donaghey|Shapiro|1977}} in their survey of Motzkin numbers.
{{harvtxt|Guibert|Pergola|Pinzani|2001}} showed that [[vexillary involution]]s are enumerated by Motzkin numbers.

'''Point-to-point encryption''' (P2PE) is a standard established by the [[PCI Security Standards Council]].  Payment solutions that offer similar encryption but do not meet the P2Pe standard are referred to as [[end-to-end encryption]] (E2Ee) solutions. The objective of P2Pe and E2Ee is to provide a payment [[information security|security solution]] that instantaneously converts [[confidentiality|confidential]] payment card (credit and [[debit card]]) data and information into indecipherable code at the time the card is swiped to prevent [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] and [[fraud]]. It is designed to maximize the security of payment card transactions in an increasingly complex regulatory environment.

== The standard ==
The P2PE Standard defines the requirements that a "solution" must meet in order to be accepted as a PCI validated P2PE solution.  A "solution" is a complete set of hardware, software, gateway, decryption, device handling, etc.  Only "solutions" can be validated; individual pieces of hardware such as card readers cannot be validated.  It is also a common mistake to refer to P2PE validated solutions as "certified"; there is no such certification.

The determination of whether or not a solution meets the P2PE standard is the responsibility of a P2PE Qualified Security Assessor (P2PE-QSA).  P2PE-QSA companies are independent third-party companies who employ assessors that have met the PCI Security Standards Council's requirements for education and experience, and have passed the requisite exam. The PCI Security Standards Council does not validate solutions.

== How it works ==
As a payment card is swiped through a card reading device, referred to as a  [[point of interaction]] (POI) device, at the merchant location or [[point of sale]], the device immediately encrypts the card information. A device that is part of a PCI validated P2Pe solution uses an algorithmic calculation to encrypt the confidential payment card data. From the POI, the encrypted, indecipherable codes are sent to the payment gateway or processor for decryption.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The keys for encryption and decryption are never available to the merchant, making card data entirely invisible to the retailer. Once the encrypted codes are within the secure data zone of the payment processor, the codes are decrypted to the original card numbers and then passed to the issuing bank for authorization. The bank either approves or rejects the transaction, depending upon the card holder's payment account status. The merchant is then notified if the payment is accepted or rejected to complete the process along with a token that the merchant can store.  This token is a unique number reference to the original transaction that the merchant can use should they ever be needed to perform research or refund the customer without ever knowing the customer's card information ([[Tokenization (data security)|tokenization]]). There are also Qualified Integrator and Reseller (QIR) Companies, which are businesses authorized to "implement, configure, and/or support validated" PA-DSS Payment Applications, and perform qualified installations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/qualified_integrators_and_resellers PCI Security Standards: Assessors and Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution providers ==
According to the PCI Security Standards Council:&lt;blockquote&gt;The P2PE solution provider is a third-party entity (for example, a processor, acquirer, or payment gateway) that has overall responsibility for the design and implementation of a specific P2PE solution, and manages P2PE solutions for its merchant customers. The solution provider has overall responsibility for ensuring that all P2PE requirements are met, including any P2PE requirements performed by third-party organizations on behalf of the solution provider (for example, certification authorities and key-injection facilities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/P2PE_v1_1_FAQs_Aug2012.pdf|title=P2PE FAQs|last=|first=|date=August 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Benefits ==

=== Customer benefits ===

P2PE significantly reduces the risk of payment card fraud by instantaneously encrypting confidential cardholder data at the moment a payment card is swiped or 'dipped' if it is a chip card at the card reading device (payment terminal) or POI.

=== Merchant benefits ===

P2PE significantly facilitates merchant responsibilities:
* With a P2PE validated solution, merchants save significant time and money as PCI requirements may be greatly reduced. [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-faqs-2/#2 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=PCI Compliance Guide |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For organizations who use a P2PE validated solution provider, the PCI Self Assessment Questionnaire is reduced from 12 sections to 4 sections and the controls are reduced from 329 questions to just 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/SAQ_P2PE-HW_v3.docx |title=Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard Self-Assessment Questionnaire P2PE-HW and Attestation of Compliance |accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In the event of fraud, the P2PE Solution Provider, not the merchant, is held accountable for data loss and resulting fines that may be assessed by the card brands (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and JCB).  The PCI Security Standards Council does not assess penalties on Solution Providers or Merchants. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}}
* The payment process with P2PE is quicker than other transaction processes; thus, creating simpler and faster customer-merchant transactions.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Point-to-point encryption versus end-to-end encryption ==

=== Point-to-point ===

A point-to-point connection directly links system 1 (the point of payment card acceptance) to system 2 (the point of payment processing).  
A true P2PE solution is determined with three main factors:
# The solution uses a hardware-to-hardware encryption and decryption process along with a POI device that has SRED (Secure Reading and Exchange of Data) listed as a function. 
# The solution has been validated to the PCI P2PE Standard which includes specific POI device requirements such as strict controls regarding shipping, receiving, tamper-evident packaging and installation. 
# A solution includes merchant education in the form of a P2PE Instruction Manual, which guides the merchant on POI device use, storage, return for repairs and regular PCI reporting.

=== End-to-end ===

End-to-end encryption as the name suggests has the advantage over P2PE that card details are not unencrypted between the two endpoints.  If the endpoints are a PCI PED validated PIN pad and a POS acquirer, there is no opportunity for the card details to be intercepted.  It is obviously important that the endpoints (the PED and gateway) are provided by PCI accredited organisations.

== PCI point-to-point encryption requirements ==
The requirements include: 
# Secure encryption of payment card data at the point of interaction (POI),
# P2PE validated application(s) at the point of interaction,
# Secure management of encryption and decryption devices,
# Management of the decryption environment and all decrypted account data,
# Use of secure encryption methodologies and cryptographic key operations, including key generation, distribution, loading/injection, administration and usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcipolicyportal.com/saq-a-d/saq-p2pe-hw |title=PCI SAQ P2PE-HW &amp;#124; Point-to-Point Encryption &amp;#124; Hardware Terminals &amp;#124; PCI Compliance Policies |publisher=Pcipolicyportal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[convex analysis]], '''Popoviciu's inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] about [[convex function]]s. It is similar to [[Jensen's inequality]] and was found in 1965 by [[Tiberiu Popoviciu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Tiberiu Popoviciu | title=Sur certaines inégalités qui caractérisent les fonctions convexes | year=1965 | journal=Analele ştiinţifice Univ. "Al.I. Cuza" Iasi, Secţia I a Mat. | volume=11 | pages=155–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Romanian mathematician. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''f'' be a function from an interval &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''f'' is [[convex function|convex]], then for any three points ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''I'',

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)+f(y)+f(z)}{3} + f\left(\frac{x+y+z}{3}\right) \ge \frac{2}{3}\left[ f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) + f\left(\frac{y+z}{2}\right) + f\left(\frac{z+x}{2}\right) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

If a function ''f'' is [[Continuous function|continuous]], then it is convex if and only if the above inequality holds for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'' from &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.  When ''f'' is strictly convex, the inequality is strict except for&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2006 | title = Convex functions and their applications: a contemporary approach | author1=Constantin Niculescu | author2= [[Lars-Erik Persson]] | publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business | isbn=978-0-387-24300-9 | page=12 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5tYCzB8FQcC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Popoviciu%27s+inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be generalised to any finite number ''n'' of points instead of&amp;nbsp;3, taken on the right-hand side ''k'' at a time instead of 2 at a time:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1992 | title = Convex functions, partial orderings, and statistical applications | author1=J. E. Pečarić | author2=Frank Proschan | author3=Yung Liang Tong | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-549250-8 | page=171 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCAOFpic7AkC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=Popoviciu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''f'' be a continuous function from an interval &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''f'' is [[convex function|convex]] if and only if, for any integers ''n'' and ''k'' where ''n'' ≥ 3 and &lt;math&gt;2 \leq k \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;, and any ''n'' points &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; from ''I'',

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k} \binom{n-2}{k-2} \left( \frac{n-k}{k-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i) + nf\left(\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\right) \right)\ge \sum_{1 \le i_1 &lt; \dots &lt; i_k \le n} f\left( \frac1k \sum_{j=1}^{k} x_{i_j} \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popoviciu's inequality can also be generalised to a [[weighted inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year = 1976 | author1=P. M. Vasić | author2=Lj. R.

In [[algebra]], a '''primordial element''' is a particular kind of a [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] in a [[vector space]]. Let ''V'' be a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' and fix a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' of vectors &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of a basis, every vector ''v'' in ''V'' can be expressed uniquely as
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{i \in I} a_i(v) e_i.&lt;/math&gt;
Define &lt;math&gt;I(v) = \{ i \in I \mid a_i(v) \ne 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of indices for which the expression of ''v'' has a nonzero coefficient. Given a subspace ''W'' of ''V'', a nonzero vector ''w'' in ''W'' is said to be "primordial" if it has the following two properties:&lt;ref&gt;Milne, J., [http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html Class field theory course notes], updated March 23, 2013, Ch IV, §2.&lt;/ref&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;I(w)&lt;/math&gt; is minimal among the sets &lt;math&gt;I(w')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \ne w' \in W&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math&gt;a_i(w) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for some&amp;nbsp;''i''

[[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]] asserts that an odd [[prime number]] ''p'' can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;p = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

with [[integer]] ''x'' and ''y'' if and only if ''p'' is [[Modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 1 (mod 4). The statement was announced by [[Albert Girard|Girard]] in 1625, and again by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] in 1640, but neither supplied a proof.

The "only if" clause is easy: a [[Square number|perfect square]] is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, hence a sum of two squares is congruent to 0, 1, or 2. An odd prime number is congruent to either 1 or 3 modulo 4, and the second possibility has just been ruled out. The first proof that such a representation exists was given by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1747 and was complicated. Since then, many different proofs have been found. Among them, the proof using [[Minkowski's theorem]] about [[convex set]]s&lt;ref&gt;See Goldman's book, §22.5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Zagier]]'s short proof based on involutions have appeared.

==Euler's proof by infinite descent==
[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] succeeded in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares in 1749, when he was forty-two years old. He communicated this in a letter to [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach]] dated 12 April 1749.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0852.pdf Euler à Goldbach, lettre CXXV]&lt;/ref&gt; The proof relies on [[Proof by infinite descent|infinite descent]], and is only briefly sketched in the letter. The full proof consists in five steps and is published in two papers. The first four steps are Propositions 1 to 4 of the first paper&lt;ref&gt;De numerus qui sunt aggregata duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 4 (1752/3), 1758, 3-40) [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E228.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and do not correspond exactly to the four steps below. The fifth step below is from the second paper.&lt;ref&gt;Demonstratio theorematis FERMATIANI omnem numerum primum formae 4n+1 esse summam duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 5 (1754/5), 1760, 3-13) [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E241.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The summary is based on Edwards book, pages 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the avoidance of ambiguity, zero will always be a valid possible constituent of "sums of two squares", so for example every square of an integer is trivially expressible as the sum of two squares by setting one of them to be zero.  

1. ''The product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of two squares, is itself a sum of two squares.''

::This is a well known property, based on the identity

:::&lt;math&gt;(a^2+b^2)(p^2+q^2) = (ap+bq)^2 + (aq-bp)^2&lt;/math&gt;

::due to [[Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity|Diophantus]].

2. ''If a number which is a sum of two squares is divisible by a prime which is a sum of two squares, then the quotient is a sum of two squares.''
(This is Euler's first Proposition).

::Indeed, suppose for example that &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p^2+q^2&lt;/math&gt; and that this latter is a prime. Then &lt;math&gt;p^2 + q^2&lt;/math&gt; divides

:::&lt;math&gt;(pb-aq)(pb+aq) = p^2b^2 - a^2q^2 = p^2(a^2+b^2) - a^2(p^2+q^2).&lt;/math&gt;

::Since &lt;math&gt;p^2+q^2&lt;/math&gt; is a prime, it divides one of the two factors. Suppose that it divides &lt;math&gt;pb-aq&lt;/math&gt;. Since

:::&lt;math&gt;(a^2+b^2)(p^2+q^2) = (ap+bq)^2 + (aq-bp)^2&lt;/math&gt;

::(Diophantus's identity) it follows that &lt;math&gt;p^2+q^2&lt;/math&gt; must divide &lt;math&gt;(ap+bq)^2&lt;/math&gt;. So the equation can be divided by the square of &lt;math&gt;p^2+q^2&lt;/math&gt;. Dividing the expression by &lt;math&gt;(p^2+q^2)^2&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2+b^2}{p^2+q^2} = \left(\frac{ap+bq}{p^2+q^2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{aq-bp}{p^2+q^2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

::and thus expresses the quotient as a sum of two squares, as claimed.

::On the other hand if &lt;math&gt;p^2+q^2&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;pb+aq&lt;/math&gt;, a similar argument holds by using the following variant of Diophantus's identity: 

:::&lt;math&gt;(a^2+b^2)(q^2+p^2) = (aq+bp)^2 + (ap-bq)^2 . &lt;/math&gt;

3. ''If a number which can be written as a sum of two squares is divisible by a number which is not a sum of two squares, then the quotient has a factor which is not a sum of two squares.'' (This is Euler's second Proposition).

::Suppose &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a number not expressible as a sum of two squares, which divides &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Write the quotient, factored into its (possibly repeated) prime factors, as &lt;math&gt;p_1p_2\cdots p_n&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2 = q p_1p_2\cdots p_n&lt;/math&gt;. If all factors &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as sums of two squares, then we can divide &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; successively by &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc., and applying step (2.) above we deduce that each successive, smaller, quotient is a sum of two squares. If we get all the way down to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; itself would have to be equal to the sum of two squares, which is a contradiction.  So at least one of the primes &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is not the sum of two squares.

4. ''If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime positive integers then every factor of &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of two squares.''
(This is the step that uses step (3.) to produce an 'infinite descent' and was Euler's Proposition 4. The proof sketched below also includes the proof of his Proposition 3).

::Let &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; be relatively prime positive integers: wlog &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; is not itself prime, otherwise there is nothing to prove. Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; therefore be a ''proper'' factor of &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily prime: we wish to show that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of two squares.  Again, we lose nothing by assuming &lt;math&gt; q &gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; since the case &lt;math&gt; q = 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 &lt;/math&gt; is obvious.  

::Let &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; be non-negative integers such that &lt;math&gt;mq,nq&lt;/math&gt; are the closest multiples of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; (in absolute value) to &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Notice that the differences &lt;math&gt;c := a-mq&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d := b-nq&lt;/math&gt; are integers of absolute value strictly less than &lt;math&gt;q/2&lt;/math&gt;: indeed, when &lt;math&gt; q &gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; is even, gcd&lt;math&gt;(a,q/2)=1&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise since gcd&lt;math&gt;(a,q/2) \mid q/2 \mid q \mid a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, we would also have gcd&lt;math&gt;(a,q/2) \mid b&lt;/math&gt;.  Multiplying out we obtain
:::&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = m^2q^2 + 2mqc + c^2 + n^2q^2 + 2nqd + d^2 = Aq + (c^2+d^2)&lt;/math&gt;
::uniquely defining a non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; divides both ends of this equation sequence it follows that &lt;math&gt;c^2+d^2&lt;/math&gt; must also be divisible by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;: say &lt;math&gt;c^2+d^2 = qr&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be the gcd of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; which by the co-primeness of &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; is relatively prime to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;g^2&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, so writing &lt;math&gt;e = c/g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f = d/g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s = r/g^2&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the expression &lt;math&gt;e^2+f^2 = qs&lt;/math&gt; for relatively prime &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and with &lt;math&gt; s &lt; q/2 &lt;/math&gt;, since

:::&lt;math&gt;qs = e^2 + f^2 \leq c^2+d^2 &lt; \left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^2 = q^2/2.&lt;/math&gt;

::Now finally, the ''descent'' step:  if &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is not the sum of two squares, then by step (3.) there must be a factor &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; say of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; which is not the sum of two squares.  But &lt;math&gt;q_1 \leq s &lt; q/2 &lt; q &lt;/math&gt; and so repeating these steps (initially with &lt;math&gt;e,f;q_1&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;a,b;q&lt;/math&gt;, and so on ''ad infinitum'') we shall be able to find a strictly decreasing infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;q, q_1, q_2, \ldots &lt;/math&gt; of positive integers which are not themselves the sums of two squares but which divide into a sum of two relatively prime squares.  Since such an '''infinite descent''' is impossible, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; must be expressible as a sum of two squares, as claimed.

5. ''Every prime of the form &lt;math&gt;4n+1&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of two squares.''
(This is the main result of Euler's second paper).

::If &lt;math&gt;p=4n+1&lt;/math&gt;, then by [[Fermat's Little Theorem]] each of the numbers &lt;math&gt;1, 2^{4n}, 3^{4n},\dots, (4n)^{4n}&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to one modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. The differences &lt;math&gt;2^{4n}-1, 3^{4n}-2^{4n},\dots,(4n)^{4n}-(4n-1)^{4n}&lt;/math&gt; are therefore all divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Each of these differences can be factored as
:::&lt;math&gt;a^{4n}-b^{4n} = \left(a^{2n}+b^{2n}\right)\left(a^{2n}-b^{2n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
::Since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, it must divide one of the two factors. If in any of the &lt;math&gt;4n-1&lt;/math&gt; cases it divides the first factor, then by  the previous step we conclude that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is itself a sum of two squares (since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; differ by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, they are relatively prime). So it is enough to show that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; cannot always divide the second factor. If it divides all &lt;math&gt;4n-1&lt;/math&gt; differences &lt;math&gt;2^{2n}-1, 3^{2n}-2^{2n},\dots,(4n)^{2n}-(4n-1)^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, then it would divide all &lt;math&gt;4n-2&lt;/math&gt; differences of successive terms, all &lt;math&gt;4n-3&lt;/math&gt; differences of the differences, and so forth. Since the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th differences of the sequence &lt;math&gt;1^k, 2^k, 3^k,\dots&lt;/math&gt; are all equal to &lt;math&gt;k!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Finite difference#Calculus of finite differences|Finite difference]]), the &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;th differences would all be constant and equal to &lt;math&gt;(2n)!&lt;/math&gt;, which is certainly not divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; cannot divide all the second factors which proves that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is indeed the sum of two squares.

==Lagrange's proof through quadratic forms==
[[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] completed a proof in 1775&lt;ref&gt;Nouv. Mém. Acad. Berlin, année 1771, 125; ibid. année 1773, 275; ibid année 1775, 351.&lt;/ref&gt; based on his general theory of integral [[quadratic forms]]. The following presentation incorporates a slight simplification of his argument, due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], which appears in article 182 of the [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]].

An (integral [[binary quadratic form|binary) quadratic form]] is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bxy + cy^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; integers. A number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''represented by the form'' if there exist integers &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2&lt;/math&gt;. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares is then equivalent to the statement that a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the form &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;a=c=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt;) exactly when &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[discriminant]] of the quadratic form is defined to be &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt;. The discriminant of &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; is then equal to &lt;math&gt;-4&lt;/math&gt;.

Two forms &lt;math&gt; ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a'x'^2 + b'x'y' + c'y'^2 &lt;/math&gt; are ''equivalent'' if and only if there exist substitutions with integer coefficients
: &lt;math&gt; x = \alpha x' + \beta y'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y = \gamma x' + \delta y'&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; such that, when substituted into the first form, yield the second. Equivalent forms are readily seen to have the same discriminant, and hence also the same parity for the middle coefficient &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, which coincides with the parity of the discriminant. Moreover, it is clear that equivalent forms will represent exactly the same integers, because these kind of substitutions can be reversed by substitutions of the same kind.

Lagrange proved that all positive definite forms of discriminant −4 are equivalent. Thus, to prove Fermat's theorem it is enough to find ''any'' positive definite form of discriminant −4 that represents &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. For example, one can use a form
:&lt;math&gt; px^2 + 2mxy + \left(\frac{m^2+1}{p}\right)y^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where the first coefficient ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; was chosen so that the form represents &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by setting ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the coefficient ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''m'' is an arbitrary even number (as it must be, to get an even discriminant), and finally &lt;math&gt; c=\frac{m^2+1}{p} &lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that the discriminant &lt;math&gt; b^2-4ac=4m^2-4pc &lt;/math&gt; is equal to −4, which guarantees that the form is indeed equivalent to &lt;math&gt; x^2+y^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Of course, the coefficient &lt;math&gt; c=\frac{m^2+1}{p} &lt;/math&gt; must be an integer, so the problem is reduced to finding some integer ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;m^2+1&lt;/math&gt;:  or in other words, a '' 'square root of -1 modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;' ''.  

We claim such a square root of &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt; K = \prod_{k=1}^\frac{p-1}{2} k &lt;/math&gt;.  Firstly it follows from Euclid's [[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic]] that &lt;math&gt; ab \equiv 0 \pmod p \iff a \equiv 0 \pmod p \ \ \hbox{or}\ \  b \equiv 0 \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently  &lt;math&gt; a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod p  \iff a \equiv \pm 1 \pmod p  &lt;/math&gt;: that is, &lt;math&gt; \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt; are their own inverses modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and this property is unique to them.  It then follows from the validity of [[Euclidean division]] in the integers, and the fact that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, that for every &lt;math&gt; 2 \leq a \leq p-2 &lt;/math&gt; the gcd of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed via the [[Euclidean algorithm]] yielding a unique and ''distinct'' inverse &lt;math&gt; a^{-1} \neq a &lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;  modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular therefore the product of ''all'' non-zero residues modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt; L = \prod_{l=\frac{p+1}{2}}^{p-1} l &lt;/math&gt;: from what has just been observed, &lt;math&gt; KL \equiv -1 \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;.  But by definition, since each term in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; may be paired with its negative in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; L = (-1)^\frac{p-1}{2}K &lt;/math&gt;, which since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is odd shows that &lt;math&gt; K^2 \equiv -1 \pmod p \iff p \equiv 1 \pmod 4 &lt;/math&gt;, as required.   


&lt;!-- 
This is possible by [[Euler's criterion]], but we reproduce the argument below to finish the proof.

As said, it suffices to find a root ''m'' of the polynomial &lt;math&gt; P(x)=x^2+1 &lt;/math&gt; modulo ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''n''+1. What we do know, by Fermat's Little Theorem, is that each ''z'' not congruent to 0 modulo ''p'' is a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt; Q(z)=z^{p-1}-1 = z^{4n}-1 = (z^{2n}-1)(z^{2n}+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Then it must be a root of either &lt;math&gt; z^{2n}-1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; z^{2n}+1 &lt;/math&gt;, since the integers modulo ''p'' form a field. Moreover, by a theorem of Lagrange, the number of roots modulo ''p'' of a polynomial of degree ''d'' is at most ''d'' (this follows again since the integers modulo ''p'' form a field). So the 4''n'' nonzero classes 1, 2, …, ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 must split into exactly 2''n'' of them that are roots of &lt;math&gt;z^{2n} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and the other 2''n'' that are roots of &lt;math&gt; z^{2n} + 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Choosing any ''z'' of the second kind and setting &lt;math&gt;m=z^n&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof.

==Dedekind's two proofs using Gaussian integers==
[[Richard Dedekind]] gave at least two proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, both using the arithmetical properties of the [[Gaussian integers]], which are numbers of the form ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers, and ''i'' is the square root of −1. One appears in section 27 of his exposition of ideals published in 1877; the second appeared in Supplement XI to [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]'s ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'', and was published in 1894.

'''1. First proof.''' If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an odd [[prime number]], then we have &lt;math&gt;i^{p-1} = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; in the Gaussian integers. Consequently, writing a Gaussian integer ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'' with ''x,y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z''' and applying the [[Frobenius automorphism]] in '''Z'''[''i'']/(''p''), one finds
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^p = (x+yi)^p \equiv x^p+y^pi^p \equiv x + (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}yi \pmod{p},&lt;/math&gt;
since the automorphism fixes the elements of '''Z'''/(''p''). In the current case, &lt;math&gt;p=4n+1&lt;/math&gt; for some integer n, and so in the above expression for ω&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;, the exponent (p-1)/2 of -1 is even. Hence the right hand side equals ω, so in this case the Frobenius endomorphism of '''Z'''[''i'']/(''p'') is the identity. 
Kummer had already established that if {{nowrap|''f'' ∈ {1,2}}} is the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the Frobenius automorphism of '''Z'''[''i'']/(''p''), then the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] &lt;math&gt;(p)&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''[''i''] would be a product of 2/''f'' distinct [[prime ideal]]s. (In fact, Kummer had established a much more general result for any extension of '''Z''' obtained by adjoining a primitive ''m''-th [[root of unity]], where ''m'' was any positive integer; this is the case {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 4}} of that result.) Therefore, the ideal (''p'') is the product of two different prime ideals in '''Z'''[''i''].  Since the Gaussian integers are a [[Euclidean domain]] for the norm function &lt;math&gt;N(x + iy)=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;, every ideal is principal and generated by a nonzero element of the ideal of minimal norm. Since the norm is multiplicative, the norm of a generator &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of one of the ideal factors of (''p'') must be a strict divisor of &lt;math&gt;N(p) = p^2&lt;/math&gt;, so that we must have &lt;math&gt; p = N(\alpha) = N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt;, which gives Fermat's theorem.

'''2. Second proof.''' This proof builds on Lagrange's result that if &lt;math&gt;p=4n+1&lt;/math&gt; is a prime number, then there must be an integer ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;m^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''p'' (we can also see this by [[Euler's criterion]]); it also uses the fact that the Gaussian integers are a [[unique factorization domain]] (because they are a Euclidean domain). Since {{nowrap|''p'' ∈ '''Z'''}} does not divide either of the Gaussian integers &lt;math&gt;m + i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m-i&lt;/math&gt; (as it does not divide their [[imaginary part]]s), but it does divide their product &lt;math&gt;m^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; cannot be a [[Integral domain#Divisibility, prime and irreducible elements|prime]] element in the Gaussian integers. We must therefore have a nontrivial factorization of ''p'' in the Gaussian integers, which in view of the norm can have only two factors (since the norm is multiplicative, and &lt;math&gt;p^2 = N(p)&lt;/math&gt;, there can only be up to two factors of p), so it must be of the form &lt;math&gt;p = (x+yi)(x-yi)&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This immediately yields that &lt;math&gt;p = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof by Minkowski's Theorem==
For &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; congruent to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;  mod &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; a prime, &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quadratic residue]] mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by [[Euler's criterion]]. Therefore, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;m^2+1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}, \hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[standard basis]] elements for the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;\vec{u} = \hat{i} + m\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = 0\hat{i} + p\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the [[lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;S = \{a\vec{u} + b\vec{v} \mid a, b \in \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\vec{w} = a\vec{u} + b\vec{v} = a \hat{i} + (am + bp)\hat{j} \in S&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{w}\|^2 \equiv a^2 + (am+bp)^2 \equiv a^2(1 + m^2) \equiv 0\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{w}\|^2&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\vec{w} \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

The area of the [[Primitive cell#Two dimensions|fundamental parallelogram]] (in this case a rectangle) of the lattice is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. The area of the open disk, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, of radius &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2p}&lt;/math&gt; centered around the origin is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi p &gt; 4p&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is convex and symmetrical about the origin. Therefore, by [[Minkowski's theorem]] there exists a nonzero vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{w} \in S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vec{w} \in D&lt;/math&gt;. Both &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{w}\|^2 &lt; 2p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \mid \|\vec{w}\|^2&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;p = \|\vec{w}\|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the squares of the components of &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Zagier's "one-sentence proof"==
Let &lt;math&gt;p=4k+1&lt;/math&gt; be prime, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[natural number]]s (with or without zero), and consider the finite set &lt;math&gt;S=\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{N}^3: x^2+4yz=p\}&lt;/math&gt; of triples of numbers.
Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has two [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s: an obvious one &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto (x,z,y)&lt;/math&gt; whose fixed points &lt;math&gt;(x,y,y)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to representations of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; as a sum of two squares, and a more complicated one,
: &lt;math&gt; (x,y,z)\mapsto
\begin{cases}
(x+2z,~z,~y-x-z),\quad \textrm{if}\,\,\, x &lt; y-z \\
(2y-x,~y,~x-y+z),\quad \textrm{if}\,\,\, y-z &lt; x &lt; 2y\\
(x-2y,~x-y+z,~y),\quad \textrm{if}\,\,\, x &gt; 2y
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

which has exactly one fixed point &lt;math&gt;(1,1,k)&lt;/math&gt;. Two involutions over the same finite set must have sets of fixed points with the same [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]], and since the second involution has an odd number of fixed points, so does the first.
Zero is even, so the first involution has a nonzero number of fixed points, any one of which gives a representation of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; as a sum of two squares.

This proof, due to [[Don Zagier|Zagier]], is a simplification of an earlier proof by [[Roger Heath-Brown|Heath-Brown]], which in turn was inspired by a proof of [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]]. The technique of the proof is a combinatorial analogue of the topological principle that the [[Euler characteristic]]s of a [[topological space]] with an involution and of its [[Fixed point theorem|fixed point set]] have the same parity and is reminiscent of the use of ''sign-reversing involutions'' in the proofs of combinatorial bijections.

==Proof with partition theory==

In 2016, A. David Christopher gave a [[Partition (number theory)|partition-theoretic]] proof by considering partitions of the odd prime &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; having exactly two sizes &lt;math&gt;a_i (i=1,2)&lt;/math&gt;, each occurring exactly &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt; times, and by showing that at least one such partition exists if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to 1 modulo 4.&lt;ref&gt;A. David Christopher, A partition-theoretic proof of Fermat’s Two Squares Theorem”, Discrete Mathematics, 339 (2016) 1410–1411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The book was reviewed by Pierre Kerszberg for ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and by [[Michael S. Mahoney]] for ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]''. Mahoney says "The title should have a question mark." He sets the context by referring to [[paradigm shift]]s that characterize scientific revolutions as described by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in his book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. According to Michael Crowe in chapter one, revolutions never occur in mathematics. Mahoney explains how mathematics grows upon itself and does not discard earlier gains in understanding with new ones, such as happens in biology, physics, or other sciences.  A nuanced version of revolution in mathematics is described by Caroline Dunmore who sees change at the level of "meta-mathematical values of the community that define the telos and methods of the subject, and encapsulate general beliefs about its value." On the other hand, reaction to innovation in mathematics is noted, resulting in "clashes of intellectual and social values".

'''Samuel Earnshaw''' (1 February 1805, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]]&amp;nbsp;– 6 December 1888, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]]&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1888 9c 246 ECCLESALL B. (aged 83)&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English clergyman and mathematician and physicist, noted for his contributions to theoretical physics, especially "[[Earnshaw's theorem]]".

Earnshaw was born in [[Sheffield]] and entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating [[Senior Wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize]]man in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|ENSW827S|Samuel Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1831 to 1847 Earnshaw worked in Cambridge as tripos coach, and in 1846 was appointed to the parish church St. Michael, Cambridge. For a time he acted as curate to the Revd [[Charles Simeon]].  In 1847 his health broke down and he returned to Sheffield working as a chaplain and teacher.

Earnshaw published several mathematical and physical articles and books.  His most famous contribution, "[[Earnshaw's theorem]]", shows the impossibility of stable levitating permanent magnets: other topics included optics, waves, dynamics and acoustics in physics, calculus, trigonometry and partial differential equations in mathematics. As a clergyman, he published several sermons and treatises.

A '''scientific calculator''' is a type of [[Electronics|electronic]] [[calculator]], usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]].  They have almost completely replaced [[slide rule]]s in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings.

In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by [[graphing calculator]]s, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device.  There is also some overlap with the [[financial calculator]] market.

== Functions ==

'''Modern''' scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include:

* [[scientific notation]]
* [[floating point]] arithmetic
* [[logarithm]]ic functions, using both base 10 and [[Natural logarithm|base e]]
* [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions (some including [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic trigonometry]])
* [[exponent]]ial functions and [[nth root|root]]s beyond the [[square root]]
* quick access to constants such as [[pi]] and [[E (mathematical constant)|e]]

In addition, high-end scientific calculators generally include:

* cursor controls to edit equations and view previous calculations
* [[hexadecimal]], [[Binary numeral system|binary]], and [[octal]] calculations, including basic [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] math
* [[complex number]]s
* [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] calculations
* [[statistics]] and [[probability]] calculations
* programmability — see [[Programmable calculator]]
* equation solving
* [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix calculations]]
* [[calculus]]
* [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] that can be used for spelling words or including [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] into an equation
* [[conversion of units]]
* [[physical constants]]

While most scientific models have traditionally used a single-line display similar to traditional pocket calculators, many of them have more digits (10 to 12), sometimes with extra digits for the floating point exponent.  A few have multi-line displays, with some models from [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Casio]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] using [[dot matrix]] displays similar to those found on [[graphing calculator]]s.

== Uses ==
Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions, especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms.  They are also used for calculations of very large or very small numbers, as in some aspects of [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]].

They are very often required for math classes from the junior high school level through college, and are generally either permitted or required on many [[standardized test]]s covering math and science subjects; as a result, many are sold into educational markets to cover this demand, and some high-end models include features making it easier to translate a problem on a textbook page into calculator input, e.g. by providing a method to enter an entire problem in as it is written on the page using simple formatting tools.

==History==
The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A|HP-9100A]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp9100.htm HP-9100A/B at hpmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1968, though the [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=across the editor's desk: COMPUTING AND DATA PROCESSING NEWSLETTER - THE MATHATRON|journal=Computers and Automation|date=Mar 1964|volume=XIII|issue=3|page=43|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/computersAndAutomation/|others=196403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. The HP-9100 series was built entirely from discrete [[transistor]] logic with no [[integrated circuit]]s, and was one of the first uses of the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on [[reverse Polish notation|Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN) entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived [[HP-12C]] financial calculator and the [[HP-48]] series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following.

The [[HP-35]], introduced on February 1, 1972, was Hewlett-Packard's first [[pocket calculator]] and the world's first handheld scientific calculator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/about/news/2009/14april_1.html HP-35 Scientific Calculator Awarded IEEE Milestone]&lt;/ref&gt; Like some of HP's desktop calculators it used RPN. Introduced at US$395, the HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975.

Texas Instruments (TI), after the introduction of several units with scientific notation, came out with a handheld scientific calculator on January 15, 1974, in the form of the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://datamath.org/SCI/WEDGE/sr-50.htm SR-50 page at datamath.org]&lt;/ref&gt; TI continues to be a major player in the calculator market, with their long-running [[TI-30]] series being one of the most widely used scientific calculators in classrooms.

Casio, Canon and Sharp have also been major players, with Casio's fx series (beginning with the Casio fx-1 in 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/casiofx1.html Casio FX-1 Desktop Scientific Calculator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) being a very common brand, used particularly in schools. Casio is also a major player in the graphing calculator market, and was the first company to produce one ([[Casio fx-7000G]]).

'''Skewness risk''' in [[financial modeling]] is the risk that results when observations are not spread symmetrically around an [[average]] value, but instead have a [[skewed distribution]].  As a result, the [[mean]] and the [[median]] can be different.  Skewness risk can arise in any quantitative model that assumes a [[symmetric distribution]] (such as the [[normal distribution]]) but is applied to skewed data.

Ignoring skewness risk, by assuming that variables are symmetrically distributed when they are not, will cause any model to understate the risk of variables with high skewness.

Skewness risk plays an important role in hypothesis testing.  The [[analysis of variance]], the most common test used in hypothesis testing, assumes that the data is normally distributed.  If the variables tested are not normally distributed because they are too skewed, the test cannot be used.  Instead, nonparametric tests can be used, such as the [[Mann–Whitney test]] for unpaired situation or the [[sign test]] for paired situation.

Skewness risk and [[kurtosis risk]] also have technical implications in calculation of [[value at risk]].  If either are ignored, the Value at Risk calculations will be flawed.

[[Benoît Mandelbrot]], a French mathematician, extensively researched this issue.  He feels that the extensive reliance on the normal distribution for much of the body of modern finance and investment theory is a serious flaw of any related models (including the [[Black–Scholes]] model and [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]]).  He explained his views and alternative finance theory in a book: ''The (Mis)Behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward''.

In options markets, the difference in [[implied volatility]] at different strike prices represents the market's view of skew, and is called [[volatility skew]].  (In pure Black–Scholes, implied volatility is constant with respect to strike and time to maturity.)

==Skewness for bonds==
Bonds have a skewed return. A bond will either pay the full amount on time (very likely to much less likely depending on quality), or less than that. A normal bond does not ever pay ''more'' than the "good" case.

In [[mathematics]], '''Sperner's lemma''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[analogy|analog]] of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], which is equivalent to it.

Sperner's lemma states that every '''Sperner coloring''' (described below) of a [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of an ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]] contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors.

The initial result of this kind was proved by [[Emanuel Sperner]], in relation with proofs of [[invariance of domain]].  Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s and in [[root-finding algorithm]]s, and are applied in [[fair division]] (cake cutting) algorithms. It is now believed to be an intractable computational problem to find a Brouwer fixed point or equivalently a Sperner coloring, even in the plane, in the general case. The problem is [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD-complete]], a complexity class invented by [[Christos Papadimitriou]].

According to the Soviet ''Mathematical Encyclopaedia'' (ed. [[I.M. Vinogradov]]), a related 1929 theorem (of [[Bronisław Knaster|Knaster]], [[Karol Borsuk|Borsuk]] and [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz|Mazurkiewicz]]) had also become known as the ''Sperner lemma'' – this point is discussed in the English translation (ed. M. Hazewinkel). It is now commonly known as the [[Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma]].

==Statement==
=== One-dimensional case ===
[[Image:Sperner1d.svg|thumb|20px|right|One-dimensional case example]]
In one dimension, Sperner's Lemma can be regarded as a discrete version of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete [[Function (mathematics)|function]] takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times.

=== Two-dimensional case ===
[[Image:Sperner2d.svg|250px|thumb|left|Two-dimensional case example]]
The two-dimensional case is the one referred to most frequently. It is stated as follows:

Given a [[triangle]] ABC, and a triangulation ''T'' of the triangle, the set ''S'' of vertices of ''T'' is colored with three colors in such a way that
# A, B, and C are colored 1, 2, and 3 respectively
# Each vertex on an edge of ABC is to be colored only with one of the two colors of the ends of its edge. For example, each vertex on AC must have a color either 1 or 3.

Then there exists a triangle from ''T'', whose vertices are colored with the three different colors. More precisely, there must be an odd number of such triangles.

=== Multidimensional case ===
In the general case the lemma refers to a ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=A_1 A_2 \ldots A_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

We consider a triangulation ''T'' which is a disjoint division of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; into smaller ''n''-dimensional simplices. Denote the coloring function as ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{1,2,3,...,''n'',''n''+1}, where ''S'' is again the set of vertices of ''T''. The rules of coloring are:
# The vertices of the large simplex are colored with different colors, i. e. ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''+1.
# Vertices of ''T'' located on any ''k''-dimensional subface of the large simplex

::&lt;math&gt;A_{i_1}A_{i_2}\ldots A_{i_{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

:are colored only with the colors

::&lt;math&gt;i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_{k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then there exists an odd number of simplices from ''T'', whose vertices are colored with all ''n+1'' colors. In particular, there must be at least one.

== Proof ==

We shall first address the two-dimensional case. Consider a graph ''G'' built from the triangulation ''T'' as follows:

:The vertices of ''G'' are the members of ''T'' plus the area outside the triangle. Two vertices are connected with an edge if their corresponding areas share a common border with one endpoint colored 1 and the other colored 2.

Note that on the interval AB there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and as we move along AB, there must be an odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of ''G'' corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the [[handshaking lemma]]) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of ''T''.

It can be easily seen that the only possible degree of a triangle from ''T'' is 0, 1, or 2, and that the degree 1 corresponds to a triangle colored with the three colors 1, 2, and 3.

Thus we have obtained a slightly stronger conclusion, which says that in a triangulation ''T'' there is an odd number (and at least one) of full-colored triangles.

A multidimensional case can be proved by induction on the dimension of a simplex. We apply the same reasoning, as in the two-dimensional case, to conclude that in a ''n''-dimensional triangulation there is an odd number of full-colored simplices.

=== Commentary ===
[[Image:Spernerlemma.svg|thumb|left|A simple two-dimensional triangulation of the example figure, colored and named in accordance with the assumptions of Sperner's Lemma]]
[[Image:Spernergraph.svg|thumb|right|The graph derived from the example figure]]
Here is an elaboration of the proof given previously, for a reader new to [[graph theory]]:  This diagram numbers the colors of the vertices of the example given previously.  The small triangles whose vertices all have different numbers are shaded in the graph.  Each small triangle becomes a node in the new graph derived from the triangulation.  The small letters identify the areas, eight inside the figure, and area ''i'' designates the space outside of it.  As described previously, those nodes that share an edge whose endpoints are numbered 1 and 2 are joined in the derived graph. For example, node ''d'' shares an edge with the outer area ''i'', and its vertices all have different numbers, so it is also shaded.  Node ''b'' is not shaded because two vertices have the same number, but it is joined to the outer area.
One could add a new full-numbered triangle, say by inserting a node numbered 3 into the edge between 1 and 1 of node ''a'', and joining that node to the other vertex of ''a''.  Doing so would have to create a pair of new nodes, like the situation with nodes ''f'' and ''g''.

== Generalizations ==

=== Polytopes ===
Suppose that, instead of an &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplex, we have a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[polytope]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices.

Then there are at least &lt;math&gt;n-d&lt;/math&gt; fully labeled simplices, where "fully labeled" indicates that every label on the simplex has a different color. For example, if a (two-dimensional) polygon with ''n'' vertices is triangulated and colored according to the Sperner criterion, then there are at least &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; fully labeled triangles.

The general statement was conjectured by [[Krassimir Atanassov|Atanassov]] in 1996, who proved it for the case &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Atanassov | first = K. T. | issue = 1–2 | journal = Studia Scientiarum Mathematicarum Hungarica | mr = 1405126 | pages = 71–74 | title = On Sperner's lemma | volume = 32 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The proof of the general case was first given by de Loera, Peterson, and [[Francis Su|Su]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = De Loera | first1 = Jesus A. | author1-link = Jesús A. De Loera | last2 = Peterson | first2 = Elisha | last3 = Su | first3 = Francis Edward | author3-link = Francis Su | doi = 10.1006/jcta.2002.3274 | issue = 1 | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | mr = 1932067 | pages = 1–26 | series = Series A | title = A polytopal generalization of Sperner's lemma | volume = 100 | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permutations ===
Suppose that, instead of a single labeling, we have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; different Sperner labelings.

We consider pairs (simplex,permutation) such that, the label of each vertex of the simplex is chosen from a different labeling (so for each simplex, there are &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; different pairs).

Then there are at least &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; fully labeled pairs. This was proved by [[Ravindra Bapat]].&lt;ref name="b87"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01587081|title=A constructive proof of a permutation-based generalization of Sperner's lemma|journal=Mathematical Programming|volume=44|pages=113|year=1989|last1=Bapat|first1=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to state this lemma is as follows. Suppose there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; people, each of whom produces a different Sperner labeling of the same triangulation. Then, there exists a simplex, and a matching of the people to its vertices, such that each vertex is labeled by its owner differently (one person labels its vertex by 1, another person labels its vertex by 2, etc.). Moreover, there are at least &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; such matchings. This can be used to find an [[envy-free cake-cutting]] with connected pieces.

===Degrees===
{| class="wikitable" style="float:right"
|-
! Sequence !! Degree
|-
| 123 || 1 (one 1-2 switch and no 2-1 switch)
|-
| 12321 || 0 (one 1-2 switch minus one 2-1 switch)
|-
| 1232 || 0 (as above; recall sequence is cyclic)
|-
| 1231231 || 2 (two 1-2 switches and no 2-1 switch)
|}
Suppose a triangle is triangulated and labeled with {1,2,3}. Consider the cyclic sequence of labels on the boundary of the triangle. Define the ''degree'' of the labeling as the difference between the number of switches from 1 to 2, and the number of switches from 2 to 1. See examples in the table at the right. Note that the degree is the same if we count switches from 2 to 3 minus 3 to 2, or from 3 to 1 minus 1 to 3.

Musin proved that ''the number of fully labeled triangles is at least the degree of the labeling''.&lt;ref name=m14&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1405.7513|author1=Oleg R Musin|title=Around Sperner's lemma|class=math.CO|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if the degree is nonzero, then there exists at least one fully labeled triangle.

If a labeling satisfies the Sperner condition, then its degree is exactly 1: there are 1-2 and 2-1 switches only in the side between vertices 1 and 2, and the number of 1-2 switches must be one more than the number of 2-1 switches (when walking from vertex 1 to vertex 2). Therefore, the original Sperner lemma follows from Musin's theorem.

=== Trees and cycles ===
There is a similar lemma about finite and infinite [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== Cubic Sperner lemma ===
A variant of Sperner's lemma on a cube (instead of a simplex) was proved by [[Harold W. Kuhn]].&lt;ref name="k60"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1147/rd.45.0518|title=Some Combinatorial Lemmas in Topology|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=4|issue=5|pages=518|year=1960|last1=Kuhn|first1=H. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[Poincaré–Miranda theorem]].&lt;ref name="m15"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/topology.pdf|title=Topology for the working mathematician|author=Michael Müger|year=2016|publisher=Draft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s. A Sperner coloring can be constructed such that fully labeled simplices correspond to fixed points of a given function. By making a triangulation smaller and smaller, one can show that the limit of the fully labeled simplices is exactly the fixed point. Hence, the technique provides a way to approximate fixed points.

For this reason, Sperner's lemma can also be used in [[root-finding algorithm]]s and [[fair division]] algorithms; see [[Simmons–Su protocols]].

Sperner's lemma is one of the key ingredients of the proof of [[Monsky's theorem]], that a square cannot be cut into an odd number of [[equidissection|equal-area triangles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], the '''Wasserstein''' or '''Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric''' or '''distance''' is a [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] defined between  [[probability measure|probability distribution]]s on a given [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, if each distribution is viewed as a unit amount of "dirt" piled on ''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'', the metric is the minimum "cost" of turning one pile into the other, which is assumed to be the amount of dirt that needs to be moved times the mean distance it has to be moved.  Because of this analogy, the metric is known in [[computer science]] as the [[earth mover's distance]].

The name "Wasserstein distance" was coined by [[Roland Dobrushin|R. L. Dobrushin]] in 1970, after the [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]] [[Leonid Vaseršteĭn]] who introduced the concept in 1969. Most [[English language|English]]-language publications use the [[German language|German]] spelling "Wasserstein" (attributed to the name "Vaseršteĭn" being of [[Germanic languages|German]] origin).

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space for which every probability measure on ''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'' is a [[Radon measure]] (a so-called [[Radon space]]). For &lt;math&gt;p\ge1&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P_p(M)&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of all probability measures &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on ''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'' with finite &lt;math&gt;p^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; [[Moment (mathematics)#Moments in metric spaces|moment]] for some &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in ''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{M} d(x, x_{0})^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) &lt; +\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the '''&lt;math&gt;p^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; Wasserstein distance''' between two probability measures ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P_p(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;W_{p} (\mu, \nu):=\left( \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma (\mu, \nu)} \int_{M \times M} d(x, y)^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (x, y) \right)^{1/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mu,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the collection of all measures on &lt;math&gt;M \times M&lt;/math&gt; with [[Marginal distribution|marginals]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;'' on the first and second factors respectively. (The set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mu,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is also called the set of all '''[[Coupling (probability)|couplings]]''' of ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;''.)

The above distance is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;W_p(\mu,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (typically among authors who prefer the "Wasserstein" spelling) or &lt;math&gt;\ell_p(\mu,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (typically among authors who prefer the "Vaserstein" spelling). The remainder of this article will use the ''&lt;math&gt;W_p&lt;/math&gt;'' notation.

The Wasserstein metric may be equivalently defined by

:&lt;math&gt;W_{p} (\mu, \nu)^{p} = \inf \mathbf{E} \big[ d( X , Y )^{p} \big],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}[Z]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[expected value]] of a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and the [[infimum]] is taken over all joint distributions of the random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with marginals ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; respectively.


==Intuition and Connection to Optimal Transport==
[[File:Transport-plan.svg|thumb|Two one-dimensional distributions &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, plotted on the x and y axes, and one possible joint distribution that defines a transport plan between them. The joint distribution/transport plan is not unique]]
One way to understand the motivation of the above definition is to consider the optimal transport problem. That is, for a distribution of mass &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; on a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we wish to transport the mass in such a way that it is transformed into the distribution &lt;math&gt;\nu(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the same space; transforming the 'pile of earth' &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to the pile &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. This problem only makes sense if the pile to be created has the same mass as the pile to be moved; therefore without loss of generality assume that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are probability distributions containing a total mass of 1. Assume also that there is given some cost function 

:&lt;math&gt;c(x,y) \mapsto [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

that gives the cost of transporting a unit mass from the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
A transport plan to move &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; can be described by a function &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; which gives the amount of mass to move from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In order for this plan to be meaningful, it must satisfy the following properties
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \gamma(x',x) \mathrm{d} x' &amp;= \nu(x) \\
\int \gamma(x,x') \mathrm{d} x' &amp;= \mu(x)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
That is, that the total mass moved ''out of'' an infinitesimal region around &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to &lt;math&gt;\mu(x) \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt; and the total mass moved ''into'' a region around &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\nu(x)\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to the requirement that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a joint probability distribution with marginals &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the infinitesimal mass transported from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x,y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y&lt;/math&gt;, and the cost of moving is &lt;math&gt;c(x,y) \gamma(x,y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y&lt;/math&gt;, following the definition of the cost function. Therefore, the total cost of a transport plan &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \int c(x,y) \gamma(x,y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y = \int c(x,y) \mathrm{d} \gamma(x,y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The plan &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is not unique; the optimal transport plan is the plan with the minimal cost out of all possible transport plans. As mentioned, the requirement for a plan to be valid is that it is a joint distribution with marginals &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;; letting &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all such measures as in the first section, the cost of the optimal plan is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C =  \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma(\mu, \nu)} \int c(x,y) \mathrm{d} \gamma(x,y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If the cost of a move is simply the distance between the two points, then the optimal cost is identical to the definition of the &lt;math&gt;W_1&lt;/math&gt; distance.

==Examples==

===Point masses (degenerate distributions)===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mu_{1} = \delta_{a_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{2} = \delta_{a_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; be two [[degenerate distribution]]s (i.e. [[Dirac delta distribution]]s) located at points &lt;math&gt;a_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  There is only one possible coupling of these two measures, namely the point mass &lt;math&gt;\delta_{(a_{1}, a_{2})}&lt;/math&gt; located at &lt;math&gt;(a_{1}, a_{2}) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, using the usual [[absolute value]] function as the distance function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt;p \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-Wasserstein distance between &lt;math&gt;\mu_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;W_{p} (\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}) = | a_{1} - a_{2} | .&lt;/math&gt;
By similar reasoning, if &lt;math&gt;\mu_{1} = \delta_{a_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{2} = \delta_{a_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are point masses located at points &lt;math&gt;a_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and we use the usual [[Euclidean norm]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; as the distance function, then
:&lt;math&gt;W_{p} (\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}) = \| a_{1} - a_{2} \|_{p} .&lt;/math&gt;

===Normal distributions===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mu_{1} = \mathcal{N}(m_{1}, C_{1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{2} = \mathcal{N}(m_{2}, C_{2})&lt;/math&gt; be two non-degenerate [[Gaussian measure]]s (i.e. [[normal distribution]]s) on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, with respective [[expected value]]s &lt;math&gt;m_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and [[symmetric positive definite|symmetric positive semi-definite]] [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]] &lt;math&gt;C_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;W_{2} (\mu_{1}, \mu_{2})^{2} = \| m_{1} - m_{2} \|_{2}^{2} + \mathop{\mathrm{trace}} \bigl( C_{1} + C_{2} - 2 \bigl( C_{2}^{1/2} C_{1} C_{2}^{1/2} \bigr)^{1/2} \bigr) .&lt;/math&gt;
This result generalises the earlier example of the Wasserstein distance between two point masses (at least in the case &lt;math&gt;p = 2&lt;/math&gt;), since a point mass can be regarded as a normal distribution with covariance matrix equal to zero, in which case the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] term disappears and only the term involving the Euclidean distance between the means remains.

==Applications==

The Wasserstein metric is a natural way to compare the probability distributions of two variables ''X'' and ''Y'', where one variable is derived from the other by small, non-uniform perturbations (random or deterministic).

In computer science, for example, the metric ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is widely used to compare discrete distributions, ''e.g.'' the [[color histogram]]s of two [[digital images]]; see [[earth mover's distance]] for more details.

==Properties==

===Metric structure===

It can be shown that ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies all the [[axiom]]s of a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M''). Furthermore, convergence with respect to ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to the usual [[weak convergence of measures]] plus convergence of the first ''p''th moments.

===Dual representation of ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===

The following dual representation of ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a special case of the duality theorem of [[Leonid Kantorovich|Kantorovich]] and Rubinstein (1958): when ''μ'' and ''ν'' have [[Bounded set|bounded]] [[Support (measure theory)|support]],

:&lt;math&gt;W_{1} (\mu, \nu) = \sup \left\{ \left. \int_{M} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} (\mu - \nu) (x) \right| \mbox{continuous } f : M \to \mathbb{R}, \mathrm{Lip} (f) \leq 1 \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where Lip(''f'') denotes the minimal [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz constant]] for ''f''.

Compare this with the definition of the [[Radon metric]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho (\mu, \nu) := \sup \left\{ \left. \int_{M} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} (\mu - \nu) (x) \right| \mbox{continuous } f : M \to [-1, 1] \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the metric ''d'' is bounded by some constant ''C'', then

:&lt;math&gt;2 W_{1} (\mu, \nu) \leq C \rho (\mu, \nu),&lt;/math&gt;

and so convergence in the Radon metric (identical to '''total variation convergence''' when ''M'' is a [[Polish space]]) implies convergence in the Wasserstein metric, but not vice versa.

===Separability and completeness===

For any ''p'' ≥ 1, the metric space ('''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M''), ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[Separable space|separable]], and is [[Complete space|complete]] if (''M'', ''d'') is separable and complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogachev|first=V.I.|author2=Kolesnikov,  A.V. |title=The Monge-Kantorovich problem: achievements, connections, and perspectives|journal=[[Russian Math.
