'''''Advaita Vedanta''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|d|ˈ|v|aɪ|t|ə|_|v|ɛ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; {{lang-sa|अद्वैत वेदान्त}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}'', literally, "[[monism|not-two]]"), originally known as '''Puruṣavāda''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timalsina|first1=Sthaneshwar(स्थानेश्वर)|title=Puruṣavāda: A Pre-Śaṅkara Monistic Philosophy as Critiqued by Mallavādin|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|date=November 2017|volume=45|issue=5|pages=939–959|url=https://www.academia.edu/34865811/Purusavada.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|pg. 941 "Puruṣavāda appears a preferred terminology in the early periods, before the time of Sankara." See also [[Purusha]].}} is a [[Sādhanā|school]] of [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Hinduism#Practices|religious practice]], and one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization.{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|p=4, Quote: "Advaita Vedanta is more than a philosophical system, as we understand these terms in the West today; it is also a practical guide to spiritual experience and is intimately bound up with spiritual experience."}} The term ''Advaita'' refers to its idea that the soul (true Self, [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality ([[Brahman]]). The followers of this school are known as ''Advaita Vedantins'', or just ''Advaitins'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sthaneshwar Timalsina|title=Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of ‘Awareness Only’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wO2SAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137| year=2008|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-135-97092-5|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek [[Moksha|spiritual liberation]] through acquiring ''[[vidyā]]'', meaning knowledge,{{sfn|Kanamura|2004}} of one's true identity as ''Atman'', and the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=48-52}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=78-79}}

Advaita Vedanta traces its roots in the oldest [[Upanishad]]s. It relies on three textual sources called the [[Prasthanatrayi]]. It gives "a unifying interpretation of the whole body of Upanishads",{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=112}} the [[Brahma Sutras]], and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;ref name="menoniep"&gt;Sangeetha Menon (2012), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Advaita Vedanta], IEP&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedanta is the oldest extant sub-school of [[Vedanta]],{{refn|group=note|Literally: ''end or the goal of the [[Vedas]]''.}} which is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox]] (''āstika'') Hindu philosophies ({{IAST|''darśana''}}). Although its roots trace back to the 1st millennium BCE, the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedanta is considered by the tradition to be 8th century scholar [[Adi Shankara]].{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=x-xi, 8-10, 17-18}}&lt;ref name="Stephen Phillips 1998 page 332"&gt;Stephen Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, page 332 note 68&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=221, 680}}

Advaita Vedanta emphasizes ''[[Jivanmukti]]'', the idea that ''[[moksha]]'' (freedom, liberation) is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize ''videhamukti'', or ''moksha'' after death.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=4}}{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=114-120}} The school uses concepts such as Brahman, Atman, [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]], [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]] and others that are found in major Indian religious traditions,&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirst2005p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline G.

Advaita influenced and was influenced by various traditions and texts of Hindu philosophies such as [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], other sub-schools of Vedanta, [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], the [[Puranas]], the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], as well as social movements such as the [[Bhakti movement]].{{sfn|Novetzke|2007|pp=255-272}}{{sfn|Goodall|1996|p=xli}}{{sfn|Davis|2014|pp=13, 167 with note 21}} Beyond Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta interacted and developed with the other traditions of India such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=691}} Advaita Vedanta texts espouse a spectrum of views from idealism, including illusionism, to realist or nearly realist positions expressed in the early works of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=68}} In modern times, its views appear in various [[Neo-Vedanta]] movements.{{sfn|King|2002|p=119-133}} It has been termed as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Guide to Hindu Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYeAIM0d-KYC |year=2006|publisher=World Wisdom |isbn=978-1-933316-17-8|pages=38–43, 68–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and "The Mystic East" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOiDNx_co5wC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-63234-3|pages=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The Advaita Vedanta school has been historically referred to by various names, such as ''Advaita-vada'' (speaker of Advaita), ''Abheda-darshana'' (view of non-difference), ''Dvaita-vada-pratisedha'' (denial of dual distinctions), and ''Kevala-dvaita'' (non-dualism of the isolated).{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}}

According to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term ''Advaita'' first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of [[Mandukya Upanishad]].{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}} In contrast, according to Frits Staal, a professor of Philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word ''Advaita'' is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage [[Yajnavalkya]] (8th or 7th-century BCE&lt;ref name=benami9&gt;Ben-Ami Scharfstein (1998), ''A comparative history of world philosophy: from the Upanishads to Kant'', Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olivelle7thcen&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|authorlink=Patrick Olivelle|title=Upaniṣads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9-2jV7sRuEC |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-283576-5|page=xxxvi with footnote 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is credited to be the one who coined it.&lt;ref name="Staal2008p365"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC&amp;pg=PA365 |year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|pages=365 note 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the ''Advaita'' containing verse excerpt in ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', as follows:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|

==Darśana (philosophy) - central concerns==
{{See|Hindu philosophy}}

Advaita is a subschool of Vedanta, the latter being one of the six classical Hindu ''darśanas''. It, like nearly all these philosophies,{{refn|group=note|It is not a philosophy in the western meaning of the word, according to Milne.{{Sfn|Milne|1997|p=166}}}} has an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices for what Hinduism considers four proper aims of life: virtue (''[[dharma]]''), material prosperity (''[[artha]]''), desire (''[[kama]]'') and the fourth and final aim being ''[[moksha]]'', the spiritual liberation or release from cycles of rebirth ([[samsara]]).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=73}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|page=26}} Traditional Advaita Vedanta centers on the study of the ''sruti'' especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the [[Brahma Sutras]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=34-37, 211}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=16, 26-27}}

Within the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism are many sub-schools, of which Advaita is one. Unlike Buddhism, but like Jainism, all Vedanta schools consider the existence of Atman (real self, soul) as self-evident.&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref name=7sources/&gt; The Vedanta tradition also posits the concept of [[Brahman]] as the eternal, unchanging metaphysical reality. The sub-schools of Vedanta disagree on the relation between ''Atman'' and ''Brahman''. The Advaita ''darsana'' considers them to be identical.{{sfn|Koller|2006}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=48-52}}

Advaita Vedanta believes that the knowledge of one's true self or Atman is liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Experiential Dimension of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV6GVSQF3SwC |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1058-7|page=27}}, quote: "According to Advaita, the pure subject is our true self whose knowledge is liberative, (...) If the subject could be realised in its purity then all misery would cease: this is called self-knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt; Along with self-knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Experiential Dimension of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV6GVSQF3SwC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1058-7|pages=27, 72–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; it teaches that ''moksha'' can be achieved by the correct understanding of one's true identity as [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]], the dispassionate and unmoveable observer, and the identity of Ātman and [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Koller|2013|pp=100-102}}

The process of acquiring this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, is essentially the same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as ''anubhava'', immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self-knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness ''of Brahman'', but instead an awareness that ''is Brahman'', since one will transcend any form of duality in this state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S. Davis|title=Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism: Deconstructive Modes of Spiritual Inquiry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_kHcG0tspgC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-2068-8|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correct knowledge, which destroys ''avidya'', psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman,&lt;ref name="SUNY Press"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Śaṅkarācārya|author2=Sengaku Mayeda|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-8120827714|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; is obtained through three stages of practice, ''sravana'' (hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}

The Vedanta tradition of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely [[Purusha]] (spirit) and [[Prakriti]] (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the efficient cause of all existence while Prakriti is its material cause.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=19}} Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause, "that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed." What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=18-20}} This Brahman it postulates is ''sat-cit-ananda'' (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for:{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=20-22}} first, how did ''sat'' Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did ''cit'' Brahman create material world? third, if ''ananda'' Brahman is pure bliss, why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=20-22}}

Advaita establishes its truths, in part, from the oldest [[Principal Upanishads]] (''sruti''), the [[Brahma Sutras]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and numerous other Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; Reason is used to support revelation, the ''sruti'', the ultimate source of truth.{{sfn|Koller|2006|p=xi-xii}} Reason clarifies the truth and removes objections, according to the Advaita school, however it believes that pure logic cannot lead to philosophical truths and only experience and meditative insights do. The ''Sruti'', it believes is a collection of experience and meditative insights about liberating knowledge.{{sfn|Koller|2006|p=xii}} The Advaita literature also provide a criticism of opposing systems, including the dualistic school of Hinduism, as well as non-Hindu philosophies such as Buddhism.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=101}}

==Moksha – liberation through knowledge of Brahman==

===Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life===
Advaita, like other schools, accepts Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life as natural and proper:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8-9}}
* [[Dharma]]: the right way to life, the "duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual";{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8}}
* [[Artha]]: the means to support and sustain one's life;
* [[Kāma]]: pleasure and enjoyment;
* [[Mokṣa]]: liberation, release.

Of these, much of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy focuses on the last, gaining liberation in one's current life.&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Dimensions Of Renunciation In Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808256}}, pages 1-5 with footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; The first three are discussed and encouraged by Advaitins, but usually in the context of knowing Brahman and Self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 121-125, 128, 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moksha - liberation===
{{See also|Jnana|Prajna (Vedic)|Mahāvākyas#Prajñānam Brahma|l1=Jnana|l2=Prajna|l3=Prajñānam Brahma}}

The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]],{{refn|group=note|Indian philosophy emphasises that "every acceptable philosophy should aid man in realising the [[Puruṣārtha|Purusarthas]], the chief aims of human life:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8-9}}
* [[Dharma]]: the right way to life, the "duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual";{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8}}
* [[Artha]]: the means to support and sustain one's life;
* [[Kāma]]: pleasure and enjoyment;
* [[Mokṣa]]: liberation, release.}} Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

According to Advaita Vedanta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called ''[[Jivanmukti]]''.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=320}} The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought.{{refn|group=note|The true Self is itself just that pure consciousness, without which nothing can be known in any way.(...) And that same true Self, pure consciousness, is not different from the ultimate world Principle, Brahman&amp;nbsp; (...) Brahman (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;the true Self, pure consciousness) is the only Reality (''sat''), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublimatable.{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6-7}}}} Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman.&lt;ref name=aramb/&gt;&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p30"/&gt;

According to Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that "the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self."&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anantanand Rambachan|title=The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORPkAf3SZBQC&amp;pg=PA109 |year=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6851-7|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jivanmukta====
In Advaita Vedanta, the interest is not in liberation in after life, but in one's current life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=183-184}} This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves this is called a ''[[Jivanmukta]]''.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=320}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], [[:iarchive:philosophyupani00deusgoog|The philosophy of the Upanishads]], Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Jivanmukti'' of Advaita Vedanta contrasts with ''Videhamukti'' (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, after which the liberated individual shows attributes such as:&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' K.N.

* he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him;
* when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;
* even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;
* he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;
* he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;
* he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;
* he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);
* he doesn’t care about or wear sikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

===Vidya, Svādhyāya and Anubhava===
{{main|Svādhyāya}}

''Sruti'' (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (''vidya'') for the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by ''[[svādhyāya]]'',{{sfn|Sivananda|1977|p=viii}} study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: ''sravana'' (perception, hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation),{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John A. Grimes 1996 98–99"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

''Sravana'' literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher ([[guru]]),{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}} wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt; ''Manana'' refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on ''svadhyaya'' and ''sravana''.&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.

Bilimoria|title=Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arvrCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2911-1|pages=299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}}

Adi Shankara uses ''anubhava'' interchangeably with ''pratipatta'', "understanding".{{sfn|Hirst|2005|p=68}} Dalal and others state that ''anubhava'' does not center around some sort of "mystical experience," but around the correct knowledge of Brahman.{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14}} Nikhalananda states that (knowledge of) ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'' can only be reached by ''[[buddhi]]'', "reason,"{{sfn|Nikhalananda|1931|p=viii}} stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while ''buddhi'' is the highest means of attaining knowledge.{{sfn|Nikhalananda|1931|p=viii-ix}}

===Mahavakya – The Great Sentences===
{{Main|Mahāvākyas}}

Several ''Mahavakyas'', or "the great sentences", have Advaitic theme, that is "the inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are one and the same".{{sfn|Braue|1984|p=81}}

===Stages and practices===
Advaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature,{{refn|group=note|Puligandla: "Any philosophy worthy of its title should not be a mere intellectual exercise but should have practical application in enabling man to live an enlightened life. A philosophy which makes no difference to the quality and style of our life is no philosophy, but an empty intellectual construction."{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=11}}}} but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's [[Upadesasahasri]]{{sfn|Mayeda|2006}} and the [[Vivekachudamani]], which is also attributed to Shankara.

====Jnana Yoga – path of practice====
{{Main|Jnana Yoga}}

Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|pp=104-105}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=125-142}} It consists of fourfold qualities,&lt;ref name=maharaj82/&gt; or behavioral qualifications (''Samanyasa'', ''Sampattis'', ''sādhana-catustaya''):{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref name=davis38&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S.

Correct knowledge, which destroys ''avidya'', psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman,&lt;ref name="SUNY Press"/&gt; is obtained in ''jnanayoga'' through three stages of practice,&lt;ref name=davis38/&gt; ''sravana'' (hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'':&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John A.

* ''Sravana'', listening to the teachings of the sages on the [[Upanishads]] and Advaita Vedanta, studying the Vedantic texts, such as the [[Brahma Sutras]], and discussions with the [[guru]] (teacher, counsellor);{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}}{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}

====Samadhi====
While Shankara emphasized [[Shravana (hearing)|sravana]] ("hearing"), [[Manana (reflection)|manana]] ("reflection") and [[nididhyasana]] ("repeated meditation"), later texts like the ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka]]'' (14th century) and ''[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)]]'' (15th century) added [[samadhi]] as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda.

====Guru====
{{Main|Guru}}

Advaita Vedanta school has traditionally had a high reverence for Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality. However, the Guru is not mandatory in Advaita school, states Clooney, but reading of Vedic literature and followed by reflection is.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=182}} Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words "such as ''Sastracaryopadesa'' (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and ''Vedantacaryopadesa'' (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru".{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=182}} This reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization.{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=182-183}}

A guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the ''guru'' serving as a "counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student.&lt;ref name=joelmlecko33&gt;Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 33-61&lt;/ref&gt; The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a "counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life."&lt;ref name=joelmlecko33/&gt;

==Ontology - the nature of Being==
{{See also|Metaphysics|Ontology}}

[[File:SwansCygnus olor.jpg|right|thumb|The swan is an important motif in Advaita. It symbolises two things: first, the swan is called ''hamsah'' in Sanskrit (which becomes ''hamso'' if the first letter in the next word is /h/). Upon repeating this ''hamso'' indefinitely, it becomes ''so-aham'', meaning, "I am That". Second, just as a swan lives in a lake but its feathers are not soiled by water, similarly a liberated Advaitin lives in this world but is not soiled by its [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].]]

===Levels of Reality, Truths===
{{See also|Two truths doctrine}}
The classical Advaita Vedanta explains all reality and everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, and there is no dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-03946-6|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality,{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=174-178}} the theory of two truths,{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|pp=171–172, 191}} and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (''anirvacaniya khyati'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0982-6|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt;

Shankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=174-178}}{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=246-247}}
* ''{{IAST|Pāramārthika}}'' (''paramartha'', absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This reality is the highest, it can't be sublated (assimilated) by any other.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=176-178}}
* ''{{IAST|Vyāvahārika}}'' (''vyavahara''), or ''samvriti-saya'',{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} consisting of the empirical or pragmatical reality. It is ever changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true but this is incomplete reality and is sublatable.{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=176-178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley J. Malkovsky|title= The Role of Divine Grace in the Soteriology of Śaṃkarācārya|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fDA9HMjeRIgC |year=2001| publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12044-0|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}}'' (''pratibhasika'', apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. Well-known examples of ''pratibhasika'' is the imaginary reality such as the "roaring of a lion" fabricated in dreams during one's sleep, and the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=176-178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Advaita Vedanta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions.&lt;ref name="Grimes2004p31"/&gt; It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This "absolute and relative truths" explanation, Advaitins call as the "two truths" doctrine.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|pp=171–172, 191}}&lt;ref name="Grimes2004p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.R.V. Murti|title=Studies in Indian Thought: Collected Papers of Prof. T. R. V.

From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not "all is light", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedanta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives.&lt;ref name="Grimes2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Grimes|title=The Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śaṅkarācārya Bhagavatpāda: An Introduction and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCEX083AJA4C&amp;pg=PA31| year=2004|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-2039-5|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= John Grimes|title= Problems and Perspectives in Religious Discourse: Advaita Vedanta Implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySff1LxPHp8C |year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1791-1|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three states of consciousness and Turiya===
{{See also|Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|Kosha}}

Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2004), ''Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedånta'', State University of New York Press, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, pages 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; and correspond to the [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|Three Bodies Doctrine]]:{{sfn|Wilber|2000|p=132}}
# The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world.&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15&gt;Arvind Sharma (2004), ''Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedånta'', State University of New York Press, pages 15-40, 49-72&lt;/ref&gt; This is the gross body.
# The second state is the dreaming mind. This is the [[subtle body]].&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15/&gt;
# The third state is the state of deep sleep. This is the [[causal body]].&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15/&gt;

Advaita also posits the fourth state of [[Turiya]], which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness.&lt;ref group=web name=rm&gt;[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/tw/tw617.html  {{cite book|author=Ramana Maharshi|title=States of Consciousness}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=sc1&gt;[http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/summits_of_god-life {{cite book|author=Sri Chinmoy|title=Summits of God-Life}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (''ananta'') and non-different (''advaita/abheda''), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which [[ajativada]], non-origination, is apprehended.{{sfn|King|1995|p=300 note 140}} According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|pp=122, 137}} Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the ''Jivanmukta''.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|pp=126, 146}}{{Sfn|Comans|2000|pp=128-131, 5-8, 30-37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|2000|pp=106–108}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

====Identity of Atman and Brahman====
According to Advaita Vedanta, Atman is identical to Brahman.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=12}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=49}} This is expressed in the ''mahavakya'' "''tat tvam asi''", "thou are that." There is "a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman."{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=49}} Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite.{{sfn|Potter|2008a|p=510-512}} According to Shankara, Atman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=14}}

Moksha is attained by realizing the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans |2000 |p=183 }} This is frequently stated by Advaita scholars, such as Shankara, as:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.

===Empirical reality - illusion and ignorance===
According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the sole reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an important question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (constantly changing reality) and ''avidya'' ("ignorance"). Other than ''Brahman'', everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore [[maya (illusion)|maya]]. Brahman is ''Paramarthika Satyam'', "Absolute Truth",{{sfn|Venkatramaiah|2000|p=xxxii}} and "the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (''sat''), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable".{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6-7}}

====Causality====
{{Main|Cause and effect in Advaita Vedanta}}

All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''[[Satkaryavada|Satkāryavāda]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The ''Brahma Sutras'', the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda" /&gt; support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}

Scholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita system explained causality through ''vivarta''.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of ''parinama-vada'', the competing causality theory is ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says "the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (''vivarta'') of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} "Although the world can be described as conventionally real", adds Nicholson, "the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated".&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate ''Vivartavada'', and his explanations are "remote from any connotation of illusion". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to ''Vivarta'', and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position.{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hugh Nicholson, "the definitive study on the development of the concept of ''vivarta'' in Indian philosophy, and in Advaita Vedanta in particular, remains Hacker's ''Vivarta''.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 20, 167-170}} To Shankara, the word ''maya'' has hardly any terminological weight.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 21}}}} Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the ''vivarta-vada'' isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to ''parinama-vada'', and the ''vivarta'' explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from "the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=40-43}}

====''{{IAST|Māyā}}'' (illusion)====
{{Main|Maya (illusion)}}

The doctrine of Maya is used to explain the empirical reality in Advaita.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|and other sub-schools of Vedanta with the concept of Maya.&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;}} Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is not what it appears to be".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] or divisional plurality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic F Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3, pages 388, 397 and note 11&lt;/ref&gt; The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual Reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as [[Brahman]]. This theory of māyā was expounded and explained by [[Adi Shankara]]. Competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, ''A History of Indian Philosophy.'' Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, "Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta" in Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic." Routledge, 1995, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, "Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidyā: A Problem of Truth and Reality, {{oclc|658823}}, pages 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth in Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp=19-40, 53-58, 79-86}}&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D. Fowler|title=Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlB4v85S1EC |year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-94-3|pages=30–31, 260–264}}, Quote: (p. 30) – "As a philosophical and metaphysical term it [monism] refers to the acceptance of one single, ultimate, principle as the basis of the cosmos, the unity and oneness of all reality (...) [monism] has a model par excellence in that put forward by the eighth-century Indian philosopher Shankara, who is associated with the school of thought of Advaita Vedanta. (p. 263) – "In Shankara's words: 'the notions oneself and one's own are indeed falsely constructed (upon Atman) through nescience. When there is (the knowledge of) the oneness of Atman, these notions certainly do not exist. If the seed does not exist, whence shall the fruit arise?".&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Avidya'' (ignorance)====
Due to ignorance ({{IAST|avidyā}}), Brahman is perceived as the material world and its objects (nama rupa vikara). According to Shankara, Brahman is in reality [[Nirguna Brahman|attributeless and formless]]. Brahman, the highest truth and all (Reality), does not really change; it is only our ignorance that gives the appearance of change. Also due to {{IAST|avidyā}}, the true identity is forgotten, and material reality, which manifests at various levels, is mistaken as the only and true reality.

The notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedanta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Stephen|title=Vidyā and Avidyā: Simultaneous and Coterminous?: A Holographic Model to Illuminate the Advaita Debate|journal=Philosophy East and West |date=April 2007 |volume=57 |issue=2|series=2 |pages=178–203 |jstor=4488090 |doi=10.1353/pew.2007.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of [[Adi Shankara]]'s Upadesasahasri:
{{quote|Certainly the most crucial problem which Sankara left for his followers is that of avidyā. If the concept is logically analysed, it would lead the Vedanta philosophy toward dualism or nihilism and uproot its fundamental position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayeda|first=Sengaku|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara|year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance of this Universal Self, see their "I-ness" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="Adi Sankara pages 173-214"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Advaitins gave somewhat various explanations, from which various Advaita schools arose.

==Epistemology - ways of knowing==
{{See also|Pramana|Epistemology}}

The ancient and medieval texts of Advaita Vedanta and other schools of Hindu philosophy discuss '' Pramana'' ([[epistemology]]). The theory of Pramana discusses questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref name=kp&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedānta,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=228}} accepts the following six kinds of {{IAST|pramāṇas}}:{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}{{sfn|Datta|1932|pp=221-253}}
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (प्रत्यक्षाय) - perception
# ''Anumāṇa'' (अनुमान) - inference
# ''Upamāṇa'' (उपमान) - comparison, analogy
# ''Arthāpatti'' (अर्थापत्ति) - postulation, derivation from circumstances&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt;

# ''Śabda'' (शब्द) - relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;

===''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)===
''Pratyakṣa'' (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception, is of two types: external - that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal - perception of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anumāṇa'' (inference)===
''Anumāṇa'' (अनुमान), inference, is defined as applying reason to reach a new conclusion about truth from one or more observations and previous understanding of truths.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''. This epistemological method for gaining knowledge consists of three parts: 1) ''Pratijna'' (hypothesis), 2) ''Hetu'' (a reason), and 3) ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts: 1) ''Sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and 2) ''Paksha'' (the object on which the ''Sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''Sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''Vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies further demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Upamāṇa'' (comparison, analogy)===
''Upamāṇa'' (उपमान), comparison, analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arthāpatti'' (postulation)===
''Arthāpatti'' (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramana'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''Pramana'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.

===''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)===
''Anupalabdi'' (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.{{sfn|Datta|1932|pp=221-253}}&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; A variation of ''Anupaladbi'', called Abhava (अभाव) has also been posited as an epistemic method. It means non-existence. Some scholars consider ''Anupalabdi'' to be same as ''Abhava'',&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt; while others consider ''Anupalabdi'' and ''Abhava'' as different.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic — Abhāva versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 155-174, 227-255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava-pramana'' has been discussed in Advaita in the context of ''[[Padārtha]]'' (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A ''Padartha'' is defined as that which is simultaneously ''Astitva'' (existent), ''Jneyatva'' (knowable) and ''Abhidheyatva'' (nameable).&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; ''Abhava'' was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: ''dhvamsa'' (termination of what existed), ''atyanta-abhava'' (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), ''anyonya-abhava'' (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and ''pragavasa'' (prior, antecedent non-existence).{{sfn|Datta|1932|pp=221-253}}&lt;ref name=chba&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), ''Padartha'', in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, {{ISBN|81-260-1221-8}}, page 3958&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between Advaita and other schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P.

==Ethics==
Some claim, states Deutsch, "that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=99}} However, adds Deutsch, ethics ''does'' have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers "an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bauer | first=Nancy F. | title=Advaita Vedanta and Contemporary Western Ethics | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | volume=37 | issue=1 | year=1987 | pages=36–50 | doi=10.2307/1399082 | jstor=1399082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, there cannot be "any absolute moral laws, principles or duties", instead in its axiological view Atman is "beyond good and evil", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of "distinctionless Oneness" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=100}} Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own soul and another being's, good and just [[Karma]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=101-102 with footnotes}}

The values and ethics in Advaita Vedanta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that "the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self."&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"/&gt; Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to "a deeper identity and affinity with all". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens "the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness".&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"/&gt; These ideas are exemplified in the [[Isha Upanishad]] – a ''sruti'' for Advaita, as follows:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
One who sees all beings in the self alone, and the self of all beings,
feels no hatred by virtue of that understanding.
For the seer of oneness, who knows all beings to be the self,
where is delusion and sorrow?
&lt;/poem&gt;

Adi Shankara, a leading proponent of Advaita, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his ''Upadeśasāhasrī'', asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of [[Yamas]] (ethical precepts) such as [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), [[Satya]] (truth, abstinence from falsehood), [[Asteya]] (abstinence from theft), [[Aparigraha]] (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=88–89}} Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=92}} however, Shankara discourages ritual worship and oblations to ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'' (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The "doctrine of difference" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, "he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 16-17; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, in verses 1.26-1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any ''Bheda'' (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 17-19; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29/&gt;

{{Quote|One, who is eager to realize this highest truth spoken of in the Sruti, should rise above the fivefold form of desire: for a son, for wealth, for this world and the next, and are the outcome of a false reference to the Self of Varna (castes, colors, classes) and orders of life. These references are contradictory to right knowledge, and reasons are given by the Srutis regarding the prohibition of the acceptance of difference. For when the knowledge that the one non-dual Atman (Self) is beyond phenomenal existence is generated by the scriptures and reasoning, there cannot exist a knowledge side by side that is contradictory or contrary to it.

== Texts ==
The [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Brahma Sutras]] are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'' and their changeless nature.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35}}

Adi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. [[Adi Shankara]]'s ''[[Bhashya]]'' (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=221, 680}} The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries.

=== ''Prasthanatrayi'' ===
The ''Vedanta'' tradition provides exegeses of the ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavadgita]]'', collectively called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]'', literally, ''three sources''.{{sfn|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35}}

# '''The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', or ''Nyaya prasthana'' / ''Yukti prasthana'''''; considered the reason-based foundation of ''Vedanta''. The ''Brahma Sutras'' attempted to synthesize the teachings of the ''Upanishads''.  The diversity in the teachings of the ''Upanishads'' necessitated the systematization of these teachings. The only extant version of this synthesis is the ''Brahma Sutras'' of ''[[Badarayana]]''. Like the ''Upanishads'', ''Brahma Sutras'' is also an aphoristic text, and can be interpreted as a non-theistic ''Advaita Vedanta'' text or as a theistic ''Dvaita Vedanta'' text. This has led, states Stephen Phillips, to its varying interpretations by scholars of various sub-schools of ''Vedanta''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1998), ''Classical Indian Metaphysics'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, page&amp;nbsp;332 note&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmasutra'' is considered by the Advaita school as the ''Nyaya Prasthana'' (canonical base for reasoning).{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}}

===Textual authority===
The identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'', and their unchanging, eternal nature,{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100}} are basic truths in Advaita Vedanta. The school considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its ''karma-kanda'' (ritual injunctions).{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}} The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman and Brahman are found in the [[Upanishads]], which Advaita Vedanta has regarded as "errorless revealed truth."{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}} Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}

Advaita Vedanta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an [[epistemic]] premise that [[Śruti]] (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439"&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248&lt;/ref&gt; The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-1867-6}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.

The possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 17-19, 22-34&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=35-36, 77, 210-212}} The [[Brahmasutra]] (also called Vedanta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining [[pramana]]s.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17/&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}} This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the [[Brahmasutra]] as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayeda |first=Sengaku |year=2006 |title=A thousand teachings : the Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2771-4 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhagavad Gita, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara.&lt;ref name="rambachanepis"/&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=35-36, 77, 210-212}}

==History of Advaita Vedanta==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)|thumb|240px]]
Advaita Vedanta existed prior to Adi Shankara but found in him its most influential expounder.{{sfn|Grimes|1990|p=7}}

===Pre-Shankara Advaita Vedanta===
Of the Vedanta-school before the composition of the [[Brahma Sutras]] (400–450 CE{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}), wrote Nakamura in 1950, almost nothing is known.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} The two Advaita writings of pre-Shankara period, known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, were the ''Vākyapadīya'', written by [[Bhartṛhari]] (second half 5th century{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=426}}), and the ''Māndūkya-kārikā'' written by [[Gaudapada]] (7th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

Scholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17-18}}&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H Phillips (1995), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0812692983}}, page 332 with note 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791436967}}, pages 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=x-xi, 8-18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joachim F|last=Sprockhoff|year=1976|title=Samnyasa: Quellenstudien zur Askese im Hinduismus|publisher=Wiesbaden: Kommissionsverlag Franz Steiner|language=German| isbn=978-3515019057|pages=277–294, 319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient texts may be, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early 1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17-18}}

====Earliest Vedanta - ''Upanishads'' and ''Brahma Sutras''====
{{Main|Brahma Sutras}}
{{See also|Vedas|Upanishads|Darsanas}}

The Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedanta gives an interpretation.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=95-96}} The Upanishads do not contain "a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments".{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, Balasubramanian argues that since the basic ideas of the Vedanta systems are derived from the Vedas, the Vedantic philosophy is as old as the Vedas.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxix}}}} This philosophical inquiry was performed by the [[darsanas]], the various philosophical schools.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx–xxxi}}{{refn|group=note|Deutsch and Dalvi point out that, in the Indian context, texts "are only part of a tradition which is preserved in its purest form in the oral transmission as it has been going on".{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=95}}}}

====Bādarāyana's Brahma Sutras====
The Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the ''Vedanta Sutra'',{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxii}} were compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=436}} but "the great part of the ''Sutra'' must have been in existence much earlier than that".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=436}} Estimates of the date of Bādarāyana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE.{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=4}}

The Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads. It was and is a guide-book for the great teachers of the Vedantic systems.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxii}} Bādarāyana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}} He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him:{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}
{{quote|From the way in which Bādarāyana cites the views of others it is obvious that the teachings of the Upanishads must have been analyzed and interpreted by quite a few before him and that his systematization of them in 555 sutras arranged in four chapters must have been the last attempt, most probably the best.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}}}

====Between Brahma Sutras and Shankara====
According to Nakamura, "there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period, but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/pre-sankara.html advaita-deanta.org, ''Advaita Vedanta before Sankaracarya'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Vedanta philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

The names of various important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the ''Siddhitraya'' by Yamunācārya (c.1050), the ''Vedārthasamgraha'' by Rāmānuja (c.1050–1157), and the ''Yatīndramatadīpikā'' by Śrīnivāsa-dāsa.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} Combined together,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} at least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahman Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Bhartŗhari (c.450–500), Upavarsa (c.450–500), Bodhāyana (c.500), Tanka (Brahmānandin) (c.500–550), Dravida (c.550), Bhartŗprapañca (c.550), Śabarasvāmin (c.550), Bhartŗmitra (c.550–600), Śrivatsānka (c.600), Sundarapāndya (c.600), Brahmadatta (c.600–700), Gaudapada (c.640–690), Govinda (c.670–720), Mandanamiśra (c.670–750).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

Although Shankara is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedanta school, according to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of these early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought "were advocated by someone before Śankara".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} Shankara "was the person who synthesized the ''Advaita-vāda'' which had previously existed before him".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} In this synthesis, he was the rejuvenator and defender of ancient learning.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} He was an unequalled commentator,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} due to whose efforts and contributions the Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}}

===Gaudapada and ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}''===
{{Main|Gaudapada}}
[[File:Shri Gaudapadacharya Statue.jpg|thumb|240px|Statue of [[Gaudapada]].]]
Gaudapada (6th century){{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} was the teacher of [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]] and the grandteacher of Shankara. [[Gaudapada]] uses the concepts of [[Ajativada]] and [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=27-33}} to establish "that from the level of ultimate truth the world is a cosmic illusion,"{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=94}} and "suggests that the whole of our waking experience is exactly the same as an illusory and insubstantial dream."{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=157}}  In contrast, [[Adi Shankara]] insists upon a distinction between waking experience and dreams.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=157}}

====Mandukya Karika====
Gaudapada wrote or compiled{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=308}} the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'', also known as the ''{{IAST|Gauḍapāda Kārikā}}'' or the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=280}} The ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' is a commentary in verse form on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', one of the shortest [[Upanishads]] consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedanta, the oldest surviving complete text is the ''Māṇḍukya Kārikā''.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=239}} Many other texts with same type of teachings and which were older than ''Māṇḍukya Kārikā'' existed and this is unquestionable because other scholars and their views are cited by Gaudapada, Shankara and Anandagiri, according to Hajime Nakamura.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=211-213}} Gaudapada relied particularly on ''Mandukya Upanishad'', as well as ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]]'' and ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]s''.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=239}}

The ''Mandukya Upanishad'' was considered to be a [[Śruti]] before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=280}} In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire ''Karika'' became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=280-281}}{{refn|group=note|Nakamura notes that there are contradictions in doctrine between the four chapters.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=308}} According to Murti, the conclusion from ''Mandukya Karika'' is irresistible that Gaudapada is attempting an advaitic interpretation of Vedanta school of Hinduism in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. The first three chapters of the ''Karika'' are founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; Chapter Four is unlike the first three, and shows Buddhist terms and influence.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; Further, according to Murti, and Richard King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four of ''Karika'', they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;}}

===Adi Shankara===
{{Main|Adi Shankara}}

Adi Shankara (788–820), also known as {{IAST|Śaṅkara Bhagavatpādācārya}} and {{IAST|Ādi Śaṅkarācārya}}, represents a turning point in the development of Vedanta.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} After the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedanta, culminating in the works of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} Using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita [[Vedanta]] in the 8th century CE, though the school was founded many centuries earlier by [[Badarayana]].&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt; His thematic focus extended beyond [[metaphysics]] and [[soteriology]], and he laid a strong emphasis on ''[[Pramanas]]'', that is [[epistemology]] or "means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rambachan, for example, summarizes the widely held view on one aspect of Shankara's epistemology before critiquing it as follows,
{{quote|According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary.&lt;ref name=rambachanepis/&gt;}}

Sengaku Mayeda concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (''vastutantra''), and considered subjective opinions (''purushatantra'') and injunctions in Śruti (''codanatantra'') as secondary.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}} Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (''pramana-janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}}&lt;ref&gt;Karl H Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-61486-1}}, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarked that the ''Anvaya'' (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the ''Samanvayat Tatparya Linga'', that is six characteristics of the text under consideration:

While this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called ''Anvaya-Vyatireka'', which states that for proper understanding one must "accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics" and "exclude meanings that are incompatible with any".&lt;ref&gt;Mayeda &amp; Tanizawa (1991), Studies on Indian Philosophy in Japan, 1963–1987, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 41, No. 4, pages 529–535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (1996), Śankara and the Prasankhyanavada, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 24, No. 1, pages 49–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Hacker and Phillips note that this insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is "doubtlessly the suggestion" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (2000) in Roy W. Perrett (Editor), Epistemology: Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3609-9}}, pages 224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63&lt;/ref&gt; Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using ''[[pranama]]s'' (epistemology), reason and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Merrell-Wolff (1995), Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2675-3}}, pages 242–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant (1976), Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-671-54800-1}}, Chapter XIX, Section VI&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical context====
{{See also|History of India#Late Middle Kingdoms – The Late-Classical Age|l1=Late-Classical Age|History of Hinduism#Middle Ages|l2=Hinduism Middle Ages}}

Shankara lived in the time of the so-called "Late classical Hinduism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} which lasted from 650 to 1100{{nbsp}}CE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} This era was one of political instability that followed [[Gupta dynasty]] and King Harsha of the 7th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}CE.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2&gt;John Koller (2012), ''Shankara in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion'' (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-78294-4}}, pages 99–108&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time of social and cultural change as the ideas of Buddhism, Jainism, and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members.&lt;ref&gt;TMP Mahadevan (1968), ''Shankaracharya'', National Book Trust, pages 283–285, {{oclc|254278306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frankwhaling&gt;Frank Whaling (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23440361 Sankara and Buddhism], Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol.{{nbsp}}7, No.{{nbsp}}1, pages 1–42&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in particular influenced India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1998), ''Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta up to Śaṃkara and his pupils'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0310-7}}, pages 1–21, 103–119&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara and his contemporaries made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions; they then transformed the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important tradition for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2/&gt;

====Writings====
{{Main|Adi Shankara bibliography}}

Adi Shankara is best known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (''Bhasyas'') on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' (literally, commentary on [[Brahma Sutra]]), a fundamental text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}} His commentaries on ten [[Mukhya Upanishads|Mukhya]] (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}&lt;ref name=paulhacker30&gt;Paul Hacker, Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pages 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita (part of his [[Prasthana Trayi]] Bhasya).&lt;ref name=rambachanepis&gt;A Rambachan (1991), Accomplishing the Accomplished: Vedas as a Source of Valid Knowledge in Sankara, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8248-1358-1}}, pages xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Shankara's ''Vivarana'' (tertiary notes) on the commentary by Vedavyasa on [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]] as well as those on Apastamba Dharma-sũtras (''Adhyatama-patala-bhasya'') are accepted by scholars as authentic works of Adi Shankara.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}&lt;ref name=halbfassyoga/&gt; Among the ''Stotra'' (poetic works), the Daksinamurti Stotra, Bhajagovinda Stotra, Sivanandalahari, Carpata-panjarika, Visnu-satpadi, Harimide, Dasa-shloki, and Krishna-staka are likely to be authentic.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=351–352}} He also authored [[Upadesasahasri]], his most important original philosophical work.&lt;ref name=johnkoller&gt;John Koller (2007), in Chad Meister and Paul Copan (Editors): ''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-134-18001-1}}, pages 98–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halbfassyoga&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1990), ''Tradition and Reflection: Explorations in Indian Thought'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0362-4}}, pages 205–208&lt;/ref&gt; Of other original ''Prakaranas'' (प्रकरण, monographs, treatise), 76 works are attributed to Adi Shankara. Modern era Indian scholars Belvalkar and Upadhyaya accept five and thirty nine works, respectively, as authentic.{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=113–115}}

Several commentaries on Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads have been attributed to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful.&lt;ref name=paulhacker30/&gt;{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}} Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholars&lt;ref name=paulhackeraupr&gt;Paul Hacker, 'Sankaracarya and Sankarabhagavatpada: Preliminary Remarks Concerning the Authorship Problem', in ''Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta'' (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pp. 41–56&lt;/ref&gt; as his works, and are likely works of later Advaita Vedanta scholars; these include the Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, and Gopalatapaniya Upanishad.{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}}

The authenticity of Shankara being the author of {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}&lt;ref&gt;Adi Shankaracharya, [https://archive.org/stream/vivekachudamanio00sankrich#page/n3/mode/2up Vivekacūḍāmaṇi] S Madhavananda (Translator), Advaita Ashrama (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; has been questioned, and "modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara."&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes (2004), ''The Vivekacudamani of Sankaracarya Bhagavatpada: An Introduction and Translation'', Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3395-2}}, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of Shankara of his [[Mandukya Upanishad]] ''Bhasya'' and his supplementary commentary on Gaudapada's ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' has been disputed by Nakamura.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=262-265}} However, other scholars state that the commentary on Mandukya, which is actually a commentary on Madukya-Karikas by [[Gaudapada]], may be authentic.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}}

====Influence of Shankara====
Shankara's status in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta is unparallelled. He travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Per Durst-Andersen and Elsebeth F. Lange (2010), ''Mentality and Thought: North, South, East and West'', CBS Press, {{ISBN|978-87-630-0231-8}}, page{{nbsp}}68&lt;/ref&gt; His teachings and [[sampradaya|tradition]] form the basis of [[Smartism]] and have influenced [[Sant Mat]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ron Geaves|date=March 2002|title=From Totapuri to Maharaji: Reflections on a Lineage (Parampara)|publisher=27th Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the {{IAST|[[panchayatana puja|Pañcāyatana]]}} form of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]], the simultaneous worship of five deities{{snd}}Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi. Shankara explained that all deities were but different forms of the one [[Brahman]], the invisible Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), ''A Survey of Hinduism'', Third Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, page{{nbsp}}40&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely [[Jivatma|Atman]] and [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benedict Ashley, O.P.|title=The Way toward Wisdom|isbn=0-268-02028-0|oclc=609421317|page=395|authorlink=Benedict Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaeva states that Shankara's influence extended to reforming Hinduism, founding monasteries, edifying disciples, disputing opponents, and engaging in philosophic activity that, in the eyes of Indian tradition, helped revive "the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings" and Vedanta thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|oclc=24953669|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;lpg=PP1|author=N. V. Isaeva|year=1992|page=2|isbn=978-0-7914-1281-7|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars doubt Shankara's early influence in India.&lt;ref name=paulhacker29&gt;Paul Hacker, ''Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta'' (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pages{{nbsp}}29–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Mandana-Misra]], who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita.{{sfn|King|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=33–34}} Other scholars state that the historical records for this period are unclear, and little reliable information is known about the various contemporaries and disciples of Shankara.&lt;ref name=karlpottermms&gt;Karl Potter (2008), ''Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta up to Śaṃkara and his pupils'', Vol{{nbsp}}3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0310-7}}, pages{{nbsp}}346–347, 420–423, Quote: "There is little firm historical information about Suresvara; tradition holds Suresvara is same as Mandanamisra."&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of the Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India.&lt;ref name=paulhacker29/&gt;&lt;ref name=blakemichael&gt;R. Blake Michael (1992), The Origins of Vīraśaiva Sects, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0776-1}}, pages{{nbsp}}60–62 with notes{{nbsp}}6, 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after the 14th century, such as the widely cited Vidyaranya's Śankara-vijaya. [[Vidyaranya]], also known as Madhava, who was the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386,&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Mādhava Āchārya".

Vidyaranya was a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support,&lt;ref name=talbot/&gt; and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedanta philosophies, and establish monasteries (''mathas'') to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=paulhacker29/&gt;

===Post-Shankara - early medieaval times===

====Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra====
{{Main|Sureśvara|Maṇḍana Miśra}}

Sureśvara (fl. 800-900 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}} and Maṇḍana Miśra were contemporaries of Shankara, Sureśvara often (incorrectly) being identified with Maṇḍana Miśra.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=29}} Both explained Sankara "on the basis of their personal convictions".{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=29}} Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}}

Maṇḍana Miśra was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of [[Kumarila]], but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the ''Brahma-siddhi''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |year=1993|publisher =Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0982-6|pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, Maṇḍana Miśra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate, after which he became a follower of Shankara.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}} Yet, his attitude toward Shankara was that of a "self-confident rival teacher of Advaita",{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=291}} and his influence was such that some regard the ''Brahma-siddhi'' to have "set forth a non-Shankaran brand of Advaita""{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}} The "theory of error" set forth in this work became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=32}} It was Vachaspati Misra's commentary on this work that linked it to Shankara's teaching.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} His influential thesis in the Advaita tradition has been that errors are opportunities because they "lead to truth", and full correct knowledge requires that not only should one understand the truth but also examine and understand errors as well as what is not truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |year=1993|publisher =Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0982-6|pages=101–109, 51–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra had different views on various doctrinal points:{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}}
* The locus of ''avidya'':{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}} according to Maṇḍana Miśra, the individual ''jiva'' is the locus of ''avidya'', whereas Suresvara contends that the ''avidya'' regarding Brahman is located in Brahman.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}} These two different stances are also reflected in the opposing positions of the Bhamati school and the Vivarana school.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}}
* Liberation: according to Maṇḍana Miśra, the knowledge that arises from the Mahavakya is insufficient for liberation. Only the direct realization of Brahma is liberating, which can only be attained by meditation.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290-291}} According to Suresvara, this knowledge is directly liberating, while meditation is at best a useful aid.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=291}}{{refn|group=note|According to both Roodurum and Isaeva, Sureśvara stated that mere knowledge of the identity of Jiva and Brahman is not enough for liberation, which requires prolonged meditation on this identity.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=241}}}}

====Advaita Vedanta sub-schools====
After Shankara's death, several sub-schools developed. Two of them still exist today, the [[Bhāmatī]] and the [[Vivarana]].&lt;ref group=web name =BhamatiVivarana&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/bhavir.html THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} Two defunct schools are the ''Pancapadika'' and ''Istasiddhi'', which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of [[Maya (illusion)|māyā]] and [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]].&lt;ref group=web name =BhamatiVivarana /&gt;

=====Padmapada - Pancapadika school=====
[[Padmapada]] (c. 800 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=38}} was a direct disciple of Shankara who wrote the ''Pancapadika'', a commentary on the ''Sankara-bhaya''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=38}} Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of ''avidya'', designating ''prakrti'' as ''avidya'' or ''ajnana''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=39}}

=====Vachaspati Misra – Bhamati school=====
{{Main|Bhamati|Vācaspati Miśra}}

Vachaspati Misra (800–900 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=34}} wrote the ''Brahmatattva-samiksa'', a commentary on Maṇḍana Miśra's ''Brahma-siddhi'', which provides the link between Mandana Misra and Shankara{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} and attempts to harmonise Shankara's thought with that of [[Mandana Misra]].&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt; According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Misra "to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati".{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=34}} Only two works are known of Vachaspati Misra, the ''Brahmatattva-samiksa'' on Maṇḍana Miśra's ''Brahma-siddhi'', and his ''Bhamati'' on the ''Sankara-bhasya'', Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-sutras.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} The name of the Bhamati sub-school is derived from this ''Bhamati''.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/bhavir.html THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the [[Jiva]] as the source of avidya.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt; It sees meditation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=37}}

=====Prakasatman - Vivarana school=====
{{Main|Vivarana}}

Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}} wrote the ''Pancapadika-Vivarana'', a commentary on the ''Pancapadika'' by [[Padmapadacharya]].{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}} The ''Vivarana'' lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmum, "[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition."{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

The Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of ''mulavidya'' or ''maya'' as being of "positive beginningless nature",{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=41}} and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt;

=====Vimuktatman - Ista-Siddhi=====
Vimuktatman (c. 1200 CE){{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198}} wrote the ''Ista-siddhi''.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198}} It is one of the four traditional ''siddhi'', together with Mandana's ''Brahma-siddhi'', Suresvara's ''Naiskarmya-siddhi'', and Madusudana's ''Advaita-siddhi''.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198-199}} According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is "pure intuitive consciousness".{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=199}} His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

===Late medieaval times - "Greater Advaita Vedanta" (Islamic rule of India)===
Michael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but "scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedanta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period."{{sfn|Allen|Venkatkrishnan|2017}}

====Prominent teachers====
{{See also|Dashanami Sampradaya|List of teachers of Advaita Vedanta}}

According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in the later Advaita tradition are:&lt;ref group=web name="Menon"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Sangeetha Menon (2007), ''Advaita Vedānta'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prakāsātman, Vimuktātman, Sarvajñātman (10th century)(see above)
* Śrī Harṣa, Citsukha (12th century)
* ānandagiri, [[Amalananda|Amalānandā]] (13th century)
* Vidyāraņya, Śaṅkarānandā (14th century)
* Sadānandā (15th century)
* Prakāṣānanda, Nṛsiṁhāśrama (16th century)
* Madhusūdhana Sarasvati, Dharmarāja Advarindra, Appaya Dīkśita (17th century)

====Influence of yogic tradition====
While Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an "orthodox" Advaita Vedanta, the living Advaita Vedanta tradition in medieaval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' and the ''Bhagavata Purana''.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=4-5}} The ''Yoga Vasistha'' became an authoritative surce text in the Advaita vedanta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidyāraņya's ''Jivanmuktiviveka'' (14th century) was influenced by the ''(Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha'', which in turn was influenced by [[Kashmir Shaivism]].{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=4}} Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on ''nirvikalpa samadhi'' was preceded by medieaval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In thee 16th and 17th centuries, some [[Nath]] and [[hatha yoga]] texts also came within the scope of the Advaita vedanta tradition.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=5}}

====Development of central position====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta}}

=====Highest Indian philosophy=====
Already in medieval times, Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as the highest of the Indian religious philosophies,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} a development which was reinforced in modern times due to western interest in Advaita Vedanta, and the subsequent influence on western perceptions on Indian perceptions of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|2002|p=119-133}}

In contrast, King states that its present position was a response of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing "Hindu inferiority complex" during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=136-138}} The "humanistic, inclusivist" formulation, now called Neo-Vedanta, attempted to respond to this colonial stereotyping of "Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West", states King. Advaita Vedanta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Vedanta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the [[Buddha]] a part of the Vedanta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo-Vedanta developed as a reaction to western [[Orientalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].{{sfn|King|2002|pp=136-138, 141-142}} With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulation of Advaita Vedanta has "become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

=====Unifying Hinduism=====
{{main|Unifying Hinduism}}

Advaita Vedanta came to occupy a central position in the classification of various Hindu traditions. To some scholars, it is with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate thereafter the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=190-194, 200-201}}&lt;ref name=gaborieau7&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaborieau |first=Marc |date=June 1985 |title=From Al-Beruni to Jinnah: Idiom, Ritual and Ideology of the Hindu-Muslim Confrontation in South Asia |journal=Anthropology Today |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=7–14 |doi=10.2307/3033123 |jstor=3033123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the twelfth and the fourteen century, according to Andrew Nicholson, this effort emerged with a classification of astika and nastika systems of Indian philosophies.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=190-194, 200-201}} Certain thinkers, according to Nicholson thesis, began to retrospectively classify ancient thought into "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=1-3}}

Other scholars, acknowledges Nicholson, present an alternate thesis. The scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, texts such as [[Dharmasutras]] and [[Puranas]], and various ideas that are considered to be paradigmatic Hinduism are traceable to being thousands of years old. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Hinduism as a religion does not have a single founder, rather it is a fusion of diverse scholarship where a galaxy of thinkers openly challenged each other's teachings and offered their own ideas.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=1-3}} The term "Hindu" too, states Arvind Sharma, appears in much older texts such as those in Arabic that record the Islamic invasion or regional rule of Indian subcontinent. Some of these texts have been dated to between the 8th and the 11th century.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; Within these ''[[Doxology|doxologies]]'' and records, Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=178-183}}

===Modern times (Colonial rule and independence)===
According to Sangeetha Menon, Sadaśiva Brahmendra was a prominent 18th century Advaita Vedantin.&lt;ref group=web name="Menon"/&gt;

====Influence on Hindu nationalism====
{{Main|Hindu nationalism}}

According to King, along with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule came orientalism wherein the new rulers viewed Indians through "colonially crafted lenses". In response, emerged Hindu nationalism for collective action against the colonial rule, against the caricature by Christian and Muslim communities, and for socio-political independence.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=107-109}} In this colonial era search of identity, Vedanta came to be regarded as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as "then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion" and umbrella of "inclusivism".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=107-109, 128}} This umbrella of Advaita Vedanta, according to King, "provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=132-133, 172}}

Among the colonial era intelligentsia, according to Anshuman Mondal, a professor of Literature specializing in post-colonial studies, the monistic Advaita Vedanta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] professed monism of Advaita Vedanta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anshuman A Mondal|title=Nationalism and Post-Colonial Identity: Culture and Ideology in India and Egypt|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw2CAgAAQBAJ |year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-49417-0|pages=85, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedanta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Morris|title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA142| year= 2006|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn =978-0-521-85241-8|pages=112, 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaborieau7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Blom Hansen|title=The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAqn3OIGE54C |year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691006710|pages=76–77, 91–92, 179–181, 44–47, 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Swami Vivekananda=====
{{Main|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

A major proponent in the popularisation of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|King|2002|p=135-142}} who played a major role in the [[Hindu nationalism|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta". Vivekananda discerned a [[Universalism|universal religion]], regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91-92}} He presented karma, bhakti, jnana and raja yoga as equal means to attain moksha,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91}} to present Vedanta as a liberal and universal religion, in contrast to the exclusivism of other religions.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91}}

Vivekananda emphasised ''nirvikalpa'' [[samadhi]] as the spiritual goal of Vedanta, he equated it to the liberation in [[Yoga]] and encouraged Yoga practice he called ''Raja yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rabindra Kumar Dasgupta|title=Swami Vivekananda on Indian philosophy and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4LXAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|isbn=978-81-85843-81-0|pages=145–146, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, however, is missing in historic Advaita texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Comans | first=Michael | title=The Question of the Importance of Samadhi in Modern and Classical Advaita Vedanta | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | volume=43 | issue=1 | year=1993 | pages=19–38 | doi=10.2307/1399467 | jstor=1399467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Vivekananda claimed that Advaita appeals to modern scientists:
{{quote|I may make bold to say that the only religion which agrees with, and even goes a little further than modern researchers, both on physical and moral lines is the Advaita, and that is why it appeals to modern scientists so much. They find that the old dualistic theories are not enough for them, do not satisfy their necessities. A man must have not only faith, but intellectual faith too".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 2/Jnana-Yoga/The Absolute and Manifestation]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Anantanand Rambachan|Rambachan]], Vivekananda interprets ''anubhava'' as to mean "personal experience", akin to [[religious experience]], whereas Shankara used the term to denote liberating understanding of the ''sruti''.{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1991}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

Vivekananda's claims about spirituality as "science" and modern, according to David Miller, may be questioned by well informed scientists, but it drew attention for being very different than how Christianity and Islam were being viewed by scientists and sociologists of his era.&lt;ref name="Ishwaran1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Miller|editor=Karigoudar Ishwaran|title=Ascetic Culture: Renunciation and Worldly Engagement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBwJoA1jZVUC&amp;pg=PA115 |year=1999|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-11412-2|pages=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan=====
{{Main|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan}}

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedanta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; According to Michael Hawley, a professor of Religious Studies, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as "what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism," as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby "in a sense Hindusizing all religions".&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; To him, the world faces a religious problem, where there is unreflective dogmatism and exclusivism, creating a need for "experiential religion" and "inclusivism". Advaita Vedanta, claimed Radhakrishnan, best exemplifies a Hindu philosophical, theological, and literary tradition that fulfills this need.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Hawley|editor=Steven Engler and Gregory Price Grieve|title=Historicizing "Tradition" in the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81AU6gxv7TAC&amp;pg=PA300|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-090140-5|pages=300–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minor1987p132"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neil Minor|title=Radhakrishnan: A Religious Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LzRkWABC6sC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-554-5|pages=18, 25–26, 39–42, 132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishnan did not emphasize the differences between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism versus Hinduism that he defined in terms of Advaita Vedanta, rather he tended to minimize their differences. This is apparent, for example, in his discussions of Buddhist "Madhyamika and Yogacara" traditions versus the Advaita Vedanta tradition.&lt;ref name="Minor1987p132"/&gt;

Radhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for contemporary needs and context.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#H2 Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the transcendent metaphysical absolute concept (''nirguna'' Brahman).&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists," a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his ''The Life Divine'', declares that he has moved from Sankara's "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term."{{sfn|Gier|2012}}}} Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. According to Radhakrishnan, ''maya'' is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Braue (1984), [https://archive.org/stream/MayaInRadhakrishnansThoudhtSixMeaningsOtherThanIllusion/Maya%20In%20Radhakrishnan%27s%20Thoudht%20Six%20Meanings%20Other%20Than%20Illusion#page/n111/mode/2up Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought], Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|0-8364-1129-3}}, pages 101-136&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mahatama Gandhi=====
Gandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Vedanta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas.&lt;ref name=gier40&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F. Gier|title=The Virtue of Nonviolence: From Gautama to Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVLt99uleLwC&amp;pg=PA40|year =2004|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5949-2|pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that ''atman'' exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this ''atman''.&lt;ref name=gier40/&gt; Gandhi called himself advaitist many times, including his letters, but he believed that others have a right to a viewpoint different than his own because they come from a different background and perspective.&lt;ref name=jordens116/&gt;&lt;ref name=long194/&gt; According to Gier, Gandhi did not interpret ''maya'' as illusion, but accepted that "personal theism" leading to "impersonal monism" as two tiers of religiosity.&lt;ref name=gier40/&gt;

=====Neo-Advaita=====
{{Main|Neo-Advaita}}

''Neo-Advaita'' is a [[New religious movement|New Religious Movement]] based on a popularised, western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta and the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]].{{sfn|Lucas|2011}}  Neo-Advaita is being criticised{{sfn|Marek|2008|p=10, note 6}}{{refn|group=note|Marek: "Wobei der Begriff Neo-Advaita darauf hinweist, dass sich die traditionelle Advaita von dieser Strömung zunehmend distanziert, da sie die Bedeutung der übenden Vorbereitung nach wie vor als unumgänglich ansieht.

It can even be termed 'pseudo' because, by presenting the teaching in a highly attenuated form, it might be described as purporting to be Advaita, but not in effect actually being so, in the fullest sense of the word.

Advaita Vedanta has gained attention in western [[spirituality]] and [[New Age]], where [[Perennial philosophy|various traditions]] are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} Nonduality points to "a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object".&lt;ref group=web name="Undivided"&gt;[http://undividedjournal.com/about-the-journal/ Undivided Journal, ''About the Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, "the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality".&lt;ref group=web name="whatisnond"&gt;[http://nonduality.org/what-is-nonduality/ Jerry Katz on Nonduality, ''What is Nonduality?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of [[Sannyasa|renunciation]]. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related:&lt;ref group=web name="MonasticTradition" /&gt;
{{quote|Most of the notable authors in the advaita tradition were members of the sannyasa tradition, and both sides of the tradition share the same values, attitudes and metaphysics.&lt;ref group=web name="MonasticTradition" /&gt;}}
Shankara organized monks under 10 names and established mathas for them. These mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was "due to institutional factors". The mathas which he built exist until today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, "while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=680-681}}

Shankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of [[Shiva]],&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt; established the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the [[Dashanami Sampradaya|Ekadandi monks]] under an umbrella grouping of ten names.&lt;ref group=web name="MonasticTradition"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Shankara/shankar4.html Sankara Acarya Biography – Monastic Tradition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508091224/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Shankara/shankar4.html |date=8 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis.&lt;ref&gt;Karigoudar Ishwaran, ''Ascetic Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Sinclair-Brull, ''Female Ascetics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.A.

Sankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four {{IAST|[[Matha|Maṭhas]]}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|मठ}}) (monasteries), called the ''Amnaya Mathas'', with the headquarters at [[Dvārakā]] in the West, [[Jagannatha Puri]] in the East, [[Sringeri]] in the South and [[Badrikashrama]] in the North.&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt; Each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then.{{refn|group=note|According to Pandey, these Mathas were not established by Shankara himself, but were originally ashrams established by [[Vibhandak Rishi|Vibhāņdaka]] and his son [[Rishyasringa|Ŗșyaśŗnga]].{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=4-5}} Shankara inherited the ashrams at Dvārakā and Sringeri, and shifted the ashram at Śŗngaverapura to Badarikāśrama, and the ashram at Angadeśa to Jagannātha Purī.{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=5}}}} According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's [[samadhi]] at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely [[Naduvil Madhom, Thrissur|Naduvil Madhom]], Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.

Monks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures enumerated by Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a [[Saiva]] sect,&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=782-783}} despite the historical links with Shaivism.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit.org: "Advaitins are non-sectarian, and they advocate worship of Siva and Visnu equally with that of the other deities of Hinduism, like Sakti, Ganapati and others."&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;}} Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities.&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;

==Relationship with other forms of Vedanta==
The Advaita Vedanta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedanta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified [[nondualism]]) of [[Ramanuja]], and the 14th-century [[Dvaita]] (theistic dualism) of [[Madhvacharya]].{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=238–243, 288–294, 340–342}}

===Shuddhadvaita===
{{main|Shuddhadvaita}}

[[Vallabhacharya]] (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of [[Shuddhadvaita]] Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world.&lt;ref&gt;Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, "Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)", Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; That is why shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss).&lt;ref&gt;"Brahmavād Saṅgraha", Pub.

===Dvaita===
{{main|Dvaita}}

Madhvacharya was also a critic of [[Advaita]] Vedanta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are identical, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities.&lt;ref name=stoker2011mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt; Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only [[Vishnu]] is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities.&lt;ref name=stoker2011mc&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhva (1238-1317) |first= Valerie| last= Stoker| publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011 |accessdate=2 February 2016| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/madhva/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215&gt;Stafford Betty (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Viśiṣṭādvaita: Contrasting Views of Mokṣa, Asian Philosophy: An International Journal of the Philosophical Traditions of the East, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 215-224&lt;/ref&gt; Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedanta and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] were a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] school of thought.&lt;ref name=smschari6/&gt; Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including ''Upadhikhandana'' and ''Tattvadyota'', primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.&lt;ref name=smschari6&gt;SMS Chari (1999), Advaita and Visistadvaita, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815353}}, pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Vedanta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought.{{sfn|Indich|2000|page=57–60}}{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=240-243}}{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|page=19}} Advaita Vedanta, states [[Eliot Deutsch]], "has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1996), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smarta Tradition===
{{Main|Smarta Tradition}}

The [[Smarta Tradition|Smarta]] tradition of [[Hinduism]] is an ancient tradition,{{refn|group=note|Archeological evidence suggest that the Smarta tradition in India dates back to at least 3rd-century CE.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Asher|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ  |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"/&gt;}} particularly found in south and west India, that revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit.&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood1996p17"/&gt;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}} Their [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]] practice is called ''Panchayatana puja''.&lt;ref name="Bühnemann2003p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Bühnemann|title=Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQf2m8VaC_oC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2003|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-9004129023|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

In the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedanta ideas combined with [[bhakti]] are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}} and reformer of the Smarta.{{sfn|Rosen|2006|p=166}} According to [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the ''smarta'' tradition.{{refn|group=note|Practically, Shankara fostered a rapprochement between Advaita and ''smarta'' orthodoxy, which by his time had not only continued to defend the ''varnasramadharma'' theory as defining the path of ''karman'', but had developed the practice of ''pancayatanapuja'' ("five-shrine worship") as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices. Thus one could worship any one of five deities (Vishnu, Siva, Durga, Surya, Ganesa) as one's ''istadevata'' ("deity of choice").{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}}}

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues ([[murti]]), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality ''saguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bühnemann2003p60"/&gt; The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as "That art Thou".&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;[https://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects The Four Denominations of Hinduism], Basics of Hinduism, Kauai Hindu Monastery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falk Reitz (1997), [http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/76/1/Pancayatana_1.pdf Pancayatana-Komplexe in Nordindien: Entstehung, Entwicklung und regionale Besonderheiten einer indischen Architekturform], PhD Thesis (in German), Awarded by [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Hindu traditions===
Within the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], the ideas of Advaita Vedanta have had a major influence. Advaita Vedanta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India.{{sfn|Neog|1980|pp=243–244}} One of its most popular text, the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedanta philosophy.{{sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pp=172–173}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|pp=553–557}}{{sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} The ''Bhagavata Purana'' is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Sheridan|1986|p=6}}&lt;ref name="Archaism"&gt;{{Cite book | year=1966 | last=van Buitenen | first=J. A. B | chapter=The Archaism of the Bhagavata Purana|  editor=Milton Singer | title=Krishna: Myths, Rites, and Attitudes | pages=23–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient and medieval literature of [[Shaivism]], called the ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]'', the influence of Advaita Vedanta is once again prominent.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=126–128}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=162–167}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|1984|pp=177–178}} Of the 92 ''Āgamas'', ten are ''[[Dvaita]]'' texts, eighteen are ''[[Bhedabheda]]'', and sixty-four are ''[[Advaita]]'' texts.{{sfn|Davis|2014|p=167 note 21}}{{sfn|Dyczkowski|1989|pp=43–44}} According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada's Advaita Vedanta ideas and [[Kashmir Shaivism]].{{sfn|Isaeva|1995|pp=134–135}}

[[Shaktism]], the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Vedanta and dualism premises of Samkhya–Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic ''Shakti'').{{sfn|McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}{{sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=35–39}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|p=274 with note 73}}

Other influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the ''[[Yoga Yajnavalkya]]'', ''[[Yoga Vashishta]]'', ''[[Avadhuta Gita]]'', ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'' and ''[[Sannyasa Upanishads]]'' predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-x with footnote 3}};&lt;br&gt;Richard Rosen (2001), Review of Yogayajnavalkya Samhita by TKV Desikachar, {{Google books|AeoDAAAAMBAJ|Yoga Journal}}, Issue March/April, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= White |first=David Gordon |title=The "Yoga Sutra of Patanjali": A Biography| year=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691143774|pages=xvi–xvii, 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Rigopoulos|1998|pp = 37, 57, 62–63, 195–207}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author=M.

==Relationship with Buddhism==
{{See also|Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta}}

Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism share similarities and have differences,{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}} their relationship a subject of dispute among scholars.&lt;ref name=ingalls291&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ingalls | first=Daniel H.

The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, while others deny such influences, or see them as variant expressions.&lt;ref&gt;N.V. Isaeva (1993), ''Shankara and Indian Philosophy'', SUNY Press, pages 12-14, 145–154&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]], the Japanese Buddhist scholarship has argued that Adi Shankara did not understand Buddhism.&lt;ref name=ingalls291/&gt;

Some Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its ''Maya'' and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Lipner]] (1986), The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Rāmānuja, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887060397}}, pages 120-123&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} [[Ramanuja]], the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a ''Prachanna Bauddha'', that is, a "crypto-Buddhist",{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}} and someone who was undermining theistic [[Bhakti]] devotionalism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} The non-Advaita scholar [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] of the Bhedabheda Vedanta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as "this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

A few Buddhist scholars made the opposite criticism in the medieval era toward their Buddhist opponents. In the sixth century CE, for example, the Mahayana Buddhist scholar [[Bhaviveka]] redefined Vedantic concepts to show how they fit into Madhyamaka concepts,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=152}} and "equate[d] the Buddha's [[Dharma body]] with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the Upanishads."&lt;ref name=Eckel&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bhāvaviveka|author2=Malcolm David Eckel (Translator) |title=Bhāviveka and his Buddhist opponents: chapters 4 and 5 of Bhāviveka's Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ with Tarkajvāla commentary|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1bYAAAAMAAJ|year= 2008|publisher= Harvard University Press|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ'', Bhaviveka stages a Hinayana ([[Theravada]]) interlocutor, who accuses Mahayana Buddhists of being "crypto-Vedantins".{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=152-153}}{{sfn|King|1995|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|Nicholson: "a Hīnayāna interlocutor accuses the Mahāyāna Buddhist of being a crypto-Vedāntin, paralleling later Vedāntins who accuse the Advaita Vedānta of crypto-Buddhism."{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=152-153}}}} Medieval era Tibetan Gelugpa scholars accused the [[Jonang school]] of being "crypto-Vedantist."&lt;ref name=newland260/&gt;&lt;ref name=cozort74/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The [[Jonang school]] was influenced by Yogachara and taught [[Shentong]] Buddhism, which sees the highest Truth as self-existent.&lt;ref name=newland260&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Newland|title=The Two Truths: In the Madhyamika Philosophy of the Gelukba Order of Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtFZIDFX2aIC |year=1992 |publisher= Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-778-0|page= 260 note 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cozort74&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Cozort|title=Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School: The Systematization of the Philosophy of the Indian Buddhist Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamika School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzb-Gih7k1EC&amp;pg=PA74 |year=1990|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-997-5|pages=74–75 with footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Contemporary scholar [[David Kalupahana]] called the seventh century Buddhist scholar [[Chandrakirti]] a "crypto-Vedantist", a view rejected by scholars of Madhayamika Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Paul Kakol|title= Emptiness and Becoming: Integrating Mādhyamika Buddhism and Process Philosophy|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=1vZOAQAAIAAJ|year= 2009|publisher= Shambala|isbn= 978-81-246-0519-6|pages=108–109}}, Quote: "He also charges that Candrakirti was a crypto-Vedantist, (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advaita Vedanta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on ''Atman'', ''Anatta'' and ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}}

===Similarities with Buddhism===
According to scholars, the influence of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] on Advaita Vedanta has been significant.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}{{sfn|Grimes|1998|pp=684–686}} Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}}{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=126, 157}} According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, "a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw."{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}}

Both traditions hold that "the [[Twelve Nidānas|empirical world is transitory]], a [[Sunyata|show of appearances]]",{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|pp=351-352}}&lt;ref name=helmithglasenapp2&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; and both admit [[Two Truths doctrine|"degrees of truth or existence"]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=354}} Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 22, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Helmuth von Glasenapp]] writes: "The Buddhist Nirvana is, therefore, not the primordial ground, the eternal essence, which is at the basis of everything and form which the whole world has arisen (the Brahman of the Upanishads) but the reverse of all that we know, something altogether different which must be characterized as a nothing in relation to the world, but which is experienced as highest bliss by those who have attained to it ([[Anguttara Nikaya]], Navaka-nipata 34). Vedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines, a gulf that cannot be bridged over. According to [[Majjhima Nikaya]], Sutta 22, a doctrine that proclaims "The same is the world and the self. This I shall be after death; imperishable, permanent, eternal!" (see [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4, 4, 13), was styled by the Buddha a perfectly foolish doctrine. On the other side, the [[Katha Upanishad]] (2, 1, 14) does not see a way to deliverance in the Buddhist theory of dharmas (impersonal processes): He who supposes a profusion of particulars gets lost like rain water on a mountain slope; the truly wise man, however, must realize that his [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is at one with the [[Brahman|Universal Atman]], and that the former, if purified from dross, is being absorbed by the latter, "just as clear water poured into clear water becomes one with it, indistinguishably."&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;}} Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated "into his own system a Buddhist notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}} Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's [[Vijnanavada]] and Shankara's Advaita.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=174}}

According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent "different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara."{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}}{{refn|group=note|This development did not end with Advaita Vedanta, but continued in Tantrism and various schools of Shaivism. Non-dual [[Kashmir Shaivism]], for example, was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika,{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=26}}}} The influence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the [[Visuddhimagga]] of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the [[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206}} According to John Plott,
{{Quote|We must emphasize again that generally throughout the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Dynasty]], and even more so after its decline, there developed such a high degree of syncretism and such toleration of all points of view that Mahayana Buddhism had been Hinduized almost as much as Hinduism had been Buddhaized.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285–288}}}}

===Gaudapada===
The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}{{Sfn|Comans|2000|p=2}}

One school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]]{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{refn|group=note|It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā".{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=126, 143-144}}

Of particular interest is Chapter Four of Gaudapada's text ''Karika'', in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and the term ''Asparsayoga'' is borrowed from Buddhism.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} According to Murti, "the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an Advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them."&lt;ref name=trvmurti114&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, pages 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gauḍapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma, "to mistake him [Gaudapada] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd".{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=145-147}} The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;

{{Quote|
We have been talking of borrowing, influence and relationship in rather general terms. It is necessary to define the possible nature of the borrowing, granting that it did take place. (...) The Vedantins stake everything on the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Brahman) and accept the authority of the Upanishads. We have pointed out at length the [[Anatta|Nairatmya]] standpoint of Buddhism and its total opposition to the Atman (soul, substance, the permanent and universal) in any form.

Advaitins have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285–288}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;{{sfn|Potter|1981|p=81}}

===Differences from Buddhism===
====Atman and anatta====
Advaita Vedanta holds the premise, "Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or ''Anatta'', non-self)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman ("the self")."&lt;/ref&gt; is self evident".&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al. (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, ''[[Anatta]]'' (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An-atman) is the concept that in human beings and living creatures, there is no "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=7sources&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), '''Quote:''' "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”).";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2217-5}}, page 64; '''Quote:''' "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought).

In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to ''nirvana'', in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=7sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' suggest self-like concepts, variously called ''Tathagatagarbha'' or ''[[Buddha nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|location=|pages=104, 125–127|via=|author=Paul Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these "self-like" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=107, 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

====Epistemology====
The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article).{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's ''Śabda'' pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wayman (1999), A Millennium of Buddhist Logic, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816466}}, page xix-xx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontology====
Advaita Vedanta posits a [[Substance theory|substance ontology]], an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman-Brahman.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=49-50, 60-62}} In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes.&lt;ref name="Bartley2011p91"/&gt;

In contrast, [[Buddhism]] posits a [[Process philosophy|process ontology]], also called as "event ontology".&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartley2011p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Bartley|title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlupnDEr5iAC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84706-449-3|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process.&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"/&gt;{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=40-50, 60-62, 97}}{{refn|group=note|Kalupahana describes how in Buddhism there is also a current which favours substance ontology. Kalupahanan sees [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Yogacara]] as reactions against developments toward substance ontology in Buddhism.{{sfn|Kalupahanan|1994}}}} There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena (''pratitya samutpada'') in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Vedanta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Bartley|title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlupnDEr5iAC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84706-449-3|pages=90–91, 96, 204–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pali Abdhidhamma and Theravada Buddhism considered all existence as ''dhamma'', and left the ontological questions about reality and the nature of ''dhamma'' unexplained.&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-20701-0|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Renard, Advaita's theory of three levels of reality is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}}

====Shankara on Buddhism====
A central concern for Shankara, in his objections against Buddhism, is what he perceives as nihilism of the Buddhists.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}} Shankara states that there "must be something beyond cognition, namely a cognizer,"{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=304}} which he asserts is the self-evident ''Atman'' or witness.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=301-305}} Buddhism, according to Shankara, denies the cognizer. He also considers the notion of Brahman as pure knowledge and "the quintessence of positive reality."{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}}

The teachings in Brahma Sutras, states Shankara, differ from both the [[Sarvastivada|Buddhist realists]] and the [[Yogacara|Buddhist idealists]]. Shankara elaborates on these arguments against various schools of Buddhism, partly presenting refutations which were already standard in his time, and partly offering his own objections.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954}} Shankara's original contribution in explaining the difference between Advaita and Buddhism was his "argument for identity" and the "argument for the witness".{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=299-301, 303-304}} In Shankara's view, the Buddhist are internally inconsistent in their theories, because "the reservoir-consciousness that [they] set up, being momentary, is no better than ordinary consciousness. Or, if [they] allow the reservoir-consciousness to be lasting, [they] destroy [their] theory of momentariness."{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|pp=302-303}} In response to the idealists, he notes that their ''[[alaya-vijnana]]'', or store-house consciousness, runs counter to the Buddhist theory of momentariness.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}} With regard to the ''Sunyavada'' ([[Madhyamaka]]), Shankara states that "being contradictory to all valid means of knowledge, we have not thought worth while to refute" and "common sense (''loka-vyavahara'') cannot be denied without the discovery of some other truth".{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=303}}

==Reception==
Advaita Vedanta is most often regarded as an idealist [[monism]].&lt;ref name=menoniep2/&gt;&lt;ref name="JN Mohanty 1980 page 205"/&gt; According to King, Advaita Vedanta developed "to its ultimate extreme" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads.{{sfn|King|1995|p=65; Quote: "The prevailing monism of the Upanishads was developed by the Advaita Vedanta to its ultimate extreme"}} In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedanta "monistic," since this confuses the "negation of difference" with "conflation into one."{{sfn|Milne|1997|p=168}} ''Advaita'' is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the "negation of a difference," between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. {{sfn|Milne|1997|p=168}}

According to Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1988|pp=3, 10, 13-14 with footnotes}} According to Jacqueline Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes "oneness" premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Hirst (2005), Samkara's Advaita Vedanta: A Way of Teaching, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415406017}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson states Advaita Vedanta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=68}}

==Advaitic Meditation (Bhramara-kita-nyaya)==
Bhramara-kita-nyaya is based on the analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar, which states how the caterpillar gets transformed into a wasp by intense thinking of the latter. Similarly, the Jiva becomes [[Brahman]] itself by meditating intensely on [[Brahman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">'''Alexandru Dragomir''' (November 8, 1916 in [[Zalău]] – November 13, 2002 in [[Bucharest]]) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]]. He made his doctoral studies under [[Martin Heidegger]]'s direction, in 1940.

==Philosophy==
Dragomir refused to publish any of his writing. He always maintained that publishing was of no importance to him; instead, genuine understanding was all that mattered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Thus he never got involved with the public cultural milieu. Before his death, no one even knew whether he had actually written anything, or not.

[[Walter Biemel]] recollects that Heidegger much appreciated Dragomir's brightness. Dragomir attended Heidegger's private [[seminar]]s and it is said that, when the discussion seemed to stall, [[Heidegger]] would turn to him and say: “Eh, what do the Latins say? ”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studia-phaenomenologica.com/introduction.php?page=introduction434&lt;/ref&gt; Dragomir was a close friend of Biemel, with whom he translated “What is metaphysics? ” into Romanian (in 1942).

At the end of 1943, Dragomir was obliged to leave [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] and Heidegger's seminars and return to [[Romania]] to be [[conscription|conscripted]]. It was the beginning of war. Even Heidegger's insistence to prolong his stay in Freiburg could not prevent his departure. In 1945, the end of the war coincided with the Russian occupation and the introduction of [[communism]] in Romania; Dragomir saw himself unable to continue his thesis with Heidegger. He understood that his connections with [[Germany]] could be reasons for political persecution and that his interest in philosophy could trigger his prosecution. Dragomir understood that his life depended on his ability to hide his interest in philosophy and to efface his ties with Germany. While continuously erasing the traces of his past, Dragomir worked in all possible trades: welder, salesman, civil servant or accountant, always changing jobs, being regularly fired because of his politically unsuitable “file”.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Finally, he was an [[economist]] with the Ministry for Wood until his retirement in 1976. After 1985, he agreed to make a compromise as far as his silence on his philosophical activity: he decided to hold several seminars with the disciples of [[Noica]]: [[Gabriel Liiceanu]], [[Andrei Pleșu]], [[Sorin Vieru]].

==Legacy==
In 2002, a hundred books with notes, comments on traditional philosophical texts, tests of investigation and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologic]] analysis, philosophical and extremely subtle descriptions were found at his home. Most of the texts are phenomenologic microanalyses of various concrete aspects of life. Texts were found that dealt with themes such as the mirror, lapse of memory, error, [...], the morning alarm clock, what one calls ugly and disgusting, attention - because of being wrong about oneself, writing and orality - because of distinguishing and [...], uniqueness and so on.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} They are disparate and heterogeneous subjects, as if Dragomir had let his phenomenologic magnifier fall upon the diversity of the world and chose to analyze, for his own desire to comprehend, with no other end, such and such fact or such and such aspect of reality.

However, one of his topics is constant: it is to be found in a series of books, entitled Chronos, in which Dragomir systematically looked into the problem of [[time]] for several decades: the first book goes back to 1948 and it includes several notes written in German, while the last one covers the period between 1980 and 1990. This discovery enabled the recovery of Dragomir's work. Three volumes have been already published by the Humanitas publishing house to-date: ''Crase banalităţi metafizice'' ("Utter metaphysical banalities", 2004), ''Cinci plecări din prezent. Exerciţii fenomenologice'' ("Five departures from present. Phenomenological exercises", 2005), and ''Caietele timpului'' ("The Time Notebooks", 2006). Five more volumes are envisaged for publication. Lastly, to prevent any further delay in the reception of this thinker abroad, a number of the Studia Phænomenologica magazine was dedicated to him, featuring texts by Dragomir translated into French, English and German, as well as texts about his personality, according to the ones who knew him and who could testify for his life and his manner of philosophizing. Other translations appeared in the French review “Alter”.

'''Andrea Bonomi'' ([[Rome]], 1940-) is an [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and logician.  Born in [[Rome]] in 1940, he studied with [[Enzo Paci]]. After an initial interest in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] (''Existence and structure: Essay on Merleau-Ponty'', 1967), he decided to dedicate himself wholeheartedly  to the study of [[analytic philosophy]], particularly the [[philosophy of language]].

His major contributions have been concentrated in the area of [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]], especially in the field of the logic of epistemic, modal and temporal sentences. In particular, in ''Mental Events'' (1983), he proposed an original solution to the problem of the intentionality of propositional attitude attributions, based on the idea of ''perspectivity'': the systematic ambiguity of [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] which characterizes propositional attitude sentences is explained by way of the contrast between the point of view of the attributor and the point of view of the person who entertains the attitude attributed. Also of notable importance is his semantic analysis of fictitious contexts of language use (''Universes of Discourse'', 1979; ''The spirit of narration'', 1994).

'''Antonio Millán-Puelles''' (February 11, 1921 – March 22, 2005) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosopher]] interested in phenomenology and metaphysics, who published many books and articles. He discovered his vocation to philosophy when he read [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]’s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' and abandoned the medical studies he had just begun.

His preferred topics were the relationship between conscience and subjectivity, the value of freedom, the ideal and the unreal being, and the rapport between metaphysics and logic. "The properly and refreshing philosophical attitude of the author is precisely made evident by the fact that he is open to the truth regardless of who stayed it. He is close to the phenomena and data of experience and analyzes them carefully and without a trace of reductionism and constructivism".&lt;ref name="Seifert1"&gt;Seifert, Josef. Preface to ''The Theory of the Pure Object'', Universitätsverlag, C. Winter, Heidelberg, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Among his most important books there are:
*“El problema del ente ideal” (''The Problem of the Ideal Being''. A study of Hartmann and Husserl, doctoral dissertation; 1947);
*“Ontología de la existencia histórica” (''The Ontology of Historical Existence'', 1951);
*“Fundamentos de Filosofía” (''Fundamentals of Philosophy'', 1958), {{ISBN|84-321-3278-0}};
*“La claridad en Filosofía y otros estudios” (''Clarity in Philosophy and Other Essays'', 1958);
*“La función social de los saberes liberales” (''The Social Function of the Humanities'', 1961);
*“Persona humana y justicia social” (''The Human Person and Social Justice'', 1961), {{ISBN|968-428-380-6}};
*“La formación de la personalidad humana” (''The Development of Human Personality'', 1963), {{ISBN|84-321-0009-9}};
*“La estructura de la subjetividad” (''The Structure of Subjectivity'', Ediciones Rialp, 1967). Translated to Italian; in this work he studies particularly the concept of [[intentionality]];
*“Economía y libertad” (''Economy and Freedom'', 1974);
*“Sobre el hombre y la sociedad” (''On Man and Society'', 1976);
*“Universidad y sociedad” (''The University and Society'', 1976);
*“Teoría de la educación” (''A Theory of Education'', 1983);
*“Léxico Filosófico” (''A Philosophical Lexicon'', 1984), {{ISBN|84-321-3416-3}}, {{ISBN|978-84-321-3669-6}};
*“Teoría del objeto puro” (''The Theory of the Pure Object'', 1990). Translated to English: Heidelberg, Universitätsverlag C. Winter 1996; {{ISBN|3-8253-0309-8}};
*“El interés por la verdad” (''The Interest for Truth'', 1997);
*“La lógica de los conceptos metafísicos (2 Vols.)” (''The Logic of Metaphysical Concepts'', 2002);
*"La libre afirmación de nuestro ser", (''The Free Affirmation of Our Being'', {{ISBN|84-321-3028-1}});
*"La inmortalidad del alma humana" (''The Inmortality of the Human Soul''), {{ISBN|978-84-321-3669-6}}.

His books could be divided in three main groups: those devoted to the theory of knowledge and metaphysics, those devoted to ethics and society, and educational handbooks. In all these works he studies and comments [[Brentano]], [[Aristotle]], [[Aquinas]], [[Husserl]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]], [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]], [[Sartre]], [[Heidegger]], and many other ancient, medieval, and modern philosophers.

==Life and career==

Dacey was raised in the rural Midwest by liberal Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, "The Accidental Exorcist," in Russell Blackford and Udo Schüklenk, eds., 50 voices of disbelief: Why we are atheists (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2009), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; His father Philip Dacey is a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipdacey.com/ |title=Philip Dacey's homepage |publisher=Philipdacey.com |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young teenager, Dacey became an evangelical Protestant,&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, "The Accidental Exorcist," 178.&lt;/ref&gt; playing in the Christian alternative rock band, The Swoon, which in 1990 released an EP produced by [[Charlie Peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/charlie-peacock-p2367/credits |title=Charlie Peacock |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying music and philosophy at [[The Evergreen State College]] in Olympia, Washington, Dacey lost his religion, explaining later that "God stopped returning my calls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marshall Independent |url=http://www.marshallindependent.com/page/content.detail/id/502016.html |title=Religion's role – MarshallIndependent.com &amp;#124; News, Sports, Jobs, Community Info. |publisher=Marshall Independent |date=May 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[applied ethics]] and [[social philosophy]] at [[Bowling Green State University]] in Bowling Green, Ohio, and was awarded a doctorate in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/phil/page25825.html |title=BGSU :: Department of Philosophy :: PhD Dissertations and Placements |publisher=Bgsu.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTHLecSXaHU Does God Exist?] A debate between William Lane Craig and Austin Dacey. 2005.  California State University, Fresno.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1999, Dacey worked for the [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI), a think tank that seeks "to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net |title=Home |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the New York City branch office of CFI&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Skeptics' Organization Seeks Better Coverage of Science by Media" (March 16, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and later served as the organization's representative to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Steinfels, "Perceiving 2 Fallacies, a Secularist Faults His Fellows," New York Times (May 24, 2010).
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Dacey left CFI and published a critique of the secular movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/1963/decomposing_humanism%3A_why_replace_religion |title=Decomposing Humanism: Why Replace Religion? &amp;#124; (A)theologies |publisher= ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' |date=October 29, 2009 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he created The Impossible Music Sessions, a forum in New York City for censored and persecuted musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128216493 |title=Music You're Not Supposed To Hear |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught ethics at the [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]].

==Secularism==

Dacey has defended a form of [[secularism]] emphasizing the values of "individual autonomy, equal rights and freedom of conscience."&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt; Religion News Service dubbed him a member of [[Atheism 3.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-10-19-atheism-belief_N.htm |title=Atheism 3.0 finds a little more room for religion |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |first1=Daniel |last1=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; a designation he contests.&lt;ref&gt;Austhttp://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2009/10/the_secularist_case_against_atheism_30.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that secularism is not atheistic, but instead that it comes "before God."&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of Dacey's position have been embraced by religious thinkers such as [[Richard John Neuhaus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard John Neuhaus |url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2008/03/the-secular-conscience |title=(11 March 2008) |publisher=Firstthings.com |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sullivan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2006/week5/index.html |title=The Dish &amp;#124; By Andrew Sullivan – The Daily Beast |publisher=Andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316003515/http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2006/week5/index.html |archive-date=March 16, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Marc Gellman&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman, "The God Squad," Newsday (June 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as secular figures such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Susan Jacoby]], [[Ibn Warraq]], and [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://austindacey.com/books.html |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224231927/http://www.austindacey.com/books.html |archivedate=December 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of conscience===

In ''The Secular Conscience'', Dacey argues that contemporary [[secular liberalism]] has "lost its soul" due to misconceptions he labels the Privacy Fallacy and the Liberty Fallacy. The Privacy Fallacy lies in thinking that "because matters of conscience are private in the sense of nongovernmental, they are private in the sense of personal preference."&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, The secular conscience: Why belief belongs in public life (Amherst: Prometheus Books 2008), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty Fallacy lies in thinking that "because conscience must be free from coercion, its moral conclusions must also be free from public criticism."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; This confused thinking, according to Dacey, leads to "the conclusion that controversial religious and moral claims are beyond evaluation by reason, truth and objective standards of right and wrong, and should therefore be precluded from public conversation."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

In place of the "privacy of conscience," Dacey defends a model of the "openness of conscience," comparing conscience to a [[Freedom of the press|free press]]. It is to be protected from coercion so that it can be free to play an important role in the public sphere and free to follow its own objective standards.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, "The Secular Conscience," Contemplate: The International Journal of Cultural Jewish Thought (2008–09), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reasons of conscience are by their nature shareable, not subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, The secular conscience: Why belief belongs in public life (Amherst: Prometheus Books 2008), 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey uses the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac to illustrate the thesis that "any act of faith depends on a prior act of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1866 |title=Jenny Bunker – The Secular Conscience: Why Belief Belongs in Public Life by Austin Dacey |publisher=New Humanist |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics of conscience===

By precluding conscience from public debate, secular liberals had hoped to prevent believers from introducing sectarian beliefs into politics. Instead, the "gag order" has prevented secular liberals from subjecting religious claims to "due public scrutiny"&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, The secular conscience: Why belief belongs in public life (Amherst: Prometheus Books 2008), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and from advancing their own views in robustly moral terms, granting a "monopoly on the language of ethics and values"  to the religious on the Right and the Left.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=news.display_article&amp;mode=s&amp;NewsID=6769.&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argues that claims of conscience—including religious claims—cannot be barred from public debate, but that they can and must be held to the same critical conversational standards as all serious contributions to public debate.

While advocating the [[separation of religion and state]], Dacey has suggested that political institutions should be designed to protect the exercise of conscience, not religion as such. In "Against Religious Freedom", a 2010 article in [[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]] co-authored with Colin Koproske, he argues that [[religious freedom]] should be regarded as "one manifestation of more fundamental rights held by all people, religious and secular alike: private property, personal autonomy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and perhaps most important, freedom of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey and Colin Koproske, "Against Religious Freedom," Dissent (Summer 2011), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secularism and Islam===

Criticizing the failure of some on the Left in the West to support secular liberal forces in the Arab and [[Muslim world]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hw.libsyn.com/p/f/4/5/f4532fd55805882d/POI_2008_03_21_Austin_Dacey.mp3?sid=d4dca104ceb7618609d97d99a521a26b&amp;l_sid=18988&amp;l_eid=&amp;l_mid=1770357 ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Rosenthal. "La Conscienza del Politico," Il Foglio Quotidiano (September 16, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey has stressed the importance of religious rationales for secularism. He has analogized religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries to dissident Protestant sects such as the Anabaptists who constructed theological arguments for toleration and church-state separation in early modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=331 |title=Online Features – Who's Afraid of Shari'a? |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320062019/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=331 |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacey was a lead organizer of the [[Secular Islam Summit]] in March 2007, described by the ''Wall Street Journal'' as "a landmark."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephens |first=Bret |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117314819125027850 |title=Islam's Other Radicals - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference issued the St. Petersburg Declaration, a statement of principles endorsed by [[Mithal al-Alusi]], [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], and [[Shahriar Kabir]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/isis/news/the_st_petersburg_declaration/ |title=(5 April 2007) |publisher=Centerforinquiry.net |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing The Secular Conscience for [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], [[Amir Taheri]] wrote, "[m]aking this book available in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and other languages of the Muslim nations would be an immense service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taheri |first=Amir |url=http://www.asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=8&amp;id=12664 |title=Loading |publisher=Asharq-e.com |date=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==

As a representative of civil society organizations at the United Nations, Dacey has participated in lobbying at [[Human Rights Council]] in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Austin Dacey |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1204806/2008/11/29/De-vrijheidsmisvatting.dhtml |title=De vrijheidsmisvatting – Nieuws – TROUW |language=nl |publisher=Trouw.nl |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to oppose efforts by some member states to diminish international standards of freedom of expression out of "respect for religions and beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/1276/religious_persecution_wolf_in_anti-defamation_sheep%E2%80%99s_clothing |title=Religious Persecution Wolf in Anti-Defamation Sheep's Clothing &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=Religion Dispatches |date=March 30, 2009 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The ultimate aim of this effort is not to protect the feelings of Muslims," Dacey has commented, "but to protect illiberal Islamic states from charges of human rights abuse, and to silence the voices of internal dissidents calling for more secular government and freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-why-should-i-respect-these-oppressive-religions-1517789.html |title=Johann Hari: Why should I respect these oppressive religions? – Johann Hari – Commentators |publisher=The Independent |date=January 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defending a universal human right to blaspheme, Dacey has emphasized that it is a matter of freedom of conscience as much as just freedom of speech. In ''The Future of Blasphemy'', Dacey contends that debates in the international community about religiously offensive expression should be understood as "contests over what counts as sacred" in which unbelievers and heterodox believers reserve a right of conscience to express their views.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, The Future of Blasphemy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Dacey co-authored the CFI report, ''Islam and Human Rights: Defending Universality at the United Nations'', which puts these efforts in the context of a campaign by the intergovernmental Organization of the Islamic Conference to promulgate culturally specific "Islamic human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/unitednations/news/center_for_inquiry_defends_freedom_of_expression/ |title=CFI at the United Nations News |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacey also authored a CFI position paper accusing the UN [[Alliance of Civilizations]] of neglecting secular perspectives and perpetuating the "problematic division of the social world by religion" for which the "clash of civilizations" thesis is often faulted. There is a "clash of values" but it is taking place "''within'' societies and cultures, not only between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/unitednations/campaigns |title=CFI at the United Nations |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of music==

In March 2010, Dacey launched The Impossible Music Sessions, a forum in Brooklyn that features "artists who cannot appear and the music they are not free to make."&lt;ref name="impossiblemusic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.impossiblemusic.org/about.html |title=about – The Impossible Music Sessions |publisher=Impossiblemusic.org |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101130600/http://www.impossiblemusic.org/about.html |archive-date=January 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured artists join via Internet streaming or phone as a counterpart with whom they have collaborated in advance performs a live interpretation of their music.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, "Music You're Not Supposed to Hear."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark LeVine]] wrote in the [[Huffington Post]] that the first Impossible Music Session "will go down in the annals of rock history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-levine/the-evolution-will-be-oov_b_494407.html |title=Mark LeVine: The Evolution Will be ooVood |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= March 11, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sessions are produced in cooperation with [[Freemuse]]: The World Forum on Music and Censorship.&lt;ref name="impossiblemusic1"/&gt;

In an interview, Dacey commented, "Ironically, in the Internet age, the live performance has become even more important. The thing that's frustrating for these groups is that while they can record on their Macbook in their basement and share the music with their friends, the government and other powerful forces in society—they control the public spaces. . . . there's something magical about standing in front of people and playing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetgreen.discovery.com/feature/instrumental/impossible-music-stages-us-concerts-austin-dacey.html |title=Discovery web site is down |publisher=Planetgreen.discovery.com |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the Sessions have facilitated collaborations between musicians in North America and musicians in Iran, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, and Cuba. Dacey told the ''Wall Street Journal'' that the purpose is to "crosspollinate musically" and "banish isolation."&lt;ref&gt;Melik Kaylan, "Muzzled Musicians."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and culture==

From his early work with the Center for Inquiry, Dacey has been interested in the cultural implications of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/188488/ |title=New York Debunk'd |publisher=Village Voice |date=January 4, 2005 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he argued in [[Skeptical Inquirer]] that "science is making us more ignorant" by unsettling received cultural understandings of the self, meaning, and morality without replacing them with coherent alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Austin Dacey |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/is_science_making_us_more_ignorant/ |title=CSI &amp;#124; Is Science Making Us More Ignorant? |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column for ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Dacey explores the significance of the "culture of science" in Islamic, Chinese, and Indian cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dacey |first=Austin |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/archive/category/circumnavigations |title=CSI &amp;#124; Circumnavigations |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacey coined the term "accommodationism" to describe those "who either recognize no conflicts between religion and science, or who recognize such conflicts but are disinclined to discuss them publicly,"&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey, "Evolution education and the science-religion conflict: Dispatches from a philosophical correspondent,” in Ariela Keysar and Barry A. Kosmin, eds., Secularism and Science in the 21st Century (Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture, 2008): 51–67.&lt;/ref&gt; a usage which has been adopted in blogosphere debates about creationism and the [[New Atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/accomodationism.html |title=The Reality Club: The Big Accommodationism Debate |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sympathetic critic of organized [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dacey |first=Austin |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2004/06/Upgrading-Humanity.aspx |title=Upgrading Humanity: Transhumanists call for improving health, extending life spans via technology By Austin Dacey |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey is an advocate of culturing meat as an ethical alternative to using animals for meat.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Dacey and Patrick Hopkins, "Vegetarian meat: Could Technology Save Animals and Satisfy Meat Eaters?” Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 21 (January 2009): 579–596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edge.org/q2009/q09_11.html#dacey |title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2009—Page 11 |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

In a 2004 article for [[Free Inquiry]] magazine, "Atheism is Not a Civil Rights Issue," Dacey and co-author DJ Grothe criticized comparisons between the atheist cause in the United States and the causes of civil rights and LGBT rights, concluding that atheists "need a public awareness campaign, not a liberation movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=grothe-dacey_24_2 |title=Council for Secular Humanism |publisher=Secularhumanism.org |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was attacked by humanists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Council for Secular Humanism |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/tabash_24_4.htm |title=Atheism is Indeed a Civil Rights Issue |publisher=Secularhumanism.org |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the atheist blogger [[PZ Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/06/29/polarizing-is-a-dirty-word-so/ |title="Polarizing" is a dirty word, so atheists should surrender : Pharyngula |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Secular Islam Summit]] was criticized by representatives of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] as being organized by non-Muslims and "neo-cons" with no standing in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070408/16muslims.htm |title=Fighting for the Soul of Islam – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' compared Dacey to the British conservative author [[Melanie Phillips]] and associated him with the idea that "our civilization depends on the freedom to publish racist cartoons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Poole |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview10 |title=Et cetera: Apr 19 &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= April 19, 2008|accessdate=January 27, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' questioned whether Dacey has fairly characterized secular liberalism, and commented that many people "will balk at his plea that liberalism place 'global resistance to theocratic Islam at the center of its agenda,' much the way a generation of cold-war liberals once mobilized around anti-Communism.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

[[File:Lamarck Compared to Darwin, Baldwin, Waddington.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Baldwin effect compared to [[Lamarckism|Lamarck's theory of evolution]], [[Darwinian evolution]], and Waddington's [[genetic assimilation]]. All the theories offer explanations of how organisms respond to a changed environment with adaptive inherited change.]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''Baldwin effect''' describes the effect of learned behavior on evolution. In brief, [[James Mark Baldwin]] and others suggested during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] in the late 19th century that an organism's ''ability to learn'' new behaviors (e.g. to acclimatise to a new stressor) will affect its reproductive success and will therefore have an effect on the genetic makeup of its species through [[natural selection]]. Though this process appears similar to [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]], Lamarck proposed that living things ''inherited'' their parents' acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect has been independently proposed several times, and today it is generally recognized as part of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].

=="A New Factor in Evolution"==
The effect, then unnamed, was put forward in 1896 in a paper "A New Factor in Evolution" by [[United States|American]] [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin]]. The paper proposed a mechanism for specific selection for general learning ability. As [[Robert J. Richards|Robert Richards]] explains:&lt;ref name=Richards1987&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Robert J. Richards|Richards, Robert J.]] | year=1987 | title=Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior| publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago | isbn=0-226-71199-4 | page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If animals entered a new environment—or their old environment rapidly changed—those
that could flexibly respond by learning new behaviors or by ontogenetically adapting would
be naturally preserved. This saved remnant would, over several generations, have the
opportunity to exhibit spontaneously congenital variations similar to their acquired traits and
have these variations naturally selected. It would look as though the acquired traits had sunk
into the hereditary substance in a Lamarckian fashion, but the process would really be [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Selected offspring would tend to have an increased capacity for learning new skills rather than being confined to genetically coded, relatively fixed abilities. In effect, it places emphasis on the fact that the sustained behavior of a species or group can shape the evolution of that species. The "Baldwin effect" is better understood in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] literature as a scenario in which a character or [[biological trait|trait]] change occurring in an [[organism]] as a result of its interaction with its environment [[genetic assimilation|becomes gradually assimilated]] into its developmental genetic or epigenetic repertoire (Simpson, 1953; Newman, 2002). In the words of [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref name=dennett03/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thanks to the Baldwin effect, species can be said to pretest the efficacy of particular different designs by phenotypic (individual) exploration of the space of nearby possibilities. If a particularly winning setting is thereby discovered, this discovery will ''create'' a new selection pressure: organisms that are closer in the adaptive landscape to that discovery will have a clear advantage over those more distant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An update to the Baldwin Effect was developed by [[Jean Piaget]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Conrad Waddington]] in the 1960s–1970s. This new version included an explicit role for the social in shaping subsequent natural change in humans (both evolutionary and developmental), with reference to alterations of selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burman J. T. | year = 2013 | title = Updating the Baldwin Effect: The biological levels behind Piaget's new theory | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 363–373 | doi = 10.1016/j.newideapsych.2012.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is to be expected from [[Stigler's law]], subsequent research shows that Baldwin was not the first to identify the process; [[Douglas Spalding]] mentioned it in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, R.; [[Denis Noble|Noble, D.]] (2017) Was the Watchmaker Blind? Or Was She One-Eyed? ''Biology'' 2017, 6(4), 47; doi:10.3390/biology6040047, quoting Bateson, P. The adaptability driver: Links between behaviour and evolution. Biol. Theory 2006, 1, 342–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Suppose a species is threatened by a new [[predator]] and there is a behavior that makes it more difficult for the predator to kill individuals of the species. Individuals who learn the behavior more quickly will obviously be at an advantage. As time goes on, the ability to learn the behavior will improve (by genetic selection), and at some point it will seem to be an [[instinct]].

Baldwin gives the following case involving cooperation: "Animals may be kept alive let us say in a given environment by social cooperation only; these transmit this social type of variation to posterity; thus social adaptation sets the direction of physical phylogeny and physical heredity is determined in part by this factor" (Baldwin, 1896, p.&amp;nbsp;553).

The appearance of [[lactose intolerance|lactose tolerance]] in human populations with a long tradition of raising domesticated animals for milk production has been suggested as another example.{{by whom|date=May 2018}} This argument holds that a feedback loop operates whereby a dairy culture increases the selective advantage from this genetic trait, while the average population genotype increases the collective rewards of a dairy culture.

==Controversy and acceptance==

Initially Baldwin's ideas were not incompatible with the prevailing, but uncertain, ideas about the mechanism of transmission of hereditary information and at least two other biologists put forward very similar ideas in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=C. L. |authorlink=C. Lloyd Morgan |year=1896 |title=On modification and variation |journal=Science|volume=4|pages=733–740 |doi=10.1126/science.4.99.733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osborne |first=H. F. |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborne |year=1896 |title=Ontogenic and phylogenic variation |journal=Science |volume=4|pages=786–789 |doi=10.1126/science.4.100.786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] referred to behavioural adaptations to prevailing climates in different species of bees as ‘what had merely been an idea, therefore, and opposed to instinct, has thus by slow degrees become an instinctive habit’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Life of the Bee|last=Materlinck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Maeterlinck |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Co. |year=1901 |location=New York |pages=Chapter VII section 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baldwin effect theory subsequently became more controversial, with scholars being split between "Baldwin boosters" and "Baldwin skeptics".&lt;ref name="depew03"&gt;Depew, David J. (2003), "Baldwin Boosters, Baldwin Skeptics" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-23229-4 |pages=3–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was first called the "Baldwin effect" by [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; Simpson "admitted that the idea was theoretically consistent, that is, not inconsistent with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]",&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; but he doubted that the phenomenon occurred very often, or if so, could be proven to occur. In his discussion of the reception of the Baldwin-effect theory Simpson points out that the theory appears to provide a reconciliation between a neo-Darwinian and a [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]] approach and that "Mendelism and later genetic theory so conclusively ruled out the extreme neo-Lamarckian position that reconciliation came to seem unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Baldwin effect |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |year=1953 |journal=Evolution |volume=7 | issue=2 |pages=110–117 |doi=10.2307/2405746}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, the evolutionary biologist [[Julian Huxley]] promoted the Baldwin effect as part of the modern synthesis, saying the concept had been unduly neglected by evolutionists.&lt;ref name=Julian1942&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Julian Huxley |author=Huxley, Julian |year=1942 |location=London |title=[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]] |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] contended that the Baldwin effect theory was untenable because
# the argument is stated in terms of the individual genotype, whereas what is really exposed to the selection pressure is a phenotypically and genetically variable population;
# it is not sufficiently emphasized that the degree of modification of the phenotype is in itself genetically controlled;
# it is assumed that phenotypic rigidity is selectively superior to phenotypic flexibility.&lt;ref name=Mayr1963&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |year=1963 |location=Cambridge, MA |title=Animal Species and Evolution|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and Steven Nowlan demonstrated by computer simulation that learning can accelerate evolution, and they associated this with the Baldwin effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How learning can guide evolution|authors=[[Geoffrey Hinton|Hinton, Geoffrey E.]]; Nowlan, Steven J. |year=1987 |journal=Complex Systems |volume=1 |pages=495–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When learning guides evolution|authorlink=John Maynard Smith |author=Maynard Smith, John |year=1987 |journal=Nature |volume=329 |pages=761–762 |doi=10.1038/329761a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Puentedura2003&gt;{{cite book| author=Puentedura, Ruben R. |year=2003|location=Cambridge, MA |chapter=The Baldwin effect in the age of computation |title=Evolution and Learning: The Baldwin Effect Reconsidered |editors=Weber,Bruce H.; Depew, David J.|publisher=MIT press |pages=219–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Griffiths&lt;ref name=Griffiths2003&gt;{{cite book| author=Griffiths, Paul E. |year=2003|location=Cambridge, MA|chapter=Beyond the Baldwin effect: James Mark Baldwin’s ‘social heredity,’ epigenetic inheritance, and niche construction|title=Evolution and Learning: The Baldwin Effect Reconsidered|publisher=MIT press|pages=193–215|editors=Weber, Bruce H.; Depew, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests two reasons for the continuing interest in the Baldwin effect. The first is the role ''mind'' is understood to play in the effect. The second is the connection between ''development'' and evolution in the effect. Baldwin’s account of how neurophysiological and conscious mental factors may contribute to the effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Heredity and instinct|authors=[[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin, J.

[[File:Carpodacus mexicanus -Madison, Wisconsin, USA-8.jpg|thumb|The [[house finch]]'s colonisation of North America has provided empirical evidence of the Baldwin effect.&lt;ref name=Badyaev/&gt;]]

Still, observes David Depew, "it is striking that a rather diverse lot of contemporary evolutionary theorists, most of whom regard themselves as supporters of the Modern Synthesis, have of late become 'Baldwin boosters{{'"}}&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; These Baldwin boosters

&lt;blockquote&gt;
are typically [[evolutionary psychologist]]s who are searching for scenarios in which a population can get itself by behavioral trial and error onto a "hard to find" part of the fitness landscape in which human brain, language, and mind can rapidly coevolve. They are searching for what [[Daniel Dennett]], himself a Baldwin booster, calls an "evolutionary crane," an instrument to do some heavy lifting fast.&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Daniel Dennett]], recent work has rendered the Baldwin effect "no longer a controversial wrinkle in orthodox Darwinism".&lt;ref name="dennett03"&gt;[[Daniel Dennett|Dennett, Daniel]] (2003), "The Baldwin Effect, a Crane, not a Skyhook" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-23229-4 |pages=69–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential genetic mechanisms underlying the Baldwin effect have been proposed for the evolution of natural (genetically-determinant) antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Russell|date=1996|title=How the adaptive antibodies facilitate the evolution of natural antibodies|url=|journal=Immunology and Cell Biology|volume=74 | issue = 2 |pages=286–291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, empirical evidence for the Baldwin effect was provided from the colonisation of North America by the [[house finch]].&lt;ref name=Badyaev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badyaev |first1=Alexander V. |title=Evolutionary significance of phenotypic accommodation in novel environments: an empirical test of the Baldwin effect |journal=Phil.

==Comparison with genetic assimilation==
{{further|Genetic assimilation}}

The Baldwin effect has been confused with, and sometimes conflated with, a different evolutionary theory also based on [[phenotypic plasticity]], [[C. H. Waddington]]'s [[genetic assimilation]]. The Baldwin effect includes genetic accommodation, of which one type is genetic assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crispo | first1=Erika | year=2007 | title=The Baldwin effect and genetic assimilation: revisiting two mechanisms of evolutionary change mediated by phenotypic plasticity | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00203.x/full | journal=Evolution | volume=61 |  pages=2469–2479 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--more needed--&gt;

==Plot Summary==
The story takes place in future city, where [[Android (robot)|android]]s are serving the population in various positions where the robots finally began to help people, and even replace them in some jobs. 

The megacity, in which the series is taken place, is awash with androids. They raise children, work as chauffeurs and security guards, and they are able to think and feel empathy. Soulless machine named Arisa, is suddenly begin to behave extremely humanively and at times more intelligent than living beings. 

And then the question arises: so which of us is better?

'''David A. Johnson''' (born 1952) is Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Yeshiva University]] and has previously taught at [[UCLA]], [[University of Missouri]], and [[Syracuse University]].  Raised in [[Nebraska]], he earned his BA from the [[University of Nebraska]], where he studied under [[Robert Audi]], and his PhD from [[Princeton University]].  His areas of concentration are [[Philosophy of Religion]], [[Metaphysics]], and [[Epistemology]].  His brother, Edward, is Professor of Philosophy at [[University of New Orleans]].

In his first book, ''Hume, Holism, and Miracles'', Johnson purports to have refuted [[David Hume]]'s popular [[argument]] for the irrationality of belief in testimony of miracles (as can be found in his essay entitled "Of Miracles") as well as several reconstructions of Hume's argument (most notably that of [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] philosopher [[Jordan Howard Sobel]]).  Subsequently, [[Robert Fogelin]] (of [[Dartmouth College]]) responded to Johnson's critique of Hume in his book ''A Defense of Hume on Miracles''.

Johnson's second book, ''Truth Without Paradox'', consists mostly of Johnson's claimed resolutions of many alleged paradoxes, such as the [[Liar Paradox]]. Towards the end of the book, Johnson presents his version of the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of God. He also gives a [[historical argument]] for the validity of the [[Bible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7766">The '''Declaration on Crimes of Communism''' is a declaration signed on 25 February 2010 by several prominent European politicians, former political prisoners, human rights advocates and historians, which calls for the condemnation of [[communism]]. 
==Creation==
It concluded the international conference Crimes of the [[Communist Regime]]s, that took place at the [[Czech Senate]] and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic from 24 to 26 February 2010. The declaration reiterated many of the suggestions set forth by the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes |title=International conference: Crimes of the Communist Regimes |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfMt85Af?url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Hosts===
The conference was hosted by [[Jiří Liška (statesman)|Jiří Liška]], Vice President of the Czech Senate, and the [[Government of the Czech Republic|Office of the Government of the Czech Republic]], and organized by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] under the patronage of [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]], [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]], [[Heidi Hautala]], Chairwoman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the European Parliament, [[Göran Lindblad]], Vice President of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], among others. The cooperation partners included the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], the Information Office of the [[European Parliament]], the Representation of the European Commission in the Czech Republic, the Robert Schuman Foundation of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Polish Institute in Prague]], the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] and the [[National Endowment for Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/home.html |title=International Conference: Crimes of the Communist Regimes: About the conference |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfNiFRIt?url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/home.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The declaration both called for condemnation of communism, education about communist crimes, prosecution of communist criminals by establishing an international court within the EU for communist crimes, construction of a memorial to the victims of world communism, and reduction of pensions and social security benefits for communist perpetrators. The declaration stated that:
*"Communist regimes have committed, and are in some cases still committing, crimes against humanity in all countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in other countries where communism is still alive"
*"Crimes against humanity are not subject to statutory limitations according to international law; however, the justice done to perpetrators of Communist crimes over the past 20 years has been extremely unsatisfactory"
*"We must not deny the tens of millions of victims of Communism their right to justice"
*"Since crimes against humanity committed by the communist regimes do not fall under the jurisdiction of existing international courts, we call for the creation of a new international court with a seat within the EU for the crimes of communism. Communist crimes against humanity must be condemned by this court in a similar way as the Nazi crimes were condemned and sentenced by the Nuremberg tribunal, and as the crimes committed in former Yugoslavia were condemned and sentenced"
*"Not punishing the communist criminals means disregard of and thus weakening of international law"
*"As an act of reparation and restitution, European countries must introduce legislation that equalizes the pensions and social security benefits of perpetrators of communist crimes so that they are equal to or smaller than those of their victims"
*"As democracy must learn to be capable of defending itself, Communism needs to be condemned in a similar way as Nazism was. We are not equating the respective crimes of Nazism and Communism, including the Gulag, the Laogai and the Nazi concentration camps. They should each be studied and judged on their own terrible merits. Communist ideology and communist rule contradict the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Just as we are not willing to relativise crimes of Nazism, we must not accept a relativisation of crimes of Communism."
*"We call upon EU member states to increase the awareness raising and education about crimes of communism; we remind them of the need to implement, without further delay, the Resolution of the European Parliament (2 April 2009) to mark 23 August as the European-wide Day of Remembrance of the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes."
*"We call upon the European Commission and European Council of Justice and Home Affairs to adopt a Framework Decision introducing a pan-European ban on excusing, denying or trivializing the crimes of communism."
*"The creation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as supported by the European Parliament and the EU Council in 2009, must be completed at EU level. Individual governments must live up to their commitments regarding the work of the Platform."
*"As an act of recognition of the victims and respect for the immense suffering inflicted upon half of the continent, Europe must erect a memorial to the victims of world Communism, following the example of [[Victims of Communism Memorial|the memorial in the USA in Washington, D.C.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html |title=Declaration on Crimes of Communism |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfNE22gE?url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States constitutional law}}

'''Executive privilege''' is the power of the [[President of the United States]] and other members of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[United States Government]] to resist certain [[subpoena]]s and other interventions by the [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial branch]]es of government in pursuit of information or personnel relating to the executive. The power of [[United States Congress|Congress]] or the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] to obtain such information is not mentioned explicitly in the [[United States Constitution]], nor is there any explicit mention in the Constitution of an executive privilege to resist such requests from Congress or courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald Cox|Cox, Archibald]].  [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol122/iss6/1 "Executive Privilege"], ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', Volume 122, page 1384 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has ruled this privilege may qualify as an element of the [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] doctrine, derived from the supremacy of the executive branch in its own area of Constitutional activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority in ''US v. Nixon'' noted: "Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 ''United States v. Nixon''], 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (Supreme Court opinion at FindLaw)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary, instead of emanating from Congress.&lt;ref name=USvNixon&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 ''United States v. Nixon''], 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (Supreme Court opinion at FindLaw)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a "sufficient showing" that the "Presidential material" is "essential to the justice of the case". [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger|Warren Burger]] further stated that executive privilege would most effectively apply when the oversight of the executive would impair that branch's national security concerns.&lt;ref name=USvNixon /&gt;  Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the [[Congressional Research Service]],&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;Garvey, Todd.  [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/R42670.pdf Presidential Claims of Executive Privilege: History, Law, Practice, and Recent Developments], [[Congressional Research Service]], p. 1 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; only two federal court cases had addressed the merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those cases reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://openjurist.org/498/f2d/725/senate-select-committee-on-presidential-campaign-activities-v-m-nixon Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon]'', 498 F.2d 725 (D.C. Cir. 1974); ''[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1810993/committee-on-jud-us-house-of-repres-v-miers/ Comm. on the Judiciary v. Miers]'', 558 F. Supp. 2d 53 (D.D.C. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to which branch of government is requesting the information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether it involves a "presidential communications privilege" or instead a "[[deliberative process privilege]]" or some other type of privilege.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt; The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in [[common law]], whereas the presidential communications privilege is often considered to be rooted in separation of powers, thus making the deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Narayan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4406&amp;context=flr|title=Proper Assertion of the Deliberative Process Principle|author=Narayan, S.| page= 6|website=fordham.edu|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual deference in view of previous practice and precedents regarding the exercise of executive privilege.

==Early precedents==
[[Deliberative process privilege]] is a specific instance of the more general principle of executive privilege.  It is usually considered to be based upon common law rather than separation of powers, and its history traces back to the English crown privilege (now known as [[public-interest immunity]]).&lt;ref name=Narayan /&gt;  In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is another specific instance of executive privilege, usually considered as being based upon separation of powers, and for that reason it is more difficult to overcome than deliberative process privilege.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;  A significant requirement of the presidential communications privilege is that it can only protect communications sent or received by the President or his immediate advisors, whereas the deliberative process privilege may extend further down the chain of command.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;

In the context of privilege assertions by United States presidents, law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] has written: "In 1796, President [[George Washington]] refused to comply with a request by the House of Representatives for documents related to the negotiation of the then-recently adopted [[Jay Treaty]] with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The Senate alone plays a role in the ratification of treaties, Washington reasoned, and therefore the House had no legitimate claim to the material. Therefore, Washington provided the documents to the Senate but not the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20020206.html|title=A Brief History Of Executive Privilege, From George Washington Through Dick Cheney|author=Dorf, Michael |date=February 6, 2002 |website=Findlaw|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] continued the precedent for this in the trial of [[Aaron Burr]] for [[treason]] in 1809. Burr asked the court to issue a ''[[subpoena duces tecum]]'' to compel Jefferson to testify or provide his private letters concerning Burr. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], a strong proponent of the powers of the federal government but also a political opponent of Jefferson, ruled that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] to the Constitution, which allows for these sorts of court orders for criminal defendants, did not provide any exception for the president. As for Jefferson's claim that disclosure of the document would imperil public safety, Marshall held that the court, not the president, would be the judge of that. Jefferson refused to personally testify but provided selected letters.

In 1833, President [[Andrew Jackson]] cited executive privilege when Senator [[Henry Clay]] demanded he produce documents concerning statements the president made to his cabinet about the removal of federal deposits from the [[Second Bank of the United States]] during the [[Bank War]].&lt;ref&gt;David and Jeanne Heidler, ''Henry Clay: The Essential American'' (2010) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War era==
During the period of 1947–49, several major security cases became known to Congress. There followed a series of investigations, culminating in the famous [[Alger Hiss|Hiss]]-[[Whittaker Chambers|Chambers]] case of 1948. At that point, the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration issued a sweeping secrecy order blocking congressional efforts from FBI and other executive data on security problems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Security files were moved to the White House and Administration officials were banned from testifying before Congress on security related matters. Investigation of the State Department and other cases was stymied and the matter left unresolved.

During the [[Army–McCarthy hearings]] in 1954, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] used the claim of executive privilege to forbid the "provision of any data about internal conversations, meetings, or written communication among staffers, with no exception to topics or people." Department of Defense employees were also instructed not to testify on any such conversations or produce any such documents or reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Blacklisted by History p. 575&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to refuse the McCarthy Committee subpoenas of transcripts of monitored telephone calls from Army officials, as well as information on meetings between Eisenhower officials relating to the hearings. This was done in the form of a letter from Eisenhower to the Department of Defense and an accompanying memo from Eisenhower Justice. The reasoning behind the order was that there was a need for "candid" exchanges among executive employees in giving "advice" to one another. In the end, Eisenhower would invoke the claim 44 times between 1955 and 1960.

==''United States v. Nixon''==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
The Supreme Court addressed "executive privilege" in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the 1974 case involving the demand by [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] [[special prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]] that President [[Richard Nixon]] produce the audiotapes of conversations he and his colleagues had in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] in connection with criminal charges being brought against members of the Nixon Administration. Nixon invoked the privilege and refused to produce any records.

The Supreme Court did not reject the claim of privilege out of hand; it noted, in fact, "the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties" and that "[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process." This is very similar to the logic that the Court had used in establishing an "executive immunity" defense for high office-holders charged with violating citizens' constitutional rights in the course of performing their duties. The Supreme Court stated: "To read the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of 'a workable government' and gravely impair the role of the courts under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]]." Because Nixon had asserted only a generalized need for confidentiality, the Court held that the larger public interest in obtaining the truth in the context of a criminal prosecution took precedence.

"Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced into the difficult task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and the Executive's Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive's claims of confidentiality and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers and checks and balances. These 'occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two branches' are likely to be avoided whenever possible. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 United States v. Nixon], supra, at 692."&lt;ref&gt;Holding, Reynolds.

==Post-Watergate era==
===Reagan administration===
In November 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a directive regarding congressional requests for information. Reagan wrote that if Congress seeks information potentially subject to executive privilege, then executive branch officials should "request the congressional body to hold its request in abeyance" until the president decides whether to invoke the privilege.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;Savage, Charlie.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/us/politics/executive-privilege-sessions-trump.html  "Explaining Executive Privilege and Sessions’s Refusal to Answer Questions"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===George H. W. Bush administration===
Prior to becoming Attorney General in 1991, [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William P. Barr]] issued guidance in 1989 about responding to congressional requests for confidential executive branch information. He wrote: "Only when the accommodation process fails to resolve a dispute and a subpoena is issued does it become necessary for the president to consider asserting executive privilege".&lt;ref&gt;Barr, William.  [https://www.justice.gov/file/24236/download "Congressional Requests for Confidential Executive Branch Information"], U.S. Department of Justice (June 19, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savage /&gt;

===Clinton administration===
The Clinton administration invoked executive privilege on fourteen occasions.

In 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] became the first president since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court, when a federal judge ruled that Clinton aides could be called to testify in the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Peter; and Schmidt, Susan. {{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/starr050698.htm|accessdate=2007-03-27|title=President is Denied Executive Privilege | work=The Washington Post | date=July 22, 1998}} ''The Washington Post'', May 6, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Clinton exercised a form of negotiated executive privilege when he agreed to testify before the grand jury called by [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] only after negotiating the terms under which he would appear. Declaring that "absolutely no one is above the law", Starr said such a privilege "must give way" and evidence "must be turned over" to prosecutors if it is relevant to an investigation.

===George W. Bush administration===
The Bush administration invoked executive privilege on six occasions.

President [[George W. Bush]] first asserted executive privilege in December 2001 to deny disclosure of details regarding former Attorney General [[Janet Reno]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29bush.html|title=Bush Asserts Executive Privilege on Subpoenas|first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|date=June 29, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=June 3, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal involving [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) misuse of organized crime informants [[James J. Bulger]] and [[Stephen Flemmi]], and Justice Department deliberations about President Bill Clinton's fundraising tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A16FC3B5B0C778DDDAB0994D9404482 |title=Bush Claims Executive Privilege in Response to House Inquiry |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |work=The New York Times|date=2001-12-14 |accessdate=2007-07-17 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush invoked executive privilege "in substance" in refusing to disclose the details of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]'s meetings with energy executives, which was not appealed by the GAO. In a separate Supreme Court decision in 2004, however, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] noted "Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power 'not to be lightly invoked.'" ''[[United States v. Reynolds]]'', 345 U.S. 1, 7 (1953).

Further, on June 28, 2007, Bush invoked executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas requesting documents from former presidential counsel [[Harriet Miers]] and former political director [[Sara Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19480518|title=White House refuses to answer subpoenas|date=June 28, 2007|website=msn.com|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reason for these distinctions rests upon a bedrock presidential prerogative: for the President to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice and that free and open discussions and deliberations occur among his advisors and between those advisors and others within and outside the Executive Branch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 9, 2007, Bush again invoked executive privilege to block a congressional subpoena requiring the testimonies of Taylor and Miers. Furthermore, [[White House Counsel]] [[Fred F. Fielding]] refused to comply with a deadline set by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain its privilege claim, prove that the president personally invoked it, and provide logs of which documents were being withheld. On July 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite Miers and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Joshua Bolten]] for [[contempt of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House inches toward constitutional showdown with contempt vote |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/25/house.contempt/index.html |work=Politics |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = House Judiciary Reports Contempt Citations to the House of Representatives |publisher = [[U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary]] |date = July 25, 2007 |url = http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=837 |accessdate = 2007-07-26 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070725214703/http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=837 |archivedate = July 25, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, less than a week after claiming executive privilege for Miers and Taylor, Fielding effectively claimed the privilege again, this time in relation to documents related to the 2004 death of [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Ranger]] [[Pat Tillman]]. In a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Fielding claimed certain papers relating to discussion of the [[friendly fire]] shooting "implicate Executive Branch confidentiality interests" and would therefore not be turned over to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House Rebuffs Congress on Tillman Papers |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003788310_webtillman13.html |work=Politics |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510231247/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003788310_webtillman13.html |archivedate=May 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2007, Bush invoked the privilege for the fourth time in little over a month, this time rejecting a subpoena for [[Karl Rove]]. The subpoena would have required Rove to testify before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] in a probe over fired federal prosecutors. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]], Fielding claimed that "Rove, as an immediate presidential advisor, is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure and that relate to his official duties in that capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush won't let aide Rove testify to Congress|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0141867220070801 |work=Politics |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leahy claimed that President Bush was not involved with the decision to terminate the service of U.S. attorneys. Furthermore, he asserted that the president's executive privilege claims protecting both Bolten and Rove were illegal. The Senator demanded that Bolten, Rove, Sara Taylor, and [[J. Scott Jennings]] comply "immediately" with their subpoenas. This development paved the way for a Senate panel vote on whether to advance the citations to the full Senate. "It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover-up and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that same effort", Leahy concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leahy: Bush not involved in firings |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071130/ap_on_go_co/senate_prosecutors_17 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

{{as of|2008|July|17}}, Rove still claimed executive privilege to avoid a congressional subpoena. Rove's lawyer wrote that his client is "constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rove ignores committee's subpoena, refuses to testify|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/10/rove.subpoena/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-07-10 | date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama administration===
On June 20, 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] asserted executive privilege in order to withhold certain [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] documents related to the [[Operation Fast and Furious]] controversy ahead of a [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] vote to hold Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in [[contempt of Congress]] for refusing to produce the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|title=Obama team: 'Fast and Furious' documents are privileged|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/06/obama-team-fast-and-furious-documents-are-privileged/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savage | first=Charlie | title=House Recommends Contempt for Holder | website=The New York Times | date=June 8, 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/us/obama-claims-executive-privilege-in-gun-case.html | access-date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, the House Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to hold Holder in contempt of Congress over not releasing the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madhani and Davis|first=Aamer and Susan|title=House panel votes to cite Holder for contempt of Congress|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-06-20/holder-contempt-House-vote/55717644/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive privilege was also used in a lawsuit stemming from the 2012 implementation of the "Net Worth Sweep" against [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]. The Obama administration did not disclose roughly 11,000 documents from the plaintiffs in the discovery process as they related to the reasoning behind the 2012 actions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====House investigation of the SEC====
Leaders of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) testified on February 4, 2009 before the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] subcommittee. The subject of the hearings was why the SEC had failed to act when [[Harry Markopolos]], a private fraud investigator from Boston, alerted the SEC, detailing his persistent and unsuccessful efforts to get the SEC to investigate [[Bernard Madoff]] beginning in 1999.&lt;ref name=henriques&gt;{{Cite news

===Trump administration===
While investigating [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] subpoenaed former FBI Director [[James Comey]] to testify. Comey was [[Dismissal of James Comey|fired]] several weeks before being subpoenaed but had appeared before the committee once before in March while still serving as director. Less than a week before the scheduled hearing, it was reported that [[President Trump]] was considering invoking executive privilege to prevent Comey's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/politics/trump-james-comey-executive-privilege/index.html%3E|title=Error|website=CNN|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-02/trump-reviewing-whether-to-block-comey-testimony-spokesman-says|title=Trump Reviewing Whether to Block Comey Testimony to Senate|date=June 2, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 3, 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to attorney Page Pate, it seemed unlikely that executive privilege would be applicable, as Trump had publicly spoken about the encounters in question multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pate|first1=Page|title=Trump can't stop Comey with executive privilege|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/03/opinions/trump-cant-stop-comey-testimony-pate/index.html|accessdate=June 3, 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]], a White House spokesman, released a statement on June 5 stating: "The president's power to assert executive privilege is very well-established. However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey's scheduled testimony."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/05/comey-trump-239146|title=White House: Trump will not assert executive privilege to block Comey's testimony|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 2017, other officials in the Trump administration, including [[Dan Coats]] and [[Jeff Sessions]], declined to describe in congressional hearings conversations they had with President Trump, on the ground that they wanted Trump to have an opportunity to decide whether to invoke executive privilege.  According to [[Robert S. Litt]], former general counsel of the [[Director of National Intelligence|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] in the Obama administration, this argument may be legitimate under the presidential communications privilege:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he privilege belongs to the President, and inferior officers should not take it upon themselves to disclose such communications without express permission from the White House. Certainly that is how these issues were handled in the Obama Administration: when Congress asked an agency for information about presidential communications, as it often did, the agency consulted with the White House to see if there were objections to responding.&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Robert.  [https://www.lawfareblog.com/some-thoughts-coats-rogers-testimony-and-executive-privilege "Some Thoughts on the Coats-Rogers Testimony and Executive Privilege"], [[Lawfare (blog)]] (June 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Paul.

Democratic members of Congress emphasized that they were not seeking classified information, and strongly objected to the rationale given by the Trump administration officials.&lt;ref&gt;Zapotosky, Matt.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jeff-sessions-finds-a-shield-in-executive-privilege--but-it-might-not-be-a-strong-one/2017/06/13/977677ce-5077-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html "Jeff Sessions finds a shield in executive privilege — but it might not be a strong one"], [[The Washington Post]] (June 13, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2018, [[Steve Bannon]], the former Trump political adviser, but who was no longer part of the Trump administration, appeared at the [[House Intelligence Committee]] under subpoena. According to committee members, he answered only 25 questions that had been pre-approved by the White House, in each to which he answered "no", and invoked the president's executive privilege in declining to answer any of the committee questions. Republican and Democratic members of the committee said they were considering seeking [[contempt of Congress]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/steve-bannon-scripted-questions-russia-probe-414755|title=Bannon limits answers to House after seeing Mueller|work=Politico|date=2018-02-15|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Robert Tennant''' (September 1, 1866 - September 9, 1957), best known as '''F. R. Tennant''' was a British [[theologian]], [[philosopher of religion]] and writer.

==Career==

Tennant studied mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry at [[Caius College]], Cambridge (1885–89) prior to becoming a theologian. After hearing the 1889 Huxley lectures, Tennant’s interest in religion grew in the 1890s ultimately leading him to prepare for ordination in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Frances Thelen (1968) biography in Tennant F.R. (1903) ''The Sources of Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin'' (Schoken: New York); Delton L. Scudder (1940) ''Tennant’s Philosophical Theology'' (Yale University Press: New Haven; Humphrey Milford: London; Oxford University Press: Oxford). Also, see the website: http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/t/tennant_f_r.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was ordained he taught science at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School (1891–94), and became a lecturer in Theology and [[fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://trinitycollegechapel.com/about/memorials/brasses/tennant/ |publisher=trinitycollegechapel.com |title= Frederick Robert Tennant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an Anglican theologian, Tennant assimilated much of Huxley’s lectures culminating in the 1901-1902 [[Hulsean Lectures|Hulsean]] Lecture entitled ''Origin and Propagation of Sin'' where he integrated evolutionary ideas into a Christian synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick R. Tennant. 1906. ''The Origin and Propagation of Sin: Being the Hulsean lectures delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1901-2''. 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tennant's goals in his writings was an integrative synthesis of the doctrines of the fall and original sin with Huxley’s claims of conflict between [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] thought and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Brannan, D.K. (2007) Darwinism and Original Sin: Frederick R. Tennant’s Integration of Darwinian Worldviews into Christian Thought in the Nineteenth Century. ''Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science'' 1:187-217; Brannan, D.K. (2011) Darwinism and Original Sin: Frederick R. Tennant’s analysis of the Church Fathers’ understanding of Original Sin and an exegesis of St. Paul. ''Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science'' 8:139-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and purpose==

Tennant believed that the existence of a god was needed to explain the purposive quality of evolution. Tennant was the first theist widely known to put forward such an argument. In volume 2 of his book ''Philosophical Theology'' he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The multitude of interwoven adaptations by which the world is constituted a theatre of life, intelligence, and morality, cannot reasonably be regarded as an outcome of mechanism, or of blind formative power, or aught but purposive intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/design/#SH1d |publisher= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was an advocate of [[theistic evolution]]. Tennant made an [[argument from design]] from the "quality of the evolution process".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibrahim Kalin|Kalin, Ibrahim]]. (2014). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam''. Oxford University Press. p. 182. {{ISBN|978-0-19-935843-4}} "Guided" or "theistic evolution is an attempt by the theistic camp to digest Darwinian revolution and integrate it in a "design" worldview. Its first proponent was Frederick Robert Tennant, who argued for design to be seen in the "quality of the evolution process" and not in terms of the functional complexity of organisms."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gadadhara Pandita''', also known as Pandita Goswami, was a close associate of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De|first1=Sushil K.|title= Early History of the Vaishnava Faith and Movement in Bengal |date=1942| isbn=|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadadhara Pandita Goswami is described as a handsome young boy, student of [[Nyaya]] (Indian logic) and ranked highest among the inner circle of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kapoor|first1=O.B.L.|title= The Philosophy and Religion of Sri Caitanya |date=1976| isbn=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandita Goswami is considered to be [[Radharani]] herself. In the later part of his life, Gadadhara Pandita lived in the Tota Gopinatha Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jagannathpuri.in/index.php/tota-gopinatha-temple|title=Tota Gopinatha temple|last=|first=|publisher= |date= |website=www.jagannathpuri.in |access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The local legend around the temple is that the deity of Krishna in the temple sat down to accommodate Pandit Goswami's worship after he had become feeble due to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's departure. Others say that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Pandit Goswami disappeared on the same day inside the Gundicha Temple of Puri, Odisha &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Das|first1=Vrindaban|title= Shri Chaitanya Bhagawat, Publication=Reflect Publication, Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Gadadhara Parivara ==
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally gave Gadadhara Pandita Goswami the deity to worship, and the responsibility to teach Srimad Bhagavatam.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sri Guru Darsanam|last= Shastri|first= Haridas|publisher=Shri Haridas Shastri Goseva Sansthan |year=2015|isbn=978-81-929328-0-4|location=Vrindavan|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandita Goswami's guru was Pundarika Vidyanidhi. Pandita Goswami initiated Bhugarbha Goswami, and Bhugarbha Goswami gave rise to one line of the Gadadhara parivara. The Gadadhara Parivāra (Parivāra means 'family') is one among different traditional Chaitanya lineages that have continued till modern times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sriharidasniwas.org/index.php/sri-guru-parampara/our-guru-shishya-parampara.html |title=Our Guru Shishya parampara|last=|first=|publisher= |date= |website=sriharidasniwas.org |access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the [[Advaita Parivāra]] is another example. 

Because Pandita Goswami is [[Radharani]] herself, the followers of Pandita Goswami aspire for mādhurya-rasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jiva.org/worship-of-sri-sri-gaura-gadadhara/ |title=Worship of Sri Sri Gaura Gadadhara|last=|first=|publisher= |date= |website=jiva.org |access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of the Gadadhara parivara is to worship the deities of Gaura and Gadadhara. 

Followers of the Gadadhara parivara are of the opinion that Rupa and Sanatana Goswami, Narottama Dasa Thakura Mahasaya and his guru Loknath Goswami were disciples of Gadadhara Pandita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jiva.org/sri-gadadhara-panditas-role-in-the-gaudiya-sampradaya/ |title=Sri Gadadhara Pandita’s Role in the Gaudiya Sampradaya
|last=|first=|publisher= |date= |website=jiva.org |access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others hold that Sanatana Goswami was the disciple of Vidyavacaspati, and Rupa Goswami was the disciple of Sanatana Goswami.

'''George Gleig''' [[FRSE]] FSA LLD (12 May 1753 – 9 March 1840) was a Scottish minister who transferred to the Episcopalian faith and became [[Primus of Scotland|Primus]] of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]].

==Life==
He was born at Boghall Farm, near [[Arbuthnott]] in [[Aberdeenshire (unitary authority area)|Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of a farmer. He was educated at Arbuthnott Parish School.

At the age of thirteen he entered [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]], where the first prize in [[mathematics]] and [[Physics|physical]] and moral sciences fell to him. In his twenty-first year he took orders in the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], and was ordained to the pastoral charge of a congregation at [[Pittenweem]], [[Fife]], whence he removed in 1790 to [[Stirling]]. He became a frequent contributor to the ''[[Monthly Review]]'', the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'' and the ''[[British Critic]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1786 he declined the office of [[bishop of Brechin]].&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;{{cite web |title=BrMS 3/DC 82/21 Miscellaneous transcriptions |url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=((text)=%27gleig%27) |website=Archive Services Online Catalogue |publisher=University of Dundee |accessdate=31 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816225955/http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27gleig%27%29 |archivedate=16 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote several articles for the third edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', and on the death of the editor, [[Colin Macfarquhar]], in 1793, was engaged to edit the remaining volumes. Among his principal contributions to this work were articles on [[Instinct]], [[Theology]] and [[Metaphysics]]. The two supplementary volumes were mainly his own work.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1797 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]], [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|Sir James Hall]], and [[Dugald Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was twice chosen [[bishop of Dunkeld]], but the opposition of [[John Skinner (bishop)|Bishop Skinner]], afterwards Primus of Scotland, rendered the election on both occasions ineffectual. In 1808 he was consecrated assistant and successor to the [[bishop of Brechin]], in 1810 was preferred to the sole charge, and in 1816 was elected Primus of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], in which capacity he greatly aided in the introduction of many useful reforms, in fostering a more catholic and tolerant spirit, and in cementing a firm alliance with the sister [[Church of England]]. 

He died at [[Stirling]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He is buried in the chapel of Greyfriars Church in Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

*''Letters containing an Apology for the Episcopal Church of Scotland'' (1787)
*''Some Account of the Life and Writings of the late [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]'' (1812)
*''Directions on the Study of Theology'' (1827)

Besides various sermons, Gleig was the author of ''Directions for the Study of Theology'', in a series of letters from a bishop to his son on his admission to holy orders (1827); an edition of [[Thomas Stackhouse]]'s ''History of the Bible'' (1817); and a life of Robertson the historian, prefixed to an edition of his works. See ''Life of Bishop Gleig'', by the Rev. W. Walker (1879). Letters to [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]] of Edinburgh and [[John Douglas (Anglican bishop)|John Douglas]], bishop of Salisbury, are in the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Family==

In 1789 he married Janet Hamilton (a widow née Fullton). She died in 1824.

His third and only surviving son, [[George Robert Gleig|George Robert]], was a noted soldier and chaplain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">In [[Christian theology]], the '''gift of miracles''' is among the [[spiritual gift]]s (''charismata'') mentioned by [[St. Paul]] in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]. As a [[charism]], the gift is imparted to individuals by the power of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="cathen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Devine | first = Arthur |title = Gift of Miracles | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = 10 | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | year = 1911 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10350a.htm | accessdate = 18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of [[Cessationism]] held that the ''charismata'' were exclusively for Apostolic times, and therefore the gift of miracles ceased with the writing of the last book of the Bible or the death of [[St. John the Apostle]].  In [[Continuationism]], on the other hand, the gifts are held to be possible throughout the history of Christianity, and to have occurred since Apostolic times.

==Catholicism==
In [[Catholicism]], the gift is one of the extraordinary [[Grace in Christianity|graces]] of the Holy Spirit imparted to certain individuals so that Christ's doctrine may become credible and Christians confirmed in their faith. Although [[miracle]]s are necessarily the work of God, men and angels may be said to work miracles in a threefold way

* by their prayers invoking a miraculous effect;
* by disposing or accommodating the materials, as it is said of the angels that they will in the resurrection collect the dust of the dead bodies that these may be re-animated by the Divine power,
* by performing some other act in co-operation with the Divine agency, as in the case of the application of relics, or of visits to holy places which God has marked out for special and extraordinary favours of this kind. 

Like other ''charismata'', these are special and extraordinary powers vouchsafed by God only to a few, and primarily for the spiritual good of others rather than of the recipient.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

==Pentecostals and charismatics==
In [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christianity, it is believed that God continues to operate this gift through believers with the gift of faith.&lt;ref name=foundations338&gt;Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; This gift does not, however, make one a miracle worker since it is God who performs the miracle. The emphasis is on "the power of God operating by the Spirit of God in and through the Church of God".&lt;ref name=GeeGifts54&gt;Gee, Donald. ''Concerning Spiritual Gifts''. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House. {{ISBN|0-88243-486-1}}. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; God always signifies or teaches something with miraculous manifestations.&lt;ref name=foundations338/&gt;

'''Helmut Richard Niebuhr''' (September 3, 1894 – July 5, 1962) is considered one of the most important [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] [[ethics|ethicists]] in 20th century [[United States|America]], most known for his 1951 book ''Christ and Culture'' and his posthumously published book ''The Responsible Self''.  The younger brother of theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], Richard Niebuhr taught for several decades at the [[Yale Divinity School]]. Both brothers were, in their day, important figures in the [[neo-orthodox]] theological school within American Protestantism. His theology (together with that of his colleague at Yale, [[Hans Wilhelm Frei]]) has been one of the main sources of [[narrative theology|postliberal]] theology, sometimes called the "Yale school".  He influenced such figures as [[James Gustafson]], [[Stanley Hauerwas]], and [[Gordon D. Kaufman|Gordon Kaufman]].

==Life==
Niebuhr was born in [[Wright City, Missouri]], the son of Gustav Niebuhr, a minister in the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]]. His family moved to [[Lincoln, Illinois]] in 1902.&lt;ref name="Reinhold Niebuhr A Biography"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Richard|title=Reinhold Niebuhr|year=1985|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=006250343X|pages=5 to 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from [[Elmhurst College]] in 1912, and [[Eden Theological Seminary]] in 1915. He would later obtain a master's degree from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1918, and his Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in 1924. He started his working career as a [[reporter]] in [[Lincoln, Illinois]] in 1915 and 1916. He was ordained a minister in the Evangelical Synod in 1916, and served with that body in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], through 1918.  (The Synod merged in 1934 with the [[German Reformed Church in the United States]]; the subsequently formed [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]] united in 1957 with the [[Congregational Christian Churches]] to form the [[United Church of Christ]].)  While living in St. Louis, he was a member and leader in Evangelical United Church of Christ in Webster Groves, Missouri, and taught at [[Eden Theological Seminary]] from 1919 to 1924 and from 1927 to 1931.  Between 1924 and 1927, he was the President of [[Elmhurst College]]. He taught at [[Yale]] from 1931 to 1962, specializing in [[theology]] and [[Christian ethics]].

==Teachings==
Niebuhr was concerned throughout his life with the absolute sovereignty of God and the issue of historical relativism. He considered [[Karl Barth]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] to be his main influences. He accepted from Barth and neo-orthodoxy the absolute transcendence of God. He believed that God is above history, that he makes commands upon human beings, and that all history is under the control of this God. Niebuhr borrowed often from [[Paul Tillich]]'s notion of God. He was comfortable describing God as Being-itself, the One, or the [[Ground of being|Ground of Being]]. In this regard, Niebuhr held something of a middle ground between the dogmatic, confessional theology of Karl Barth and the philosophically oriented neo-liberalism of Paul Tillich.

Niebuhr was also concerned with historical [[relativism]]. While God may be absolute and transcendent, human beings are not. Humans are a part of the flux and movement of the world. Because of this, how God is apprehended is never permanent. God is always understood differently by people at different times in history and in different social locations.  Niebuhr's theology shows great sensitivity to how expressions of faith differ from one religious community to another. His thought in some respects anticipated latter-day liberal Protestant concerns about [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and tolerance. However, in ''The Kingdom of God in America'' (1937), he also criticized the liberal [[social gospel]], describing its message as, "A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Kingdom of God in America | origyear = 1937 | place = New York | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1959 | page = 193}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-09-011-c | newspaper = Touchstone | title = The Comforting Doctrine of Hell}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Niebuhr was, by training, a Christian [[ethics|ethicist]]. In this capacity, his biggest concern was how human beings relate to God, to each other, to their communities, and to the world. Niebuhr's theological ethics can be described as relational. His greatest ethical treatise is ''The Responsible Self'', published shortly after his death. It was intended to be the seed of a much larger book on ethics.  His sudden death prevented his writing this work. In ''The Responsible Self'', Niebuhr dealt with human beings as responding agents. Human beings are always "in response" to some influence, whether another human being, a community, the natural order or history, or, above all, God.

===''Christ and Culture''===
His most famous work is ''Christ and Culture.'' It is often referenced in discussions and writings on a Christian's response to the world's culture. In the book, Niebuhr gives a history of how Christianity has responded to culture. He outlines five prevalent viewpoints:

:'''Christ against Culture.''' For the exclusive Christian, history is the story of a rising church or Christian culture and a dying pagan civilization.

:'''Christ of Culture.''' For the cultural Christian, history is the story of the Spirit’s encounter with nature.

:'''Christ above Culture.''' For the synthesist, history is a period of preparation under law, reason, gospel, and church for an ultimate communion of the soul with God.

:'''Christ and Culture in Paradox.''' For the dualist, history is the time of struggle between faith and unbelief, a period between the giving of the promise of life and its fulfillment.

:'''Christ Transforming Culture.''' For the conversionist, history is the story of God’s mighty deeds and humanity’s response to them.  Conversionists live somewhat less "between the times" and somewhat more in the divine "now" than do the followers listed above.  Eternity, to the conversionist, focuses less on the action of God before time or life with God after time, and more on the [[presence of God]] in time.  Hence the conversionist is more concerned with the divine possibility of a present renewal than with conservation of what has been given in creation or preparing for what will be given in a final redemption.

'''''Happy''''' is a 2011 feature documentary film directed, written, and co-produced by [[Roko Belic]]. It explores human happiness through interviews with people from all walks of life in 14 different countries, weaving in the newest findings of [[positive psychology]].

Roko Belic was inspired to create the film after producer/director [[Tom Shadyac]] showed him an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' titled "A New Measure of Well Being from a Happy Little Kingdom".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The article ranks the United States as the 23rd-happiest country in the world. Shadyac then suggested that Belic make a documentary about happiness. Belic spent several years interviewing hundreds of people, from leading happiness researchers to a rickshaw driver in [[Kolkatta]],&lt;ref name="Huffing Post Article"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roko-belic/happy-documentary_b_1220111.html|title=The Search for Happiness |work=The Huffing Post |date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a family living in a cohousing community in Denmark, a woman who was run over by a truck, a [[Cajun]] fisherman, and more.

==Production==
Belic and his brother [[Adrian Belic]] shot the film on three [[Sony Z1U]] HDV video cameras. They interviewed a number of psychologists around the world, including [[Ed Diener]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Illinois]]; [[Richard Davidson]], a professor at the University of Wisconsin's Lab of Affective Neuroscience; and [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], professor at the [[University of California, Riverside]] and author of ''[[The How of Happiness]]''.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal Speakeasy Entertainment Blog"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/05/the-secret-of-happiness-a-documentarian-looks-for-the-answer/|title=The Secret of Happiness - A Documentarian Looks for the Answer|date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 8, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Miguel|last=Gonzalez Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-production==
[[Vivien Hillgrove]] edited the film. Belic received the majority of the budget from [[Tom Shadyac]] to complete principal photography and post-production. The filmmakers then turned to [[crowdsource]] fundraising website [[Kickstarter]] to raise the finishing funds for the film. The Kickstarter campaign raised $36,000 in July 2010.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal Speakeasy Entertainment Blog"/&gt;

'''Herbert Marcuse''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr|ˈ|k|uː|z|ə}}; {{IPA-de|maɐ̯ˈkuːzə|lang}}; July 19, 1898 – July 29, 1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory|Critical Theory]]. Born in [[Berlin]], Marcuse studied at the [[University of Berlin|universities of Berlin]] and then at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], where he received his PhD.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings. Westview Press, Boulder, CO. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent figure in the Frankfurt-based [[Institute for Social Research]] – what later became known as the [[Frankfurt School]]. He was married to Sophie Wertheim (1924–1951), Inge Neumann (1955–1973), and Erica Sherover (1976–1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/sophie/sophie.htm |title=Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/inge/inge.htm |title=Inge Neumann (1913–1973) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/ricky/ricky.htm |title=Erica Sherover-Marcuse (1938–1988) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his written works, he criticized [[capitalism]], modern technology, [[historical materialism]] and entertainment culture, arguing that they represent new forms of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. "A Survey of Modern Social Theory". Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US government service for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) where he criticized the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in the book ''[[Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis]]'' (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the [[New Left]] and the student movements of [[West Germany]], France, and the United States; some consider him the "father of the New Left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKs0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177|page=177|title=The End of the Experiment: The Rise of Cultural Elites and the Decline of America's Civic Culture|first=Stanley|last=Rothman|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351295628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known works are ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955) and ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964). His [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally.  He viewed the integration of [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] and ''[[Logos]]'' to be the liberation of society.&lt;ref name=marcuse64&gt;[https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm6.html Marcuse 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eroscivil /&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/ ''SEP'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kApRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=marcuse+eros+and+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=marcuse%20eros%20and%20logos&amp;f=false | title=Eros and Revolution: The Critical Philosophy of Herbert Marcuse| isbn=9789004308701| last1=Castro| first1=Javier Sethness| date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Herbert Marcuse was born July 19, 1898, in [[Berlin]], to Carl Marcuse and Gertrud Kreslawsky. His family was [[Jewish]]. In 1916 he was drafted into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], but only worked in horse stables in Berlin during [[World War I]]. He then became a member of a Soldiers' Council that participated in the aborted [[socialism|socialist]] [[Spartacist uprising]]. He completed his PhD thesis at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1922 on the German ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' after which he moved back to Berlin, where he worked in publishing. In 1924 he married Sophie Wertheim, a mathematician. He returned to [[Freiburg]] in 1928 to study with [[Edmund Husserl]] and write a [[habilitation]] with [[Martin Heidegger]], which was published in 1932 as ''[[Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity]]'' (''Hegels Ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit''). This study was written in the context of the Hegel renaissance that was taking place in Europe with an emphasis on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ontology of life and history, idealist theory of spirit and dialectic.&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm|title=Illuminations: Kellner|author=Douglas Kellner|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his academic career blocked by the rise of the [[Third Reich]], in 1933 Marcuse joined the [[Institute for Social Research]], popularly known as the [[Frankfurt School]], in 1932. He went almost at once into exile with them, first briefly in [[Geneva]], then in the [[United States]]. Unlike some others, Marcuse did not return to [[Germany]] after the war, and when he visited Frankfurt in 1956, the young [[Jürgen Habermas]] was surprised to discover that he was a key member of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Theory.html?id=sf93K6SYMxIC |title=Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings|author=Lemert, Charles|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=9780786749577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Marcuse published his first major review, of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]''. In this review, Marcuse revised the interpretation of [[Marxism]], from the standpoint of the works of the early Marx.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

While a member of the Institute of Social Research, Marcuse developed a model for critical social theory, created a theory of the new stage of state and monopoly capitalism, described the relationships between philosophy, social theory, and cultural criticism, and provided an analysis and critique of German fascism. Marcuse worked closely with critical theorists while at the institute.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Emigration to the United States===
After emigrating from Germany in 1933, Marcuse immigrated to the United States in 1934, where he became a citizen in 1940. Although he never returned to Germany to live, he remained one of the major theorists associated with the Frankfurt School, along with [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (among others). In 1940 he published ''Reason and Revolution'', a dialectical work studying [[G. W. F. Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].

===World War II===

During World War II, Marcuse first worked for the US [[Office of War Information]] (OWI) on anti-Nazi propaganda projects. In 1943, he transferred to the [[Research and Analysis Branch]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

Directed by the Harvard historian [[William L. Langer]], the Research and Analysis Branch was in fact the biggest American research institution in the first half of the twentieth century. At its zenith between 1943 and 1945, it comprised over twelve hundred employees, four hundred of whom were stationed abroad. In many respects, it was the site where post–World War II American social science was born, with protégés of some of the most esteemed American university professors, as well as a large contingent of European intellectual émigrés, in its ranks.

These men comprised the "theoretical brain trust" of the American war machine, which, according to its founder, [[William J. Donovan]], would function as a "final clearinghouse" for the secret services—that is, as a structure that, although not engaged in determining war strategy or tactics, would be able to assemble, organize, analyze, and filter the immense flow of military information directed toward Washington, thanks to the unique capacity of the specialists on hand to interpret the relevant sources.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Reports on Nazi Germany. The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort by [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], Herbert Marcuse &amp; [[Otto Kirchheimer]] Edited by Raffaele Laudani (Princeton University Press 2013) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943, Marcuse joined his fellow [[Frankfurt School]] scholar [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] in R &amp; A's Central European Section as senior analyst and rapidly established himself as "the leading analyst on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Laudani, Secret Reports p3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the OSS in 1945, Marcuse was employed by the [[US Department of State]] as head of the Central European section, retiring after the death of his first wife in 1951.

===Post-war===
In 1952, Marcuse began a teaching career as a political theorist, first at [[Columbia University]], then at [[Harvard University]]. Marcuse worked at [[Brandeis University]] from 1958 to 1965, then at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement. It was during his time at [[Brandeis University]] that he wrote his most famous work, ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishers. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse was a friend and collaborator of the [[political sociology|political sociologist]] [[Barrington Moore Jr.]] and of the political philosopher [[Robert Paul Wolff]], and also a friend of the [[Columbia University]] sociology professor [[C. Wright Mills]], one of the founders of the [[New Left]] movement.  In his "Introduction" to ''One-Dimensional Man'', Marcuse wrote, "I should like to emphasize the vital importance of the work of C. Wright Mills."&lt;ref&gt;''One-Dimensional  Man (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period, Marcuse rejected the theory of [[class struggle]] and the Marxist concern with labor, instead claiming, according to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant." He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192851093|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse's critiques of [[capitalism|capitalist]] society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests and his essay ''[[Repressive Tolerance]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt; Marcuse soon became known in the media as "Father of the New Left."&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  Contending that the students of the sixties were not waiting for the publication of his work to act,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/70s/Bourne1979MarcuseGrandfatherNewLeft.pdf Tom Bourne (Sept. 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse brushed the media's branding of him as "Father of the New Left" aside lightly,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt; saying "It would have been better to call me not the father, but the grandfather, of the New Left."&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  His work heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]]. He had many speaking engagements in the US and [[Western Bloc]] in the late 1960s and 1970s. He became a close friend and inspirer of the French philosopher [[André Gorz]].

Marcuse defended the arrested [[East Germany|East German]] dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]] (author of ''Die Alternative: Zur Kritik des real existierenden Sozialismus'' [trans., ''The Alternative in Eastern Europe'']), discussing in a 1979 essay Bahro's theories of "change from within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefan Meretz |url=http://www.opentheory.org/marcuse_ueber_bahro/text.phtml |title=open theory · offene theorie: Protosozialismus und Spätkapitalismus.

Among those who critiqued him from the left were [[Marxist humanism|Marxist-humanist]] [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], fellow German emigre [[Paul Mattick]], both of whom subjected ''One-Dimensional Man'' to a Marxist critique, and [[Noam Chomsky]], who knew and liked Marcuse "but thought very little of his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Barsky |first= Robert |year= 1997 |title= Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= MIT Press |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=RKUbyYPG4mcC&amp;pg=PA134 134] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse's 1965 essay "[[Repressive Tolerance]]", in which he claimed capitalist [[democracy|democracies]] can have [[totalitarian]] aspects, has been criticized by conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/haters/haters.htm marcuse.org (books about)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse argues that genuine tolerance does not permit support for "repression", since doing so ensures that marginalized voices will remain unheard. He characterizes tolerance of repressive speech as "inauthentic". Instead, he advocates a form of tolerance that is intolerant of repressive (namely right-wing) political movements:

{{quote|Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left.

Surely, no government can be expected to foster its own subversion, but in a democracy such a right is vested in the people (i.e. in the majority of the people). This means that the ways should not be blocked on which a subversive majority could develop, and if they are blocked by organized repression and indoctrination, their reopening may require apparently undemocratic means. They would include the withdrawal of toleration of speech and assembly from groups and movements that promote aggressive policies, armament, chauvinism, discrimination on the grounds of race and religion, or that oppose the extension of public services, social security, medical care, etc.&lt;ref name="marcuse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm |title=Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marcuse later expressed his radical ideas through three pieces of writing. He wrote ''[[An Essay on Liberation]]'' in 1969, in which he celebrated liberation movements such as those in [[Vietnam]], which inspired many radicals. In 1972 he wrote ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'', which argues that the hopes of the 1960s were facing a counterrevolution from the right.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

After Brandeis denied the renewal of his teaching contract in 1965, Marcuse taught at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement and devoted the rest of his life to teaching, writing and giving lectures around the world. His efforts brought him attention from the media, which claimed that he openly advocated violence, although he often clarified that only "violence of defense" could be appropriate, not "violence of aggression". He continued to promote Marxian theory, with some of his students helping to spread his ideas. He published his final work ''[[The Aesthetic Dimension]]'' in 1979 on the role of art in the process of what he termed "emancipation" from bourgeois society.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Marriages===
[[Image:Grave-of-Herbert-Marcuse.jpg|thumb|Grave in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]], Berlin, where Marcuse's ashes were buried in 2003]]

Marcuse married three times. His first wife was [[mathematician]] Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951), with whom he had a son, Peter (born 1928). Herbert's second marriage was to Inge Neumann (1910–1973), the widow of his close friend [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] (1900–1954). His third wife was Erica Sherover (1938–1988), a former graduate student and forty years his junior, whom he married in 1976. His son [[Peter Marcuse]] is professor emeritus of [[urban planning]] at [[Columbia University]]. His granddaughter is the novelist [[Irene Marcuse]] and his grandson, [[Harold Marcuse]], is a professor of history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

===Death===
On July 29, 1979, ten days after his eighty-first birthday, Marcuse died after suffering a [[stroke]] during a visit to Germany. He had spoken at the Frankfurt ''Römerberggespräche'', and was on his way to the [[Max Planck Society#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in Starnberg, on invitation from second-generation Frankfurt School theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In 2003, after his ashes were rediscovered in the United States, they were buried in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]] in Berlin.

==Philosophy and views==
Marcuse's famous concept [[repressive desublimation]] refers to his argument that postwar mass culture, with its profusion of sexual provocations, serves to reinforce political repression. If people are preoccupied with inauthentic sexual stimulation, their political energy will be "desublimated"; instead of acting constructively to change the world, they remain repressed and uncritical. Marcuse advanced the prewar thinking of critical theory toward a critical account of the "one-dimensional" nature of bourgeois life in Europe and America. His thinking could, therefore, also be considered an advance of the concerns of earlier liberal critics such as [[David Riesman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Key_Contemporary_Social_Theorists.html?id=fTowST-_gmYC |title=Key Contemporary Social Theorists – Google Books|date= 2002-10-22|accessdate=2013-09-06|isbn=9780631219729|last1=Elliott|first1=Anthony|last2=Ray|first2=Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Marcuse's philosophy was centered around the belief that [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] had to integrate with ''[[Logos]]'' in order to strive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-I-Under-the-Rule-of-the-Reality-Principle1.pdf freudians.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://footnotes2plato.com/2011/03/25/psychoanalysis-and-philosophy-towards-the-eroticization-of-logos/ footnotes2plato.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defended Plato's argument that while Eros was constructive, ''Logos'' was superior and would eventually absorb it.&lt;ref name=eroscivil&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=autxu8JMA1gC&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Eros and Civilization|author=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=Beacon Press|page=125–126|date=1955|accessdate=September 1, 2018|isbn=9780807015551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''One Dimensional Man'', he argued that ''Logos'' would also liberate's one's gratification.&lt;ref name=marcuse64 /&gt;

Two aspects of Marcuse's work are of particular importance, first, his use of language more familiar from the critique of Soviet or Nazi regimes to characterize developments in the advanced industrial world; and second, his grounding of critical theory in a particular use of psychoanalytic thought. Both of these features of his thinking have often been misunderstood and have given rise to critiques of his work that miss the point of his targets.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishing. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse's early "Heideggerian Marxism"===
During his years in Freiburg, Marcuse wrote a series of essays that explored the possibility of synthesizing Marxism and Heidegger's fundamental ontology, as begun in the latter's work ''Being and Time'' (1927). This early interest in Heidegger followed Marcuse's demand for "concrete philosophy," which, he declared in 1928, "concerns itself with the truth of contemporaneous human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "On Concrete Philosophy." 1929. In Heideggerian Marxism. Eds. John Abromeit and Richard Wolin. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; These words were directed against the neo-Kantianism of the mainstream, and against both the revisionist and orthodox Marxist alternatives, in which the subjectivity of the individual played little role.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of Marcuse's perspectives on the Marxisms of his day, see Benhabib's introduction to Hegel's Ontology. (Marcuse, Herbert. Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity. 1932. Trans. Seyla Benhabib. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987. pp. xi–xix.)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Marcuse quickly distanced himself from Heidegger following Heidegger's endorsement of Nazism, it has been suggested by thinkers such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] that an understanding of Marcuse's later thinking demands an appreciation of his early Heideggerian influence.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Marcuse, Herbert. ''Heideggerian Marxism'', edited by Richard Wolin and John Abromeit, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005, pp. xi–xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse and capitalism===
Marcuse's analysis of capitalism derives partially from one of Karl Marx's main concepts: Objectification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objectification |title=Glossary of Terms: Ob |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which under capitalism becomes Alienation. Marx believed that capitalism was exploiting humans; that by producing objects of a certain character, laborers became alienated and this ultimately dehumanized them into functional objects themselves. Marcuse took this belief and expanded it. He argued that capitalism and industrialization pushed laborers so hard that they began to see themselves as extensions of the objects they were producing. At the beginning of ''One-Dimensional Man'' Marcuse writes, "The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/quotes/QuotRedThread.html#Capitalism marcuse.org (quotations)]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that under capitalism (in consumer society) humans become extensions of the commodities that they buy, thus making commodities extensions of people's minds and bodies. Affluent mass technological societies, he argues, are totally controlled and manipulated. In societies based upon mass production and mass distribution, the individual worker has become merely a consumer of its commodities and entire commodified way of life. Modern Capitalism has created false needs and false consciousness geared to consumption of [[commodities]]: it locks one-dimensional man into the one-dimensional society which produced the need for people to recognize themselves in their commodities.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very mechanism that ties the individual to his society has changed and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced. Most important of all, the pressure of consumerism has led to the total integration of the working class into the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system. Its political parties and trade unions have become thoroughly bureaucratized and the power of [[Negative dialectics|negative thinking]] or critical reflection has rapidly declined.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; The working class is no longer a potentially subversive force capable of bringing about revolutionary change. As a result, rather than looking to the workers as the revolutionary vanguard, Marcuse put his faith in an alliance between radical intellectuals and those groups not yet integrated into one-dimensional society, the socially marginalized, the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other ethnicities and other colors, the unemployed and the unemployable. These were the people whose standards of living demanded the ending of intolerable conditions and institutions and whose resistance to one-dimensional society would not be diverted by the system. Their opposition was revolutionary even if their consciousness was not.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Leszek Kołakowski]] described Marcuse's views as essentially anti-Marxist, in that they ignored Marx's critique of Hegel and discarded the historical theory of [[class struggle]] entirely in favor of an inverted Freudian reading of human history where all social rules could and should be discarded to create a "New World of Happiness." Kołakowski concluded that Marcuse's ideal society "is to be ruled despotically by an enlightened group [who] have realized in themselves the unity of ''Logos'' and Eros, and thrown off the vexatious authority of logic, mathematics, and the empirical sciences."&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"/&gt;

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] asserted that almost all of Marcuse's key positions are false and that his generalizations were based upon the total absence of any account of contemporary social structure. Featherstone criticized his portrayal of modern consumerism: it falsely assumed that consumers were completely passive, uncritically responding to corporate advertising.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Herbert Marcuse appealed to students of the New Left through his emphasis on the power of critical thought and his vision of total human emancipation and a non-repressive civilization. He supported students he felt were subject to the pressures of a commodifying system, and has been regarded as an inspirational intellectual leader.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt; He is also considered among the most influential of the Frankfurt School critical theorists on North American culture, due to his studies on student and counter-cultural movements on the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the 1960s, of which Marcuse was a vital part, lives on, and the [[Great Refusal]] is still practiced by oppositional groups and individuals who refuse to conform to the existing systems of oppression and domination.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

Wolf von Laer, in a podcast titled ''Campus Speech and the Libertarian Student Movement'', cites the influence of Marcuse as an unacknowledged source for the disruptive tactics of the "New Left" on today's campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-daily-podcast/campus-speech-libertarian-student-movement cato.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3538">'''Johannes Jacobus Poortman''' ([[Rotterdam]], April 26, 1896 &amp;ndash; [[The Hague]], December 21, 1970), studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at [[Groningen University]] under [[Professor]] [[Gerardus Heymans]].  In 1919 he received his [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]]; many years later he would also earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]. He was also a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]].

==Biography==
Poortman studied at the universities of [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] and at [[University of Vienna|Vienna]].  From 1932 to 1938 he was member of the Council of the [[Dutch Society for Psychical Research]]. From 1958 to 1966 he was a [[Professor]] of [[metaphysics]] at the [[University of Leiden]]. After he retired his chair was successively occupied by Prof. Dubbink, Prof. van Vledder and Prof. Gerding.

Poortman was the maker of the Repertory of Dutch philosophers, [[Repertorium der Nederlandse Wijsbegeerte]], which can be consulted on line at the site of the Leiden University.

He formulated the idea of a ''hylic [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]'' (in Dutch ''hylisch pluralisme'') of the plurality of matter, a model of the universe in which science and metaphysics are no longer contradictory. This vision was explained in his four volume work, ''Vehicles of Consciousness''.

==Poortmans categories==

Poortman distinguished six different [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] views of the world, which he named from ''Alpha'' to ''Zeta''.

# ''Alpha'': [[monism|monistic]] [[materialism]], the view that only one kind of stuff, i.e. [[matter]], ultimately exists in this [[universe]].
# ''Beta'': the view that only [[matter]] exists, but that there are different kinds of matter (hylic pluralism), specifically that [[God]] and other spiritual beings are created of a ''finer'' kind of matter, not visible to our scientific instruments.
# ''Gamma'': that only matter exists, with the exception of one single entity which is not material. This entity may be [[God]], [[Brahman]], etc. This is the view held by Poortman himself.
# ''Delta'': the view that two separate kinds of material and one kind of spiritual, immaterial entity exists, for example the early Christian and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] belief that man was made of [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]], where the first two are different forms of matter and the spirit is immaterial.
#''Epsilon'': a view in which matter and mind are totally separate things. This view was for example held by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' statement, see [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind dualism]].
#''Zeta'': monistic idealism or illusionism, where matter is seen as some kind of [[emanationism|emanation]] of God or another spiritual being. Especially this classification applies to the [[Brahman]] of the [[Hinduism]].

McMurtry's principal research project in Philosophy spanning over seven years has followed from the invitation by the Secretariat of [[UNESCO]]/[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]] (EOLSS, Paris-Oxford) to construct, author and edit ''Philosophy and World Problems''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/E6-25-toc.aspx EOLSS - Philosophy and World Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; as a multi-volume study of world philosophy. Three sub-volumes entitled "Western Philosophy and the Life-Ground", "Modes of Reason", and "Philosophy, Human Nature and Society" have been written with internationally distinguished philosophers contributing to five topic areas in each of these general fields.

The central title study by McMurtry, entitled, "What is Good, What is Bad? The Value of All Values Across Time, Place and Theories", is an encompassing in-depth critical study of known world philosophies and fields to explain the inner logic of each canon and school in relationship to world problems across languages and eras including the method of [[Value of life|life-value]] onto-[[axiology]] which is deployed to excavate, explain and resolve life-blind presuppositions of the world's major thought-systems from the ancients East and West to modern and contemporary philosophy.

==Biography==
John McMurtry received his doctorate from [[University College, London]] in the United Kingdom after completing his BA and MA at the University of Toronto, Canada where he also joined the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity.  Prior to doctoral studies, he was "a professional football player, print and television journalist, academic English teacher and world-traveller".&lt;ref name="uoguelph.ca"/&gt;  In his autobiographic article "The Human Vocation: An Autobiography of Higher Education" for the scholarly journal Nordicum-Mediterraneum,&lt;ref&gt;John McMurtry, [http://nome.unak.is/previous-issues/issues/vol3_2/mcmurtry.html "The Human Vocation: An Autobiography of Higher Education,"] ''Nordicum-Mediterraneum'': Icelandic E-journal of Nordic and Mediterranean Studies, 3(2), December 2008. Retrieved 28.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; McMurtry recounts the most salient moments of his formative years and states that he "came to philosophy as a last resort, because as someone naturally disposed to question unexamined assumptions and conventional beliefs, I could find no other profession which permitted this vocation at the appropriate level of research."

Value theory is his unifying field of research, as he has published and taught in as diverse fields of inquiry as [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]], Asian/[[Hindu philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]], [[philosophy of economics]], [[philosophy of education]], [[philosophy and literature]], [[philosophy of history]], post-Kant continental philosophy, the logic of natural language, and philosophy of the environment.

He is also part of the [[peace movement]] and [[international law]] study bodies.&lt;ref name="IPRD Advisory Board"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPRD Advisory Board|url=http://iprd.org.uk/?page_id=6327|work=Dr. John McMurtry|publisher=Institute for Policy Research and Development|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He served as Chair of Jurists, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Tribunal at the Alternative World Summit in Toronto, 1989.&lt;ref name="IPRD Advisory Board"/&gt; His professional work has been published in over 150 books and journals, including [[Inquiry]], the [[Monist]], the [[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]], [[Praxis International]], the [[Encyclopaedia of Ethics]], [[Atlantic Monthly]], [[Guardian Weekly]], and the [[Norton Anthology of Prose]].

==Political, philosophical, and economic views==
McMurtry's recent research has focused on the [[value of life|underlying value structure of economic theory]], its [[value of Earth|consequences for global civil and environmental life]], and the life ground and civil commons. McMurtry considers the global free market "inefficient and life-destructive" in proportion to how unregulated it is by life needs (that without which life capacity is reduced) and by life capital (human and ecological life wealth that reproduces more life wealth if not run down).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/columns/essays/2007/06/01/essay/ How the Free Market Destroys Life], by John McMurtry in ''[[The New Internationalist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, four principles of analysis and development are applied: the life-ground (all the conditions required to take one's next breath), life value (whatever enables life capacities), life capital (means of life that can produce more means of life without loss and cumulative gain), and civil commons (any social construct that enables universal access of community members to life goods through time).

In ''Unequal Freedoms:  The Global Market As An Ethical System'', 1998, he examines the underlying value system of the global market and claims that it constructs the opposite of the "free and democratic society" it claims to bring about.

In ''The Cancer Stage of Capitalism'', 1999, he claims a propensity of human societies to assume the social order in which they live as good however life-destructive they may be, focusing on [[financial capitalism]] as displaying the hallmark characteristics of a cancer invasion at the social level of life organization. He conceives "the civil commons" as a social immune system.

In ''Value Wars: The Global Market Versus the Life Economy'', 2002, he criticizes capitalist scientific technology, transnational trade apparatuses, NATO wars, and an expanding prison regime as symptoms of a "new totalitarianism cumulatively occupying the world and propelling civil and ecological breakdowns", and proposes constitutional standards of a "life economy".

McMurtry has previously supported [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] to explain the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center. In one lecture, he drew comparisons to the event of the [[Reichstag fire]] and argued that the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] has been lobbied for and exploited by multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="911 McMurtry"&gt;John McMurtry, [https://archive.org/details/mcmurtry Why the Facts of 9/11 are Suppressed,"] Intl. Citizens Inquiry into 9-11, Toronto, May 30, 2004. (video, 51 min.). Retrieved 28.01.2015&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 article on [[GlobalResearch.ca|Globalresearch.ca]], he advocates that the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center Towers]] could have only been brought down via a [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|controlled demolition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-moral-decoding-of-9-11-the-official-conspiracy-theory-the-free-press-and-the-9-11-turn/5479046|title=The Moral Decoding of 9-11.

'''Jon Elster''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|s|t|ər}}; born 22 February 1940, [[Oslo]]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] social and [[political theorist]] who has authored works in the [[philosophy of social science]] and [[rational choice theory]]. He is also a notable proponent of [[analytical Marxism]], and a critic of [[neoclassical economics]] and [[public choice theory]], largely on behavioral and psychological grounds.

In 2016, he was awarded the 22nd [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]] for his contributions to [[political science]].

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}
Elster earned his PhD in 1972 from the [[Paris Descartes University]] in Paris with a dissertation on [[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Yeghiayan| first =Eddie| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =JON ELSTER A Selected Bibliography| work =| publisher =UCI Department of Philosophy| date =| url =http://sun3.lib.uci.edu/~scctr/philosophy/elster.html| doi =| accessdate =2008-04-18| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20000816051346/http://sun3.lib.uci.edu/~scctr/philosophy/elster.html| archivedate =2000-08-16| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Raymond Aron]].  Elster was a member of the [[September Group]] for many years but left in the early 1990s.  Elster previously taught at the [[University of Oslo]] in the department of history and held an endowed chair at the [[University of Chicago]], teaching in the departments of philosophy and political science. He is now Robert K. Merton Professor of Social Sciences with appointments in Political Science and Philosophy at [[Columbia University]] and ''professeur honoraire'' at the [[Collège de France]]. He was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in 1997 and the Skytte Prize in Political Science in 2016.

He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26848/artikkel/vis.html?tid=27639|title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], of the [[American Philosophical Society]], of the [[Academia Europaea]], and a Corresponding [[Fellow of the British Academy]].

He is the son of journalist/author and CEO of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]  [[Torolf Elster]] and poet [[Magli Elster]].

Elster is doctor honoris causa at the universities of [[University of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Stockholm University|Stockholm]], [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|Trondheim]], [[Université Catholique de Louvain|Louvain-la-Neuve]], [[Torcuato di Tella University|Torcuato di Tella]], and the [[National University of Colombia]]. He is honorary professor at the [[University of Chongqing]].

==Philosophical work==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}
Much of Elster's writing is characterized by attempts to use analytical theories, especially [[rational choice theory]], as a springboard for philosophical and ethical analysis, with numerous examples from literature and history. "Elster has made important contributions to several fields," Daniel Little wrote in a review essay. "The breadth and depth of his writings are striking in a time of high specialisation; he is read and discussed by political scientists,legal scholars, economists and philosophers. His work is difficult to summarise in a slogan, but ... it is generally informed by a broad and deep acquaintance with relevant literature in economics, political science, history, philosophy, and psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter on Jon Elster by Daniel Little in ''New Horizons in Economic Thought: Appraisals of Leading Economists'', edited by Warren Samuels (Edward Elgar Publishing, 1992) {{ISBN|1-85278-379-6}}. Also available as download [http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~delittle/ELSTER3.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

A student of the philosophy of social science (a topic he investigated through case studies in ''Explaining Technical Change''), Elster strongly argued that social scientific explanations had to be built on top of [[methodological individualism]] (the belief that only individuals, not larger entities like "organizations" or "societies", can actually do things) and microfoundations (explaining big societal changes in terms of individual actions). He criticized Marxists and other social scientists for believing in [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] (the belief that institutions exist because of their effect on society) and instead tried to give Marxism a foundation in [[game theory]] (the economic notion that people make choices based on the expected benefits and the choices others are likely to make).

Elster wrote numerous books attempting to use rational choice theory for a wide variety of social explanations. "Rational choice theory is far more than a technical tool for explaining behaviour," he once wrote. "It is also, and very importantly, a way of coming to grips with ourselves - not only what we should do, but even what we should be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jon |last=Elster |title=Some unresolved problems in the theory of rational behaviour |journal=[[Acta Sociologica]] |year=1993 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=179–189 [p. 179] |doi=10.1177/000169939303600303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to apply it to topics as varied as politics (''Political Psychology''), bias and constrained preferences (''Sour Grapes''), emotions (''Alchemies of the Mind''), self-restraint (''Ulysses and the Sirens'', which was selected for the [[Norwegian Sociology Canon]]), Marxism (''[[Making Sense of Marx]]''), and more.

In doing so, he elucidated many issues with simplistic notions of rational choice: endogenous preference formation (certain actions today can change preferences tomorrow, so how does one decide which preferences one prefers?), framing (people express different preferences when the same question is asked different ways), imperfect rationality (weakness of the will, emotion, impulsiveness, habit, self-deception) and our adjustments for it, and [[time preference]]s, among others.

As time went on Elster began to sour on rational choice. A 1991 review in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted "Elster has lost his bearings, or at least his faith. [His latest books], he says, 'reflects an increasing disillusion with the power of reason'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hollis (philosopher)|Hollis, Martin]], [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hmelberg/elster/hollis91.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+22:33:17 Why Elster is stuck and needs to recover his faith], ''London Review of Books'', 13 January 1991&lt;/ref&gt; His magisterial 500-page book ''Explaining Social Behavior'' includes something of a recantation:

{{Quote|I now believe that rational-choice theory has less explanatory power than I used to think. Do real people act on the calculations that make up many pages of mathematical appendixes in leading journals? I do not think so. ... ''There is no general nonintentional mechanism that can simulate or mimic rationality.'' ... At the same time, the empirical support ... tends to be quite weak. This is of course a sweeping statement. ... let me simply point out the high level of disagreement among competent scholars ... fundamental, persistent disagreements among 'schools.' We ''never'' observe the kind of many-decimal-points precision that would put controversy to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Social Behaviour'', pp. 5, 25ff&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book discusses both rational behavior, but also irrational behavior, which Elster says is "widespread and frequent [but] not inevitable ... we ''want'' to be rational".&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Social Behaviour'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent book, ''Le désintéressement'' (part of a two-volume ''Traité critique de l’homme économique'') explores the ramifications of these insights for the possibility of disinterested action.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Le désintéressement'', by [[Gloria Origgi]], [http://berlinbooks.org/brb/2010/01/origgi-desinteressement/ The Possibility of Disinterested Action], The Berlin Review of Books, 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julije (Julio) Bajamonti''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Giulio Bajamonti''; 4 August 1744 &amp;ndash; 12 November 1800) was a medical historian, writer, translator, encyclopedist, historian, philosopher, and musician&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUG0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Julije+Bajamonti&amp;dq=Julije+Bajamonti&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=2 Music in Croatia] by Josip Andreis&lt;/ref&gt; from the city of [[Split (city)|Split]] in present-day [[Croatia]]. His wife was Ljuba Bajamonti, a Split commoner.

Bajamonti is known for composing the first opera in modern Croatia (''La traslazione di San Doimo'', performed only once), writing about the history of [[Split (city)|Split]] (unfinished and unpublished, and helping [[Alberto Fortis]], a Venetian, with his journey around [[Dalmatia]], which also included the discovery of the now famous South Slavic Muslim song, Hasanaginica.

After the fall of [[Venice]] in 1797 he urged that Dalmatia should be annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In his speech in 1797 he stated that Austria was the successor of the old Venetian state. Like many other intellectuals along the Dalmatian coast, Bajamonti wrote most of his works in Italian. [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] claims that there was no one in Italy who wrote better than Bajamonti during his time.

He performed his medical work in the cities of Split, [[Hvar]], and [[Kotor]] (in the area of Boka Kotorska in today's Montenegro).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slowaymusic.com/loader.php?section=skladatelj&amp;page=main&amp;subsect=bio&amp;id=51&amp;lang=en SlowayMusic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716092850/http://www.slowaymusic.com/loader.php?section=skladatelj&amp;page=main&amp;subsect=bio&amp;id=51&amp;lang=en |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name Kaniyan implies that he was an [[astronomer]] as it is a Tamil word referring [[mathematics]]. He was born and brought up in Mahibalanpatti, a village panchayat in the [[Thiruppatur taluk]] of [[Sivaganga district]] in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vē.

==Purananuru==

&lt;poem&gt;
யாதும் ஊரே யாவரும் கேளிர்
தீதும் நன்றும் பிறர்தர வாரா
நோதலும் தணிதலும் அவற்றோ ரன்ன
சாதலும் புதுவது அன்றே, வாழ்தல்
இனிதென மகிழ்ந்தன்றும் இலமே முனிவின்
இன்னா தென்றலும் இலமே, மின்னொடு
வானம் தண்துளி தலைஇ யானாது
கல் பொருது மிரங்கு மல்லல் பேரியாற்று
நீர்வழிப் படூஉம் புணைபோல் ஆருயிர்
முறை வழிப் படூஉம் என்பது திறவோர்
காட்சியில் தெளிந்தனம் ஆகலின், மாட்சியின்
பெரியோரை வியத்தலும் இலமே,
சிறியோரை இகழ்தல் அதனினும் இலமே. (புறம்: 192)
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
To us all towns are our own, everyone our kin, 
Life's good comes not from others' gifts, nor ill, 
Pains and pain's relief are from within, 
Death's no new thing, nor do our bosoms thrill
When joyous life seems like a luscious draught. 
When grieved, we patient suffer; for, we deem
This much-praised life of ours a fragile raft
Borne down the waters of some mountain stream
That o'er huge boulders roaring seeks the plain
Tho' storms with lightning's flash from darkened skies. 
Descend, the raft goes on as fates ordain. 
Thus have we seen in visions of the wise! 
We marvel not at the greatness of the great; 
Still less despise we men of low estate.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Kaniyan Poongundran, ''Purananuru'' - 192&lt;br /&gt;
(Adapted from translation by [[George Uglow Pope|G.U.Pope]], 1906)

==Cosmopolitanism==
Poongundranar rejected division of mankind into various categories and emphasised the universality of all humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pillai|first=Jaya|title=Educational system of the ancient Tamils|year=1972|publisher=South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Pub. Society|location=Tirunelveli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil bards and intellectuals of the time of Poongundranar and those preceding his age considered that all humans, whatever their rank or station in life, were alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ma̲raimalaiyạtikạl|title=Ancient and modern Tamil poets|year=1971|publisher=South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Pub. Society|location=Tirunelveli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural law==
Poongundranar states that the wooden log is carried by the water in its direction and similarly postulates that everything in life will also follow [[Natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Civacaṅkari|title=Knit India Through Literature: The South|publisher=Eastwest Books|location=1998|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; This he calls 'Way of Order'({{indic|lang=ta|indic=முறை வழி|trans=muṟai vazhi}}).

===Principles of the Way of Order===
Throughout his poem, Poongundranar lays down the principles of his version of [[natural law]]. The first part of the poem deals with the basic principles of the 'Way of Order'({{indic|lang=ta|indic=முறை வழி|trans=muṟai vazhi}}) which is his term for [[natural law]].

*Every human of every town is of the same value because they are கேளிர் (related). Hence, all people should be bound by one, same moral and legal code.
*நன்று ([[good and evil|good]]) and தீது ([[evil]]) do not come from others. Hence, humans are liable for both the pleasure and suffering they feel.
*Death is a natural part of the cycle of life, it is not new. Hence, this life must be made use of to its full potential.
*Yet, life should neither be full of pleasure (மகிழ்ச்சி), nor full of storms (புயல்) [of suffering]. Hence, life should be full of [[plenitude]].

===Allegory of the raft===
Poongundranar further goes onto explain these principles with an example of a raft.

*He compares birth to lightning, suggesting it can happen spontaneously anywhere.
*He gives an example of a raft which is allegorical to human life going downstream a steep hill, having a perilous journey through boulders and faces its climax just as in திறவோர் காட்சியில் (lit. Wisemen's vision means fate) which is death.
*He concludes that since everyone's life is like the raft's journey, it is irrational to magnify the பெரியோ[ர்] (accomplished people) and even worse to diminish சிறியோ[ர்](less accomplished people), because everyone goes through similar tribulations whatever their social estate might be.

==Influence==
Poongundranar was extremely influential in the revivalist [[Self-respect movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bharathi|first=S. Lakshmirathan|title=History and growth of rationalist movement in Thamizh Naadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sentence of his poem has been adopted as the motto of the World Thamizh Confederation to represent [[Tamil people]].

'''[[Karma]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]''' is one of the central issues addressed in Eastern philosophy, and an important part of its general practice.

==Overview==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], karma is created by physical actions, speech, and even thoughts. There is no concept of good nor bad karma—simply karma. Tibetan Buddhism teaches that every creature has transmigrated helplessly since beginningless time under the influence of ignorance and that their lack of understanding has led to performance of actions that have created connections with [[Samsara (Buddhism)|cyclic existence]]. To break this pattern, one must reorient their thinking to accord with reality.&lt;ref name="powers"&gt;Powers, John. Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism. Ithaca, NY, USA: Snow Lion Publications, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism draws on the current human intellect for problem solving as opposed to a higher deity or power.

Karma literally means "action," but it refers to action in a comprehensive way that includes thoughts, words, and deeds. Furthermore, it includes all the effects of these various kinds of action, both the immediate and visible effects and the long-term and invisible effects. Karma is the force that connects all the moments of life to each other and all things to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John M. Asian Philosophies. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of a person's own motivations and aspirations, the issue of others' karmic results is scarcely relevant. The importance is his or her own intention.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations. London: Routledge, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is a dependent entity-—one whose forces are a direct result of one’s thoughts, actions, and words. According to Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddha taught that one’s present life is only one in a beginningless series of incarnations, and each of these is determined by one’s actions in previous lives.&lt;ref name="powers" /&gt; Tibetan Buddhist philosophy believes that we are born again after we die, and subsequently, the karma we create in past lives is carried into our next. The Tibetan Buddhist concept of karma is similar to [[Newton’s laws of motion|Newton’s Third Law of Motion]], which holds that for every action there is a concordant reaction. This is presented as a universal law that has nothing to do with abstract ideas of justice, reward, or punishment.&lt;ref name="powers" /&gt; Karma, whether one is aware of it or not, is constantly being created. Tibetan Buddhism teaches that karma can have immediate reactions, or reactions may come later in life, in a future life, or in the [[bardo]] interval between lives, which creates the basis for the form in which the next life will take. By understanding the ball-and-chain relationship between karma and the individual, one can better understand Tibetan Buddhism as a whole.

==Gelugpa - Tsongkhapa==
[[Tsongkhapa]], the founder of the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, argued that the Prāsaṅgika position allowed for the postulation of something called an "act's cessation" (''las zhig pal'') which persists and is in fact a substance (''rdzas'' or ''dngos po'', S. ''vastu''), and which explains the connection between cause and result.{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=173}} [[Gorampa]], an important philosopher of the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, accused Tsongkhapa of a doctrinal innovation not legitimately grounded in Candrakīrti's work, and one which amounted to little more than a (non-Buddhist) [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] concept.{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=176}} Gelugpa scholars offered defenses of the idea.{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=176}}

==Nyingma==
In the [[Nyingma]] school, the teaching of karma is the third of four thoughts that turn the mind to dharma in the outer preliminaries.{{sfn|Norgay|2014|p=v}} It is taught within the [[Ngöndro#Nyingma|pre-liminary practices]] of the ''[[Longchen Nyingthig]]'', "The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse". This is a ''[[Terma (religion)|terma]]'' or "spiritual discovery", a hidden teaching from [[Padmasambhava]] which was revealed by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1729-1798).{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxii-xxxiv}} It is one of the most widely practiced teachings in the Nyingmapa school.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxv}} ''The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse'' teaching cycle has the following structure:{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxv-xxxviii}}
* Pre-liminary practices (''sngon 'gro''):
** Outer or external pre-liminaries: i)the freedoms and advantages of precious human rebirth; ii) the truth of impermanence and change; iii) the workings of karma;{{refn|group=note|karma as actions: Paltrul Rinpoche explains karma as actions: the cause and effect principle, which encompasses the whole process: cause, conditions, effect as action.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche| 2011 | p=382 }} Within this he means that his teacher’s mind is not beyond samsara, but is a perfect example to disciples on actions to follow the path in [[Yana (Buddhism)#Nine y.C4.81nas|progression of vehicles]];{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche| 2011 | p=382 }}}} iv) the suffering of living beings within [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]
** Inner pre-liminaries: taking refuge, arousing [[bodhicitta]], Vajrasattva, mandala offering, and [[Guru Yoga]]{{refn|group=note|Guru Yoga: Kenpo Ngawang Pelzang’s Guru Yoga practice explanation offers a karma purification practice where the student first visualizes the merit field, performs the seven branch offerings, prays with resolute trust, and takes the four empowerments with the teacher. The seven branches offering actions each have associated antidotes to poisons:{{sfn|Kenpo Ngawang Pelzang|2004|p=265-277}}
# Prostration for pride
# Offering for attachment
# Confession for aversion
# Rejoicing for jealously
# Exhorting Buddhas to turn dharma wheel for ignorance
# Requesting Buddha not to enter nirvana for wrong views
# Dedication for uncertainty.

Patrul Rinpoche gives a further explanation on confession, which may include all moral downfalls and harmful deeds, all unmentionable things, ten negative actions of body speech and mind, five crimes with immediate retribution, five crimes which are almost as grave, the four serious faults, eight perverse acts, and abusing the three jewels funds.{{sfn| Patrul Rinpoche|2011|p=322}}

The five crimes with immediate retribution are:{{sfn| Paultrul Rinpoche|2011|p=414}}
# killing one’s father or
# one’s mother or
# and Arhat;
# creating a split in the Sangha;
# malevolent causing a Buddha to bleed.

The five crimes which are almost as grave are:{{sfn| Paultrul Rinpoche|2011|p=414}}
# acting impurely with a female Arhat;
# killing a Bodhisattva;
# killing someone training toward the supreme level;
# stealing the Sangha’s sustenance;
# destroying a stupa.

The eight perverse acts are:
# criticizing good,
# praising evil,
# interrupting the accumulation of merit of a virtuous person,
# disturbing the minds of those who have devotion,
# giving up one’s varjra brothers and sisters,
# desecrating a mandala. {{sfn| Paultrul Rinpoche|2011|p=412}}}}
* Main practice (''dngos gzhi''): [[generation stage|generation phase]], [[completion stage|perfection phase]], and the [[Great Perfection]]{{refn|group=note | Transference: Khepo Ngawang Pelzang explains the swift transference practice action within great perfection, as a main practice branch. When awareness is vulnerable to circumstances, this belongs to the generation and perfection phase, with five transference methods.  Whereas, transference is unnecessary for someone with impregnable and perfectly stable awareness, who then must still meditate on the visualizations and transference practice itself.  These are "buddhahood without meditation" instructions. {{sfn| Khepo Ngawang Pelzang | 2004 | pp=281-286}}}}

=== Jigme Lingpa ===
In Jigme Lingpa's ''Mindfulness Application: Unique Great Perfection Preliminary Instructions'', karma arises to produce [[samsara]], which should be abandoned.  All the ten virtues and non-virtues will give results similar to the cause and can proliferate.  With this understand, cultivating a stable mind can avoid non-virtuous acts and appreciation for virtuous acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dahl |first1=Cortland |title=Entrance to the Great Perfection A Guide to the Dzogchen Preliminary Practices |date=2010-02-16 |publisher=Shambhala Publications |location=USA |isbn=9781559393393 |pages=56–59 of 260 |url=http://www.shambhala.com/entrance-to-the-great-perfection.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patrul Rinpoche===
[[Patrul Rinpoche]] wrote down Jigme Lingpa's pre-liminary practices from his teacher Jikmé Gyalwé Nyugu. These were translated into a book called ''The Words of My Perfect Teacher''. {{refn|group=note|Perfect Teacher: Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu, who received the teaching from Jigme Lingpa, was Paltrul Rinpoche’s Perfect Teacher.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=xxiiv}} Paltrul Rinpoche is considered to be Jigme Lingpa's speech emanation. {{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011|p=420}}}} {{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxv}} It describes ten negative actions which are to be avoided,{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2001|p=xxiv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=101-110}}{{refn|group=note|Ten actions to be avoided:{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|2001|p=xxiv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=101-110}}
# Taking life
# Taking what is not given
# Sexual misconduct
# Lying
# Sowing discord
# Harsh speech
# Worthless chatter
# Covetous
# Wishing harm on others
# Wrong views.}} and [[Merit (Buddhism)#Ten Wholesome Ways|positive actions to be adopted]].{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=117}} According to Patrul Rinpoche, each negative act produces four kinds of karmic effects:{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=112-117}}
# The fully ripened effect: rebirth in one of the lower realms of samsara;{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=112}}
# The effect similar to the cause: rebirth in a human form, in which we have a predisposition for the same negative actions, or undergo the same negative actions being afflicted on us;{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=112-116}}
# The conditioning effect: the negative act shapes our environment;{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=116}}
# The proliferating effect: a continuous repetition of former negative actions, which keeps us wandering endlessly in samsara.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=117}} Positive actions comprise the vow never to commit any of the negative actions.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=117}} According to Patrul Rinpoche, the quality of our actions determine all the pleasures and miseries that an individual experiences.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2001|p=118}}

===Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang===
[[Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang]], a qualified [[Longchen Nyingthig]] commentator, explained harmful karma’s remedy is to first meet the spiritual friend, then listen to teachings and reflect on them. When karmic obstacles arise, the student may generate confidence in karmic laws; regret past actions and the student may apply other appropriate remedies. {{sfn| Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang |2004|p=48-49}}  Continuing harmful karma may lead to lower rebirth. Lessening past results with meritorious activity results in higher rebirths. {{sfn| Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang |2004|p=56}}  Students achieving pure karma will be welcomed to go directly to liberation in any instant. {{sfn| Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang |2004|p=63}}  Since harmful actions are rooted in negative emotions and these are rooted in the self belief, some realize no-self to believe and then end both karma and the emotions. Students may then attain the [[Arhat]]’s [[nirvana]] result, with and without residue, similar to the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|no more learning path]]. {{sfn| Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang |2004|p=72}}   [[Bodhisattva]]s may pray for all karma to ripen upon them to purify its effect most beneficially for the student. {{sfn| Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang |2004|p=179}}

===Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche ===
[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]]’s student Jane Tromge compiled his Dudjom Tersar Ngondro teachings from [[Dudjom Lingpa]]’s [[Terma (religion)|terma]] revelation.  Karma weaves experienced patterns as the inevitable results from out flowing causes. Understanding karma and purifications can establish a spiritual compass to direct conduct in positive accord until enlightenment’s threshold. An enlightened Buddha has passed beyond karmic dualism to an infinite reflecting radiance awakening. Karma is created in the mind source, with speech and body following the mind’s lead. Buddhist ten non-virtues and ten virtues delineate what to abandon and accept. Proliferating virtuous actions carries repetitions forward into future lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche |first1=Jane |last2=Tromge |first2=Jane |title=Ngondro Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Preliminary Practices of the New Treasure of Dudjom |date=October 1, 1995 |publisher=Padma Publishing |isbn=978-1881847069 |pages=29–37 of 124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse===
[[Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche|Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse’s]] [[Longchen Nyingthig]] commentary explains that forgetting about death and karma is shown when we complain about everyone else. {{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|p=72}}  The sutras say [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s third arrow is directed to those with wrong views, such as not believing in cause condition and effect (karma).{{refn|group=note|Mara's arrow:{{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=30-31}}Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse is referring to Jamgon Kpngtrul LodroTaya writings and "taming the mind" from Kongtrul Rinpoche's reference}}  Protection may be achieved with discipline, meditation and wisdom. {{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=30-31}}  Exhausting karma leads to enlightenment and it's impossible to be independent and in control of anything having so many causes.{{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=67-69}}  Scientific people may believe in karma and not in reincarnation as its effects from virtute and non-virtue.{{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=134}} This may corrode the [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]] beliefs in an interdependent reality, [[shunyata]], and the [[triple gem]], which request Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to not pass into Parinirvana.  {{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=67-69}} Karma is synonymous with reincarnation.{{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|p=27}} Karmic debts pass from each lifetime.{{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|175-76}} Merit produces good karma. {{sfn| Dzonsar Jamyag Khentse |2004|pp=154-55}}

===Khenpo Tenzin Norgay===
Khenpo Tenzin Norgay's [[Nam Cho]] [[Ngöndro]] (preliminary practice) teachings emphasize karma purification importance in relation to proceeding to Dzogchen practices. There are 10 Steps in Ngöndro to quick enlightenment and karma is at Step 3. Karma follows the mind's wandering in samsara and may propel to the [[Desire realm#The Six Domains|six realms]]. Only the student can purge and manage conduct and outcomes.{{sfn |Norgay|2014|p=19}} Advancing to Dzogchen and skipping Ngöndro practices could lead to wrong karma views, where avoiding karma causes dangerous [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] (bodhicitta voided) views, the antidotes may become poisons.  For example, the [[Heart Sutra]], which explains no suffering, no cause of suffering, no path and no fruition could lead to a paradox asking why even practice. Understanding karma in the Ngöndro context helps answer the paradox.  Karma is in the foundation for all buddhist practices and requires both logic and faith for acceptance. Karma necessitates accepting beyond what the senses can materially perceive. {{sfn |Norgay|2014|p=28-30}}  Karmic law is not legislated, it is buddha nature and unavoidable. It is a way of expressing how the mind functions and can be trained. The [[Abhidharma]] explains karma in detail as karma is seen in the four noble truths.  Dharma works out in nondiscrimination for everyone when there are shared karmic beliefs. {{sfn|Norgay|2014|p=57-30}}

===Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro===
Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro interprets karma to mean cause, whenever karma is committed the seed will be planted in the [[Eight Consciousnesses|alaya consciousness]] and the effect ripens.  There are four types of ripening; the first ripes in this lifetime.  While, the other three types may ripen in the next lifetime.  Infailabe karma, a weak cause may encounter a strong antidote and causality may be broken. Immutable karma and mutable karma may have indefinite fruition. Virtuous karma can ripen slowly, and it's possible when undergoing suffering. Some illness result from previous lives.  The [[Abhidharmakośakārikā|Abhidharma-kosha-shastra]] clearly explains the workings of cause and effect. According to the [[Abhidharma|
Mahayanabhiddharma-sangiti-shastra]], repenting from beginningless time and vowing to never commit evil again mutes evil karma which is suffering's cause. With Merit dedication the seed of happiness it planted and may save virtuous karma and prevent it from becoming mutable. Children may inherit their parents' karma.  From the relative truth perspective, when there is cause there is an effect.  {{sfn|Lodro|2015|p=102-117}}

==Purification of karma==
In the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be "purified" through such practices as meditation on [[Vajrasattva]] because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon.{{sfn|Kalu Rinpoche|1993|p=204}}{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}} The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have.{{sfn|Thrangu Rinpoche|2012|pp=20-21}} Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness.{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}}  One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche | 2011| pp=264-265}}  Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion.

===Thubten Zopa Rinpoche===
[[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]]  explains that purification entails applying the four powers, where each action has four aspects that determine if the action is complete or incomplete. These aspects are: motivation, object, performance and completion.  If an action is complete in all four aspects, this is throwing karma and can determine throwing rebirth into the six realms; or, if beneficial with good karma to better rebirth.  A missing aspect becomes completed karma, thus determining future life quality and a completed negative action keeps suffering ongoing.  The first of the four purification powers is taking refuge and generating bodhicitta, the second is release to counteract the results similar to the cause, the third is remedy with applying antidotes to throwing karma and the fourth is indestructible determination by overcoming tendency to habitually create negativities over and over again.{{refn|group=note|Patrul four powers: Patrul Rinpoche's four powers are explained as 1) support (Refuge in Vajrasattva and arousing bodhicitta.  For example the Thirty Five Buddha provide support when reciting the Sutra in Three Parts), 2) regretting having done wrong, 3) resolution and 4) action as the antidote (to accomplish as many positive actions as possible).   Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang explained the essence to Patrul Rinpoche's four powers, in that 1
)support has two aspects (inner and outer), 2) regret is remorse, 3) resolution is a vow to not repeat, and 4)action as antidote is to develop real wish to practice dharma. {{sfn|Kenpo Ngawang Pelzang | 2004 | pp=226-227}}  }}  This logic is common to all Vajrayana practices.  Realizing emptiness is the ultimate purification.  The four powers are confessional and are different than Christian confessionals; however parallels exist.  Each action leaves an imprint to ripen as positive for happiness or negative for suffering. {{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=1-3}} Proper application requires a qualified lama to guide the process with view, reading the method alone may be insufficient. {{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=6}}

===''Tibetan Book of the Dead''===
The [[Tibetan Book of the Dead]] contains elaborate karma purification practices to naturally liberate cyclic rebirth action.  This includes natural liberation practice with the mind; with the spiritual teacher; with naked perception; with homage to sacred enlighten families for habitual tendencies; with confessional acts, with death signs visual recognition; with death ritual deception for fear; with recollection for consciousness transference; fundamentally with hearing great liberation; and with wearing through the [[Skandha|psycho-physical aggregates]].{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=4}}  Confessional acts in this context is important for purification (without renunciation) where the four powers are 1)reliance with one hundred peaceful and wrathful deities visualization, 2)actual antidote with elaborate confessional acts natural liberation practice and Vajrasattva mantra, 3)remorse, negative acts genuine recollection, and 4) resolving to never commit such negative actions again. {{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=115}}

'''László Radványi''' (December 13, 1900—July 3, 1978),&lt;ref&gt;[http://golm.rz.uni-potsdam.de/Seghers/frankreich/LASZLO1.htm Portrait and Biography in the Potsdam University site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130106032018/http://golm.rz.uni-potsdam.de/Seghers/frankreich/LASZLO1.htm |date=2013-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Johann Lorenz Schmidt''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] writer and academic.
 
==Life==
===Childhood and early career===
Radványi was born into a Jewish family in [[Hungary]]. As a boy, Radványi attended a grammar school on Marko Street in [[Budapest]]. While attending grammar school, at the age of 16, he authored a book of poetry, which received a preface from [[Frigyes Karinthy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC12527/12638.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Radványi studied economics and philosophy at the [[University of Budapest]] from 1918 to 1919, where he became involved in radical politics. With the destruction of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919 he fled to [[Vienna]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=5096.&lt;/ref&gt; where he adopted the pseudonym "Johann [[:de:Lorenz Schmidt|Lorenz Schmidt]]", from the 18th-century Protestant dissident theologian. Radványi studied philosophy in [[Germany]] at [[Heidelberg University]], where he obtained his doctorate in 1923. Directed by [[Karl Jaspers]], his thesis on [[Chiliasm]] was '[[Summa Cum Laude|summa cum laude]]'. While at Heidelberg, Radványi met the poet [[Anna Seghers]]. They married in 1925 and had two children, [[:de:Pierre Radványi|Pierre]] (b. 1926) and Ruth (b. 1928).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focus.de/kultur/buecher/literatur-seghers-tochter-ruth-radvanyi-gestorben_aid_533642.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJPOR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreno|first1=Alejandro|last2=Sánchez-Castro|first2=Manuel|title=A Lost Decade? László Radványi and the Origins of Public Opinion Research in Mexico, 1941–1952|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3-24|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edp002|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijpor/article/21/1/3/776405|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin and Paris===
After finishing their studies at Heidelberg, Radvanyi and Seghers moved to Berlin, where Radvanyi directed the Marxistische Arbeiterschule (Marxist Workers School) from 1925 to 1933. Radványi gathered faculty members such as [[Georg Lukács]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and speakers such as [[Albert Einstein]], who in 1931 hosted a conference titled "What a worker must know about the Theory of Relativity". László indicated in his letters in 1926 the impossibility of obtaining a job as a philosophy professor in Germany because of his "Hungarian-ness and Jewishness". The German government closed the Marxistische Arbeiterschule in 1933, and Radványi then left for [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Im Visier des FBI: Deutsche Exilschriftseller in den Akten amerikanischer Geheimdienste, von Alexander Stephan&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, Radványi founded and directed the Freie Deutsche Hochschule (Free German University), however, the German invasion of Paris forced Radványi to abandon his new endeavour. In 1940, the police in [[Meudon]] detained him as a citizen of a country allied with Germany. In December 1940, Seghers obtained a visa for herself, her husband, and their children with the help of [[Karl Mannheim]]. The family did not leave France until March 24, 1941, after they had received a transit visa from the United States; they arrived in New York on June 16, 1941. They departed June 25, 1941, aboard the SS Monterrey. The SS Monterey's manifest of passengers also included the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and surrealistic writer [[André Breton]] for [[New York City]] and the port of [[Veracruz]], in the Gulf of Mexico.

===Mexico, final years and death===
Radványi and his family arrived in [[Mexico]] on June 30, 1941. In Mexico City, the family had an audience in the National Palace with the new president, General [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]]. Radványi got a job at a local newspaper. [[Vicente Lombardo Toledano]], the leader of the Mexican labor movement, asked Radványi to join the recently created [[Universidad Obrera de México]] (Workers' University of Mexico) and teach Marxist history and economics. In 1944, Radványi took a position at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]]. Radványi left Mexico in 1952 for the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] where he taught at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1955, Radványi and his family moved to Volkswohlstraße 81 (later Anna-Seghers-Straße), in East Berlin. On July 3, 1978, he died and was buried with his wife in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]]. In 2007, Radványi's archives were deposited, though not organized, at Humboldt University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">"'''Modern Moral Philosophy'''" is an article on [[moral philosophy]] by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]], originally published in the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', vol. 33, no. 124 (January 1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=Philosophy |volume=33 |issue=124 |pages=1–19 |date=January 1958 |jstor=3749051 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100037943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article has influenced the emergence of contemporary [[virtue ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Roger Crisp|editor2=Michael Slote|title=Virtue ethics|year=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-875188-5|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919-2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially through the work of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].  Notably, the term "[[consequentialism]]" was first coined in this paper.

==Theses==
The author presents three theses:
# &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# &lt;blockquote&gt;"Concepts of obligation, and duty &amp;mdash; moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say &amp;mdash; and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of "ought," ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# &lt;blockquote&gt;"The differences between the well-known English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
John Wardle argued that Anscombe misrepresented [[Henry Sidgwick]]'s understanding of the concept of [[humility]] when she concludes that it is "a species of untruthfulness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardle|first=John|title=Miss Anscombe on Sidgwick's View of Humility|journal=Philosophy|date=July 1983|volume=58|issue=225|pages=389–391|jstor=3750774|doi=10.1017/s0031819100068467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8855">'''Moravec's paradox''' is the discovery by [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level [[reasoning]] requires very little computation, but low-level [[Sensory processing#Sensorimotor system|sensorimotor]] skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by [[Hans Moravec]], [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and others in the 1980s. As Moravec writes, "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".{{sfn|Moravec|1988|p= 15}}

Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to [[reverse engineer]] are those that are ''unconscious''. "In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best", he wrote, and added "we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly".{{sfn|Minsky|1986|p=29}}

==The biological basis of human skills==
One possible explanation of the paradox, offered by Moravec, is based on [[evolution]]. All human skills are implemented biologically, using machinery designed by the process of [[natural selection]]. In the course of their evolution, natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations. The older a skill is, the more time natural selection has had to improve the design. Abstract thought developed only very recently, and consequently, we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient.

As [[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] writes:
{{quote |Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.{{Sfn |Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}}}

A compact way to express this argument would be:
* We should expect the difficulty of reverse-engineering any human skill to be roughly proportional to the amount of time that skill has been evolving in animals.
* The oldest human skills are largely unconscious and so appear to us to be effortless.
* Therefore, we should expect skills that appear effortless to be difficult to reverse-engineer, but skills that require effort may not necessarily be difficult to engineer at all.

Some examples of skills that have been evolving for millions of years: recognizing a face, moving around in space, judging people’s motivations, catching a ball, recognizing a voice, setting appropriate goals, paying attention to things that are interesting; anything to do with perception, attention, visualization, motor skills, social skills and so on.

Some examples of skills that have appeared more recently: mathematics, engineering, human games, logic and scientific reasoning. These are hard for us because they are not what our bodies and brains were primarily evolved to do. These are skills and techniques that were acquired recently, in historical time, and have had at most a few thousand years to be refined, mostly by cultural evolution.&lt;ref group = "lower-alpha"&gt;Even given that cultural evolution is faster than genetic evolution, the difference in development time between these two kinds of skills is five or six orders of magnitude, and ([[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] would argue) there hasn't been nearly enough time for us to have "mastered" the new skills.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical influence on artificial intelligence==
In the early days of artificial intelligence research, leading researchers often predicted that they would be able to create thinking machines in just a few decades (see [[history of artificial intelligence#The optimism|history of artificial intelligence]]). Their optimism stemmed in part from the fact that they had been successful at writing programs that used logic, solved algebra and geometry problems and played games like checkers and chess. Logic and [[algebra]] are difficult for people and are considered a sign of intelligence. They assumed that, having (almost) solved the "hard" problems, the "easy" problems of [[computer vision|vision]] and [[commonsense reasoning]] would soon fall into place. They were wrong, and one reason is that these problems are not easy at all, but incredibly difficult. The fact that they had solved problems like logic and algebra was irrelevant, because these problems are extremely easy for machines to solve.&lt;ref group = "lower-alpha"&gt;These are not the only reasons that their predictions did not come true: see [[History of artificial intelligence#The problems|the problems]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Brooks]] explains that, according to early AI research, [[intelligence]] was "best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging", such as chess, [[symbolic integration]], proving [[math|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and solving complicated word algebra problems. "The things that children of four or five years could do effortlessly, such as visually distinguishing between a coffee cup and a chair, or walking around on two legs, or finding their way from their bedroom to the living room were not thought of as activities requiring intelligence."&lt;ref name=Brooks2002&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brooks|2002}}, quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p= 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would lead Brooks to pursue a new direction in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] research. He decided to build intelligent machines that had "No cognition. Just sensing and action. That is all I would build and completely leave out what traditionally was thought of as the ''intelligence'' of artificial intelligence."&lt;ref name=Brooks2002/&gt; This new direction, which he called "[[Nouvelle AI]]" was highly influential on [[robotics]] research and AI.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=456}}{{sfn|Brooks|1986}}

==Reception==
Linguist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] considers this the main lesson uncovered by AI researchers. In his book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', he writes:
 
{{quote |The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard. The mental abilities of a four-year-old that we take for granted – recognizing a face, lifting a pencil, walking across a room, answering a question – in fact solve some of the hardest engineering problems ever conceived... As the new generation of intelligent devices appears, it will be the stock analysts and petrochemical engineers and parole board members who are in danger of being replaced by machines. The gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are secure in their jobs for decades to come.{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp= 190–91}}}}

'''Mordechai Nessyahu''' was an Israeli political theorist and philosopher of science, as well as the originator of a worldview he called ''cosmotheism''.

==Biography==
While studying physics and philosophy at the [[Hebrew University]], Nessyahu began to formulate the worldview he eventually called cosmotheism. He exchanged several letters on the subject with [[Albert Einstein]]. In 1953 he published a book in Hebrew entitled ''Ma'ada Ha'Cosmos vey Hevrat Ha'Mada'' (''Cosmic Science and the Scientific Society'') which became the foundation of his eventual cosmotheistic formulation. [[Moshe Sharett]], soon to be [[Israel]]'s second [[Prime Minister]], was so impressed by the book that he shared it with Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]]. As a result, Nessyahu was appointed Director of the Research Department of the [[Israeli Labor Party]]. Nessyahu remained in this position until his death.

In 1968 he met Tsvi Bisk, a new immigrant from the [[United States]], who became his assistant at the Research Department. This meeting triggered a renewed interest in cosmotheism with Bisk as his collaborator and translator. Numerous English-language drafts of the idea were produced over the years and sent to hundreds of thinkers around the world to solicit their opinions. The year he died Nessyahu finally published his work in book form in Hebrew.

==The cosmotheistic hypothesis==

The cosmotheistic hypothesis stipulates that the [[Big Bang]] that created our [[cosmos]] was a local event in an infinite universe &amp;mdash; a universe that contains an infinite number of cosmoi (what is now being speculated by theoretical physicists as the [[multiverse]]). It proposes that this cosmos is an evolutionary entity, in a constant state of ever growing complexity &amp;mdash; that eventually has produced conscious life. It posits that due to the evolutionary nature of cosmic development, now being revealed by the "[[new physics]]" and "new [[cosmology]]", it is statistically certain that huge numbers of conscious life-forms (equivalent in self-awareness to human beings) have arisen throughout the cosmos; as if conscious life has been sown (as a cosmic genome) throughout the cosmos by the very process of cosmic evolution.

Nessyahu postulated that a number of these conscious life-forms will conclude that they must strive to become part of the God-ing of the cosmos. The expansion of conscious life throughout the cosmos will eventually be unfettered by its physical limitations and ultimately conscious life will fill the entire cosmos; it will become co-eval with a cosmos that has dissolved into pure [[radiation]] as an inevitable consequence of [[entropy]]. Thus the cosmos will become in its entirety a conscious universal being &amp;mdash; i.e., the cosmos will have become God. Cosmotheism posits God as the consequence of the cosmos and not as its cause. Not in the beginning God created the cosmos but in the end the evolutionary cosmos will have created God.

==From cosmotheism to cosmodeism==
Since several racist groups co-opted the name ''cosmotheism'', Nessyahu's living colleague Tsvi Bisk decided to rename Nessyahu's hypothesis ''cosmodeism'', a name closer to the tradition of natural theology which cosmodeism best reflects. Bisk is presently writing a book entitled ''Cosmodeism: A Worldview for the Space Age.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=The Global-Report |title=The COSMOTHEIST HYPOTHESIS of Mordekhai Nessyahu | author=Tsvi Bisk | date=May 30, 2012 | url=http://www.global-report.com/thehope/a158-the-cosmotheistic-hypothesis-of-mordechai-nessyahu | access-date=March 8, 2016 | quote=William Luther Pierce III was an assistant professor of Physics at Oregon State University and as such was a recipient of one of Nessyahu's English language drafts of cosmotheism. Unfortunately Pierce was also a white supremacist and neo-Nazi racist and co-opted the term cosmotheism, establishing a "religion" by the same name based on white racialism and National Socialism. Pierce's views influenced Norman Lowell a European and founder of the racist Imperium Europa which advocates an all-White Europe and the forced expulsion of non-whites from the continent. Needless to say these positions would have been anathema to Nessyahu and are in complete contravention of the spirit of cosmotheism. As a consequence, Tsvi Bisk, his collaborator and translator decided to rename Nessyahu's Hypothesis to cosmodeism[i], which ironically is a name closer to the tradition of natural theology under which cosmodeism might be listed. Bisk is presently writing a book entitled ''Cosmodeism: A Worldview for the Space Age''.}}{{cite web| publisher=Hypothesis of Mordechai Nessyahu | title=A Brief Introduction to the Cosmodeistic Hypothesis of Mordechai Nessyahu | url=https://cosmodeism.wordpress.com | date=May 10, 2010 | author=Tsvi Bisk |access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="972">'''Mundane Reason''' is a book by Melvin Pollner.

==Meaning==
The basic [[premise]] of the concept of '''mundane reason''' is that the standard assumptions about reality that people typically make as they go about day to day, including the very fact that they experience their reality as perfectly natural, are actually the result of social, cultural, and historical processes that make a particular perception of the world readily available. It is the reasoning about the world, self, and others which presupposes the world and its relationship to the observer; according to [[Steven Shapin]] (Shapin 1994:31), it is a set of presuppositions about the subject, the object, and the nature of their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. 1994, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Spiritual Autobiography''''' is a book published in 2009, compiled by {{ill|Sofia Stril-Rever|Fr}} from speeches and interviews of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], {{ISBN|9781846042423}}.

==Description==
The book is a compilation of unpublished texts of the Dalai Lama, which is accompanied by comments from the translator and collaborator of the Dalai Lama, Sofia Stril-Rever. Initially, the book was published in French, and in 2010 it became available translated and published in English and Russian.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;

The title "My spiritual autobiography" may be a little misleading, for in some ways the book does not resemble an autobiography.&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paine J.|lien auteur=|date= 23 January 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/21/AR2011012106630.html|title=The forging of a holy man|format=|série=|editor=The Washington Post |access-date= 12 January 2013|language=en|description=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three characteristics – his Compassionate motivation, lack of self-importance and flexibility of mind – while showing the internal coherence of the Dalai Lama's views in their temporal development, and the continuity of these points of view.&lt;ref name="Paine" /&gt;

The book is composed of three parts.&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mooney J.|lien auteur=|date=9 December 2010|url=http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/books/info-12-2010/book-review-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=The Dalai Lama's Spiritual Journey|format=|série=|editor=AARP The Magazine |access-date= 12 January 2013|language=en|description=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first considers universal questions; in the second, the Dalai Lama -as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Monk]]- expressed his hopes for the spiritual transformation of the world through the transformation of each person's mind, and the third provides a History of the Dalai Lama, spiritual master of the [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] people, and 14th Dalai Lama's life in exile.

The book ends with a poem, 'Never Give Up', written by the American writer [[Ron Whitehead]] in 1994, inspired by the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insomniacathon.org/nevergiveup.html The Story Behind the Ron Whitehead poem "Never Give Up"] ''insomniacathon.org'', accessed 23 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Arabia''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] holding a [[Rosary]] and the [[Child Jesus]] as venerated in [[Kuwait]] and [[Bahrain]] by its faithful  devotees.

The image was advocated by [[Pope Pius XII]] who authorised its [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]], while [[Pope John XXIII]] granted a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the venerated image on 25 March 1960 through Cardinal [[Valerian Gracias]]. On 5 January 2011, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] proclaimed her Patroness of the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia]] and designated the feast of the image Saturday preceding the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time with the permission to celebrate it also on Sunday.
[[File:Our Lady of Arabia Parish, Ahmadi.jpg|thumb|Church where the image is enshrined and venerated.]]

==History==
The original image is derived from an image of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] brought to [[Al Ahmadi, Kuwait]] on 1 May 1948. On the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] 1948, the priest, Father Teofano Ubaldo Stella of the [[Carmelite Order]] had it framed and brought out for veneration.  In 1949, the [[Legion of Mary]] used their own image of [[Miraculous Medal]], which encouraged Father Stella to commission an image in Italy under the sculpting company ''Rosa and Zanzio Ditta'' to carve a statue of the [[Madonna and Child]] using a [[cedar of Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://holyspiritinteractive.net/features/somethingaboutmary/arabia.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The image was brought to [[Pope Pius XII]] who also venerated the image and authorised its Marian title.

On Orthodox Christmas, 6 January 1950, the statue was returned to Kuwait for public veneration by the faithful.

In 1954, Kuwaiti soldiers travelled to Rome for the hundredth anniversary of the [[Dogma]] the [[Immaculate Conception]], and presented another replica of the image at the Parish of Saint Teresa in Rome. On 16 September 1954, the same image was brought to [[Pope Pius XII]], who blessed the statue at [[Castel Gandolfo]]. In May 1956, Pius XII sent a special candle to the new parish built in Ahmadi, especially chosen by him from that year's [[Candlemas]] ceremonies in Rome.
 
In 1956, Bishop Stella petitioned the [[Holy See]] to proclaim the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under the title of Our Lady of Arabia as [[Patron saint|Patroness]] of Kuwait. Pope Pius XII granted his consent via the [[Papal bull]] ''Regnum Mariae'' on 25 January 1957. A solid gold crown studded with precious [[rubies]] and [[diamonds]] was crafted and then brought to Rome, where [[Pope John XXIII]] personally blessed it on 17 March 1960. Bishop Stella donated a particular [[pearl]] to the crown as well.

The [[Canonical coronation]] was further authorised by Pope John XXIII, which occurred on 25 March 1960 via the [[Papal legate]] Cardinal [[Valerian Gracias]] of Bombay. In 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] approved the patronage by assigning the Marian title was the principal patroness for the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia]].

==Pontifical approbation==
* [[Pope Pius XII]] authorised the devotion to the statue on 17 December 1949 at the [[Apostolic Palace]], to which he also consented to be photographed venerating the image. The same [[Pontiff]] made the Marian title [[Patroness]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-church.org/kuwait/our_lady_of_arabia_solemnity.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Pope John XXIII]] issued a [[Papal bull]] granting her [[Canonical coronation]] on 25 March 1960 via the [[Archbishop of Bombay]], Cardinal [[Valerian Gracias]]. The pontifical document was signed and attested by Cardinal [[Domenico Tardini]] dated 9 January 1960. 

==Patronage==
In the 25th January 1957 decree ''Regnum Mariae'', Pope Pius XII, declared Our Lady of Arabia the Principal Patron of the territory and the Vicariate Apostolic of Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahraincathedral.org/?p=1499 "Dedication of the Cathedral to Our Lady of Arabia", Bahrain Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] approved her title as Patroness for the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia]] on 5 January 2011.

'''Peter Stephen Du Ponceau''' (born '''Pierre-Étienne du Ponceau''', June 3, 1760 – April 1, 1844) was a French-American [[linguistics|linguist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[jurist]].  After emigrating to the colonies in 1777, he served in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Afterward, he settled in Philadelphia, where he lived the remainder of his years. He contributed significantly to work on the indigenous languages of the Americas, as well as advancing the understanding of [[written Chinese]].

==Early life and war career==
Du Ponceau's fondness for languages began at age six.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He studied at a [[Benedictine]] college until he abruptly ended his education after only 18 months over a dissatisfaction with the scholarly philosophy taught there. He emigrated to America in 1777, at age 17, with [[Baron von Steuben]], who was 30 years his senior.

Du Ponceau served as a secretary to Steuben in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolution]]. After the war, he settled in Philadelphia, where he would spend the rest of his life. Among his acquaintances were many important figures of the [[American Revolution]], including [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and [[James Monroe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Du Ponceau|first=Peter Stephen|last2=Whitehead|first2=James L.|date=1939|title=Notes and Documents: The Autobiography of Peter Stephen Du Ponceau|jstor=20087180|journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|volume=63|issue=2|pages=189–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in philosophy and linguistics==

Du Ponceau joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1791 and later served as its president, from 1827 until his death. He became notable in the field of [[linguistics]] for his analysis of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]]; as a member of the society's Historical and Literary Committee, he helped build a collection of texts that described and recorded the native languages of the Americas. His book concerning their grammatical systems (''Mémoire sur le systeme grammatical des langues de quelques nations Indiennes de l'Amérique du Nord'') won the [[Volney Prize]] of the [[French Institute]] in 1835. In 1816 he was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistd American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1820.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Ponceau also worked on [[Asian languages]]. He was one of the first Western linguists to reject axiomatic classification of Chinese writing as ideographic.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis 1984: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Du Ponceau stated:
# That the Chinese system of writing is not, as has been supposed, ''ideographic''; that its characters do not represent ''ideas'', but ''words'', and therefore I have called it ''lexigraphic''.
# That ideographic writing is a creature of the imagination, and cannot exist, but for very limited purposes, which do not entitle it to the name of writing.
# That among men endowed with the gift of speech, all writing must be a direct representation of the spoken language, and cannot present ideas to the mind abstracted from it.
# That all writing, as far as we know, represents language in some of its elements, which are words, syllables, and simple sounds. In the first case it is lexigraphic, in the second syllabic, and in the third alphabetical or elementary.&lt;ref&gt;Du Ponceau 1838: xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;
He used the example of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (called "[[Cochinchina|Cochinchinese]]" at the time) using [[chữ Nôm]], a modified form of Chinese characters, showing that the Vietnamese used the Chinese characters to represent sound and not meaning. One hundred years later, his theory remained a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis 1984: 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language, writing, and disciplinarity in the Critique of the ‘‘Ideographic Myth’’: Some proleptical remarks|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~dbl11/Lurie-LangWritingDisc.pdf|last=Lurie|first=David B|publisher=Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Columbia University|place=New York|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Gossett''' (September 27, 1941 – June 12, 2017)&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |title=Philip Gossett, scholar of 19th-century Italian opera, is dead at 75 |first=John |last=von Rhein |date=June 13, 2017 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170615151852/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |archive-date=2017-06-15|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[musicologist]] and historian, and Robert W. Reneker Distinguished Service Professor of Music at the [[University of Chicago]]. His lifelong interest in 19th-century Italian opera began with listening to [[Metropolitan Opera]] broadcasts in his youth. ''Divas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera'', a major work on the subject, won the Otto Kinkeldey Award of the [[American Musicological Society]] as best book on music of 2006.

Philip Gossett's contributions to opera scholarship and how they can influence operatic performance may best be summed up by ''[[Newsday]]'''s comment that "some encomiasts claim that soprano [[Maria Callas]] did as much for Italian opera as [[Arturo Toscanini]] or Verdi. Musicologist Philip Gossett arguably has done as much for Italian opera as any of those geniuses."&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lignara Rosenberg, [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/retirement/opera-review-1.650130 "Restoring the erotic to a Verdi classic"], , ''[[Newsday]]'',  2 April 2004 online at newsday.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gossett earned degrees from the [[Juilliard School]], [[Amherst College]], and [[Princeton University]]. He studied in Paris on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]].&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2017/9/Departments/Obituaries.html|title=Obituaries: Philip Gossett|work=[[Opera News]]|date=September 2017|volume=82|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he began graduate musical studies in the mid-1960s, the Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]] had been given little serious academic study.  As he noted: "If you were going to be a serious musicologist, you had to study Beethoven or Bach or Gregorian chants, but Rossini -- that was a pretty funny idea" &lt;ref name="Gossett"&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/04/041219.gossett-st.html Art Golab, "U. of C. musicologist gets 'surprise' $1.5 mil. award", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', December 19, 2004, on news.uchicago.edu/citations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he persisted and notes that "I went to [[Princeton University]] for graduate work in musicology (and) I fell more in love with the music and wrote my doctoral dissertation on the music of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. Then I went to Paris on a [[Fulbright]] and studied Rossini's operas."&lt;ref name="Clurman"&gt;Judith Clurman, [http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html "Meet Philip Gossett"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040503153607/http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html |date=2004-05-03 }}, ''The Juilliard Journal Online'' on juilliard.edu, March 2004. Interview with Philip Gossett&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Gossett's work has frequently taken him to Italy, where he has advised on the presentations of productions at the [[Rossini Opera Festival]] in Rossini's hometown of [[Pesaro]], and he has worked directly with the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani (Institute of Verdi Studies) in [[Parma]] which was founded in 1960. Also, for the 2001 centenary of Verdi's death, he worked with the [[Teatro Regio di Parma]] on their programming. In 1968 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] where he remained for the rest of his career. He was a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago at the time of his death in 2017.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

==Critical editions of Verdi and Rossini operas==
Given that Gossett's musical interests focus on 19th-century Italian opera (especially the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi),  most of his career was devoted to being General Editor of two important  projects while at the University of Chicago: the research for the preparation of [[Critical edition (opera)|critical editions]] of all the operas of both Rossini (some 70) and Verdi (some 33, in their various forms).  These are being prepared and gradually published as ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' (by the University of Chicago Press in collaboration with the Italian publishing house [[Casa Ricordi]] of [[Milan]]) and of ''The Works of Gioachino Rossini'' (by [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter Verlag]], [[Kassel]]).

In an interview, Gossett explained what he means by the term "critical edition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By critical edition of an opera I have always meant an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work. In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required – we feel it is necessary – to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name="GAZZ"&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.org. 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he explained the overall aim of the production of critical editions of the operas by using the example of Rossini's ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We used sources in Rome, Paris, Vienna, and New York. The scores reprinted cheaply today simply reproduce all the errors, all the faults of these 19th-century scores—most of which were produced very quickly and, in Verdi's own words, "are filled with errors." ... The new critical editions have tried, for the first time, to return to authentic sources and they allow performers to have access to the various versions sanctioned by the composers.&lt;ref name="Clurman"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As he has explained, Gossett does not believe that singers need to base their interpretations entirely on everything contained in a critical edition. His aim is "that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce".&lt;ref name="GAZZ"/&gt;

As of 2004, it was noted that "Gossett's team (had) completed 12 of 33 projected volumes of Verdi's work and more than 30 volumes of an expected 70 for Rossini. 'I'll never get through the Rossini,' Gossett said. 'But the Verdi – I'm hoping.'"&lt;ref name="Gossett"/&gt;  However, in July 2013, the University of Chicago's "Verdi Critical Edition - Available Titles" page shows 17 opera titles by Verdi
&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  List of Verdi operas in critical editions]&lt;/ref&gt; and 9 Rossini opera titles currently available or planned for publication by Bärenreiter Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm  Rossini operas prepared by Bärenreiter Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is in addition to the 26 Rossini operas for which critical editions have been prepared by the Rossini Foundation under Gossett's general direction.

However, he is on record as denying that the [[Claudio Scimone]] edition of ''[[Maometto II]]'' is a critical edition in the true sense of the word, but is more a performing edition by Scimone as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rossini's ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''[[Ermione]]'' and ''[[Semiramide]]'' are three of critical editions which he has personally edited, while his most recent work is Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]'' which, while yet to be formally published, was performed at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in November 2005 in its 1869 version. The 1862 version was presented in the Stadttheater, Bern in April 2006.

===Work with US opera companies===
In the US, he has consulted with the [[Houston Grand Opera]] (in 1979 for the first production of the critical edition of ''Tancredi'', with its then newly discovered tragic ending, starring [[Marilyn Horne]])&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'' pp 148-152&lt;/ref&gt;. He has worked three times with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]: for its November 1990 production of ''[[Semiramide]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 175-199&lt;/ref&gt;; for its 1993 production of ''[[Stiffelio]]''; and for its 1997 production of ''[[La cenerentola]]''. He has also worked with [[Santa Fe Opera|The Santa Fe Opera]] in 2000 for Rossini's ''[[Ermione]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] for the first presentations of Rossini's long-lost ''Il viaggio a Reims'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp. 152-158&lt;/ref&gt; Gossett again acted as consultant to The Santa Fe Opera during rehearsals for its 2012 season production of the new critical edition of Rossini's original ''Maometto II'' of 1820 and he returned in the same capacity during rehearsals of the company's new production of Rossini's ''[[La donna del lago]]'' during the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santafeopera.org/tickets/production.aspx?performanceNumber=5708  Performance details at The Santa Fe Opera]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 presentations of Verdi's ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' for the Met, Gossett also worked with conductor [[Riccardo Muti]] on revisions to the score based on new research. This has become a new critical edition of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  The ''Atilla'' critical edition], edited by Helen Greenwald, is currently available as a rental in ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muti has acknowledged Gossett's role in clarifying ambiguities (in this case in ''Rigoletto'') which had crept into many texts.&lt;ref&gt;F. Paul Driscoll, "Grandissimo Maestro", ''Opera News'', February 2010, p.20. Interview with Riccardo Muti: "Even the critics did not realize that some words they were used to hearing didn't make any sense. For example, the critical edition with Gossett revealed many important things, such as when the Duke goes in the ''taverna''...and asks for "Una stanza e del vino" ("a room and some wine") [....] but nobody realized that these are not the words that Verdi wrote.  Verdi wrote, "Tua sorella e del vino" - "I want your ''sister'' and some wine". Muti continues to explain that Rigoletto's comment to Gilda (in which he says "that's just like him", meaning that the request is typical of his behaviour)   which follows the Duke's remark, makes no sense without the word "sister" being included."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Gossett was awarded the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]'s "Distinguished Achievement Award" in 2004, which gained him a prize of $1.5 million to facilitate his research. Also, in 1998, the Italian government gave  him the  "Cavaliere di Gran Croce", the highest honor that can be awarded to a civilian. Academically, he has been President of the American Musicological Society and of the Society for Textual Scholarship, as well as Dean of the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2008 Gossett was appointed foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].

In [[United States criminal law]], '''probable cause''' is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal or the issuing of a [[search warrant]]. The principle behind the standard is to [[limited power|limit the power]] of authorities to perform random or abusive searches ([[unlawful search and seizure]]), and to promote lawful evidence gathering and procedural form during criminal arrest and prosecution. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/probable_cause|title=Probable Cause|last=Busby|first=John C|date=2009-09-17|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term comes from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]:

{{Quote|The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, ''but upon probable cause'', supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.}}

''Probable'' in this case may relate to statistical [[probability]] or to a general standard of common behavior and customs. The context of the word ''probable'' here is not exclusive to community standards, and could partially derive from its use in formal mathematical statistics as some have suggested;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hald |first=Anders |title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1990 |page=44 |isbn=0471502308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''but cf. probō, Latin etymology.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/probo#Latin|title=probō, Wiktionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. immigration proceedings, the “reason to believe” standard has been interpreted as equivalent to probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/198382907/Jose-Manuel-Isabel-Diaz-A205-500-422-BIA-Dec-30-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A common definition is "a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a [[Reasonable person|prudent and cautious person's]] belief that certain facts are [[probability|probably]] true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handler |first=J. G. |title=Ballentine's Law Dictionary |edition=Legal Assistant |year=1994 |location=Albany |publisher=Delmar |page=431 |isbn=0827348746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition, allowing for use of the term by citizens and/or the general public.

In the context of warrants, the ''Oxford Companion to American Law'' defines probable cause as "information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)". "Probable cause" is a stronger standard of evidence than a [[reasonable suspicion]], but weaker than what is required to secure a [[criminal conviction]]. Even [[hearsay]] can supply probable cause if it is from a reliable source or supported by other evidence, according to the ''[[Aguilar–Spinelli test]]''.

In ''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] defines probable cause as "where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', {{ussc|338|160|1949}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
[[File:Constitution of the United States WDL2708.jpg|thumb|Constitution of the United States]]
The use of probable cause in the United States and its integration in the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] has roots in [[English common law]] and the old saying that "a man's home is his castle". This is the idea that someone has the right to defend their "castle" or home from unwanted "attacks" or intrusion. In the 1600s, this saying started to apply legally to landowners to protect them from casual searches from government officials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=9780132457613|page=62|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1700s, the British use of the [[Writ of assistance|writs of assistance]] and general warrants, which allowed authorities to search wherever and whenever sometimes, without expiration date, in the American colonies were raised in several court cases. The first was in Massachusetts in 1761 when a customs agent submitted for a new writ of assistance and Boston merchants challenged its legality. In the case the lawyer for the merchants James Otis argued that writs of assistance violated the fundamentals of English Law and was unconstitutional. [[John Adams]], a lawyer at the time who later wrote the Massachusetts provision on which the Fourth Amendment heavily relied, was impacted by James Otis's argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780132457613|page=63|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case against general warrants was the English case [[Entick v Carrington|''Entick v. Carrington'']] (1765). In that case, [[Lord Camden]] the chief judge said that general warrants were not the same as specific warrants and that parliament or case law could not authorize general warrants. Along with these statements, Lord Camden also affirmed that the needs of the state were more important than the individuals rights. This upheld the ideology of the social contract while holding to idea that the government purpose was to protect the property of the people.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; He called for the government to seek reasonable means in order to search private property, as well as a cause.

==Probationers and parolees==
In early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from "probable cause" to "reasonable grounds"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griffin v. Wisconsin]]'', {{ussc|483|868|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "reasonable suspicion". Specifically, the degree of individualized suspicion required of a search was a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. The Supreme Court held:

{{quote|Although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term "probable cause," a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable&amp;nbsp;... When an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer's significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Knights]]'', {{ussc|534|112|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion is not even necessary:

{{quote|The [[California Legislature]] has concluded that, given the number of inmates the State paroles and its high recidivism rate, a requirement that searches be based on individualized suspicion would undermine the State's ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders. This conclusion makes eminent sense. Imposing a reasonable suspicion requirement, as urged by petitioner, would give parolees greater opportunity to anticipate searches and conceal criminality.}}

The court held that reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, is the [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Samson v. California]]'', {{ussc|547|843|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Fourth Amendment rights be extended to probationers and parolees, but such proposals have not gained traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |volume=39|publisher=Hastings L. J.|pages=449|date=1987–1988|title=Right of All the People to be Secure: Extending Fundamental Fourth Amendment Rights to Probationers and Parolees, The|author=Koshy, Sunny A. M. |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/hastlj39&amp;section=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much that remains of the Fourth Amendment rights of probationers after waiving their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=35|publisher=Santa Clara L. Rev.|pages=1237|date=1994–1995|title=Fourth Amendment Rights of Probationers: What Remains after Waiving Their Right to be Free from Unreasonable Searches and Seizures, The|author=Kneafsey, Sean M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/saclr35&amp;section=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essay called "They Released Me from My Cage...But They Still Keep Me Handcuffed" was written in response to the ''Samson'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=4|publisher=Ohio St. J.

California|author=Binnall, James M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/osjcl4&amp;section=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the requirement that a police officer must have individualized suspicion before searching a parolee's person and home was long considered a foundational element of the Court's analysis of Fourth Amendment questions and that abandoning it in the name of crime prevention represents an unprecedented blow to individual liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=42|publisher=Harv.

==Use of trained drug dogs==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0703-023, Dresden, Rauschgiftspürhund im Einsatz.jpg|thumb|185px|Right|Officer training a drug dog]]
In the United States, use of a [[drug dog|trained dog]] to smell for narcotics has been ruled in several court cases as sufficient probable cause. A K-9 Sniff in a public area is not a search according to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1983 ''[[United States v. Place]]''. In this particular case, Place was in the New York Airport, and [[DEA]] agents took his luggage, even though he refused to have his bag searched. His luggage smelled of drugs, and the trained dog alerted the agents to this. Dogs alerting their officers provides enough probable cause for the officer to obtain a warrant. The DEA then procured a [[Search warrant|warrant]] and found a sizable amount of drugs in Place's luggage. It was not considered a search until after the warrant because a trained dog can sniff out the smell of narcotics, without having to open and look through the luggage.

The power of probable cause by K-9 units smelling for drugs is not limited to just airports, but even in schools, public parking lots, high crime neighborhood streets, mail, visitors in prisons, traffic stops, etc. If there is an incident where the dog alerts its officer, the probable cause from the dog is considered enough to conduct a search, as long as one of the exceptions to a warrant are present, such as [[plain view doctrine|plain view]], [[incident to arrest]], automobile, [[exigency]], or with a [[stop and frisk]]. During a traffic stop and checkpoint, it is legal for police to allow a drug dog to sniff the exterior of the car. This is legal as long as it does not cause the traffic stop to be any longer than it would have been without the dog. If the dog finds a scent, it is again a substitute for probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;Wallentine, Ken. "The Dog Day Traffic Stop - Basic Canine Search and Seizure." (2008). Web. 21 Oct. 2014. http://policek9.com/html/drugdog.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber surveillance==
Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], law enforcement officials do not need probable cause, in order to access communications records, credit cards, bank numbers and stored emails held by third parties. They only need reasonable suspicion that the information they are accessing is part of criminal activities.  Under this, officers are authorized for a court order to access the communication information.  Only certain information can be accessed under this act (such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, etc.). Probable cause is needed for more detailed information because law enforcement needs a warrant to access additional information.  Generally, law enforcement is not required to notify the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles. “The USA PATRIOT Act: A Legal Analysis”. (2002). Web. 30 Nov 2014. {{cite web |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206041849/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text of the Patriot Act limits the application of that statute to issues that clearly involve the national security of the United States. &lt;ref&gt;See the text of 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent to search==
{{main|Consent search}}

If voluntary consent is given and the individual giving the consent has authority over the search area, such as a car, house, business, etc. then a law enforcement officer does not need probable cause or even reasonable suspicion.  If the person does not give voluntary consent, then the officer needs probable cause, and in some cases, a search warrant may be required to search the premises.  Unless another exclusion to the fourth amendment of the US constitution occurs, when the person withdraws their consent for searching, the officer has to stop looking immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, Bryan R. “SEARCHING A VEHICLE WITHOUT A WARRANT” Web. 30 Nov 2014. https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/4th-amendment/searchingavehicle-consent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident investigation==
In the United States, the term probable cause is used in accident investigation to describe the conclusions reached by the investigating body as to the factor or factors which caused the accident.  This is primarily seen in reports on aircraft accidents, but the term is used for the conclusion of diverse types of transportation accidents investigated in the United States by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] or its predecessor, the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]].

==Related cases==
===In the United States===
*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', {{ussc|462|213|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lowered the threshold of probable cause by ruling that a "substantial chance" or "fair probability" of criminal activity could establish probable cause. A better-than-even chance is not required.
*The decision in ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established that "stop and frisks" (seizures)  may be made under [[reasonable suspicion]] if the officer believes a crime has been committed, is, or soon will be committed with a weapon concealed on such person.
*In ''[[United States v. Matlock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Matlock]]'', {{ussc|415|164|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court announced the "co-occupant consent rule" which permitted one resident to consent in the co-occupant's absence.  The case established that an officer who made a search with a reasonable belief that the search was consented to by a resident did not have to provide a probable cause for the search.
:However, in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', {{ussc|547|103|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled, thus replacing ''Matlock'', when officers are presented with a situation wherein two parties, each having authority to grant consent to search premises they share, but one objects over the other's consent, the officers must adhere to the wishes of the non-consenting party.

*''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', {{ussc|468|1214|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; set a special precedent for searches of students at school. The Court ruled that school officials act as state officers when conducting searches, and do not require probable cause to search students' belongings, only [[reasonable suspicion]].
*In ''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'', {{ussc|480|709|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court relied on ''T.L.O.'' to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to administrative searches of public employees' belongings or workplaces when conducted by supervisors seeking evidence of violations of workplace rules rather than criminal offenses.

== Probable cause hearings ==
{{See also|Evidentiary hearing}}
In the various states, a '''probable cause hearing''' is the preliminary [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] typically taking place before [[arraignment]] and before a serious crime goes to [[Trial (law)|trial]]. The [[judge]] is presented with the basis of the [[prosecution]]'s case, and the [[defendant]] is afforded full right of [[cross-examination]] and the right to be represented by [[Lawyer|legal counsel]]. If the prosecution cannot make a case of probable cause, the court must dismiss the case against the accused.

==Comparison with other countries==
===Sweden===
In the criminal code of some European countries, notably [[Sweden]], probable cause is a higher level of suspicion than "justifiable grounds" in a two level system of formal suspicion.  The latter refers only to the suspect being able to and sometimes having a motive to commit the crime and in some cases witness accounts, whereas probable cause generally requires a higher degree of physical evidence and allows for longer periods of detention before trial. See ''[[häktning]]''.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Powers of arrest without a warrant can be exercised by a constable who 'has reasonable grounds' to suspect that an individual is "about to commit an offence", or is "committing an offence"; in accordance with the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] and the partially repealed [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/110 Section 110, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24 Section 24, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "reasonable grounds for suspecting" is used throughout the law dealing with police powers.

====Scotland====
In Scotland the legal language for the provision of police powers pertaining to stopping, arresting and searching a person who "has committed or is committing an offence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/46/section/13 Section 13, Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; or in possession of an offensive article or article used in connection with an offence; is similar to as in England and Wales but is instead the powers are provided by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">In archaeological terms, [[graffiti]] (plural of [[graffito (archaeology)|graffito]]) is a mark, image or writing scratched or engraved into a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert C.|title=Invisible Romans|date=2011|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, Mass|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous examples found on sites of the [[Roman Empire]], including taverns and houses, as well as on pottery of the time.

[[File:Inscription on Wall Plaster - Roman Museum - Augusta Raurica - August 2013.JPG|thumbnail|right|Inscription on wall plaster]]

==Graffiti Samples==
Inscriptions cover a range of topics from poems, advertisements, political statements, to greetings. There are two forms of graffiti: painted inscriptions (usually public notices) and inscribed inscriptions (spontaneous messages).

===Pompeii===
Over 11,000 graffiti samples have been uncovered in the excavations of [[Pompeii]]. Archaeologists have been studying and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has not survived the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlson, Kristin. "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/reading-the-writing-on-pompeiis-walls-1969367/ Reading the Writing on Pompeii's Walls]." Smithsonian, 26 July 2010. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====House of Maius Castricius====
[[File:Pompeii Stairwell Poetry.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of poetry from stairwell of House of Maius Castricius, Pompeii]]
This domestic residence shows that ancient graffiti was not limited to the public sphere, as graffiti is in modern day. This site, discovered in the 1960s, has benefited from preservation efforts, leaving the graffiti samples in their original context and remain legible. There is a unique feature of eleven graffiti containing multiple lines of poetry. For the most part, the poems are arranged vertically and respect the space of the others. This mix of original work and common phases are not a miscellaneous group because of the number and composition; instead, it appears that a conversation has formed.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Dialogues of Ancient Graffiti in the House of Maius Castricius in Pompeii." American Journal of Archaeology 114.1 (2010): 59-101. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

One passage on the staircase reads:
     vasia quae rapui, quaeris formosa puella
     accipe quae rapui non ego solus; ama.
     quisquis amat valeat 

Which translates to:
     Beautiful girl, you seek the kisses that I stole.
     Receive what I was not alone in taking; love.
     Whoever loves, may she fare well.

====Outside the shop of Fabius Ululitremulus====
[[File:Arma virumque cano.jpg|thumbnail|right|Three inscriptions referring to the opening line of the Aeneid]]

An example here demonstrates a familiarity with [[Virgil]] and [[hexameter]] verse. On the doorpost of the shop near pictures of [[Aeneas]] and [[Romulus]] is written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sander M. Goldberg |authorlink= |title=Constructing Literature in the Roman Republic |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University |location= |pages=20 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSWUPFkvYaUC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Fullones+ululamque+cano,+non+arma+virumque.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq7CIlC3L9&amp;sig=Vl2_Y6pd6MhI3XWHm922FDJicWs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip4-7Ro9XKAhUH_R4KHc0ZBiAQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Fullones%20ululamque%20cano%2C%20non%20arma%20virumque.&amp;f=false |isbn=9780521854610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

     Fullones ululamque cano, non arma virumque.

Translating to:

     I sing of cloth-launderers and an owl, not [[Aeneid#Theme|arms and a man]].

The owl is a signifier of [[Minerva]], the goddess who has been said to be protector over the profession of [[fullo]]nes.&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;

[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] notes that there are more than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil in Pompeii alone, but also notes that the majority of the references are to the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the [[Aeneid]], suggesting that these lines may have been widely known in the fashion "[[To be, or not to be]]" is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mary Beard |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |title=SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome |year=2015 |publisher=W.

===Dialogues===
[[File:8259(Successus textor).jpg|thumbnail|right|Inscription diaologue]]

Graffiti is often meant to be seen and expects to be read. A dialogue is formed between the reader and the inscription and can be simple as they speak directly to the readers in forms such as "if anyone sits here, let him read this before everything else…" as well as "He who writes this is in love… and I who reads this am a prick."

There are also dialogues where one passage answers another. These responses take the forms of greetings, insults, prayers, etc.
     Successus textor amat coponiaes ancilla(m)
     nomine Hiredem quae quidem illum
     non curat sed ille rogat illa com(m)iseretur
     scribit rivalis vale

Translates to :
     Successus the weaver is in love with the slave of the
     Innkeeper, whose name is Iris. She doesn't care about
     him at all, but he asks that she take pity on him.
     A rival wrote this

A response to this translates to:&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;
     You're so jealous you're bursting. Don't tear down
     someone more handsome―
     a guy who could beat you up and who is good-looking.

===Games and riddles===
Word squares ([[magic square]]) and riddles are also common forms of the culture of graffiti. These show a level of mental agility and flexibility of language.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Magic Squares, Alphabet Jumbles, Riddles and More: The Culture of Word-Games among the Graffiti of Pompeii." ''The Muse at Play''. Vol. 305. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2012. 65-80. Web. 4 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Examples of handwritten alphabets are common graffiti in Pompeii and could be evidence of children practicing their alphabet. This lends to the argument that children were responsible for much of the graffiti. However, the height of the inscriptions and location may contradict this.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"/&gt;

==Commentary==
Writing around 100 AD, [[Plutarch]] wrote of graffiti: "There is nothing written in them which is either useful or pleasing – only so-and-so 'remembers' so-and-so, and 'wishes him the best', and is 'the best of his friends', and many things full of such ridiculousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Emily Gowers]] |title=Ancient vandalism? |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1493961.ece |quote= |pages= |work=Times Literary Supplement |location= |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

21st-century scholars have found more to study and enjoy in the visual art and [[intertextuality]] of Roman graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kristina Milnor |authorlink= |title=Graffiti and the Literary Landscape in Roman Pompeii |year=2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |pages= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndbQAgAAQBAJ |isbn=9780199684618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than simply text and thought, Roman graffiti give insight into the use of space and how people interacted within it. Studying the motivation behind the marks reveals a trend for the graffiti to be located where people spend time and pass most frequently as they move through a space. Common places for graffiti are staircases, central peristyle, and vestibule. The use of graffiti by Romans has been said to be very different from the defacing trends of modern day, with the text blending into the walls and rooms by respecting the frescoes and decoration with the use of small letters. In this way, the environment influences the graffiti by subject and organization, and the graffiti in turn changes and influences the environment.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;

==Studying graffiti==
Typical techniques when studying graffiti include drawing each inscription and taking photographs if special attention is required. When only a shadow of the engravings are visible to the naked eye, other methods of observance are needed to decipher the engravings.

===3D laser profilometry===

Using 3D laser profilometry to analyze the roughness of a surface, archaeologists have been able to determine the tools used in engraving. This technique merged with photographs taken with oblique light, different lighting conditions, and results from [[electrostatic detection device]]s have increased the readability of illegible inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Isabelle, et al. "Analysis of Roman Pottery Graffiti by High Resolution Capture and 3D Laser Profilometry." Journal of Archaeological Science 39.11 (2012): 3349.Web&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosemarie "Rosie" Tong''' is an American [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]].  The author of 1998's ''Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction,''  an overview of the major traditions of feminist theory, she is the emeritus distinguished professor of health care ethics in the Department of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.  

Tong's research is focused on ethical issues in long-term care, [[cognitive enhancement]] and [[genetics]].  She has been recognized for contributions to [[bioethics]], [[health care reform]], genetic and reproductive technology, and the implications of caregiving for parents and children, a role performed primarily by women.&lt;ref name="journal med phil"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teaching Bioethics in the New Millennium: Holding Theories Accountable to Actual Practices and Real People|journal=The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|date=2002|volume=27|issue=4|pages=417–432|url=http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/4/417.abstract|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosemarie Tong|url=http://ethics.uncc.edu/people/rosemarie-tong|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tong holds a BA in religious studies and German from [[Marygrove College]], an MA in philosophy from [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]] and a PhD from [[Temple University]]. Her MA thesis was on the 19th-century German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. She earned her PhD with a dissertation titled “Towards a Rational reconstruction of Anglo-American Criminal Law: The Insanity Defense.”&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hull|first1=Gordon|title=Remarks|url=http://ethics.uncc.edu/sites/ethics.uncc.edu/files/media/Rosie%20symposium%20remarks%20for%20website.pdf|website=uncc.edu|publisher=UCC Ethics|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and affiliations==
Tong has held professorships at Williams College and Lafayette College.  She was the Thatcher Professor in Medical Humanities at Davidson College until 1999, when she began her professorship at the University of North Carolina.&lt;ref name="cdcc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosemarie Tong|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Tong.html|website=cddc.vt.edu|publisher=CDCC|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She chaired the American Philosophical Association’s Committee on the Status of Women from 2003-2007.  From 1999-2002 she was the co-coordinator of the International Network for Feminist Approaches to Bioethics.  Tong has also served as chair of the Institutional Review Board’s Conflict of Interest Committee at Chesapeake Research, Inc., co-chair of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine’s Task Force on Pandemic Influenza, and on the boards of the  U.S. Women’s Bioethics Project, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics.

Tong has been a consultant to the Advanced Center for Learning Studies, the [[Fulbright Foundation]], the [[Hastings Center]], the National Advisory Board on Ethics and Reproduction, and curricular programs involving medical humanities bioethics and women's studies. She has received grants from the [[Sloan Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the Fullerton Foundation and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name="UNC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cdcc" /&gt;

She has written 13 books and more than 100 papers, and was the series editor of the ''Point/Counterpoint'' series and the ''New Feminist Perspectives'' series from Rowman and Littlefield Press.&lt;ref name="UNC" /&gt;

In ''Feminist Thought''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Thought|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|publisher=Westview Press, A Member of the Perseus Books Group|year=1998|isbn=0-8133-3332-6|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tong describes intersectionality and its importance to the globalization of feminism. Tong suggests that intersectionality represents the commitment of women and global feminists, regardless of culture, to "widen the scope of feminist thought." Although global feminism is defined by the sexual issues and gender discrimination of women, its personal twist stems from the political and economic disparities. "Third World" women are far more concerned with the latter disparities separating them from their privileged oppressors. The political agenda of the western world has direct implications on the globalization of the rest of the world, the "non-west."

'''Semantic architecture''' is a novel concept in software architecture which envisions enabling the architecture community to unambiguously capture, catalog, communicate, preserve, and interoperably exchange semantics of their architectures, thus making architecture descriptions true assets.

== Overview ==

The overall goals of the semantic architecture are
* to define a formal semantic way of representing architecture intended to be both human and machine readable
* to describe a system architecture at a high level of abstraction
* to support automatic generation of software architecture models
* to permit analysis of architectural quality attributes
* to provide a repository of patterns expressed utilizing the semantic web standards RDF/S and OWL

In order to achieve these goals, the software architecture community and industry need to define
* a common architecture description language
* an OWL ontology for architecture data models
* a set of tools for capturing, querying, and visualizing all aspects and view points of an architecture

The tooling or toolkits for semantic architecture should
* be suitable for communicating an architecture to all stakeholders
* supports architecture creation, refinement, evaluation, and validation of quality attributes
* provides a basis for further implementation
* allows the architecture community to exchange semantics of architecture styles and patterns in an interoperable fashion

'''''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality''''' is a 2000 book by the biologist [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], in which the author explores the social construction of gender, and the social and medical treatment of [[intersex]] people. She stated that in it she sets out to "convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development."&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Fausto-Sterling  mentions the most common types of [[intersex]], congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), gonadal dysgenesis, hypospadias, and unusual chromosome compositions such as XXY (Klinefelter Syndrome) or X0 (Turner Syndrome).&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000"&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling (2000). Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

She gives [[John Money]]'s view of intersexuality by stating,: “Intersexuality, in Money's view, resulted from fundamentally ab-normal processes. Their patients required medical treatment because they ought to have become either a male or a female. The goal of treatment was to assure proper psychosexual development by assigning the young mixed-sex child to the proper gender…” &lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt; Money declared, "From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis.” Money is disproved in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body when it is stated that congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) girls tend to manufacture larger amounts of masculine hormones until birth and the production of these male hormones raises the question among scientist of whether or not the excess male hormones that a CAH girl produces has an effect on her brain development.&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000" /&gt;

Fausto-Sterling argues surgery on intersex babies should wait until the child can make an informed decision, and label surgery without consent as [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]]. In "Sexing the Body", Sterling describes the grueling process of transforming an intersex person into the desired sex, and the appearance of a "densely scarred and immobile penis" or “extensive suturing [or] skin transplants in such a way that it seems difficult for anyone to endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterlin|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the decision should be made strictly by the parents without any coercion or influence presented by the doctor, it is ultimately the “physicians who decide how to manage intersexuality”.&lt;ref name="Sterlin 2000 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how impartial they attempt to be, physicians simply “act out of, and perpetuate, deeply held beliefs about male and female sexuality, gender roles, and the (im)proper place of homosexuality in normal development” when performing the necessary surgery for the chosen gender.&lt;ref name="Sterlin 2000 48"/&gt;

Fausto-Sterling’s article titled “Of Gender and Genitals: The Use and Abuse of the Modern Intersexual” criticizes the standard model of sex and gender by using the case of intersex individuals by explaining how those individuals are neither male nor female so they do not fit in the sex binary. It is suggested that “bodies… only live within the productive constrains of certain highly regulatory schemas.” People must be “culturally intelligible as males or females”. While the standard model says that sex is biologically determined, Fausto-Sterling challenges this by stating “From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes, doctors decide the sex of an intersex infant immediately after birth. Doctors choose the sex based on what they believe a male or a female should look like. In essence, society decides what is male or female.  Fausto-Sterling portrays how our society puts a great deal of trust in doctors because they are seen as the experts and those who decide what nature tells us. Doctors for decades past have felt the need to immediately “correct” intersex children after birth. Fausto-Sterling states, “The attending physician, realizing that the newborn's genitalia are either/or, neither/both, consults a pediatric endocrinologist (children's hormone specialist) and a surgeon. They declare a state of medical emergency. According to current treatment standards, there is no time to waste in quiet reflection or open-ended consultations with the parents”.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 45]&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors felt that this was a medical emergency because intersex children were seen as abnormal, and because we live in a society based on heternormativity, physicians were pressured to make anything abnormal, normal. Fausto-Sterling mentions that “no masculine women or effeminate men need apply.” These individuals are considered to be “unthinkable, abject, unlivable.” As this belief is deeply rooted in people’s mind, it is essential and imperative for “surgeons, psychologists, and endocrinologists, through their surgical skills, [to] try to make good facsimiles of culturally intelligible bodies.” Contrary to the belief that physicians thought it was vital to immediately decide a sex for an intersex child, evidence shows that just because science chooses a sex for a child that does not guarantee that the child will grow up to “fit” that gender role. For example, the article states, “These individuals seemed to be listening to some inner voice that said that everyone in authority surrounding h/her was wrong. Doctors and parents might have insisted that they were female, removed their testes, injected them with estrogen, and surgically provided them with a vagina, but still, they knew they were really males”.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are the exception to the standard model and a prime example of why the standard model is not relevant. These types of people do not properly fit the sexual dimorphism so a more acceptable categorization would be the alternative model. The alternative model a spectrum with completely male on one side and completely female on the other, leaving room for sexually ambiguous humans to be categorized somewhere in between.

In "Of Gender and Genitals", Anne Fausto-Sterling illustrates how the standard model of the difference between sex and gender can be at times damaging and how it necessitates that doctors’ uphold to certain protocol in order to maintain it. She informs the reader that the extensive surgeries intersex children undergo soon after birth are both “unnecessary and sexually damaging”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants, if born intersex, are subjected to a number of considerable surgeries as soon as they are born merely to uphold to society’s standard model. If society’s view changed to that of a gender-sex spectrum, these babies would be given the freedom to choose their own gender when they become of age. Unfortunately that was not the case in the past. Instead, for example, intersex babies, who were chosen to function as a male, experienced multiple surgeries “on their penises during the first couple of years of their lives”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with the parents of intersex children, doctors must follow certain guidelines so as not to dishearten the parents’ of their children’s normality. Fausto-Sterling specifically references some doctors’ endeavor towards “discouraging any feeling of sexual ambiguity” for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title="Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Fausto-Sterling says, "[o]ur conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body:gender and politics and the construction of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People''' are international clinical protocols outlining the recommended assessment and treatment for gender non-conforming individuals across the lifespan or transgender or transsexual people who wish to undergo social, hormonal or [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgical]] transition to the other sex.  Clinicians' decisions regarding patients' treatment are often influenced by this standard of care (SOC).

Prior to the advent of the first SOCs, there was no semblance of consensus on psychiatric, psychological, medical, and surgical requirements or procedures.  Before the 1960s, few countries offered safe, legal medical options and many criminalized cross-gender behaviors or mandated unproven psychiatric treatments.  In response to this problem, the [[Harry Benjamin]] International Gender Dysphoria Association (now known as the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]]) authored one of the earliest sets of clinical guidelines for the express purpose of ensuring "lasting personal comfort with the gendered self in order to maximize overall psychological well-being and self-fulfillment." These standards are still the most well-known; however, other sets of SOCs, protocols and guidelines do exist, especially outside the United States.

== WPATH Standards of Care==
The ''Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People'' by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health ([[WPATH]]), formerly known as the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association Standards of Care, are the most widespread SOC used by professionals working with transsexual, transgender, or [[Gender variance|gender variant]] people.&lt;ref name="wpath-criteria-2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Britt Colebunders|author2=Griet De Cuypere|author3=Stan Monstrey|title=New Criteria for Sex Reassignment Surgery: ''WPATH Standards of Care, Version 7'', Revisited|journal=[[International Journal of Transgenderism]]|date=2015|volume=16|issue=4|page=222-233|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2015.1081086|accessdate=December 10, 2016|doi=10.1080/15532739.2015.1081086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/health/transgender-medically-necessary-procedures/index.html|title=What is medically necessary treatment for gender-affirming health care?|last=Grinberg|first=Emanuella|date=2018-07-20|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WPATH-SOC are periodically updated and revised. The latest revision was released September 25, 2011. This is the seventh version of the WPATH-SOC since the original 1979 document was drafted. Previous revisions were released in 1980, 1981, 1990, 1998, and 2001.&lt;ref name="wpath-soc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards of Care, Version 7|url=https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc|website=WPATH|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==WPATH SOC, version 7==
Included in the guidelines are sections on purpose and use of the WPATH-SOC, the global applicability of the WPATH-SOC, the difference between gender nonconformity and gender dysphoria, [[epidemiology]], treatment of children, adolescents and adults, [[mental health]], hormone replacement therapy ([[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|female-to-male]] or [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|male-to-female]]; HRT), reproductive health, voice and communication therapy, [[sex reassignment surgery]], lifelong preventive and primary care, applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people living in institutional environments, and applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people with [[disorders of sex development]].

== Summary of WPATH-SOC For Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version ==
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpath.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/WPATHsocv6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth revision recommends that mental health professionals document a patient's relevant history in a letter, which should be required by medical professionals prior to physical intervention. One letter is required for hormone replacement therapy or either [[augmentation mammoplasty]] or [[male chest reconstruction]]. Two additional letters are needed for genital surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mental Health Professional." ''The World Professional Association for Transgender Health's Standards Of Care For Gender Identity Disorders.'' 6th ed. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eligibility Criteria and Readiness Criteria in version 6 give certain very specific minimum requirements as prerequisites to HRT or sex reassignment surgery (SRS). For this and other reasons, the WPATH-SOC is a controversial and often maligned document among patients seeking medical intervention (hormones, and/or surgery), who state that their legally protected right to proper medical care and treatment is unjustly and unduly withheld or even denied based on the SOC.

WPATH-SOC sections One through Four are introductory in nature, explaining (section I) the purpose, intent, and need for the SOC, (section II) epidemiological considerations relating to transsexual people, (section III) diagnostic nomenclature, and (section IV) the job of the mental health professional.  The assessment and treatment of children and adolescents is covered in section V. 

Sections Five through Eight begin the actual guide to treatment. They specifically address the manner in which to assess and support gender non-conforming children and how to diagnose transgender identity or transsexualism in both teens and adults; the manner in which to document the diagnoses and recommendations ("The Letter") and also covers requirements and treatment using hormones, including use and effects of hormones.

Section Nine covers "The Real-life Experience," during which individuals seeking hormonal and other treatments are expected to begin transitioning publicly to their preferred gender role.

WPATH-SOC sections Ten through Twelve specifically cover the surgical treatment of transsexual people. Section Twelve, titled "Genital Surgery," deals directly with all concerns about sex reassignment surgery. It includes six "Eligibility Criteria" and two "Readiness Criteria", which are intended to be used by professionals for both diagnosis and guidance before providing patients "letters of recommendation."

The Thirteenth and final section covers "post-transition follow-up".

== Criticism of the WPATH-SOC ==
Numerous criticisms have been made against the WPATH-SOC over the course of its history, some of which are reflected in later versions of the guidelines.  Most of these criticisms are related to the strictness of the requirements, noting that the rate of post-surgical regret among transsexual people is very low — lower than many medically necessary and cosmetic procedures with less stringent requirements. Provisions related to the necessity of real-life experience (noting that requiring real-life experience in an incongruous anatomical/social role can be both mentally harmful as well as physically dangerous to the individual) have been particularly under fire. For many, it is safe only to express gender outwardly in limited settings (8/7, 12/7 or 18/7 rather than all day,  every day (24/7).  This is now taken into consideration in version 7. 


The WPATH SOC version 6 and 7 allow for referral for puberty blocking medication to be prescribed to youth experiencing puberty, starting at Tanner stage&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_scale&lt;/ref&gt; 2 or above. Referral after that age could lead to bodily changes reversible only with surgery (facial shape, secondary sex characteristics); surgically risky (voice pitch); or, irreversible changes (skeletal structure or height).  The WPATH SOC version 7 has also removed the set length of time for psychotherapy, in order to facilitate support and referral to transition services in a timely way, should they be required.  These changes have led some critics to claim that the criteria are too loose, however, an individualized approach that provides prospective, supportive follow-up and education to families about how to affirm expression, and create an environment for safe exploration has always been recommended. 

WPATH has also come under fire for adopting pathological language when referring to Intersex individuals in its latest revision, SOC 7. The SOC uses the term "Disorders of Sex development" even though many Intersex individuals don't consider their biological differences a disorder, and argue that the language used by the SOC is stigmatizing and offensive.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Other SOCs, protocols and guidelines for treatment of Gender Dysphoria ==
In some countries or areas, local standards of care exist, such as in the Netherlands, Germany or Italy. Also, some health care providers have their own set of SOCs which have to be followed to have access to health care.
The criticism about the WPATH-SOCs applies to these as well; some of these SOCs are based on much older versions of the WPATH-SOCs, or are entirely independent of them. A more lenient version that has been increasing in acceptance is the Health Law Standards Of Care, developed by the Health Law Project (also known as the ICTLEP guidelines), which is based on a harm-reduction model.

Treatment according to older SOCs is often reserved for [[transsexual]] people only, not for other [[transgender]] people, who might not want to undergo the complete set of treatments, or who see themselves outside a [[binary gender system]]. Such older SOCs are often used to withhold medical interventions from [[transgender]] people altogether.

In other regions, notably [[Latin America]], surgeons follow no particular set standards and use their own criteria for eligibility for surgery.

In Western countries the emphasis is on [[psychiatry]] or [[psychology]]; typically, in Latin America, the emphasis is on the ability to "[[Passing (gender)|pass]]", and in Thailand the emphasis is on cross-living experience.

==Background==
===Education and career===
Clark was born on 30 October 1945 in [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]], though the family came originally from Shropshire/Staffordshire. His father, D.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;R. Clark, was an apprentice railway engineer who became a technology teacher, and was later appointed principal of Middlesbrough Technical College, now the University of Teesside, then principal of Nottingham Technical College, now Trent University. His mother, M.&amp;nbsp;K. Clark, was a teacher and the daughter of [[Samuel Finney]]. Clark was raised in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Gifford&gt;Hancock, Brannon. [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=42 "Stephen R L Clark"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815022646/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=42 |date=15 August 2010 }}, Gifford Lectures, accessed 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending Nottingham High School (1956–1964), he won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1964–1968), graduating with a first-class honours degree in [[greats]] (classics) in 1968, followed by a fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] (1968–1975). He was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1973. Brannon Hancock writes that the philosophers [[Arthur Prior]] and [[Anthony Kenny|Sir Anthony Kenny]] had a great intellectual influence on Clark at Balliol, while [[Robin Zaehner]] was one of his greatest influences at All Souls.&lt;ref name=Gifford/&gt;

After Oxford, he lectured in [[moral philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] for nine years, until he was appointed professor of philosophy at Liverpool in 1984. He retired from this post at the end of 2009. He has also been a visiting professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] and held an Alan Richardson Fellowship at [[Durham University]]. He is married to Gillian Clark, with whom he has three children, Samuel, Alexandra, and Verity.&lt;ref name=Gifford/&gt;

===Lectures===
Clark has delivered a number of prestigious lectures, including the 1981–1982 [[Gifford Lectures]] at the University of Glasgow, entitled "From Athens to Jerusalem", the Stanton Lectures in Philosophy of Religion at the University of Cambridge (1987–1989), and the Wilde Lectures at the University of Oxford (1990). He has also delivered the Scott Holland Lecture at the University of Liverpool (1992), the Aquinas Lecture at the University of Oxford (1994), the Read Tuckwell Lecture at Bristol University (1994), the Royal Institute of Philosophy Lecture at the University of Durham (1995), and the Aquinas Lecture at the Catholic University of Leuven (2000).&lt;ref name=Gifford/&gt; 

==Work on animal rights==
Clark served on the British government's [[Animal Procedures Committee]], a group that advises the Home Secretary on [[animal testing]], from 1998 until 2006. He has also been involved with the [[Boyd Group]], a think tank set up by researchers involved in animal testing, and others who oppose it.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Clark argues that the moral basis of humanism – that all human beings have equal moral status – is now so entrenched, in theory if not in practice, that we fail to consider what a radical idea it used to be. He writes that behind this idea is the notion that human beings are in some way uniquely gifted, perhaps with a share in the divine. This human/non-human divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation, rather than as ends in themselves.&lt;ref name=ClarkRSPCA&gt;Clark, Stephen R. L. [http://articles.animalconcerns.org/ar-voices/archive/on_their_side.html "A view of animals and how they stand"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428124856/http://articles.animalconcerns.org/ar-voices/archive/on_their_side.html |date=28 April 2006 }}, RSPCA, accessed 16 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes that we now know non-human animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought, and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them. He highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of God, yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea, namely that we ought not to treat non-humans with radically less consideration than we treat humans. He writes: "If species differences are only racial differences 'writ large,' and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment ... we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to non-humans." He argues that "[t]his is often all that is meant by the claim that 'animals have rights.'"&lt;ref name=ClarkRSPCA/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt, harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves. The question before us is not simply "how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain" (a wholly vacuous program), nor yet "what rights do creatures have before the community formulates them," but how may we best order the communities (social and global) of which we are parts? The answer, I believe, must lie in our taking seriously what we already know, that more matters even to animals than their own plain or pleasure, and that our survival even as a species depends upon being able to maintain or create substantial and civil ecosystems at household, civil, national and global levels.&lt;ref name=ClarkRSPCA/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">'''Tasos Zembylas''' (born 1962 in [[Cyprus]]) is a [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Social sciences|social scientist]] with focus in [[aesthetics]] and [[Cultural institutions|cultural institution]] studies.

== Life ==

From 1991 to 1997, Zembylas studied philosophy, history of art and sociology at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1995 he held a research grant at the "Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften" in Vienna. From 1997 to 1999 he was commissioned to carry out various studies in the field of [[education]] and [[vocational training]]. He also lectured on aesthetics and sociology of art at the University of Vienna and at the University of Applied Art in Vienna. In 1999, he was appointed assistant professor at the Institute of Culture Management and Culture Studies of the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna]]. Having completed his advanced habilitation thesis in 2003, he was appointed university professor for [[Cultural Institutions Studies]] at the same institute. In 2009, Zembylas was visiting professor at [[Zeppelin University]] in Friedrichshafen, and 2010 he moved to the Institute for Music Sociology at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.

== Research ==

Major research interests of Tasos Zembylas are [[epistemology]] of artistic creative practices, [[Cultural Institutions Studies]], and [[cultural policy]].
In the 1990s Tasos Zembylas investigated the formation process of the contemporary concept of art. His approach was to study not only relevant discourses and art theories in [[visual arts]], but, equally important, to describe and analyse institutional structures, processes of valuations and other practices taking place in the art world. He thereby developed a practice-oriented and practice-theoretical approach to the [[sociology]] of the arts.
The close connection between arts and social practices, as well as between [[art world]]s and [[social structure]]s embodied in cultural activities, led Zembylas in early 2000s to focus on cultural, social, political and economic analysis of arts and culture. His theoretical efforts resulted in the elaboration of an inter-disciplinary approach towards the major topics of [[cultural institution studies]]. In addition to his theoretical work, Zembylas has conducted several empirical studies, notably on public funding of the arts in Austria, which dealt with the legal standards prevailing in administrative subsidy procedures as well as the effects of public funding policies.
From 2006 to 2008, together with Claudia Dürr, Zembylas investigated the literary [[writing process]] from an epistemological perspective. The study focused on the formation and effects of artistic-practical know-how, as well as on the role of professional experience in the [[creative process]]. This study led to a general [[epistemology]] of artistic creative practices.
From 2013 to 2015, together with Andreas Holzer, Annegret Huber, Martin Niederauer and Rosa Reitsamer, Zembylas conducted a similar study on [[Musical composition|composition]] processes in the field of contemporary [[art music]]. In this case, the focus was on the materiality and processuality of artistic practices. In addition, the synergy of different forms of [[knowledge]] (especially [[tacit knowledge]]) was systematically investigated.
Tasos Zembylas has also published a literary travelogue about [[Mount Athos|Athos]]. In it he not only addressed religious practices but also the economic management of the Holy Monastery of [[Vatopedi]], which made the headlines in the international press in 2008 in connection with a real estate scandal.

'''Thích Thanh Từ''' (born July 24, 1924) is a Vietnamese [[Zen Buddhist]] monk. He has    been most influential of increasing traditional [[Vietnamese Buddhism]] practices in Vietnam.   

==Biography==
Thích Thanh Từ began his life in a well-educated family that followed [[Cao Đài]], a Vietnamese religion founded in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on July 24, 1924 in [[Cần Thơ]], Vietnam with the birth name of Trần Hữu Phước.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was determined to become a Buddhist monk after noticing the suffering of his people during wartime and after 3 months of Buddhist duties and at the age of 25 was given his Buddhist name which he is now known by, Thích Thanh Từ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After 3 years of servicing as an expression of gratitude towards his master he finally decided to leave so he could find his true self, which resulted in secluding himself in a meditation chamber that he built in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to discover the concept of [[Nothingness]] after many of attempts at other meditation practices. Realizing how powerful his [[meditation]] can be he wanted to expose himself to the public and teach the Buddhist ways and lived by the phrase "After realization, enlighten others.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
Thích Thanh Từ began his teachings in December 1971 with only 10 students and involved [[scripture]]s, [[discourse]]s, history and meditation methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His focus is to be aware of any false thoughts, but prevent from attaching to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later opened three new monasteries which included Linh Quang, Chân Không, [[Bát Nhã]] monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; From the initial 10 students he taught, he went on to teach thousands of other monks and nuns to pass on his [[dharma]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truclamvietzen.net/MasterTTT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded Thường Chiếu monastery (1974) in [[Đà Lạt]] which became the headquarters of his organization in 1986. Thích Thanh Từ discovered meditation to help improve the common practice of Vietnamese [[Zen]] in Vietnam, mainly at the site of the Trúc Lâm school. His practice methods are constructed from 3 important keys in historical Zen from China, which consists of patriarch Huệ Khả, Huệ Năng, and Trúc Lâm Đầu Đà. He put together their enlightened ideas and practice which they now practice in his monasteries’. He refers to the "Transmission of the Lamp"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.353&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the main objectives of distributing his teachings among his students of the Trúc Lâm philosophies. He talks about lighting 10 to 20 torches which will then light 30 to 40 torches in order to light up the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.353&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trúc Lâm==

===History===
Trúc Lâm was founded in and around the time of [[Trần Nhân Tông]] (1258–1308) who was a former king of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.350&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Trúc Lâm Temple]] was on top of Yên Tử Mountain where Nhan Tong retired to.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.351&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only school of Zen that was founded in Vietnam instead of originating from China. The Trúc Lâm sect grew enormously with the help of the next 2 patriarchs, Pháp Loa and Huyền Quang. Once they came to the end of their time, the school successfully came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.351&lt;/ref&gt; After many attempts to revive the school, Thích Thanh Từ is the most recent and becoming the most successful monk to restore Trúc Lâm. He built a monastery in Yên Tử Mountain to re-connect the meaning of Trúc Lâm to its origin, and while using this name, is able to strengthen the impact of his movement.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.352&lt;/ref&gt; Although it can be argued that what he had created was not original Trúc Lâm Buddhism but still had a positive effect on the reform of Buddhism on the global level.

===Thích Thanh Từ's influence===
His efforts are brought forth from the principles of 3 patriarchs whom he believes have very minimal amounts of transition from traditional Chinese Buddhism. Thích Thanh Từ claims to be re-establishing the Trúc Lâm traditions but in his own way has modified it from its original ways. He wasn't much of a global influence in his earlier years of work, but in recent history has been on top of Buddhist movements on the global level.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor, ''Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post-revolutionary Vietnam'' (Maryland, USA, 2008), p.363&lt;/ref&gt; His initial work in Vietnam has now moved onwards to western civilization by getting his word across through the translation of books that he has written. He is having the most influence on today's view on Buddhism and what it means to be a Buddhist monk through the implementation of the revived religion referred to as Trúc Lâm.

'''''Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible''''' is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] to the [[Bible]] compiled by [[Robert Young (biblical scholar)|Robert Young]] first published in 1879.

==Contents==
* ''Hints and Helps to Bible Interpretation'' (only in some later editions)
* ''Analytical Concordance'' - Each entry can contain the multiple original language words in the original language and in a phonetic vocalization into English. It also gives the extended meaning and usage of the word in the original language. This is a "[[Bible concordance]]" to the [[King James Version|King James Version (KJV)]] and not a [[lexicon]] of the [[Biblical Hebrew|OT Hebrew]] or [[Koine|NT Greek]] languages.
* ''Index lexicons to the Old and New Testaments, being a guide to parallel passages'' prepared by Wm. B. Stevenson.
* The British eighth edition also includes ''A complete list of Scripture Proper Names as in the Authorised and Revised Versions, showing their modern pronunciation and the exact form of the original Hebrew'' by the same author. This appendix also has an informative introduction.

==Editions==
British editions and American editions are numbered differently.

===British editions===

'''Zera Yacob''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪər|ə|_|j|æ|ˈ|k|oʊ|b}}; {{lang-gez|ዘርአ:ያዕቆብ}} ''zar'ā yāʿiqōb'' "Seed of Jacob," modern ''Zer'a Yā'iqōb''; also spelled ''Zärˀä Yaˁqob'', ''Zar'a Ya'aqob'', or ''Zar'a Ya'eqob''; 1599–1692) was a seventeenth-century [[Ethiopian philosophy|Ethiopian philosopher]]. His 1667 treatise, known in the original [[Ge'ez language]] as the ''[[Hatata]]'', has often been compared by a handful of non-traditional scholars to [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Discours de la méthode]]'' (1637). His writing came at a period when African philosophical literature was significantly oral in character. He believed in following one's natural reasoning instead of believing what one is told by others.

==Biography==
[[File:ET Axum asv2018-01 img33 StMary of Zion Church.jpg|thumb|right|250px|17th-century church in [[Axum]]]]
Yacob  was born into a Tigrayan farmer's family near [[Aksum]] in northern Ethiopia, the former capital of Ethiopia under the ancient [[kingdom of Aksum]]. Yacob's name means "The Seed of Jacob" ("Zar" is the [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] word for "seed"). Although his father was poor, he supported Yacob's attendance of traditional schools, where he became acquainted with the Psalms of [[David]] and educated in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Christian faith. He was denounced before Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r. 1607-1632), who had turned to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith and ordered his subjects to follow his own example.

Refusing to adopt the Catholic faith, Yacob fled into exile with some [[gold]] and the Book of [[Psalms]]. On the road to [[Shewa]] in the south, he found a cave at the foot of the [[Tekezé River]] and lived in it as a hermit for two years, praying and developing his philosophy. He wrote of his experience, "I have learnt more while living alone in a cave than when I was living with scholars. What I wrote in this book is very little; but in my cave I have meditated on many other such things."

After the death of the Emperor, Susenyos's son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasiledes]] (r. 1632-1667), a firm adherent of the Ethiopian [[Orthodox church]], took power, expelling the Jesuits, and extirpated the [[Catholic]] faith in his kingdom in 1633. Yacob left his cave and settled in [[Emfraz]]. He found a patron, a rich merchant named Habta Egziabher (known as Habtu), and married a maid of the family. He refused to live as a monk and stated that "the law of Christians which propounds the superiority of monastic life over marriage is false and can’t come from God." However, he also rejected polygamy because "the law of creation orders one man to marry one woman."

Yacob became the teacher of Habtu's two sons, and at the request of his patron's son [[Walda Heywat]], Yacob wrote his famous 1667 Treatise investigating the light of reason. Yacob is most noted for this [[Ethics|ethical]] philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He purported that an action's [[morality]] is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. His philosophy is [[Theism|theistic]] in nature. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world. In [[Hatata]] in following in the footsteps of great church fathers, Yacob applied the idea of the first cause to his proof for the existence of God. "If I say that my father and my mother created me, then I must search for the creator of my parents and of the parents of my parents until they arrive at the first who were not created as we [are] but who came into this world in some other way without being generated." However, the knowability of God does not depend on human intellect, but "Our soul has the power of having the concept of God and of seeing him mentally. God did not give this power purposelessly; as he gave the power, so did he give the reality."

Little is known of Yacob's later life. However, it is believed that he lived a fulfilled family life in Emfraz, and remained there for the next 25 years. He died there in 1692. Yacob's year of death was recorded by Walda Heywat in an annotation to the ''Treatise''.
