The {{nihongo|'''2002 Japan animal cruelty case'''|福岡猫虐待事件|Fukuoka neko gyakutai jiken|"Fukuoka cat cruelty case"}} was an [[animal cruelty]] case involving the [[torture]] and death of a [[cat]] in [[Japan]]. The case was a significant development as [[Cruelty to animals#Japan|Japanese animal abuse laws]] had previously been lax and seldom enforced.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On May 6 and May 7, 2002, a 26-year-old unemployed [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]],{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Hiroshima Prefecture]] man named {{nihongo|Jun Matsubara|松原 潤|Matsubara Jun}} captured a kitten in his [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] neighborhood and took it into his home. Matsubara tortured the cat for four hours by cutting off its ear and tail before strangling the cat with a piece of string. Matsubara hung the cat into a river.&lt;ref name=Spared&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20021022a6.html |title=Cat-killer spared after privacy 'invaded' |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725071725/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20021022a6.html |archivedate=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matsubara took photographs of the torture and posted them onto [[2channel]]. A placard seen in the final photograph reads in Japanese "Offer to the brothers of Kuromutsu in the world!! Oscar Dill". ''Kuromutsu'' generally refers to people that kill dogs and cats; it is used on 2ch to refer to the "I hate pets" subforum.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A poster discovered the pictures and contacted the appropriate authorities, who then proceeded to arrest Matsubara. Matsubara was sentenced on October 21, 2002 to six months' imprisonment, but the judge suspended the jail term because his privacy was violated due to the incident.&lt;ref name=Spared/&gt;

The cat who died was [[Wiktionary: posthumous|posthumously]] named "Kogenta" (こげんた) by a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[priest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5128">'''BAZAAR Stars’ Charity Night''' ({{zh|c=芭莎明星慈善夜|s=|t=|p=|j=}}) is an annual fundraising gala hosted by [[Harper's Bazaar|Harper’s Bazaar]] China in China for Chinese celebrities who support charities. The event was founded at 2003 due to the outbreak of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] upon [[Na Ying]]'s suggestion and the fundraising event was continued every year ever since.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/f/s/2015bazaar/|title=芭莎慈善夜|last=|first=|date=|website=Sina Entertainment|language=zh|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, the charity night has been a collaboration between Harper's Bazaar China and [[Zhejiang Television]] where the latter will broadcast the charity night on national television. In recent years, the event is divided into the auction segment and the donation segment with intervals of performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20161004/50061442_0.shtml|title=黄奕亮相芭莎明星慈善夜 助力慈善捐赠10辆救护车|last=|first=|date=2016-10-04|work=iFeng Entertainment News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Origin ==

=== Suggestion ===
During the outbreak of SARS, the crew of Harper's Bazaar China felt a strong social responsibility to contribute for the betterment of the society. Singer Na Ying suggested auctioning clothes and items owned by fellow celebrities and donate the money to the poor. First few years of operation for this fund raising event was not a media highlight as not many sponsors and brands gave their support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The induction of more celebrities made the fundraising event a national event and a commercial success. The event is attended by the Chinese entertainment industry with guest ranging from singers, actors, actresses to entertainment moguls.

'''Bhagoria Fest''' is a [[festival]] celebrated by the tribal people of the [[India]]n state [[Madhya Pradesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bhagoria-festival-to-get-r-day-platform-tribal-outfits-frown/ | title=Bhagoria festival to get R-Day platform, tribal outfits frown | work=Indian Express | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally known as '[[Malwa]]'). Also known as Bhagoria Haat Festival, during this festival, young boys and girls are allowed to [[Elopement (marriage)|elope]] after choosing their partners. The Bhagoria Haat Festival belongs to the local tribes called [[Bhil]]s and [[Bhilala]]s.

Bhagoria Haat Festival is organized in [[Khargone district]] and [[Jhabua District|Jhabua]]. The haat is organized in the form of a '[[Swayamvara|swayamvar]]' or a marriage market where young girls and boys are allowed to choose their partners. Bhagoria Haat Festival has an agricultural significance attached to it, that is, it coincides with the end of harvesting. So some people also celebrate it to mark the completion of [[harvest]]ing.

But the star attraction of Bhagoria Haat Festival of [[Madhya Pradesh]] is the running away of young boys and girls with their partner who are later accepted as husband and wife by the society. During the Bhagoria Haat Festival in Madhya Pradesh, the boys put red [[powder (substance)|powder]] on the face of the girl to whom he wants to get married, if the girl too wishes to marry the same boy, she has to put the same red powder on the boy's face after which both of them run away from that place. But if the girl does not agree in the first chance, the boy can go behind her to persuade her and may win her heart.

Bhagoria Haat Festival at Madhya Pradesh is celebrated in the month of March before the [[Holi festival]].

Muscle spasm and inflammation within the bronchi get worse this narrowing. Bitolterol relaxes the smooth muscles  present continuously around the bronchi and bronchioles facilitating the flow of air through them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">'''Bonuviers Teater''' ('Bonuvier Theatre') was a historic theatre in [[Åbo]] in Finland, active between 1813 and 1827. It was the first theater in Finland alongside the ''[[Engels Teater]]'' in [[Helsinki]], and the first theatre in Åbo.  It was the predecessor of the [[Åbo Svenska Theater]].  

Turku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of [[Sweden]], and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the [[Stenborg Troupe]] in the 1761 and the company of [[Carl Seuerling]] in the 1780s.  There where however, no proper theatre building. 

It was founded by the actor and theater director [[Karl Gustav Bonuvier]]. The permit of the building was given in 1813, and the building was completed in 1817. It was used by travelling theater companies. Initially, Bonuvier's own company used the building between their tours in other parts of the country. In 1820, it was used by the company of [[Anders Peter Berggren]], and in 1824-25 by Johan Gustaf Lemke (1790-1825).

The theatre was destroyed during the [[Great Fire of Turku]] of 1827.

The '''Bunny Man''' is an [[urban legend]] that originated from two incidents in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in 1970, but has been spread throughout the [[Washington, D.C.]], area. The legend has many variations; most involve a man wearing a rabbit costume who attacks people with an axe or hatchet.

Most of the stories occur around Colchester Overpass, a [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] overpass spanning Colchester Road near [[Clifton, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|38|47|23|N|77|21|44|W|type:landmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as "Bunny Man Bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/with-legend-of-the-bunnyman-a-local-band-celebrates-a-quirky-urban-myth/2014/06/02/0252e9e6-ea65-11e3-93d2-edd4be1f5d9e_story.html|title=A tale about a tail: Northern Virginia band explores the bloody Bunny Man myth in a new rock opera|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the legend vary in the Bunny Man's name, motives, weapons, victims, description of the bunny costume or lack thereof, and sometimes even his possible death. In some accounts, victims' bodies are mutilated, and in some variations, the Bunny Man's ghost or aging spectre is said to come out of his place of death each year on Halloween to commemorate his passing.

==Origin==
[[Fairfax County Public Library]] Historian-Archivist Brian A. Conley extensively researched the  Bunny Man legend. He has located two incidents of a man in a rabbit costume threatening people with an axe. The vandalism reports occurred a week apart in 1970 in [[Burke, Virginia]].
 
The first incident was reported the evening of October 19, 1970, by [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] Cadet Robert Bennett and his fiancée, who were visiting relatives on Guinea Road in Burke. Around midnight, while returning from a football game, they reportedly parked their car in a field on Guinea Road to "visit an Uncle who lived across the street from where the car was parked". As they sat in the front seat with the motor running, they noticed something moving outside the rear window. Moments later, the front passenger window was smashed, and there was a white-clad figure standing near the broken window. Bennett turned the car around while the man screamed at them about trespassing, including: "You're on private property, and I have your tag number." As they drove down the road, the couple discovered a hatchet on the car floor.   
   
When the police requested a description of the man, Bennett insisted he was wearing a white suit with long bunny ears. However, Bennett's fiancée contested their assailant did not have bunny ears on his head, but was wearing a white [[capirote]] of some sort. They both remembered seeing his face clearly, but in the darkness, they could not determine his race. The police returned the hatchet to Bennett after examination. Bennett was required to report the incident upon his return to the Air Force Academy.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The second reported sighting occurred on the evening of October 29, 1970, when construction security guard Paul Phillips approached a man standing on the porch of an unfinished home, in Kings Park West on Guinea Road. Phillips said the man was wearing a gray, black, and white bunny costume, and was about 20 years old, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}} tall, and weighed about {{convert|175|lb|kg}}. The man began chopping at a porch post with a long-handled axe, saying: "You are trespassing. If you come any closer, I'll chop off your head." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/189694162/?terms=%22Bunny+Man%22-bugs|title=Antics of 'Bunny Man' Start Police Hopping|publisher=The Minneapolis Star|date=October 31, 1970|page=31|accessdate=13 August 2018|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The [[Fairfax County Police Department|Fairfax County Police]] opened investigations into both incidents, but both were eventually closed for lack of evidence. In the weeks following the incidents, more than 50 people contacted the police claiming to have seen the "Bunny Man". Several newspapers, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'', reported that the "Bunny Man" had eaten a man's runaway cat. The {{em|Post}} articles that mentioned this incident were:

*"Bunny Reports Are Multiplying" (November 6, 1970)

In 1973, Patricia Johnson, a student at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], submitted a research paper that chronicled precisely 54 variations on the two incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/library/branches/vr/bunny/bunny3.htm|title=The Bunny Man Unmasked - Page 3 - Fairfax County, Virginia|website=www.fairfaxcounty.gov|accessdate=21 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824121902/http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/library/branches/vr/bunny/bunny3.htm#|archive-date=2016-08-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend==

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The legend has circulated for years in several forms. A version naming a suspect and specific location was posted to a website in the late 1990s by a "Timothy C. Forbes". This version states that in 1904, an [[insane asylum|asylum]] [[prison]] in [[Clifton, Virginia]], was shut down due to a petition by the growing population of residents of Fairfax County. During the transfer of inmates to a new facility, one of the fifteen transports crashed; most, including the driver, were killed, but ten inmates escaped. A search party found all but one of them.

During this time, locals allegedly began to find hundreds of cleanly skinned, half-eaten carcasses of rabbits hanging from the trees in the surrounding areas. Another search of the area was ordered, and the police located the remains of Marcus Wallster, left in a similar fashion to the rabbit carcasses, hanging in a nearby tree, or under a bridge overpass—also known as the "Bunny Man Bridge"—along the railroad tracks at Colchester Road. Officials named the last missing inmate, Douglas J. Grifon, as their suspect, and called him "the bunny man".

In this version, officials finally managed to locate Grifon, but during their attempt to apprehend him at the overpass, he nearly escaped, before being hit by an oncoming train where the original transport crashed. Supposedly, after the train passed, the police heard laughter. It was eventually revealed that Grifon had been institutionalized for killing his family on [[Easter Sunday]].

For years after the "Bunny Man's" death, in the time approaching Halloween, carcasses are said to have been found hanging from the overpass and from trees in the surrounding area. A figure was reportedly seen by pedestrians making their way through the one-lane bridge tunnel.

According to Conley, this version is demonstrably false. Among other inconsistencies, Conley notes "there has never been an asylum for the insane in Fairfax County", and that "[[Lorton Prison]] didn't come into existence until 1910, and even then it was an arm of the District of Columbia Corrections system, not Virginia's." Moreover, court records show neither a Grifon nor a Wallster.

[[Cryptozoologist]] [[Loren Coleman]], on his blog ''Cryptomundo'' and in his book ''Weird Virginia'', in a section on the Bunny Man, wrote about a direct association between the legend and that of the [[Goatman (Maryland)|Goatman]] of nearby Maryland.

==Colchester Overpass==
Colchester Overpass was built in about 1906&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Netherton, Nan and Wykoff|first=Whitney Von Lake|title=Fairfax Station All Aboard|year=1995|publisher=Friends of the Fairfax Station|location=Fairfax Station, Virginia|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the site of Sangster's Station, a Civil War era railroad station on what was once the [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Netherton, Nan and Wykoff|first=Whitney Von Lake|title=Fairfax Station All Aboard|year=1995|publisher=Friends of the Fairfax Station|location=Fairfax Station, Virginia|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its association with the legend, the overpass is a popular destination for paranormal enthusiasts ([[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]]) and curiosity seekers ([[legend tripping|legend trippers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varhola|first=Michael J.|title=Ghosthunting Virginia (America's Haunted Road Trip)|year=2008|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=Chapter 2.

The railroad tracks overhead are used by trains of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Virginia Railway Express]] ([[Manassas Line]]), and [[Amtrak]]. Virginia Railway Express and Amtrak together account for 90 trains using the overpass each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line Schedule|url=http://www.vre.org/service/schedule.htm|publisher=Virginia Railway Express|accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the vicinity of Colchester Overpass, Colchester Road is narrow and winding, with limited visibility. In Fairfax County, Virginia, it is illegal to trespass on posted railroad tracks and to loiter in a public roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Code of Ordinances|first=Fairfax County Virginia|title=Chapter 5 - Offenses, Articles 1 and 4|url=http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=10051|publisher=Fairfax County|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 [[slasher film]] ''[[Bunnyman (film)|Bunnyman]]'' is an [[Exploitation film|exploitation]]-style version of the story.

In 2017, Badwolf Brewing Company, of Manassas, Virginia, released their hoppy, red lager known as The Bunny Man in a can that depicted the tunnel, a figure in a bunny suit, and a child holding a red balloon.

The 2017 Amazon original series ''[[Lore (TV series)|Lore]]'', based on the podcast of the same name, uses the Bunny Man legend to introduce the second episode of Season 1.

In {{em|[[The Chris Gethard Show]]}} episode "Let's Get Scared", host Chris Gethard dresses as the Bunny Man for the full episode.

'''CeBIT''' was the largest and most internationally representative [[computer expo]]. The trade fair was held each year on the [[Hanover fairground]], the world's largest fairground, in [[Hanover]], Germany. In its day, it was considered a barometer of current trends and a measure of the state of the art in [[information technology]]. It was organized by [[Deutsche Messe AG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebit.de/7612 Organizer of CeBIT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128052748/http://www.cebit.de/7612 |date=28 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an exhibition area of roughly 450,000 m² (5 million ft²) and a peak attendance of 850,000 visitors during the [[dot-com boom]], it was larger both in area and attendance than its Asian counterpart [[COMPUTEX]] and its no-longer held American equivalent [[COMDEX]]. '''CeBIT''' is a German language [[acronym]] for '''''Ce'''ntrum für '''B'''üroautomation, '''I'''nformationstechnologie und '''T'''elekommunikation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cebit.de/de/ueber-die-messe/daten-und-fakten/profil/geschichte-der-cebit |title=CeBIT – Daten und Fakten – Geschichte der CeBIT |publisher=Cebit.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101150416/http://www.cebit.de/de/ueber-die-messe/daten-und-fakten/profil/geschichte-der-cebit |archivedate=1 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "Center for Office Automation, Information Technology and Telecommunication".

The final CeBIT took place from June 11 to 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cebit.de/en/news/article/from-digital-trade-fair-to-innovation-festival-49366.xhtml|title=From Digital Trade Fair to Innovation Festival - CeBIT to take place in June|website=www.cebit.de|language=en|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CeBIT was traditionally the computing part of the [[Hanover Fair]], a big industry [[trade show]] held every year. It was first established in 1970, with the opening of the [[Hanover fairground]]'s new Hall&amp;nbsp;1, then the largest exhibition hall in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/70507/ 20 Jahre Centrum für "B" und "IT": Die CeBIT hat Geburtstag] {{de icon}} &amp;ndash; By Detlef Borchers, heise online, 8 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1980s the information technology and telecommunications part was straining the resources of the trade fair so much that it was given a separate trade show starting in 1986, which was held four weeks earlier than the main Hanover Fair.

While by 2007 the CeBIT expo attendance had shrunk to around 200,000 from those all-time highs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infomaticsonline.co.uk/crn/news/2186434/attendance-cebit-increases-200 Attendance for CeBIT increases to 200,000]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; attendance rebounded to 334,000 by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/1003/73657.html |title=Cebit 2010: Besucherzahlen leicht angestiegen |publisher=Golem.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 expo was marred by the [[police raid]]s of 51 exhibitors for [[patent infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/06/technology/EU-TEC-Germany-Tech-Fair-Raid.php |title=Authorities seize gadgets during patent raid at German tech fair |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210022354/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/06/technology/EU-TEC-Germany-Tech-Fair-Raid.php |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the U.S. state of California became official Partner State of Germany's IT and telecommunications industry association, BITKOM, and of CeBIT 2009. focusing on environmentally-friendly technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1046841/schwarzenegger-goes-cebit |title=Schwarzenegger goes to Cebit |publisher=Theinquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28 2018, Deutsche Messe AG [https://www.dw.com/en/germany-cebit-worlds-largest-it-conference-canned/a-46488844 announced] that due to increasingly declining visitor and exhibitioner numbers, CeBIT will be indefinitely canceled for the foreseeable
future. This makes CeBIT 2018 the final event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.messe.de/en/applikation/presse/deutsche-messe-restructures-event-portfolio.xhtml|title=Deutsche Messe restructures event portfolio - Trade fair news|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other CeBIT-branded shows{{anchor|CeBIT Home}}==
As CeBIT continued to grow quickly and was becoming too big on its own, it was decided to concentrate on the professional market, while the home and entertainment market was given a separate show, '''CeBIT Home''', during summer, planned to be biennial. However, after being held twice (in 1996 and 1998), the 2000 CeBIT Home (had originally been scheduled to be held in [[Leipzig]] due to the [[Expo 2000]] being held in Hanover) was cancelled and the project was abandoned.

Since 1999 the CeBIT sponsor [[Deutsche Messe AG]] ("German Trade Show, Inc.") has organized trade shows outside of Germany bearing the CeBIT name:
*CeBIT Asia, in [[Shanghai]], China

==CeBIT Global Conferences==
Running over a five-day period in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], the CeBIT Global Conferences (CGC) are staged congruently with the CeBIT exhibition. The conferences are dedicated to providing a 360° overview of the digital industry’s four core markets: IT, Telecommunications, Digital Media and Consumer Electronics. Noted industry figures and researchers from across the globe are invited to speak on the latest relevant trends and innovations as well as their impact on society and the working world. The conference is divided up into [[keynote]] speeches, talks and panel discussions. The CGC conferences are produced by Deutsche Messe AG, with the German BITKOM association acting as the CGC patron since 2009. In 2014, the CGC were staged with 140 speakers on three stages with a program of 70 conference hours and 3000 participants. Target groups of the conference are [[Chief Experience Officer|CXOs]], [[Management|managers]], experts, visionaries and out-of-the-box thinkers, Conference languages are English and German.

Recent conferences have featured the following keynote themes:
*2008: "Improving Life in the Global Village". This installment of CGC attracted 1900 visitors and 43 speakers attending the keynotes and discussion sessions.
*2009: "How Will We Be Working, Living and Communicating in the Coming Years?" This CGC drew 3,133 visitors from 88 nations, with some 2,200 guests following the conference via live streaming.
*2010: "The Challenges of a Changing World - ICT for Better Lives and Better Business", attracting some 4,000 guests from more than 100 nations. Just under 4,000 guests also visited the conference via live streaming.

The motto of the CeBIT Global Conferences for 2011 was "'''The Power of Creativity and Innovation'''".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27094">The '''[[May Revolution]]''' ({{lang-es|Revolución de Mayo}}) was a series of [[revolution]]ary political and social events that took place during the early nineteenth century in the city of [[Buenos Aires]], capital of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], a colony of the [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish Crown]] which at the time contained the present-day nations of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]]. The consequence of the revolution was that the head of the Viceroyalty, [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros|Viceroy Cisneros]], was ousted from office, and role of government was assumed by the [[Primera Junta]]. There are many reasons, both local and international, that promoted such developments.

==International causes==

===United States Declaration of Independence===
{{main|American Revolution}}
{{further|American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of the United States]] inspired similar movements in the Spanish colonies in South America.]]
The [[United States]] had [[United States Declaration of Independence|emancipated]] themselves from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1776, which provided a tangible example that led [[Criollo people|Criollos]] to believe that revolution and independence from Spain could be realistic aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The changes were not only political, but also intellectual and social, combining both a strong government with personal liberties. The text of the Declaration of Independence stated that [[all men are created equal]] (and thus become [[equal before the law]]), and had [[unalienable rights]] to [[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/declaration.html The Declaration of Independence of the Thirteen Colonies]&lt;/ref&gt; They had also chosen a [[republic]]an form of government, instead of keeping a [[Monarchy|monarchic]] one. Even more, the fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the argument that ending allegiance to the mother country could be considered a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===French Revolution===
[[File:H P Perrault Prise de la Bastille (painted 1928).jpg|thumb|The [[French Revolution]] promoted new ideals that influenced local criollos.]]
{{main|French Revolution}}
The ideals of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 were spreading as well. During the Revolution, centuries of monarchy were ended with the [[Trial of Louis XVI|overthrow]] and [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution]] of the King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], and the removal of the privileges of the [[nobility]]. The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] was highly popular among the young Criollos. The French Revolution also boosted [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals in political and economic fields. Some of the most notable [[Political Liberalism|political liberal]] authors, who opposed monarchies and absolutism, were [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]], while the most notorious [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] was [[Adam Smith]]. Liberal ideas also reached the church, and the concept of the [[divine right of kings]] started to be questioned. [[Francisco Suárez]] claimed that political power did not pass directly from [[God]] to the governor, but to the population and through it to the governor. According to Suarez, such power belongs to the people and is delegated to the governor, but if such governors did not serve the public good as they should, they would become tyrants and the people would have the right to fight them and choose new governors.&lt;ref name="Factores"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The falling consensus about the divine right being legitimate gave room to monarchies being replaced by [[republic]]s in France and the United States, but also to [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], such as in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, the spread of such idea was mainly forbidden in the Spanish territories, as well as the traffic in related books or their unauthorized possession. Such blockades started when Spain [[Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars|declared war]] on France after the execution of Louis XVI, but remained after the [[Campaigns of 1796 in the French Revolutionary Wars|peace treaty of 1796]]. Nevertheless, the events of 1789 and the statements of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite the efforts to keep them at bay. Even more, the [[National Convention]] declared that France would give shelter and aid to all populations aiming to become free, and made many plans to disrupt the power of Spain over their overseas colonies. Many [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] Criollos came into contact with those authors and their works during university studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{main|Industrial Revolution}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Britain, with [[manual labour]] and [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s being replaced by machine-based manufacturing and transportation aided by [[railway]]s and [[steam power]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the need of new markets to sell the surplus of coal, steel and clothes. The [[Napoleonic Wars]], where Britain was at war with France, made this a difficult task, after Napoleon countered the British naval blockade with the [[Continental System]], not allowing Britain to trade with any other European country. Thus, England needed to be able to trade with the Spanish colonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this end they tried to conquer key cities during the British invasions, and after it to promote their emancipation.&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt; The Industrial Revolution also gave room to authors who proposed a liberal economy, like Adam Smith. [[François Quesnay]] compared the worldwide economy with a living organism, stating that economics worked beyond political power and should not be affected by it.

===Peninsular War===
 [[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|thumb|The Third of May 1808]][[File:JozefBonaparte.jpg|thumb|Joseph Bonaparte]]
{{main|Peninsular War}}
The [[Napoleonic wars]] were taking place in Europe, involving France, Great Britain and most European countries. [[Portugal]] broke the blockade imposed on British trade and, as a result, was invaded by France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Family and the bulk of the kingdom's administration [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|fled to colonial Brazil]], in a move to preserve Portuguese sovereignty. Under the pretext of reinforcing the Franco-Spanish army occupying Portugal, French Imperial troops began filing into Spain. Shortly before the Spanish King [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] abdicated due to the [[mutiny of Aranjuez]] and gave the throne to his son, [[Ferdinand VII]].&lt;ref name="Bayonne"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that he was forced to abdicate, Charles IV requested that Napoleon restore him to power. Napoleon helped remove Ferdinand VII from power, but did not return the crown to the former king: instead, he crowned his own brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new Spanish King.&lt;ref name="Bayonne"/&gt; This whole process is known as the [[Abdications of Bayonne]]. Joseph's designation found severe resistance in Spain, and the [[Junta of Seville]] took power in the absence of the King. Until then, Spain had been  an ally of France against Britain, but at this point the Spanish resistance changed sides and allied with Britain against France. The Junta of Seville was eventually defeated as well, being replaced by another one located in Cádiz.

==National causes==

===Spanish monopsony===
During colonial times Spain was [[Monopsony|the only buyer]] of goods from the viceroyalty, and by law [[Legal monopoly|it was forbidden]] to trade with other nations. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to buy and sell the quantities of goods that the Americas required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buenos Aires was even more damaged, as Spain did not send enough ships to the city. To prevent the risk of [[piracy]] the trade ships had to be followed by war ships, which made the journey very expensive. Lacking any [[gold]] or [[silver]] resources, or established indigenous populations to employ systems of [[encomienda]], it was more profitable for Spain to send them all to [[Mexico]] or [[Lima]]. This led Buenos Aires to develop a system of [[smuggling]] to obtain, by illegal means, the products that could not be received otherwise. This smuggling was allowed by most local authorities, and developed similar amounts of traffic as the legal commerce with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This whole situation developed two antagonistic groups: the ones who made leather products and wanted free commerce to be able to sell them, and the ones who benefited from the prices of the smuggled products, which would have to sell them at lower prices if such commerce was allowed.

===Social rivalries===
{{main|Criollo people|Peninsulares}}
In the political structure most authoritative positions were filled by people designated by the Spanish monarchy, most of them Spanish people from Europe, without strong compromises with American problems or interests. This created a growing rivalry between the [[Criollo people|Criollos]], people born in America, and the [[Peninsulares]], people arrived from Europe (the term "Criollo" is usually translated to English as "Creole", despite being unrelated to most other [[Creole peoples]]). Despite the fact that all of them were considered Spanish, and that there was no legal distinction between Criollos and Peninsulares, most Criollos thought that Peninsulares had undue weight in political conflicts and expected a higher intervention in them, sentiment shared by the lower clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, this process was much slower than the one experimented by the British colonies in North America, in part because the educative system was managed almost exclusively by the clergy, influencing the development of a population as conservative as in the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Unlike the European countries and, to some degree, the United States, the Spanish colonies lacked a sense of peoplehood, a needed factor for the development of a nation. The Spanish colonies were carefully designed as extensions of Spain itself, being completely dependent in economic, cultural and political terms to the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

===British Invasions of the Río de la Plata===
[[File:La Reconquista de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers. Work by Charles Fouqueray.]]
{{main|British invasions of the Río de la Plata}}
Buenos Aires and Montevideo had successfully resisted two [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British invasions]]. The first one was in 1806, when a British army led by [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]] took control of Buenos Aires, until it was defeated by an army from Montevideo, led by [[Santiago de Liniers]]. The following year a bigger army took Montevideo, but failed to take Buenos Aires, being forced to surrender and leave both cities. There was no Spanish aid from Europe either time, and to prepare for the second invasion Liniers formed militias with Criollos, despite regulations prohibiting such militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Carlotism===
[[File:Carlota Joaquina.jpg|thumb|[[Carlota Joaquina of Spain]] desired to rule the Spanish colonies.]]
{{main|Carlotism}}
By the ending of 1808 the whole Royal Family of Portugal left Europe, with the country being attacked by Napoleon, and settled in Brazil. The regent prince arrived with his wife, [[Charlotte of Spain|Charlotte Joaquina]], daughter of Charles IV and sister of Ferdinand VII. When the news of the imprisonment of Ferdinand VII arrived in South America, Charlotte tried to take control of the viceroyalties as regent, a project known as [[Carlotism]]. She could do so due to the derogation of the [[salic law]] by Charles IV in 1789, and she intended to prevent a French invasion in the Americas. Some Criollos like Castelli, Beruti, Vieytes and Belgrano supported the project, considering it a chance to get a local government instead of one in Europe, or a medium for a later declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Challenging Impossibility''''' is a 2011 [[documentary film]] which chronicles the weightlifting odyssey of the spiritual teacher [[Sri Chinmoy]], who in 1985 at the age of 54 took up [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and performing feats of strength using the power of [[meditation]]. His lifts were featured on newscasts worldwide, inspiring people to transcend their personal limitations and to abandon their concepts of the restrictions of physical age. Directed by Natabara Rollosson and [[Sanjay Rawal]]. The film was an Official Selection of the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and premiered April 22, 2011.

==Synopsis==
The subject of ''Challenging Impossibility'' is the weightlifting odyssey of [[Sri Chinmoy]], a spiritual teacher who came from [[India]] to live in [[New York City]] and began lifting weights at the age of 54. The film features news footage and interviews with [[bodybuilders]], [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]], [[olympic Games|olympians]], and [[biomechanics]] experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Tribeca-Interview-Challenging-Impossibility-Directors-Sanjay-Rawal-and-Natabara-Rollosson-24355.html |title=Tribeca Interview: Challenging Impossibility Directors Sanjay Rawal and Natabara Rollosson  |work=Cinema Blend |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows a historical narrative that builds upon a public display of strength that [[Sri Chinmoy]] performed in 2004 at [[York College, City University of New York|York College.]]

Starting out with basic dumbbells (40&amp;nbsp;lbs) in 1985, [[Sri Chinmoy]] quickly progressed to lift cars, planes and elephants in an effort to show how meditation can develop inner peace that can translate to tangible outer power and strength. Along [[Sri Chinmoy|Chinmoy]]’s journey of “self-transcendence” he honored and inspired individuals who have uplifted humanity by literally lifting them on a platform above head in an award program titled "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart". From its creating in 1987, [[Sri Chinmoy]] lifted over 7000 people, including [[Nelson Mandela]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Z9H9ga3agTU|Video of Mandela and Chinmoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desmond Tutu]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srichinmoy.tv/326/sri-chinmoy-meets-archbishop-desmond-tutu/] Video of Desmond Tutu and Sri Chinmoy] published Sri Chinmoy TV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], and [[Richard Gere]].&lt;ref name="New York Tims"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/01/nyregion/they-re-not-heavy-they-re-his-people-72-year-old-sri-chinmoy-offers-uplift.html|title=They're Not Heavy; They're His People; 72-Year-Old Sri Chinmoy Offers An Uplift Beyond the Spiritual|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|date=2004-07-01|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sri Chinmoy|Chinmoy]]’s training culminated when he held a public demonstration of his feats of strength at age 73 in the presence of strength experts such as 5-time [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] [[Bill Pearl]], 3-time [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Frank Zane]], 2002 World’s Strongest Man [[Hugo Girard]] and 9-time Olympic Gold-Medalist [[Carl Lewis]]. In the film, Lewis described how when [[Sri Chinmoy]] lifted weights, “It’s like gravity stops”.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/62084/Olympic-Gold-Medalist-Carl-Lewis-talks-%27Challenging-Impossibility%27-and-Olivia-Wilde-talks-Haiti/ |title=Olympic Gold Medalist Carl Lewis talks 'Challenging Impossibility' and Olivia Wilde talks Haiti  |work=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Chinmoy|Chinmoy]]’s lifts were featured on newscasts worldwide on outlets such as [[CNN]], [[CNN International]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and numerous local affiliates. [[Sri Chinmoy|Chinmoy]] performed his own strenuous feats to spread his message of world harmony and inner peace,&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/a-monument-to-strength-as-a-path-to-enlightenment |title=A Monument to Strength as a Path to Enlightenment  |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |first=Corey |last=Kilgannon |date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inspire people to transcend their personal limitations and to abandon their concepts of the restrictions of physical age. Appearances in the film also include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Mother Teresa]], and [[Princess Diana]].

==Premiere==
The film premiered at the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York on April 22, 2011 in a new bracket of inspiring short documentaries in which "positive thinking prevails".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/shorts_one_for_all-film36796.html |title=Tribeca Film Guide |work=[[Tribeca Film Festival]] |accessdate=April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324153312/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/shorts_one_for_all-film36796.html |archivedate=2011-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the premier, Carl Lewis described how [[Sri Chinmoy]] encouraged him to transcend his own personal limitations. "[[Sri Chinmoy]] inspired me and he's followed my career, actually he's one of the few people that had been to all four of my Olympic Games...when you were in his presence it was always positive, you never heard anything negative, he was always inspiring you to be better than yourself and think about other people."&lt;ref name="source"/&gt; Also in attendance for the premier were [[Frank Zane]], [[Hugo Girard]], Nadine Tremblay, and Wayne DeMilia, who all appear in the film.

==Exhibit==
A pop-up exhibition of [[Sri Chinmoy|Chinmoy]]’s weightlifting equipment that appeared in the film. The exhibit coincided with the premier of the film in Tribeca from April 15 to May 2, 2011.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

On display were numerous custom-made machines, such as a standing calf raise machine which [[Sri Chinmoy]] used to set a record of lifting 2,400 pounds, "the equivalent of lifting an elevator packed full of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/health/137929/spiritual-guru-s-strength-on-display-in-tribeca/ |title=Spiritual Guru's Strength On Display in Tribeca  |work=[[NY1]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the machines was also the apparatus [[Sri Chinmoy]] used to lift people in his "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart" program, which he used to honor individuals of inspiration by lifting them overhead on a platform.

'''Charles Burnett “C.B.” Wilson''' (4 July 1850 – 12 September 1926) was a British and Tahitian superintendent of the water works, fire chief under [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]], and Marshal of the Kingdom under [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185741/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0169/b46db112.dir/Wilson%2C%20Charles%20B.jpg |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0169/b46db112.dir/Wilson,%20Charles%20B.jpg |title=Wilson, Charles B. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and father of [[John H. Wilson (Hawaii)|John H. Wilson]].

==Early years==
C. B. Wilson was [[Birth aboard aircraft and ships|born at sea]], on a voyage between [[Tahiti]] and [[Fanning Island]] on July 4, 1850. His father Charles Burnett Wilson (1801–1853) was [[Scottish people|Scottish]] by ethnicity and British subject but grew up in [[Papeete]], Tahiti and became sea trader and captain of his own ship. He was moving his family Fanning Island to establish a [[coconut]] plantation for producing [[coconut oil]]. His mother was Tetaria, a Tahitian chiefess. Wilson's father continued searching for unmapped island in the Pacific. He was lost at sea en route from Australian to New Zealand in 1853. Tetaria, strained from the stresses of rearing two sons on a plantation island, handed over Wilson and his younger brother Richard to Captain Harry English who ran the plantation, while she returned to Tahiti. English left Wilson and his brother to a Captain Smith and his wife in [[Hawaii]] who ran a school which Wilson was enrolled in. Wilson was put on a career path of becoming a [[blacksmith]]. He married a [[hula]] dancer and friend of Lili{{okina}}uokalani, Eveline Townsend. Their son [[John H. Wilson (Hawaii)|Johnny]] became a co-founder of [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]] and [[Mayor of Honolulu]] in the Twentieth century.

==Military service==
[[File:Charles B. Wilson, photograph by Menzies Dickson (retouched).jpg|thumb|Charles B. Wilson, photograph by [[Menzies Dickson]]]]
In 1866 Wilson joined the [[Honolulu Rifles]], a militia unit. He was a Sergeant during the [[ʻIolani Barracks#1873 Barracks Revolt|1873 Barracks Revolt]] and was present in the standoff. He later joined the Royal Guard where he became one of a [[squad]] of personal [[bodyguard]]s to King [[Kalākaua]]. During the [[Honolulu Courthouse Riot]], an election [[riot]] by supporters of [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], who attacked the [[Hawaii State Legislature|Legislature]], Wilson rescued four representatives, three in a carriage by preventing rioters from overturning it, and catching one representative that was thrown out a courthouse window. On January 31, 1876 Wilson made First Lieutenant and Captain on March 16, 1877.

==Water Works==
Wilson was appointed Superintendent of the Water Works July 1, 1882 and [[fire chief]] on July 1, 1886. In 1886 Wilson was accused of [[embezzling]] money from customer payments. An investigation by the Legislature found that a sum of approximately $16,000 were missing from the Water Works, and Wilson was blamed, although there is a possibility his predecessor was actually responsible. He paid back $10,000, Lili{{okina}}uokalani paid $5,000, and half of Wilson’s salary was [[Garnishment|garnished]] until the missing money was made up. Wilson became involved in a plot to overthrow Kalākaua and replace him with his sister Lili{{okina}}uokalani in what became known as the [[Dominis Conspiracy (Hawaii)|Dominis Conspiracy]]. The plot was discovered, the conspirators surrendered, but Wilson was not charged, possibly because he was suspected of merely having been playing both sides.

==Marshal==
After the death of [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]], [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] inherited the throne January 29, 1891. Wilson was appointed Marshal of the Kingdom March 9 that year. Wilson had a strong [[Secularism|secular]] view of running the police forces and loosely regulated [[Biblical law|Christian based laws]] on [[Prohibition|alcohol]], [[Gambling#Legal aspects|gambling]], and opium. He described these laws as “offenses created by statute, upon the commission of which the [[Public morality|moral sense of the community]] apparently casts but little stigma.” &lt;ref&gt;The betrayal of Liliuokalani, last Queen of Hawaii, 1838-1917 By Helena G. Allen&lt;/ref&gt; On these matters warnings were issued for excessively inappropriate conduct, if not improved would lead to arrests. He supported legalizing [[opium]] to legitimize and better regulate the drug. Wilson's appointment to Marshal is still seen as a contradiction since the queen was a devout Christian.

Due to Wilson’s lenient interpretation of the law he made enemies with [[Social conservatism|Social]] and [[Christian right|Christian Conservatives]]. On the other side of the political spectrum the Liberals began to criticize Lili{{okina}}uokalani for not replacing the hated [[Bayonet Constitution]] and Wilson exposed a plot by members of the [[National Liberal Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Liberal Party]], calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League, to overthrow the queen and replace the constitution themselves which became known as the [[Wilcox rebellions#Burlesque Conspiracy|Burlesque Conspiracy]]. Before the [[Hawaii legislatorial election, 1892|elections of 1892]] Wilson himself confronted the Queen to create a new constitution, one speculation is that he threatened to lead a [[mutiny]] of the armed forces in [[protest]] of the 1887 Constitution.

==Overthrow==
After populous pressure Lili{{okina}}uokalani began to draft a [[1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|new constitution]]. On January 16, 1893 Wilson was tipped off by detectives to another [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|coup to overthrow the Hawaiian monarchy]] this time by the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]], the 13 leaders of the Hawaiian League a group within the [[Hawaii Republican Party|Reform Party]] who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on King [[David Kalākaua]], and were willing to overthrow the monarchy to maintain it. Wilson requested [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to arrest the 13 member council, of the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]], and put the Kingdom under [[martial law]]. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General [[Arthur P. Peterson]] and the Queen’s cabinet, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with [[Lorrin A. Thurston|Thurston]], Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the [[ʻIolani Barracks|Royal Household Guard]], [[Samuel Nowlein]], had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Lili{{okina}}uokalani, but she surrendered Concerning the wellbeing of her men who were woefully out numbered. Wilson was the last commander of the last [[garrison]] to surrender at [[Honolulu Police Department|HPD]] headquarters. In his battle plan he would have made use of the several artillery pieces and two [[Gatling gun|Gatling machine guns]] of the royal guard, to compensate for their shortage in numbers.

==Government in Exile==
Wilson went to Washington D.C. to lobby for the return of the monarchy even when the exiled Kingdom was dissolved in 1895 by Lili{{okina}}uokalani.  He is regarded as the last of the former government to give up on restoration the Kingdom.  Wilson joined the Hawaii Republican Party (formerly the Reform Party) believing it to be the only way to be an effective politician, but was kept a low ranking member. Despite his party affiliation he accused Republicans of denying his son, John, a civil engineer, [[government contract]]s because he was a Democrat, after these criticisms his son was given fair consideration and was able to win contracts. Wilson died in Honolulu September 12, 1926.

'''Amelia Matilda Mary Tudor Radclyffe''',&lt;ref&gt;Northern Lights, by Ralph Arnold Published 1959 Constable&lt;/ref&gt; soi-disant Countess of Derwentwater, was a 19th-century claimant to the estates of the [[Earl of Derwentwater|Earls of Derwentwater]].  She claimed to be the granddaughter of John Radclyffe, only son of the third Earl, and in 1860 commenced to agitate for her rights, initially contacting [[William Petre, 12th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] as the representative of descendants of the family using the name of Lady Matilda Radclyffe.

In September 1868, Amelia took active steps to assert her claim by forcibly taking possession of the old ruined castle at [[Dilston Castle|Dilston]].

She hoisted the Radclyffe flag on the ancient tower, and suspended portraits of the family on the ruined walls of the principal hall. Conformable to instructions from the Lords of the Admiralty, she was ejected by their agent, when she took up residence in a tent on the side of the road. After other proceedings she was imprisoned for contempt of court, her claim having formally been investigated and found to be invalid. Nevertheless, by her eccentric conduct in the prosecution of her claim, she continued to keep constantly before the public until her death, at her residence in Durham Road, Durham, 26 Feb. 1880, aged 49.&lt;ref&gt;The Strange Story of the Countess of Derwentwater, by Maurice Milner.  Published 1970 Graham&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an accomplished woman, a lover of fine art, and an artist in oil, and she was powerfully and sincerely impressed with the righteousness of her claim. Her death was caused by bronchitis, after five days' illness.  She had expressed a wish to be buried in the Radclyffe vault at Hexham, but her desire could not be complied with, and she was consequently buried at Blackhill Cemetery, Consett near Durham.
Her assertions, published in her jottings were that John Radclyffe, the son of the last Earl of Derwentwater, and de jure 4th Earl of Derwentwater did not die in 1732, but was trafficked to Germany, and in 1740 married at Frankfort-on-Maine, Elizabeth Arabella Maria, Countess of Waldstein. He died there in 1798, in his eighty-sixth year.

His son James, at that time in his fifty-fifth year, was his heir, and was married to Eleanora the Countess Mouravieff, but leaving no issue, was succeeded by his brother, John James, who was born at Alston, in Cumberland, in 1764. The latter died in 1833, having married, late in life, Amelia Anna Charlotte, Princess Sobieski, a descendant of the noted Polish family of that name. They had issue several children, of whom John James, born in 1816, and Amelia Matilda Radclyffe, the soi-disant Countess of Derwentwater, were the only survivors.

Amelia’s true identity remains a mystery.  Ralph Arnold in his 1959 book ''Northern Lights'' suggests that she may have been a lady’s maid from Dover by the name of Burke though he offers no further explanation of this. The Northumbrian Jacobites website suggest that she may have been a West Country servant girl trying her luck.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northumbrianjacobites.org.uk/pages/detail_page.php?id=39&amp;section=29&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that she was descended illegitimately from the Radclyffes of [[Dilston Castle]] and that this connection had fuelled her belief in her own claims.

She was reported on widely in contemporary news articles, the following appearing in the Hobart Mercury in October 1871:

'''THE COUNTESS OF DERWENTWATER ON HER TRAVELS'''

The Countess of Derwentwater is a character. Recently she took a steamer at Jersey City for Liverpool, and the goods she carried with her wore thus inventoried :-One guitar, with two strings ; two old cane-seated chairs, one with two legs ; three empty four-gallon demijohns, uncorked  two peacocks and a black-and-tan, in a box ; two broken children's cribs of mahogany, one without rockers ; one cross-breed hound of English birth ; one champagne bucket, covered with dust ; one broken painter's easel ; three rickety deckchairs, with varnish scraped off; one bag of tin ware; one six by three pedestal, without statuette, cracked ; four plain square Irish chests, two painted rod and two black, locks broken and hanging, each marked in white letters, " Countess D. ;" two mammoth chests, cross-tied with half-inch clothes-line, with same mark ; those contained the Countess' numerous hats ; fifteen very ancient-looking trunks, tied across the sides and double-knotted at the back ; one tray for mixing dough ; two tin berth room trunks ; one bundle loose clothing ; two portable hat racks, rather worn ; six cases of mysteriously packed bottles, supposed to be ale ; Huge crates of sauces, mixed pickles, and catsups, put up in every conceivable shape ; one copper-coloured work-box done up in oil ; seven heavy treble-twilled English travelling shawls tied with twine; thirteen gray woolen blankets made in form of" shake down;" seventeen packages of files of newspapers. The Countess wore on this occasion a green silk dress, a white crape shawl, a pair of white silk gloves, etc. When the labourers took hold of the box containing the lady's favourite peacocks and the black-and-tan, the curious crowd pressed down on the countess until her lace-trimmed bonnet took a peep skyward, and her costly shawl swept the rough boards of the pier. "Handle 'em gently; they’re my only loves !" she sharply cried, as she broke through the jeering crowd, and reached the foot of the gang plank. "This remarkable woman," says the Suit, “has a fine estate in the north of England, in the county of Cumberland, called Derwentwater. She has always been noted for her eccentric manner and antiquated notions. Her wardrobe is said to consist of over two hundred rich and elaborately trimmed dresses, girted with gold lace, fringes, and parti-colored velvets. She wears no diamonds, and but one plain finger ring adorns her hands. She claims to have among her apparel robes worn by some of the belles of the time of William the Conqueror, and when she travels, those are part of her personal luggage, carefully packed in the fifteen trunks mentioned, which are as antiquated as the dresses. Her appearance indicates an age not beyond forty, though possibly older. She will visit Scotland and Wales before returning to her home."&lt;ref&gt;The Mercury, Hobart Tasmania Friday 6 October 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death'''

When the 'Countess' died on 27 February 1880, the 'Newcastle Courant' printed the following
obituary:-

'Information has just reached this place [Consett] of the death, at half-past two o'clock this morning, of the 'Countess of Derwentwater,' the lady who laid claim to the vast estates which formerly belonged to the Derwentwater family, and whose eccentric conduct in the prosecution of her claim has kept her constantly before the public. It is now 20 years since this lady first notified to the world at large her claim, and her career since then has been full of interesting incidents. History records the death of John Radcliffe, the fourth Earl of Derwentwater, at the early age of nineteen, his death taking place at London in 1731. The Countess, however, asserted that the fourth Earl, instead of dying a minor in London, was smuggled over to Germany where he married in 1741, and left a large family, that to him succeeded a fifth, sixth,and seventh earl, and of this seventh earl she was a daughter, and only surviving heiress of the male descendants in a direct line. Twenty years ago, the soi-disant Countess left the foreign home of her ancestors to assume the grandeur they had so carefully shirked. On her arrival in this country, like the [[Tichborne claimant]], she communicated her identity to those associates whom she also deemed worthy of her confidence, but, feeling perhaps, her case required some strengthening, and that sundry links in her chain of evidence were either wanting or decidedly rusty, she resolved to restrict immediate operations to the sending of a vague warning to the tenants on the various estates. In 1869, her Ladyship having made such preparations as seemed to her adequate for the purpose, once more emerged from obscurity, and having the sympathy of the masses, and being reinforced by an energetic aide-de-camp in the person of Harry Brown, then a bailiff of the Shotley Bridge Court, the campaign was opened with considerable pluck and activity. The local agents of the Admiralty were at Haydon Bridge on the occasion of one of the regular rent days appointed, and a large portion of the tenants were duly in attendance. Whilst the receiver was proceeding with the business in hand, a strange diversion was created by the entrance of the "Countess," accompanied by her henchman, and accoutred after a somewhat novel fashion of warlike equipment. Having duly announced her name, she warned the tenants present that the gentleman then receiving their rents was not authorised by her to do so, and called upon them to pay their respective amounts to herself.  The tenants, of course, preferred to make their payments to the receiver, and, as the lady unceremoniously interrupted the proceedings, it was deemed advisable to induce her, if possible by argument, or, failing that, by severe measures, to quit the room. The quieter method having proved unavailing, and a threatened resort to qualified force having roused a slumbering lion,a somewhat lively scene ensued. Eventually the room was cleared, but not until a blow had been struck, for being armed with an antiquated sword, her ladyship drew the weapon, and a short struggle ensued, resulting in the snapping of the blade of the weapon. The immediate object of this first movement had failed, but great advantage was derived from the prominent place the extraordinary proceedings gained for her in the public interest.'&lt;ref&gt;27 February 1880, the 'Newcastle Courant' &lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is unlikely that there was truth in Amelia’s claims it is certain that she was in no way entitled to call herself Countess of Derwentwater as the title was only able to be passed through a male line. Given that the title had been attainted after the 1715 uprising the use of any title was inappropriate regardless of the truth of Amelia's claims.

A plaque was attached to the previously unmarked grave of Amelia in 2012 in Blackhill Cemetery, near [[Consett]], [[County Durham]].  Members of the Northumbrian [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Society added  a plaque to a small stone cross, which had been previously erected by society members George and Lorraine Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Echo, Friday 31 August 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Cry Me a River'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his debut studio album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002). It was written by Timberlake and [[Scott Storch]] with producer [[Timbaland]] and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer [[Britney Spears]]. [[Jive Records]] released the song to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic radio]] in the United States on November 25, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an [[electric piano]], [[Beatboxing|beatbox]], guitars, [[synthesizer]]s, [[Arabic music|Arabian]]-inspired [[riffs]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, "Cry Me a River" is an [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him with another man.

"Cry Me a River" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who considered it a stand-out track on ''Justified'' and praised Timbaland's production. The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it on their [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] at 484. It won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards|2004 ceremony]]. The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified double platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

Filmmaker [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the music video for "Cry Me a River" in [[Malibu, California]]. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a [[publicity stunt]], but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for [[Best Male Video]] and [[Best Pop Video]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" on his four major concert tours: [[The Justified World Tour]] (2003–04), [[Justified and Stripped Tour]] (2003), [[FutureSex/LoveShow]] (2007), and [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]] (2013–15). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Leona Lewis]] and [[Taylor Swift]].

==Writing and production==

They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you."&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written "Cry Me a River" after an argument with Spears: "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry."&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt; Timbaland recalled, "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/22/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-cry-me-a-river_n_1164520.html|title=Justin Timberlake Reveals Britney Spears Inspiration Behind 'Cry Me A River'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music video for "Cry Me a River" was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], and filmed in [[Malibu, California]], during the week of October 29, 2002.&lt;ref name=mtv1/&gt; Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, "[Justin and I] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it".&lt;ref name=mtv3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476973/river-about-britney-justin-but-not.jhtml|title='Cry Me A River' About Britney And Justin, But Not: VMA Lens Recap|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=August 18, 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031144756/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476973/river-about-britney-justin-but-not.jhtml|archivedate=October 31, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats.&lt;ref name=mtv3/&gt; Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a [[voyeur]] and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with [['N Sync]] and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does."&lt;ref name=mtv3/&gt; The music video for "Cry Me a River" was released onto the [[iTunes Store]] on April 28, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/music-video/cry-me-a-river-edited-version/id207699128|title=Cry Me a River (Edited version)|work=iTunes Store (US)|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video begins with a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears&lt;ref name=por/&gt;), walking out of her house hand-in-hand with an unidentified man.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459124/justin-britney-at-war.jhtml|title=Justin And Britney At War, Magazine Cover Story Declares|work=MTV News|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=December 12, 2002|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], from which he and his friend have been watching the woman.&lt;ref name=mtv3/&gt; Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room.&lt;ref name=por&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksfm.radio.com/2011/08/22/remember-that-track-of-the-day-justin-timberlake-2/|title='Remember That?'

She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.

===Reception===
Peter Robinson of ''[[NME]]'' wrote that the video shows "what Justin looks like after he's had sex.

Following the release of the music video, ''[[Us Weekly]]'' ran a cover story titled ''Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On''. Timberlake denied that Spears inspired the video, saying, "The video is not about her. The video is about me."&lt;ref name="war"/&gt; However, Spears told ''Rolling Stone'' in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her would be in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal".&lt;ref name="britney rolling stone"/&gt; Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, "Well, I got a controversial video."&lt;ref name="britney rolling stone"/&gt; She stated that it was a great [[publicity stunt]], commenting, "So he got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally."&lt;ref name="britney rolling stone"&gt;{{cite news|work=Rolling Stone|title=Britney Spears: 'Sometimes It's Hard To Be A Woman'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-finds-it-hard-to-be-a-woman-rolling-stones-2003-cover-story-20110329|date=October 2, 2003|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of Spears' video for "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" (2003), Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News said her video "[made] "Cry Me a River" look like child's play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1483976/britney-oneups-justin-toxic-clip.jhtml|title=Britney's 'Toxic' Clip Makes 'Cry Me A River' Look Like Child's Play|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=December 30, 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor Jason Lipshutz opined the clip was "one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century. The visual is JT's most controversial music video to date." He added, "The "Cry Me a River" video served a dual purpose for Timberlake: to court controversy, and to make its star seem more grown-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5719195/why-wrecking-ball-is-miley-cyrus-cry-me-a-river-opinion | title=Why 'Wrecking Ball' Is Miley Cyrus' 'Cry Me A River' (Opinion) | work=Billboard | date=September 19, 2013 | accessdate=April 22, 2016 | author=Lipshutz, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''Billboard'' critics named it the 24th "greatest music video of the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8466543/100-greatest-music-videos-of-the-21st-century |title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century: Critics' Picks |date=July 24, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2010, while performing at the annual charity gig "Justin Timberlake and Friends" in Las Vegas, Timberlake began the show with a slow and "sultry" performance of "Cry Me a River" and segued into a cover of [[Bill Withers]]' 1971 single "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]".&lt;ref name="billboard5"/&gt; He later resumed "Cry Me a River" before segueing into a cover of [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s 2010 song "[[Over (Drake song)|Over]]".

The '''Dinamulag Festival''' also known as the '''Zambales Mango Festival''' is an annual festival held in the province of [[Zambales]] in the [[Philippines]] to celebrate or encourage bountiful harvest of the province's mangoes. The festival was first held in 1999.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mango Festival, Iba, Zambales|url=http://www.albertthebackpacker.com/mango-festival-iba-zambales|accessdate=20 March 2016|publisher=albertthebackpacker.com|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangoes cultivated in Zambales particularly the ''Dinamulag'' variety of [[Carabao mango]]es were cited as the world's sweetest mangoes by [[Guinness World Records]] in 1995 and the country's sweetest mangoes by the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.choosephilippines.com/do/festivals/1325/zambales-mango-festival |title=The Mango Festival of Zambales |first=Renzelle Ann |last=Palma |date= April 25, 2014 |work=Choose Philippines |publisher=ABS-CBN Corporation |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt;

[[File:Two lambs rubber ring tail docking, cropped.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Two lambs having their tails docked by the use of rubber rings for [[elastration]].  The tight rubber rings block blood flow to the lower portion of the tail, which will [[atrophy]] and fall off.]]
'''Docking''' is the intentional removal of part of an animal's [[tail]] or, sometimes, [[ear]]s. The term '''cropping''' is more commonly  used in reference to the [[cropping (animal)|cropping]] of ears, while ''docking'' more commonly—but not exclusively—refers to the tail. The term '''tailing''' is also commonly used.  The term arises because the living flesh of the tail, from which the animal's tail hairs grow, commonly is known as the [[Rump (croup)|dock]].

==Sheep==
[[File:Lamb - no docking.jpg|thumb|250px|A lamb in Australia which has not had its tail docked. Tail docking for sheep is, on the contrary, common there.]]
Many breeds of [[sheep]] have their tails docked to reduce the buildup of faeces which can encourage [[myiasis|fly strike]].&lt;ref name = "Model Code"&gt;{{cite book |url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/22/pid/5389.htm |title = The Sheep - Second Edition |work = Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals |publisher = [[CSIRO]] Publishing |author = Primary Industries Ministerial Council |year=2006 |ISBN =0-643-09357-5 |accessdate=2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French, N. P., R. Wall and K. L. Morgan.  1994.  Lamb tail docking:  a controlled field study of the effects of tail amputation on health and productivity.  Vet. Rec. 124: 463-467.&lt;/ref&gt;    Also used for this purpose is [[mulesing]].  Docking also makes it easier to view a grown ewe's udders to detect potential problems.

==Dogs==

{{main|Docking (dog)}}
As with other domesticated animals there is a long history of docking the tails of dogs. It is understood to date at least to the Roman Empire. The  most popular reason for docking dog breeds is to prevent injury to working dogs. In hunting dogs, the tail is docked to prevent it from getting cut up as the dog wags its tail in the brush. This is contested by a wide range of groups&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Backgrounders/Documents/dogs_tail_docking_bgnd.pdf Welfare Implications of Tail Docking-Dogs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225100655/https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Backgrounders/Documents/dogs_tail_docking_bgnd.pdf |date=February 25, 2014 }} American Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes considered a form of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/cruel-practices/ear-cropping-tail-docking Ear-Cropping and Tail-Docking] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the practice being outlawed and made illegal throughout many countries, in some of which dogs are no longer bred for work, or used as [[working animal]]s.

For example, in United Kingdom tail docking was originally undertaken largely by dog breeders. However, in 1991, the UK government amended the Veterinary Surgeons Act (1966),&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101217224449/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1966/pdf/ukpga_19660036_en.pdf Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966] Office of Public Sector Information&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting the docking of dogs' tails by lay persons from 1 July 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081026172913/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1991/uksi_19911412_en_1.htm Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1991] Office of Public Sector Information&lt;/ref&gt; Only veterinary surgeons were, by law, allowed to dock. However, following the passage of the law, the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in November 1992, ruled docking to be unethical, "unless for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons". The requirement in which the Royal College considers [[prophylactic]] docking to be acceptable are so strict as to make the routine docking of puppies by veterinary surgeons extremely difficult. Vets who continue to dock risk disciplinary action, and can be removed from the professional register. Those found guilty of unlawful docking would face a fine of up to £20,000, up to 51 weeks imprisonment or both. They can only dock the tail of "working" dogs (in some specific cases) - e.g. hunting dogs that work in areas thick in brambles and heavy vegetation where the dog's tail can get caught and cause injury to the dog. Docking was banned in [[England and Wales]] by the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]] and in Scotland by the [[Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006]].

In 1987 the [[European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals]], established by Council of Europe, prohibited docking for non-medical reasons, though signatory countries are free to opt out of this provision, and almost half of them have done so.  Norway completely banned the practice in 1987{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Other countries where docking is banned include Australia&lt;ref name="australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-tail-docking-of-dogs-legal_277.html |title=Is the tail docking of dogs legal? |accessdate=2011-02-15 |date=2010-08-03 |work=RSPCA Australia Knowledgebase |publisher=RSPCA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220230224/http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-tail-docking-of-dogs-legal_277.html |archivedate=2011-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="United Kingdom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bva.co.uk/atoz/Tail_docking_of_dogs.aspx | title=Tail docking of dogs | accessdate=2012-10-30 | work=British Veterinary Association | publisher=BVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horses==
{{further|Tail (horse)}}
[[File:Polo pony docked.jpg|thumb|right|Docked and banged tail on a polo pony, photographed between 1910 and 1915]]
Originally, most docking was done for practical purposes. For example, a [[draft horse]] used for hauling large loads might have had its tail docked to prevent it from becoming entangled in tow ropes, farm machinery, or harness; without docking, it could be dangerous to the horse, painful if the tail were tangled, and inconvenient to the owner to tie up the horse's tail for every use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horse Tail Modifications|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/Horse%20Tail%20Modification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern use, the term usually does not refer to tail [[amputation]] as it does with some [[dog]] breeds. However, historically, docking was performed on some horses, often as [[foal]]s. The practice has been banned in some nations, but is still seen on some show and working [[draft horses]] in some places, and is practiced at some [[Premarin|PMU]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afac.ab.ca/research/species/articles/hhorse.htm  "Tail Docking in Heavy Horses."  Livestock Welfare INSIGHTS Issue 4 - Jun 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124040142/http://www.afac.ab.ca/research/species/articles/hhorse.htm |date=2010-11-24 }} web page accessed September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the term "docked" or "docking"  in reference to the tail of a horse generally refers to the practice of cutting the hair of the tail skirt very short, just past the end of the natural [[rump (animal)|dock]] of the tail.  In particular, the tail is often cut short to keep it from being tangled in a [[horse harness|harness]].

==Cattle==

Tail docking of dairy cows is prevalent in some regions.  Some anecdotal reports have suggested that such docking may reduce SCC (somatic cell counts in milk) and occurrence of mastitis.  However, a study examining such issues found no significant effect of docking on SCC or mastitis frequency or on four measures of cow cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, C. B., D. Fraser and D. M. Weary.  2001.  Tail docking dairy cattle:  effects on cow cleanliness and udder health.  J. Dairy Sci. 84: 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it has been suggested that leptospirosis among dairy farm workers might be reduced by docking cows' tails, a study found that milkers' leptospiral titers were not related to tail docking.&lt;ref&gt;Stull, C. L., M. A. Payne, S. L. Berry and P. J. Hullinger.  2002.  Evaluation of the scientific justification for tail docking in dairy cattle.  J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc.  220: 1298-1303.&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Veterinary Medical Association opposes "routine tail docking of cattle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/tail_docking_cattle.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618214734/http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/tail_docking_cattle.asp |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Similarly, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association opposes docking tails of dairy cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://canadianveterinarians.net/ShowText.aspx?ResourceID=1948 | title=Tail Docking of Dairy Cattle | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414050234/http://canadianveterinarians.net/ShowText.aspx?ResourceID=1948 | archivedate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle on large [[Australian]] [[cattle station]]s often have the tail brush (not the dock) cut shorter (banged) before their release; this "bang-tail muster" indicates those having been counted, treated, their current pregnancy status determined, etc.

Tail docking in the dairy industry is prohibited in Denmark, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and some Australian
states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tail Docking of Cattle|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/tail_docking_cattle_bgnd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as California, Ohio, and Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welfare Issues with Tail Docking of Cows in the Dairy Industry|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/HSUS-Report-on-Tail-Docking-of-Dairy-Cows.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several large organizations within the dairy industry are against tail docking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TAIL DOCKING OF DAIRY CATTLE – POSITION STATEMENT|url=https://www.canadianveterinarians.net/documents/tail-docking-of-dairy-cattle|website=Canadian Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tail Docking of Cattle|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Tail-Docking-of-Cattle.aspx|website=AVMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of scientific evidence supporting claims benefiting the practice.
Scientific studies have demonstrated that there are numerous animal welfare issues with this practice (such as distress, pain, increased activity in pain receptors in the tail stump, abnormal growths of nerve fibers, sensitivity to heat and cold, and clostridial diseases). Fortunately, there is an effective and humane alternative to tail docking, which is switch trimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/HSUS-Report-on-Tail-Docking-of-Dairy-Cows.pdf | title=An HSUS Report: Welfare Issues with Tail Docking of Cows in the Dairy Industry | date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pigs==
In the case of [[domestic pig]]s, where commercially raised animals are kept in [[intensive pig farming|close quarters]], tail docking is performed to prevent injury or to prevent animals from chewing or [[Tail biting in pigs|biting]] each other's tails.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5998">The '''Eifel Literatur Festival''' ({{lang-de| Eifel Literatur Festival}}) is a volunteer-organized literature event held in the [[Eifel mountains]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] every two years as part of the state's "Cultural Summer".

The aim of the festival is to raise the Eifel onto the European literature stage. The festival originated from a private initiative by Germanic scholar, Dr. Josef Zierden. In 1994, he inaugurated the Eifel Literature Festival in the town of [[Prüm]], in the small cashier's room of a bank, as an accompanying programme for the presentation of his book "The Eifel in Literature". 

== History ==
Until 2001, the focus was on [[belletristic]] literature from or about the [[Eifel]]. Later the literary programme was expanded: the Eifel was to become a literary stage for authors outside the Eifel, for example, for [[Martin Walser]], [[Mario Adorf]] and [[Siegfried Lenz]] in 2001.

Having taken place for a week in the autumn, from 1994 to 1998, its duration was extended to readings from May to November.

In 2006, the 7th Eifel Literature Festival went beyond the boundaries of the county of [[Bitburg-Prüm]] and recorded over 10,000 visitors at about 20 readings in the neighbouring counties of Daun (today [[Landkreis_Vulkaneifel|Vulkaneifel]]), [[Bernkastel-Wittlich]], [[Landkreis_Ahrweiler|Ahrweiler]] and [[Mayen-Koblenz]] as well as [[Euskirchen (district)|Euskirchen]] and [[Mayen-Koblenz]] in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

== 2008 Festival ==
The eighth festival in 2008 covered all ten counties of the Eifel - all the way to North Rhine-Westphalia. Authors were also be invited as guests in the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]. The 2008 festival ran from 25 April to 14 November.

The weekly programme included 30 events at 18 venues with authors and recitators, from Martin Walser to [[Iris Berben]], from [[Senta Berger]] to Father [[Anselm Grün]], from [[Petra Gerster]] to [[Dirk Sager]], [[Urs Widmer]] and [[Ingo Schulze]] to [[Roger Willemsen]].

== 2010 Festival ==
With around 15,000 visitors at 28 events, the 9th Eifel Literature Festival in 2010 was the most successful in its history&lt;ref name="statistik2010"&gt;Data from Dr. Josef Zierden, organizer of the festival.&lt;/ref&gt; With about 1,100&lt;ref name="statistik2010" /&gt; visitors to the monastery church of Himmerod Abbey, Father Anselm Grün set the record for the number of visitors. For the first time a festival journal was published in spring and autumn 2010: with many interviews, photo documentaries and background information on past and upcoming events. The magazine ''buchjournal''&lt;ref name= "buchjournal" &gt;''buchjournal'', Issue 1/2010, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; ranked the festival among the twelve most important literary events of 2010.

== International Eifel Literature Prize ==
In 2008, the 1st International Eifel Literature Prize was awarded, with 15,000 euros for the first prize and 3,000 euros for the 'advancement award' (''Förderpreis''). The international character of the literature prize is intended to reflect the cross-border character of the festival. The jury (Martin Lüdke, head of SWR Literature, ''Literatur im Foyer'', chairman; Sigrid Löffler, ''Literaturen''; and Volker Hage, ''Der Spiegel''") chose British writer [[Alison Louise Kennedy]] (Glasgow), one of the most important contemporary voices in Great Britain, for the main prize. She awarded the advancement prize to [[Wolfgang Herrndorf]] (Berlin).

== Prizes ==
* Eifel Award 2010 of the Zukunftsinitiative Eifel (ZIE), awarded in March 2011 at the ITB Berlin. 
* Wolf von Reis Cultural Prize of the Eifel Club 2011, awarded in May 2011 in Hellenthal/ Eifel.

== Authors ==
Authors who have been guests at the Eifel Literature Festival include: [[Mario Adorf]], [[Simon Beckett]], [[Klaus Bednarz]], [[Iris Berben]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Peter Bichsel]], [[Norbert Blüm]], [[Tom Buhrow]] &amp; Sabine Stamer, [[Michael Degen]], [[Friedrich Christian Delius]], [[Joachim C.

'''Eistnaflug''' is a metal festival in [[Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/08/31/iceland-concert-event-iceland-airwaves-to-attract-thousands-of-music-lovers/ Iceland concert event Iceland Airwaves to attract thousands of music lovers | IceNews - Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/East_Iceland_Town_Gears_Up_for_Heavy_Metal_Fest_0_379128.news.aspx East Iceland Town Gears Up for Heavy Metal Fest]&lt;/ref&gt; that has taken place annually since the summer of 2005. Eistnaflug is an indoor festival situated in [[Neskaupstaður]], a quaint little town located on the Norðfjörður fjord on the Eastern coast of Iceland, 700&amp;nbsp;km away from Reykjavik

It started out as a small one day metal festival on 27 August 2005 but has since grown into a three-day festival where metal, hardcore, punk, rock and indie bands share the stage.

Eistnaflug is held annually on the second weekend of July each year. The peaceful village of Neskaupstaður has about 1.400 inhabitants, but on the second weekend of July that number doubles. We are proud that the people of Neskaupstaður welcome us each year and that there has never been any trouble with the festival guests.

The line up usually consists of 30-40 bands, most of which are Icelandic. Foreign bands that have performed at the festival are Tyrant (SE), [[Napalm Death]] (UK), Actress (DE), [[Triptykon]] (CHE), [[Secrets of the moon]] (DE), [[Hamferð]] (FRO), The Monolith Deathcult (NL) and [[Cephalic Carnage]] (US). Domestic bands that have often played the festival include [[Sólstafir]], Momentum, Innvortis, Saktmóðigur, Severed Crotch, Gone Postal, Carpe Noctem, Celestine and many more.

Musically, Eistnaflug is also a remarkable melting pot, with a few selected, prime foreign acts stacking up against a massive selection of all the great things the Iceland music scene has to offer every year. There are no boundaries – from indie rock to hardcore to black metal, everything that’s good is accepted and embraced at Eistnaflug. Having featured international talent such as Napalm Death, Secrets Of The Moon, Triptykon or Cephalic Carnage in previous editions, Eistnaflug 2013 offers Portland’s notorious rockers Red Fang, Denmark’s sludgy post-metallers The Psyke Project, Faroe Islands Wacken Metal Battle-winning doom sensation Hamferð and iconic German thrashers Contradiction as the respectable foreign contingent descending upon Neskaupstaður this year, and they will be stacked up against the cream of the Icelandic metal crop.

The '''Formula 1430''' was founded in 1971 as the '''Formula Nacional'''. It was a junior [[formula racing]] series based in [[Spain]].

==History==
[[File:Formula SEAT 1430.jpg|thumb]]
Spanish car manufacturer [[SEAT]] launched the Formula Nacional in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41 anys després: FÓRMULA 1430|url=http://www.acfclassics.org/?page_id=1402|work=ACF Classics|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same era the [[Formula Ford]] ([[Great Britain]]), [[Formula Blue]] ([[France]]), [[Formula Vee]] ([[Germany]]) and [[Formula 850]] ([[Italy]]) were launched. Many notable Spanish racing car constructed committed to the new found series. [[Hispakart]], [[Selex Competition|Selex]] and [[Lynx Engineering|Lynx]] are a few manufacturers to commit to the series. The first race of the series was run on April 4th, 1971 at [[Circuito del Jarama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://hispakart.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=6|work=Hispakart|accessdate=14 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222061526/http://hispakart.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=6|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy battle Selex driver [[Paco Josa]] won the championship over Lynx driver [[Emilio Zapico]]. The following years were dominated by the Selex ST 3. The ST 3 won all races between 1972 and 1976. The ST 7, launched in 1978, was less successful. Selex lost its dominance with the introduction of this new car. The ST 7 would win two championships 1980 and 1981. In 1980 the championship was won by [[Enrique Llobell]]. The following year the championship was won by Enriques brother [[Jose Luis Llobell]]. As of 1982 foreign built cars were allowed in the series. Selex completely pulled out of the championship due to disappointing results. With SEAT pulling slowly pulling out of the series, the championship lost its notability and folded after the 1984 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SELEX (1965 - 1983)|url=http://www.autopasion18.com/HISTORIA-SELEX.htm|work=Autopassion|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Formula 1430 is an open chassis formula. Every manufacturer based in Spain is allowed to design and build a Formula 1430 car. The only engine allowed is the [[SEAT 1430]] engine. The engines performance is raised to 75[[horsepower|hp]]. The cars use a [[gearbox]] coming out of a [[SEAT 600]] or [[SEAT 850]]. Constructors were allowed to build a [[monocoque]] or a [[spaceframe]] chassis. Aerodynamic aids like a diffuser and wings were not allowed. Domestic produced [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Torino tyres were the spec tyres for the series. The car had a minimum weight of approximately 420kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tollkühne Männer in ihren knatternden Kisten|url=http://www.stern.de/auto/test/tollkuehne-maenner-in-ihren-knatternden-kisten-2076771.html|work=Stern|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Drone Racing Association, Inc.''' (IDRA) is a professional racing organization that sanctions and governs multiple [[drone racing]] events. IDRA's major events and series' include the 2017 Challengers Cup, 2016 World Drone Prix, 2016 North America Cup, 2016 GiGA World Masters, and the 2015 California Cup.

Justin Haggerty founded the company on 3 April 2015 to promote and build drone racing into a world renown sport. Early that summer, Co-Founder Charles Zablan joined the team and began preparing for the 2015 California Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/anna-hensel/drone-racing-los-angeles.html|title=How Los Angeles Can Help Make Drone Racing the Next NASCAR|author=Anna Hensel|work=Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/sports/drone-racing-competition.html?_r=0|title=Gentlemen, Start Your Drones|author=Erik Olsen|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDRA began working with the [[United Arab Emirates]] government and Aerial Grand Prix in October, 2015 to co-found and host the World Drone Prix in Dubai. The event, supported by Crown Prince Sheikh [[Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum|Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktou]], was held at Skydive Dubai on 11 &amp; 12 March 2016 for $1 Million in cash prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/2059086/welcome-competitive-drone-racing|title=Welcome to Competitive Drone Racing|author=David Ferry|work=Outside Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaycee Nicole''', aka Kaycee Nicole Swenson, was a fictitious persona played by an American woman named Debbie Swenson (born Deborah Marie Dickman 1960), in an early case of [[Münchausen by Internet]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Hafner|first=Katie|title=A Beautiful Life, an Early Death, a Fraud Exposed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20010531thursday.html|accessdate=3 March 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Recupero |first1=Patricia R. |year=2010 |title=The Mental Status Examination in the Age of the Internet |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=15–26 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/38/1/15 |accessdate=10 May 2011 |pmid=20305070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1999 and when the hoax was discovered in 2001, Swenson, playing the role of Kaycee, represented herself on numerous websites as a teenager suffering from terminal [[leukemia]]. Kaycee was reported to have died on May 14, 2001, and her death was publicized on May 16; shortly thereafter, members of the online communities that had supported her unraveled the story and discovered that Kaycee had never actually existed. Debbie Swenson confessed on her blog to the hoax on May 20, 2001.&lt;ref name=TCJ&gt;[http://cjonline.com/stories/052601/kan_webhoax.shtml Girl's illness was Web hoax; The Topeka Capital-Journal; May 26, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite news|last=Shreve|first=Jean|title=They Think They Feel Your Pain|url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/06/44245|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=26 April 2011|date=6 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
In 1998, Debbie Swenson's real daughter, Kelli Burke (born Kelli Jo Swenson in 1985), who was in middle school at the time in [[Gracemont, Oklahoma]], created the online persona of "Kaycee Nicole" with a group of her friends.&lt;ref name=TCJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peterborough&gt;{{cite news|last=Saitz|first=Ray|title=Internet Preys on Gullible|newspaper=[[Peterborough Examiner]]|location= Tech Monday; Pg.

In 2000, Kaycee revealed to an online friend of hers, Randall van der Woning, that she suffered from [[leukemia]], which was then in remission. Shortly afterward, she told him that the cancer was back. Sympathetic, Van der Woning offered to set up and host a [[blog]] for her to chronicle her struggles; Kaycee accepted the offer and the two created "Living Colours"&lt;!-- Even though this article is written in American English, the use of "Colours" here is correct.  Please do not change it. --&gt; in August 2000.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Kaycee's blog recounted, in sometimes vivid detail, her struggles with the disease, including multiple hospitalizations. The near-daily entries were presented as having been written by Kaycee or, in cases where she was too weak or ill, by her "mother", Debbie.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; She maintained an upbeat writing style despite her apparent hardships – her first entry said, 
"I'm beginning a new exciting journey&amp;nbsp;... into my survival. I want to win! I'll fight to the
finish!"&lt;ref name=SunTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Roeper|first=Richard|title=The sad story of Kaycee, cancer and compassion|newspaper=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1 June 2011|pages=NEWS pg 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and readers of her blog became devoted to the inspirational young girl. Readership of the blog became widespread, with millions of readers visiting the site in the two years it was active&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Bobbie|title=The short life of Kaycee Nicole|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/may/28/internetnews.mondaymediasection|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many readers recommending the blog to their own social networks
&lt;ref name=NYTEssay /&gt; Some sent cards, gifts, and well-wishes to Kaycee by mail;&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news|last=Cave|first=Damien|title=Can the Net be trusted?|url= http://www.salon.com/technology/feature/2001/06/19/dawson|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=Salon.com|date=19 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; still others spoke to "Kaycee" on the phone, some, such as the administrator of her blog, many times.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In April 2001, it was revealed that Kaycee's liver was failing. Concerned about losing a "friend" without ever having met her, Van der Woning insisted that Kaycee allow him to visit her; Kaycee told him that he was welcome to visit, but not until after she returned from a trip she would be taking to see the ocean.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

However, before Van der Woning could make his trip to see Kaycee, he received a call on May 15, 2001, from Kaycee's mother. Sobbing, Debbie informed him that Kaycee had died, unexpectedly, of an [[aneurysm]] the day before.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; News of Kaycee's death was immediately posted on her blog:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thank you for the love, the joy, the laughter and the tears. We shall love you always and forever. Kaycee Nicole passed away May 14, 2001, at the age of 19.&lt;ref name=SundayHerald&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Graeme|title=Fooled by a web of lies|newspaper=[[Sunday Herald Sun]]|location=NEWS; Pg. 11 | date=27 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Readers of the blog mourned Kaycee's death, many posting obituaries short and long on their own blogs, and news of her loss became widespread and much-discussed throughout the internet.

==Unraveling of hoax==
After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who requested an address to send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers to were told that, despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, there was no longer a [[post-office box]] mailing address for her in [[Newton, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

On May 17, blogger Saundra Mitchell posted an entry to her blog mocking people who faked illnesses on the internet. Though she did not initially name Kaycee Nicole, the next day she published another commentary which did explicitly name her and suggested that in fact, Kaycee Nicole had never existed.&lt;ref name=TheAge&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinclair|first=Jenny|title=Kaycee's tear-jerking 'blog' was all online bilge|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=5 June 2001|location=Section: Computers|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cited the nearly impossible haste with which Kaycee had been interred, noting that even if Kaycee had not been autopsied – which was dependent upon the manner of her death and whether there was a doctor attending – the two days that Debbie claimed that gathering of mourners, memorial service, and cremation had been accomplished in was unlikely;&lt;ref name=AnywhereBeyond1&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Saundra |title=Your Guide to Faking a Life and Death Online |url=http://www.anywherebeyond.com/2001/0501/051701.html |work=Headspace |publisher=anywherebeyond.com |accessdate=6 May 2011 |date=17 May 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010616231208/http://www.anywherebeyond.com/2001/0501/051701.html |archivedate=June 16, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell also noted a number of inconsistencies in the backstory about Kaycee's cancer.&lt;ref name=MefiAcidSaundra&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Saundra|title=(quoted in a comment on Metafilter)|url=http://www.metafilter.com/7819/Is-it-possible-that-Kaycee-did-not-exist#84429|work=Metafilter|date=18 May 2001|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell, working off Kaycee's "internet address", traced the girl's location to [[Peabody, Kansas]]. She called around the town, asking if anyone knew of someone of Kaycee's description who had died recently. No one did.&lt;ref name=SundayHerald /&gt;

On May 18, a user on the weblog [[Metafilter]] posted a thread entitled "Is it possible that Kaycee did not exist?",&lt;ref name=MefiMain&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it possible that Kaycee did not exist?|url=http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/7819|publisher=[[Metafilter]]|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which posited, largely on the basis of Saundra Mitchell's writings, that Kaycee Nicole might have been a hoax. Commenters in the often-heated thread (even the creator of the thread stated that "I mean, I want it NOT to be true. I hate the thought that a bunch of people are grieving over somebody who did not existi!{{sic}}"&lt;ref name=MefiAcid1&gt;{{cite web|last=acidrabbit|title=(a comment on Metafilter)|url=http://www.metafilter.com/7819/Is-it-possible-that-Kaycee-did-not-exist#84436|work=Metafilter|date=18 May 2001|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) made a number of observations about the story of Kaycee, among them that no one had ever met Kaycee in person – not even the internet denizens who had been closest to her &lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; – and that no obituary was available in a newspaper, anywhere, for a 19-year-old girl named Kaycee Nicole.&lt;ref name=MefiCentrs&gt;{{cite web|last=centrs|title=(a comment on Metafilter)|url=http://www.metafilter.com/7819/Is-it-possible-that-Kaycee-did-not-exist#84475|publisher=Metafilter|accessdate=5 May 2011|date=18 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Metafilter thread progressed, users discovered that Kaycee's CollegeClub account was tied to the CollegeClub account of Debbie Swenson's teenaged daughter and that records showed that someone had logged into Kaycee's account days after she was supposed to have died. A user investigated the photographs that Kaycee had shared on her blog, identified a school mascot pictured, and traced it back to a particular high school, then traced the jersey number that "Kaycee" was wearing to an actual player. Investigation of the player showed that the only connection she had to Kaycee Nicole was that her family had once been acquainted with the Swenson family; she was not ill, was not named Kaycee Nicole, and not aware that her photo was being used by someone else.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

===Confession===
On May 19, Debbie Swenson placed a call to her biggest supporter, Randall van der Woning. She told him that Kaycee had not actually been her own child, but rather a foster daughter. She requested that he keep Kaycee's identity secret.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted that the story of Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the ''In Living Colours'' blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; "I didn't know the reactions would be so strong", Swenson said. "I knew it was wrong and every day it ate at me and I couldn't take it."&lt;ref name=SundayTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Graeme|title=The Great Pretenders|newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|date=12 May 2002|location=Magazine|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer, none of whom were her daughter.&lt;ref name=Kuro5hin&gt;{{cite web|last=shirobara|title=The Life and Death of a False Warrior|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/5/22/11120/1650|publisher=Kuro5hin|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Internet anger at the hoax was swift, with Van der Woning and many other supporters disclaiming Kaycee and Debbie Swenson. The local police in [[Peabody, Kansas]], were notified and soon handed off the case to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as a possible fraud.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The FBI declined to further investigate after its initial acceptance of the case, stating that it had not been able to find evidence that Debbie Swenson's accepting of gifts for "Kaycee" constituted a dollar amount above their threshold for financial crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-05-31-internet-hoax-fbi.htm|title=FBI won't pursue Internet hoax|date=31 March 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://peabody.advantage-preservation.com/document/gazette-bulletin-2001-05-30-page-1 FBI declines to prosecute in 'Kaycee' internet hoax, page 1 &amp; 2; ''Peabody Gazette-Bulletin''; 8 pages; May 30, 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417001146/http://peabody.advantage-preservation.com/document/gazette-bulletin-2001-05-30-page-1 |date=April 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swenson was apologetic for the hoax but said that she believed the Kaycee character had also done some good. "A lot of people have problems," she told ''[[The New York Times]]''. "I know I helped a lot of people in a lot of different ways."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

{{further|Cause of death}}{{Update|date=September 2017}}
The following is a '''list of the causes of human deaths''' worldwide for the year 2002, arranged by their associated [[mortality rate]]s. There were 57,029,000 deaths tabulated for that year. Some causes listed include deaths also included in more specific subordinate causes (as indicated by the "Group" column), and some causes are omitted, so the percentages do not sum to 100. According to the [[World Health Organization]], about 58 million people died in 2005, using the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/cancer/en/ | year = 2005 | author = WHO | title = Cancer }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 52.77 million people died in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozano|first1=Rafael|last2=Naghavi|first2=Mohsen|title=Global and regional  mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and  2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 2012|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|url=http://ipa-world.org/society-resources/code/images/95b1494-Lozano%20Mortality%20GBD2010.pdf|display-authors=1|pmid=23245604|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By frequency==

The table below uses data from 2002 and is out of date. Data is now available for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozano|first1=Rafael|last2=Naghavi|first2=Mohsen|title=Global and regional  mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and  2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 2012|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|url=http://ipa-world.org/society-resources/code/images/95b1494-Lozano%20Mortality%20GBD2010.pdf|display-authors=1|pmid=23245604|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128}} See also [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf this CDC report from the US].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note: Tinted backgrounds indicate items that also appear in the subsequent table.  Percentage figures add to more than 100% because some deaths appear in both broadly-defined and narrowly defined categories; for example, Cardiovascular Deaths includes deaths from both Ischaemic Heart Disease and Stroke.''

== Malnutrition ==

Malnutrition can be identified as an underlying cause for shortened life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/77.extract |title=Mortality In Second And Third Degree Malnutrition |publisher=Tropej.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of childhood deaths (age 0-4) are reportedly due to diarrheal illness, acute respiratory infection, malaria and immunizable disease.

The '''[[Zecchino d'Oro]]''' International Festival of Children's Song has been held every year since 1959, first as a national (Italian) event, and after 1976 as an international one. The 1964 songs were recorded for an [[LP record|LP]] titled ''The Little Dancing Chicken,'' (an English translation of "Il Pulcino Ballerino," the award-winning song that year). The LP was released in the United States.

The '''Ljubljana Opera House''' ({{lang-sl|Opera}}, or {{lang|sl|ljubljanska operna hiša}}) is an [[opera house]] in [[Ljubljana]], the capital of [[Slovenia]]. The seat of the national opera and ballet company, the [[Ljubljana Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet]], it serves as the national opera building of the country. It stands at 1 Župančič Street ({{lang|sl|Župančičeva 1}}) between the [[Slovenian Parliament]] building, on one hand, and the [[National Museum of Slovenia|National Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Slovenia|National Gallery]], on the other hand.

==History==
The building was originally named the Provincial Theatre ({{lang-sl|Deželno gledališče}}) and was built between 1890 and 1892 in the [[Neo-Renaissance]] style by the [[Czech people|Czech]] architects [[Jan Vladimír Hráský]] and [[Anton Hruby]]. Before the construction of the German Theatre (the present [[Ljubljana National Drama Theatre]] (SNG) at 1 Erjavec Street) in 1911, the building served as a venue for productions in both [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[German language|German]], and afterwards only in Slovene.

==Architecture==
The facade of the Opera House has [[Ionic column]]s supporting a [[pediment]] with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the entrance and has two niches at the side adorned with [[allegory|allegorical]] statues of [[Tragedy]] and [[Comedy]] by the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Alojz Gangl|sl}} (1859–1935).

[[File:KONI Challenge New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Competitors in the KONI Challenge on a pre-grid at [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]] in 2008]]

The '''Michelin Pilot Challenge''' is a [[grand tourer|grand touring]] and [[touring car racing]] series run by the [[International Motor Sports Association]]. Originating from the Canadian '''[[Motorola]] Cup''', the series was taken over by Grand-Am in 2001 to become the '''Grand-Am Cup''' following the demise of rival [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firehawk]] series of similar rules in the US. KONI became series sponsor for the start of the 2007 season when the series became known as the '''[[KONI Group|KONI]] Challenge Series''', before renaming once more prior to the start of the 2009 season as the '''KONI Sports Car Challenge'''. The series name was once again changed for the 2010 season to '''[[Continental Tire]] Sports Car Challenge'''. In 2019, the series rebranded again after [[Michelin]] was selected to become the new official tire supplier of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sportscar365.com/imsa/ctscc/michelin-pilot-challenge-launched-two-class-format-for-2019/|title=Michelin Pilot Challenge Revealed; Two Classes in 2019 – Sportscar365|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Continental Challenge was the support series for Grand-Am's premier offering, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. In 2014, the series became the support series for the [[United SportsCar Championship]] upon the merger of the Rolex Series and the [[American Le Mans Series]]. The series was renamed the IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge.


==Races==
In traditional sports car racing format, the races are often run with both GS and ST classes on track simultaneously, which is known as a "combined" race. Occasionally the races will be run in "split classes", with separate races for both classes. This is especially common for shorter venues such as [[Lime Rock Park]]. Currently the races are 2 hours 30 minutes in length with a required driver change.

==Telecasts==
*All telecasts are exclusive to [[Fox Sports 1]], formerly [[Speed Channel]]. All telecasts are uploaded to the series website after their initial airing.

==Vehicles==
The series uses two classes in each race:

*The Grand Sport (GS) class features large-displacement 6-cylinder, 8-cylinder, 10-cylinder or 12-cylinder sports cars as well as small displacement 4-cylinder [[forced induction]] sports cars.
*The Street Tuner (ST) class is for smaller 4-cylinder, 5-cylinder or 6-cylinder sedans, hatchbacks, coupes or convertibles.

All vehicles have fewer modifications than most series, using a "showroom stock" format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imsa.com/2015-imsa-rules-and-regulations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411205521/http://www.imsa.com/2015-imsa-rules-and-regulations |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is reminiscent of the original [[Trans-Am Series]], combining conventional sports cars and touring cars, though the Trans-Am Series usually had a single driver per car, unlike the Continental Challenge, which has two drivers per car. Some vehicles in the Continental Challenge have actually been painted to resemble the original Trans Am cars, such as the Boss 302 Mustangs of [[George Follmer]] and [[Parnelli Jones]] or the original Sunoco Camaro. Several vehicles in ST have also competed in the [[SCCA]]'s [[Pirelli World Challenge]] touring car class.

The '''[[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]]''' in the northeast United States were an organized [[Terrorism|terrorist act]] carried out by [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]], and organized by numerous members of [[al-Qaeda]]. Motives for the attacks were stated before and after the attacks in several sources, Osama bin Laden's declaration of a [[Religious war|holy war]] against the United States, and a [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|fatwā signed by bin Laden]] and others for the killing of Americans in 1998, are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Gunarathna, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with Daily Ummat, Osama bin Laden rejected Al-Qaeda's involvement in the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/1421/category.php?DocumentID=2392|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116041119/http://www.khilafah.com/1421/category.php?DocumentID=2392|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 November 2001|title=Welcome to Khilafah.com|date=16 November 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F97A5230AAFE56C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=NewsLibrary.com - newspaper archive, clipping service - newspapers and other news sources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of 9/11, public discussion of the causes of terrorism was largely curtailed, which some commentators claimed was an effort to excuse and justify the killing of innocent civilians. Catchphrases – that terrorists were motivated by a hatred of freedom or by a fanaticism inherent to [[Islam]] – were prevalent. Arun Kundnani describes the atmosphere as one where "terrorism became an ‘evil ideology’ that did not require further analysis." By 2004 however, the taboo was broken and it was only through the notion of "[[radicalization]]" that a discussion on the causes became possible again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kundnani|first1=A.|title=Radicalisation: the journey of a concept|journal=Race &amp; Class|date=18 September 2012|volume=54|issue=2|pages=3–25|doi=10.1177/0306396812454984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
{{See also|Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden|Videos of Ayman al-Zawahiri}}
Before the attacks, [[Al-Qaeda]] issued [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|proclamations]] that provide insight into the motivations for the attacks: one was the ''[[fatwā]]'' of August 1996,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html Text of the 1996 fatwa], translation by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722010004/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second was a shorter fatwa in February 1998.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html Text of the 1998 fatwa] translation by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329110219/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html |date=March 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both documents appeared initially in the Arabic-language London newspaper ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]''. Three years before the [[September 11 attacks]], Al-Qaeda released a Fatwa, stating "We -- with God's help -- call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also call on Muslim ulema, leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid on Satan's U.S. troops and the devil's supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson."&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; The Fatwa also complains against the presence of the US in Saudi Arabia and support for Israel.&lt;ref name="e1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; After the attacks, bin Laden and [[al-Zawahiri]] have published dozens of [[Videos of Osama bin Laden|video tapes]] and audio tapes, many describing the motivations for the attacks. Two particularly important publications were bin Laden's 2002 "Letter to America",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver|title=Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'|date=24 November 2002|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|a 2004 video tape by bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;"So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and shall tell you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken, for you to consider." – [http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html 2004 Osama bin Laden video]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to direct pronouncements by bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, numerous political analysts have postulated motivations for the attacks.

==Stated motives==
===Support of Israel by United States===
{{See also|Israel–United States relations|Israel–United States military relations}}
{{Further|Arab–Israeli conflict|United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine}}
In his November 2002 "Letter to America", Bin Laden described the United States' support of Israel as a motivation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Greater Israel|expansion of Israel]] is one of the greatest crimes, and [[Presidency of George W. Bush|you are the leaders]] of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The [[Balfour Declaration|creation]] [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|of Israel]] is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its price, and pay for it heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver|title=Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'|date=24 November 2002|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004 and 2010, Bin Laden again repeated the connection between the September 11 attacks and the support of Israel by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bin Laden's 2004 taped broadcast on the attacks, in which he explains the motives for the attacks and says "The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced." (Quoted from Al Jazeera [http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html online here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bin Laden's taped broadcast from January 2010, where he said "Our attacks against you [the United States] will continue as long as U.S. support for Israel continues. ... The message sent to you with the attempt by the hero Nigerian [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] is a confirmation of our previous message conveyed by the heroes of Sept. 11". (Quoted from "Bin Laden: Attacks on U.S. to go on as long as it supports Israel", ''Haaretz'', [http://www.haaretz.com/news/bin-laden-attacks-on-u-s-to-go-on-as-long-as-it-supports-israel-1.265770 online here]).&lt;/ref&gt; Support of Israel was also mentioned before the attack in the 1998 [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|Al-Qaeda fatwa]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he aim [of the United States] is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert attention from its [[Positions on Jerusalem|occupation of Jerusalem]] and murder of Muslims there. The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], the strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee Israel's survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the Peninsula.&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western Immorality===
In the above mentioned 2002 "Letter To America", Bin Laden laments the immoral behavior that has become the norm in the United States as a motivating factor in his decision to launch the attacks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The second thing we call you to, is to stop your oppression, lies, immorality and debauchery that has spread among you. (a) We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver|title=Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'|date=24 November 2002|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sanctions imposed against Iraq===
{{See also|Iraq sanctions}}
{{further|Gulf War}}
{{Wikisource|United Nations Security Council Resolution 661}}
On 6 August 1990, after the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], the UN Security Council adopted [[UN Resolution 661|Resolution 661]], which imposed [[economic sanctions]] on Iraq, providing for a full [[trade embargo]], excluding medical supplies, food, and other items of humanitarian necessity (these to be determined by the Security Council sanctions committee). After the end of the Gulf War and after the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the sanctions were linked to removal of [[weapons of mass destruction]] by [[UN Resolution 687|Resolution 687]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/687.htm|title=UN Security Council Resolution 687 -1991|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|1998 fatwa]], Al Qaeda identified the Iraq sanctions as a reason to kill Americans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;despite the great devastation inflicted on the Iraqi people by the crusader-Zionist alliance, and despite the huge number of those killed, which has exceeded 1 million... despite all this, the Americans are once against trying to repeat the horrific massacres, as though they are not content with the protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the fragmentation and devastation....On that basis, and in compliance with Allah's order, we issue the following fatwa to all Muslims: The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim...&lt;ref name="1998 Al Qaeda fatwa"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm 1998 Al Qaeda fatwa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Michael |title=Sanctions on Iraq: A Valid Anti-American Grievance? |publisher=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/meria-rubin-sanctions-1201.htm |pages=100–115 |date=December 2001 |authorlink=Michael Rubin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028003924/http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/meria-rubin-sanctions-1201.htm |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[2004 Osama bin Laden video]], Osama calls the sanctions "the greatest mass slaughter of children mankind has ever known".&lt;ref name="aljazeera04"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech |publisher=aljazeera|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence of US military in Saudi Arabia===
{{See also|Operation Southern Watch}}
After the 1991 [[Gulf war]], the US maintained a presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2984547.stm|title=US pulls out of Saudi Arabia |accessdate=29 November 2009 | work=BBC News | date=2003-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the responsibilities of that force was [[Operation Southern Watch]], which enforced the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]] over southern Iraq set up after 1991, and the country's oil exports through the shipping lanes of the [[Persian Gulf]] are protected by the [[US Fifth Fleet]], based in [[Bahrain]].

Since Saudi Arabia houses the holiest sites in [[Islam]] ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]), many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence.
The continued presence of US troops after the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia was one of the stated motivations behind the September 11th attacks&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and the [[Khobar Towers bombing]]. Further, the date chosen for the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] (August 7) was eight years to the day that American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Plotz, David (2001) [http://www.slate.com/default.aspx?id=115404 What Does Osama Bin Laden Want?], Slate&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden interpreted [[Muhammad]] as banning the "permanent presence of infidels in Arabia".&lt;ref name="holywar-p3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergen, Peter L. |title=Holy War Inc. |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2001 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Bin Laden issued a fatwa calling for [[United States military|American troops]] to get out of [[Saudi Arabia]]. In the 1998 fatwa, Al-Qaeda wrote: "for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples."&lt;ref name="1998 Al Qaeda fatwa"/&gt; In the December 1999 interview with [[Rahimullah Yusufzai]], bin Laden said he felt that Americans were "too near to [[Mecca]]" and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world.&lt;ref name="guardian-20010926"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,558075,00.html |title=Face to face with Osama |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 26, 2001 |location=London |accessdate=2010-05-13 |first=Rahimullah |last=Yusufzai |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119011449/http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,558075,00.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inferred motives==
Political analysts have inferred some motives for the attacks that were not explicitly stated by Al-Qaeda, such as [[globalization]] and a desire to provoke the United States.

Elliot Neaman stated that the connections Walt and Mearsheimer and others, including many German intellectuals, make between 9/11 and Israel are ahistorical.&lt;ref&gt;See Elliot Neaman "The War That Took Place in Germany; Intellectuals and September 11th", ''[[German Politics and Society]]'' (Fall, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the Palestinians themselves have often pointed to their betrayal by one Arab leader after another since the founding of the state of Israel, and further that bin Laden is no exception, as he never showed any concern for the Palestinian cause until he came under the influence of Ayman Al-Zawahir and decided to use the Palestinians as a means to gain the favor of militant Muslims. Al-Qaeda and Hamas continue to have a fraught relationship, and have been argued to have different goals in regard to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.&lt;ref&gt;See also Jake Lipton, "The War of Words between Hamas and al-Qaeda", The Washington Institute Policy Analysis #1254, http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-of-words-between-hamas-and-al-qaeda&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious motivation===
[[Daniel Benjamin]] and [[Steven Simon]], in their book, ''The Age of Sacred Terror'', argue that 9/11 terrorist attacks are purely religious. They are seen as "a sacrament ... intended to restore to the universe a moral order that had been corrupted by the enemies of Islam." It is neither political or strategic but an "act of redemption" meant to "humiliate and slaughter those who defied the hegemony of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Age of Sacred Terror|page=40|author=Daniel Benjamin|author2=Steven Simon|year=2002|isbn=978-0756767518|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Bernard Lewis]] is the best-known exponent of the idea of the "humiliation" of the Islamic world through globalization. In the 2004 book ''[[The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror]]'', he argues animosity toward the West is best understood with the decline of the once powerful [[Ottoman Empire]], compounded by the import of western ideas, as seen in [[Arab socialism]], [[Liberal movements within Islam|Arab liberalism]] and [[Secularism in the Middle East|Arab secularism]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the past three centuries, the Islamic world has lost its dominance and its leadership, and has fallen behind both the modern West and the rapidly modernizing Orient. This widening gap poses increasingly acute problems, both practical and emotional, for which the rulers, thinkers, and rebels of Islam have not yet found effective answers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror''. Bernard Lewis. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an essay titled "[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/baudriterror.htm The spirit of terrorism]", [[Jean Baudrillard]] described 9/11 as the first global event that "questions the very process of globalization".&lt;ref name="baud"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/baudriterror.htm|title=The spirit of terrorism|last= Baudrillard|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provoke war with the United States===
{{See also|Pan-Islamism|Secularism in the Middle East}}
Some Middle East scholars—such as [[Michael Scott Doran]] and [[Peter Bergen]]—have argued that 9/11 was a strategic way to provoke America into a war that incites a [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamist]] revolution. Doran argued that the attacks are best understood as being part of a religious conflict within the Muslim world. In an essay, Doran argued that Bin Laden's followers "consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57618/michael-scott-doran/somebody-elses-civil-war|title=somebody-elses-civil-war|publisher=foreignaffairs|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doran further argued that bin Laden hoped that US retaliation would unite the faithful against the West, sparking revolutions in [[Arab nations]] and elsewhere, and that the [[Osama bin Laden videos]] were attempting to provoke a visceral reaction in the Middle East aimed at a violent reaction by Muslim citizens to increased US involvement in their region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doran |first=Michael Scott |title=Understanding the War on Terror |publisher=Norton |year=2005 |location=New York |pages=72–75 |isbn=0-87609-347-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen argued that the attacks were part of a plan to cause the United States to increase its military and cultural presence in the Middle East, thereby forcing Muslims to confront the idea of a non-Muslim government and establish conservative Islamic governments in the region.&lt;ref name="Bergen2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergen |first=Peter |title=The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader |publisher=Free Press |year=2006 |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-7891-7 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on suicide terrorism===
[[Robert Pape]] identified 315 incidents, all but 14 of which they classified as part of 18 different campaigns. These 18 shared two elements and all but one shared a third:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pape |first= Robert A. |authorlink= Robert Pape |title= [[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]] |year= 2005 |publisher= Random House |location= New York |isbn= 0-8129-7338-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1) A foreign occupation; 2) by a democracy; 3) of a different religion. [[Mia Bloom]] interviewed relatives and acquaintances of suicide terrorists. Her conclusions largely support Pape's, suggesting that it is much more difficult to get people to volunteer for a suicide mission without such a foreign occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bloom |first= Mia  |authorlink= Mia Bloom |title= Dying to Kill:  The Allure of Suicide Terrorism |year= 2005 |publisher= Columbia U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Musica Toscana''', Inc., was a nonprofit cultural, educational, and musicological organization located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], that promoted the musical heritage of the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] region of [[Italy]].  It was founded in 1999 under the leadership of the [[musicologist]] Robert L. Weaver, a retired faculty member of the [[University of Louisville]].  Musica Toscana was headed by Margaret M. Guarnieri after 2007.  As of 2012, the organization ceased operations.  It maintained a reciprocal membership with the [[period instrument]] ensemble [[Auser Musici]] of [[Pisa]], Italy.

One of the principal reasons for the creation of Musica Toscana was the acquisition in 1984 of the private music library of the Italian Ricasoli family by the Dwight Anderson Music Library of the University of Louisville.  At the time, the Ricasoli collection was one of the largest private collections of eighteenth-century music remaining in the world.  The collection originated with Baron Pietro Leopoldo Ricasoli in [[Florence]] and was once in the possession of Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]], a founding father of the modern Italian state and one of its first [[prime ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the musical patronage of the Ricasoli family and a catalog of the holdings of their music collection is provided in ''The Music Library of a Florentine Noble Family'' (Sterling Heights, Mich: Harmonie Park Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0899901581}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal goal of Musica Toscana was to promote music written in Tuscany, performed in Tuscany, or written by Tuscan composers active outside of Tuscany that originated from the period 1590-1850, an era of political, culture, and economic decline in the region, but one of continued musical importance that saw the birth of [[opera]] in the 1590s and the invention of the [[piano]] a century later.

Musica Toscana oversaw the publication of a series of scholarly and performing editions, the ''Monuments of Tuscan Music'', and sponsored concerts and lectures devoted to its repertory of interest, sometimes in collaboration with [[Bourbon Baroque]]. Only four of many planned volumes of the ''Monuments of Tuscan Music'' series appeared before the dissolution of the organization.

The '''origins of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]''' lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and the minority [[Sri Lankan Tamils]]. Before and during the early part of colonial rule by Europeans, Sri Lanka was under the rule of three separate kingdoms. War and peace was a status quo between nations, unlike the present status quo of war crimes and terrorism between majorities and minorities. During the colonial rule by Portuguese and then the Dutch, the three sovereign states were ruled as separate entities. The final British colonial rule amalgamated the entire island into a single administrative entity after independence the minorities were handed over to the mercy of the majority who were warring parties before the period of the European colonisation. According to Jonathan Spencer, a [[social anthropologist]] from the School of Social and Political Studies of the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Staff profile:Jonathan Spencer
| author = The University of Edinburgh |url= http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/spencer_jonathan|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the war is an outcome of how modern ethnic identities have been made and re-made since the colonial period, with the political struggle between minority Tamils and the Sinhala-dominant government accompanied by rhetorical wars over [[archeological]] sites and [[Sri Lankan place name etymology|place name etymologies]], and the political use of the national past.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J, ''Sri Lankan history and roots of conflict'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.ebookmall.com/title/sri-lanka-spencer-ebooks.htm|title= Sri Lanka Summary.|accessdate=2008-05-08 |work= Jonathan Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead up to armed struggle==
A primary contributor to the development of political awareness amongst Tamils during the European colonial rule was the advent of [[Protestant]] missionaries on a large scale from 1814. Missionary activities by missionaries of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], [[Methodists]] and [[Anglican]] churches led to a revival amongst Hindu Tamils who built their own schools, temples, societies and published literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led the Tamils to think confidently of themselves as a community and prepared the way for self-consciousness as a cultural, religious and linguisitic community in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gunasingam, ''Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunasingam, ''Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Great Britain]], which had come to control the whole of the island in 1815, instituted a [[Legislative Council of Ceylon|legislative council]] in 1833 with three Europeans and one each for [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], Sri Lankan Tamils and [[Burgher people|Burghers]]. This council's primary requirement was to play an advisory role to the [[British governors of Ceylon|Governor]]. These positions eventually came to be elected. From the introduction of the advisory council to the [[Donoughmore Commission]] in 1931 until the [[Soulbury Commission]] in 1947, the main dispute between the Sinhalese and Tamils elites was over the question of representation and not on the structure of the government. The issue of power sharing was used by the nationalists of both communities to create an escalating inter-ethnic rivalry which has continually gained momentum ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Gunasingam, ''Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

There was initially little tension amongst Sri Lanka's two largest ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, when [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], a Tamil, was appointed representative of the Sinhalese as well the Tamils in the national legislative council. However, the British Governor [[William Manning (colonial governor)|William Manning]] actively encouraged the concept of "communal representation" and created the [[Colombo]] seat which alternated between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.&lt;ref name="kms"&gt;K. M. de Sila, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Donoughmore Commission]] strongly rejected communal representation, and brought in [[universal franchise]]. The decision was strongly opposed by the Tamil political leadership, who realized that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament, according to the proportion of the population they make up. [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], a leader of the Tamil community, proposed to the [[Soulbury]] Commission that there should be 50–50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese, 50% for ''all'' other ethnic groups, including Tamils) in the proposed independent Ceylon – a proposal that was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pact.lk/2008/03/24/november-1948/ November 1948] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119132404/http://pact.lk/2008/03/24/november-1948/ |date=2009-01-19 }}, Peace and Conflict Timeline&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second World War]] served as an interregnum where the adroit politics of [[D.

Senanayake]]'s moderate,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Western-oriented, [[United National Party]] Government. This Government pass the [[Ceylon Citizenship Act]] of 1948, which denied citizenship to Sri Lankans of [[Hill Country Tamils|Indian origin]] and resulted in Sri Lanka becoming a [[majoritanian state]].  Sri Lanka's government represented only the majority community, the [[Sinhalese community]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and had [[marginalized]] the minorities, causing a "severe degree of alienation" among the minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Cheran]] (April 2009) ''[http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=3555 Roots of Sri Lankan conflict]'' at ''[[The Real News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When this Act was passed, the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress|Tamil Congress]] was strongly criticized by the opposition [[Marxist]] groups and the newly formed [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist]] [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal Party]] (FP). [[S. J. V. Chelvanayakam]], the leader of this new party, contested the citizenship act before the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]], and then in the [[Privy council]] in [[England]], on grounds of discrimination towards minorities, but he did not prevail in overturning it. The FP took two seats in the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1952|1952 election]], against the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress|Tamil Congress']] four, but in the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1956|1956 election]] it became the dominant party in the Tamil districts and remained so for two decades. The FP's came to be known for its uncompromising stand on Tamil rights.&lt;ref name=cstudy2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/25.htm |publisher= |title=Tamil Politics.|accessdate=2008-05-08 |work=Russell R. Ross
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the [[Sinhala Only Act|parliamentary act that made Sinhala the sole official language]] in 1956, Federal [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] staged a [[Nonviolent resistance|non violent]] sit in (''[[satyagraha]]'') protest, but it was broken up by a nationalist mob. The police and other state authorities present at the location failed to take action to stop the violence.  The FP was cast as [[scapegoats]] and were briefly banned after the [[Sri Lankan riots of 1958|1958 riots]] in which many were killed and thousands of Tamils forced to flee their homes.

Another point of conflict between the communities was [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state sponsored colonization schemes]] that had the effect of changing the demographic balance in the Eastern province in favor of majority Sinhalese that the Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland. It has been perhaps the most immediate cause of [[Riots and pogroms in Sri Lanka|inter-communal violence]].&lt;ref name=cstudy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/71.htm|publisher=|title=Tamil Alienation.|accessdate=2008-05-08 |work=Russell R. Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s importing [[Banning of Tamil-language media importation|Tamil-language films, books, magazines, journals]], etc. from the cultural hub of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] was banned. Sri Lanka also banned local groups affiliated with groups such as the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) and the [[Tamil Youth League]]. Foreign exchange for the long established practice of Tamil students going to India for university education was stopped.  Equally, examinations for external degrees from the [[University of London]] were abolished. This had the effect of culturally cutting off the links between Tamil Sri Lankans and Tamils from India. The then government insisted that these measures were part of a general program of economic self-sufficiency as part of its [[socialist]] agenda and not targeted against the Tamil minority.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1973 the [[policy of standardization]] was implemented by the Sri Lankan government  to what they believed was to rectify disparities created in university enrollment in Sri Lanka under [[British Ceylon|British colonial rule]]. It was in essence an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. The resultant benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant fall in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student populace.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'&gt;{{cite book  | last =Jayasuriya  | first =J.E. | title =Education in the Third World  | publisher =Indian Institute of Education  | year =1981  | location =[[Pune]]  | oclc =  7925123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Federal Party decided to demand for a [[Tamil Eelam|separate state]]. To further their nationalistic cause they merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF) in 1975. On 1976, after the first National convention of the Tamil United Liberation Front, the Ceylon Tamils moved towards a morphed nationalism which meant that they were now unwilling to live within a confined single island entity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.J. ''Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism: Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', pp. 101–110&lt;/ref&gt; Chelvanayakam and the Federal Party had always campaigned for a unitary country and thought that partitioning of the country would be “suicidal” up until 1973. However policies by the various governments that was considered to be discriminatory by Tamil leadership&lt;ref name=cstudy/&gt; modified the stand to Tamil Nationalism.

==Rise of militancy==
{{Main|Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|List of Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups}}{{See also|Human rights in Sri Lanka|Allegations of State terrorism by Sri Lanka}}[[File:LTTE car with soldiers in Killinochi april 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Tamil rebels in a  truck in [[Killinochchi]] in 2004]]
Since 1948 when Sri Lanka became independent, successive governments have adopted policies that had the effect of net preference to the majority [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] at the expense of the minority [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s.&lt;ref name=cstudy3&gt;{{cite web|url = http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/72.htm|publisher= |title= Tamil Militant Groups.|accessdate=2008-05-08 |work= Russell R. Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments adopted these policies in order to assist the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment. But these policies severely curtailed the middle class Tamil youth, who found it more difficult during the 1970s and 1980s to enter a university or secure employment. These individuals belonging to this younger generation, often referred to by other Tamils as "the boys" (''Podiyan'' in [[Tamil language]]) formed many militant organizations.&lt;ref name=cstudy3/&gt; The most important contributor to the strength of the militant groups was the [[Black July]]  pogrom which was perceived have been an organized event in which over 1000 Sri Lankan Tamil civilians were killed  prompting many youth to prefer the armed path of resistance.&lt;ref name=cstudy3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Marschall  | first = Wolfgang  | title = Social Change Among Sri Lankan Tamil Refugees in Switzerland | year = 2003  | url = http://www.research.unibe.ch/abstracts/A_66584590.html  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-12-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205014602/http://www.research.unibe.ch/abstracts/A_66584590.html |archivedate = 2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1987, they had fought not only the Sri Lankan security forces but also the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]]. They also fought among each other, as well, with equal if not greater brutality. The main group: [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), a rebel group, decimated most of the others. They represented intergenerational tensions as well as [[caste]] and ideological differences. Except the LTTE, many of the remaining organizations have morphed into minor political parties within the [[Tamil National Alliance]] or as standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name=cstudy3/&gt;

==Denial of citizenship to Indian Tamils==
{{Main|Ceylon Citizenship Act}}
There is a sizable population of Tamils in the Central Province, plantation laborers brought down from [[India]] by the British colonial authorities in the 19th and 20th centuries. These [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] (or Estate Tamils), as they are called, still work mainly in Sri Lanka’s [[tea]] plantations. They have been locked in poverty for generations and continue to experience poor living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/highlights/story/2007/01/070124_indian_tamils.shtml|title=BBCSinhala.com|author=|date=|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they speak dialects of the same language, they are usually considered a separate community from the Sri Lankan Tamils of the North and East.

The government of [[D.S. Senanayake]] passed legislation stripping the estate Tamils of their citizenship in 1949, leaving them [[Stateless nation|stateless]].

The effect was to tilt the island's political balance away from the Tamils.  In 1948, at independence, the Tamils had 33% of the voting power in Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Upon the disenfranchisement of the estate Tamils, however, this proportion dropped to 20%. The Sinhalese could and did obtain more than a 2/3 majority in Parliament, making it impossible for Tamils to exercise an effective opposition to Sinhalese policies affecting them. The main reason for the imbalance was that several multi-member constituencies elected a Tamil member of Parliament in a majority Sinhala electorate. The idea in having multi-member constituencies was to prevent domination of minorities by a future nationalist government.

Not content with stripping their citizenship, successive governments tried to remove the estate Tamils from the country entirely.  In 1964, Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] signed an agreement with Indian Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|L.B. Shastri]].  A second agreement was signed three years later with [[Indira Gandhi]]. These provided that 600,000 of the estate Tamils would be expelled and sent to India over a 15-year period, and 375,000 would be restored their Sri Lankan citizenship.  Not all of the former group actually returned to India, and remained in Sri Lanka without the ability to vote, travel abroad, or participate fully in Sri Lankan life.  It was not until 2003 that full citizenship rights were restored to the remaining Tamils in the hill country.

The detailed reports of the Kandyan Peasantry commission (1947), the Buddhist commission (1956), as well as statistics of preponderant admissions of Tamil speaking students to the university provided a basis for these Sinhala activists who ensured [[S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]] won a landslide victory in 1956, campaigning on a strong Sinhala nationalist platform.

Ethnic conflict was aggravated by the [[Sinhala Official Language Act]] of 1956.  General consensus existed that English should be replaced as the country's official language.  In the Act, the Sri Lankan government replaced English with Sinhala which deprived the Tamils of their right to deal with government institutions in their language as well as limited their opportunity to join government service. By 1956 approximately 75% of the population maintained fluency in the Sinhala language, approximately 15% were proficient in Tamil and the remaining ethnic groups spoke mainly English including the Burghers and Muslims. Multi-linguism was not common-spread, although many Sri Lankans had knowledge of at least two of the three main languages.

The [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP) government led by [[Solomon Bandaranaike]] was sworn into office on a platform that of helping the growing population of unemployed youth who were disenfranchised by the Sinhala Official Language policy. A majority of civil servants under colonial rule were Tamil whose positions benefited from free English-medium missionary schools in the north and east of the island.   The Tamil [[Federal Party of Sri Lanka|Federal Party]] led a group of Tamil volunteers and staged a sit-down ''[[satyagraha]]'' (peaceful protest).

The Sinhala Official Language policy was gradually weakened by all subsequent governments and in 1987 Tamil was made an official language of Sri Lanka,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us-english.org/foundation/research/olp/viewResearch.asp?CID=30&amp;TID=3&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Sinhala. English has remained the [[de facto]] language of governance; government activity continues to be carried out in English, including the drafting of legislation.

==1958 riots==
{{Main|Sri Lankan riots of 1958}}
In the [[Sri Lankan riots of 1958|1958 riots]], 150–200 Tamils were killed, thousands more were assaulted and Tamil property looted. Over 25,000 Tamil refugees were relocated to the North.

==1970 – Banning of Tamil media and literature importation==
Importing Tamil-language films, books, magazines, journals, etc. from the cultural hub of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] was banned. Sri Lanka also banned groups such as the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] and the Tamil Youth League. Culturally, Tamil Sri Lankans were cut off from Tamil Nadu. Foreign exchange for the long established practice of Tamil students going to India for university education was stopped.  Equally, examinations for external degrees from the [[University of London]] were abolished.  The government insisted this was a part of a general program of economic self-sufficiency, part of its [[socialist]] agenda, however most of the Tamil population did not accept nor believe this.

The banning of [[Tamil language]] media importation by the government of Sri Lanka in 1970 was perceived by some [[minority group|minority]] [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] politicians as directed against their cultural survival. Importing [[Tamil language]] films, books, magazines, journals from Tamil Nadu, India were banned.

Sri Lanka also proscribed the local branch of DMK and the [[Tamil Youth League]]. Culturally, the minority Sri Lankan Tamil people felt cut off from [[Tamil Nadu]]. But some argue that it led to native [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] literature and media to thrive without competition from India.

==1971 – Universities Act==
{{Main| Policy of standardization}}
During the 1970s university admissions were standardized. This initiative took place to rectify disparities created in university enrollment during colonial rule.

Under the [[British India|British]], English was the state language and consequently greatly benefited English speakers. However, the majority of the Sri Lankan populace lived outside urban areas and did not belong to the social elite, and therefore did not enjoy the benefits of English-medium education. The issue was compounded further by the fact that in northern and eastern regions of the island, where a largely Tamil speaking populace resided, students had access to English-medium education through missionary schools regardless of their socio-economic status. This created a situation where the large proportion of students enrolled in universities were English speaking Tamils, particularly in professional courses such as [[medicine]] and [[engineering]].

The government [[policy of standardization]] in essence was an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. The benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant fall in the number of Tamil students within the university population.

==Rise of separatism==
At first, Tamil politicians pushed for a federal system through the [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal Party]].  This was met with suspicion and resistance from many Sinhalese.  In the 1960s, the government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] proceeded to nationalize most missionary schools in the country, secularizing them and changing the language of instruction from English to Sinhala only.  After this, it became rare for Sinhalese and Tamil children to attend school together.  Unable to speak Sinhalese, it became increasingly difficult for Tamil youth to gain access to civil service jobs or attend universities, and unemployment rose.

The name of the country was changed from Ceylon to Sri Lanka in 1970, a name of [[Sanskrit]] origin that angered and alienated many Tamils.

The concept of a separate nation, [[Tamil Eelam]], was proposed by the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF) in 1976 . TULF was a coalition of parties who went on to campaign in the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1977|1977 elections]] for an independent state for Tamils in Sri Lanka. They won most of the Tamil seats, but the government later banned them from Parliament for advocating an independent state.

==1981 – Destruction of the Jaffna Public Library==
{{Main|Burning of Jaffna library}}

The '''Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] held within the city of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. The festival, organised by AKA Balloon Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian private limited firm, takes place every February at the city's Polo Ground.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mypenang.gov.my/events/all-events/103/|title=myPenang|website=mypenang.gov.my|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://penanghotairballoonfiesta.com/|title=Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta 2016|last=Tourism|first=Penang Global|work=Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta 2016|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inaugurated in 2015, the two-day Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta typically features 15 hot air balloons, with the participating crew coming from various nations such as [[Malaysia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/george-town/events/penang-hot-air-balloon-fiesta/a/poi-fes/1548146/357010|title=Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta in George Town, Malaysia|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2098537|title=More visitors expected for Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta next year|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlypenang.com/penang-attractions/penang-hot-air-balloon-fiesta-2016/|title=Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta 2016 - OnlyPenang.com|last=OnlyPenang|date=2016-01-24|work=OnlyPenang|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous edition of the festival in 2017 attracted as many as 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt;

'''Perfect crime''' is a colloquial term used in law and fiction (especially [[crime fiction]]) to characterize [[crime]]s that are undetected, unattributed to an identifiable [[perpetrator]], or otherwise unsolved or unsolvable as a kind of technical achievement on the part of the perpetrator.  In certain contexts, the concept of perfect crime is limited to just undetected crimes; if an event is ever identified as a crime, some [[Detective|investigators]] say it cannot be called "perfect".&lt;ref name=Timmermans&gt;Timmermans, Stefan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kg6QLlIaI04C&amp;pg=PA157 ''Postmortem: how medical examiners explain suspicious deaths''], University of Chicago Press, 2006, p. 157. {{ISBN|0-226-80398-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A perfect crime should be distinguished from one that has merely not been solved yet or where everyday chance or [[legal procedure|procedural matters]] frustrate a [[conviction]]. There is an element that the crime is (or appears likely to be) ''unable'' to be solved.

== Overview ==

As used by some criminologists and others who study criminal investigations (including mystery writers), a perfect crime goes unsolved not because of incompetence in the investigation, but because of the cleverness and skill of the criminal.&lt;ref name="Murder By The Bay"&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Francis
 | first =Charles
 | publisher=Quill Driver Books
 | title=Murder By The Bay: Historic Homicide in and about the City of San Francisco
 | page= 162; 2005; {{ISBN|1-884995-46-2}}
 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Lfw1vdIQ51oC&amp;dq=criminology+%22perfect+crime%22
 | accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the defining factor is the primary causative influence of the criminal's ability to avoid investigation and reprisal, and not so much the ability of the investigating authority to perform its duties.

Would-be perfect crimes are a popular subject in [[crime fiction]] and [[movies]]. They include ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'', ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]''.

==Varying definitions==

A murder committed by somebody who had never before met the victim, has no criminal record, steals nothing, and tells no one might be a perfect crime. According to criminologists and scientists, this casual definition of perfect crime exists. Another possibility is that a crime might be committed in an area of high public traffic, where DNA from a wide variety of people is present, making the sifting of evidence akin to 'finding a needle in a haystack'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = How to commit the perfect murder | episodelink =  | series = Horizon | serieslink = | airdate = 2007-05-08 | season = 2007 | number = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An intentional killing in which the death is never identified as murder is an example of one of the more rigorous definitions of perfect crime.&lt;ref name=Timmermans/&gt; Other criminologists narrow the range to only those crimes that are not detected at all.&lt;ref name=Vedder&gt;Vedder, Clyde Bennett. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wE_AAAAIAAJ ''Criminology: a book of readings''], Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1953, p. 44. "Detectives have said that they have never seen a perfect crime. This is because the only perfect crimes are those in which no one even suspects..."&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, it can never be known if such perfect crimes exist.&lt;ref name=Vedder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of criminal law, criminology and police science,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=CKwJAAAAIAAJ p. 141],  1962. Northwestern University School of Law, American Society of Criminology, Illinois Academy of Criminology, International Association of Arson Investigators, National District Attorneys Association, National Association of County and Prosecuting Attorneys, Society for the Advancement of Criminology, JSTOR, National Association of Defense Lawyers in Criminal Cases.&lt;/ref&gt; Many "close calls" have been observed, however—enough to make investigators aware of the possibility of a perfect crime.&lt;ref name=Vedder/&gt;

===Unprosecutable crime===
In 2005, Professor [[Brian C. Kalt]] of [[Michigan State University College of Law]] put forth an argument that the [[Vicinage Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] &amp;ndash; requiring jury selection from the population of the state and court district where the crime is committed &amp;ndash; may permit the commission of the "perfect crime" on the technical grounds that a jury trial could not be carried out. Since there are no residents in the portion of [[Yellowstone National Park]] that lies within the state of [[Idaho]], and since the entire park has been placed within the jurisdiction of the [[United States District Court for the District of Wyoming|Court for the District of Wyoming]], there are no residents available to form a jury for crimes committed in this specific "[[Venn diagram]]" location.&lt;ref name="kalt"&gt;Kalt, 2005, at 77&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real-life examples ==
&lt;!-- Don't add anything here without a reference that explicitly calls it out as a "perfect crime." --&gt;

In March 2009, a $6.8 million jewel theft in Germany was described as being close to a perfect crime, in that despite having [[DNA evidence]] (but no other evidence), the police were unable to bring the case to court since the DNA belonged to one of a pair of [[identical twins]], and faced with denials by both, it could not be proven which of the two was the criminal.&lt;ref name=DNATwins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1887111,00.html |title=Despite DNA Evidence, Twins Charged in Heist Go Free |last=Himmelreich |first=Claudia |date=2009-03-23 |publisher=Time |accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of one, or possibly both, identical twins avoiding punishment include juries unable to reach a verdict in a 2004 Boston rape trial, a 2005 Houston rape trial and a 2009 Malaysia drug-smuggling trial.&lt;ref name=DNATwins/&gt;

The '''Saint Silvester Road Race''' ({{lang-pt|Corrida Internacional de São Silvestre}}) is a long-distance running event, the oldest and most prestigious street race in [[Brazil]].

Regarded as the main international event in Latin American athletics, the Brazilian competition is held yearly in the city of [[São Paulo]] on December 31.  This day is [[Pope Silvester I|Saint Silvester]]'s Day, as it is the day in which the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] saint, who was a [[Pope]], died in the 4th century of the Christian Era.

São Paulo's race was originally known as a "marathon", although the course of the race, whose length has varied considerably over the years, was never that of a full marathon.  Because of that, the organization eventually dropped the term "marathon", starting to refer to the event as a "race", "international race" or "road race".  There was never an official effort on the part of the organization to address the change in the nomenclature, which causes many, including some media outlets,&lt;ref name="media"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.br/search?q=%22maratona+de+s%C3%A3o+silvestre%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N|title=Google search:media outlets still use the term "Saint Silvester Marathon"|publisher=Google.br|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to continue using the term "Saint Silvester Marathon" when referring to the event. Its course is only {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, less than half the length of a marathon but the race is made more difficult by the intense heat of the Brazilian summer and the geographical obstacles that have to be surmounted by the athletes.

Several other places like [[Amadora]], [[Porto]] and [[Volta à cidade do Funchal]] in [[Portugal]] (''Corrida de São Silvestre''&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://archive.is/20120730071053/http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1354342 Rui Silva e Sara Moreira vencem São Silvestre do Porto], [[Público (Portugal)|Público]] (December 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Calderara di Reno]] (''Maratona di San Silvestro''&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.lippomaratona.com/san_silvestro Maratona di San Silvestro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207133639/http://www.lippomaratona.com/san_silvestro |date=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Bolzano]] (''[[BOclassic]]'') in [[Italy]], and [[Madrid]] in [[Spain]] (''[[San Silvestre Vallecana]]''), organize yearly Saint Silvester road races or marathons every late December.

==History==

Cásper Líbero, a "media millionaire" of the early 20th century Brazil, is credited with originally coming up with the idea for the race.  He used it as a means of promoting his newspaper.  In 1928, the year of the race's 4th edition, he founded one of the first sports newspapers of the country,  the ''Gazeta Esportiva'' (the ''Sportive Gazette''), which then became the race's official organizer and sponsor.  The race would be the main advertising element of this sports newspaper.

The race was held for the first time on December 31, 1925 and has not been interrupted or suspended even once during its history, not even for the duration of World War II.

Originally, it was intended for men only, and participation was restricted to citizens of the city of São Paulo.  In the following years, runners from other parts of the country joined the race, but it was not until 1941 that a runner not from the city of São Paulo won the race: José Tibúrcio dos Santos, of [[Minas Gerais]], another Brazilian state.  At that time, the event was not yet open to foreign participation.  That meant that athletes from other countries could not come in to participate, but foreigners residing in the city of São Paulo (immigrants) were free to enroll.  Because of this, Italian Heitor Blasi was the only foreigner to have won the race before 1947.

In 1945 the field was opened so that foreign runners could participate.  The first international race was restricted to invited runners from South America, but the success of the first two "international events" led race organizers to open the event to the rest of the world in 1947.  That year marked the beginning of a 34-year-long period during which no Brazilian man won the event, until José João da Silva, from [[Pernambuco]], won in 1980 (he would repeat the feat in 1985).

The event would remain a men-only affair until 1975, when the [[United Nations]] declared that year as the ''International Year of Women''.  In commemoration of this, the race organizers held the women's race for the first time.  The women's race started as an open event, and the first Brazilian victory would come only in its 20th edition (in 1995), when Carmem Oliveira won.

Starting December 31, 1982, [[Rede Globo]] began to telecast the road race via satellite to the whole of Brazil, in partnership with [[TV Gazeta]].

Since 1993, a shorter race for children is held a few days before the main event (dubbed "São Silvestrinha", or "Little Saint Silvester" – a [[unisex]] event).

Until 1988, the race took place at the late night hour starting at 23:00, approaching the New Year's, but the year of 1989 - the year the race began to be recognized as an international running event - saw substantial changes in the race's format, in order to comply with the rules of the [[IAAF]].  The time of the race was altered for first afternoon (to 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. for women and 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. for men), the course direction was reversed, and men and women, who used to run together, had their races separated.  In 1991, the length of the race was extended to 15,000 meters (the distance for the event used to vary almost yearly, usually between 6.5&amp;nbsp;km and 8.8&amp;nbsp;km).  This variance needed to be corrected in order to meet IAAF marathon and road race regulations and requirements.

==Growth and prestige==

For the first race, in 1925, 60 people filled applications to participate, but only 48 actually showed up on the day of the race.  Of these, only 37 were officially qualified, since the rules then required that all runners had to finish within 3 minutes of the winner in order to qualify in the final board.

In 2004, 13,000 men and 2,000 women participated in their respective events.

Although the event had been open since 1945, it would become a noteworthy affair in the international calendar only in 1953, when the most famous runner of the time (and arguably of all time), [[Emil Zátopek]], participated and won the race.  In recent times, the foremost long distance runners of the last two decades (almost all of them, with the exception of [[Haile Gebrselassie]] of [[Ethiopia]]) have participated at least once in the event.

The principal winner of all times is now [[Paul Tergat]], of [[Kenya]], who has won the race 5 times (1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000).  He also holds the record time for the present distance of 15&amp;nbsp;km, having won his very first race in São Paulo with a time of 43 minutes and 12 seconds.

[[File:Signor Lipps.gif|thumb|As a result of the Signor-Lipps effect, the last fossil occurrences only approximate the extinction rate. This approximation is better the more fossils per time unit are preserved.]]
{{Paleontology}}
The '''Signor–Lipps effect''' is a [[paleontological]] principle proposed by [[Philip W. Signor]] and [[Jere H. Lipps]] which states that, since the [[fossil]] record of organisms is never complete, neither the first nor the last organism in a given [[taxon]] will be recorded as a fossil.&lt;ref&gt;Signor III, P. W. and Lipps, J. H. (1982) "[http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/190/291.full.pdf Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns, and catastrophes in the fossil record]", in ''Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the Earth'' (ed. L. T. Silver and P. H. Schultz), Geological Society of America Special Publication, vol. 190, pp. 291–296.&lt;/ref&gt; The Signor–Lipps effect is often applied specifically to cases of the youngest known fossils of a taxon failing to represent the last appearance of an organism. The inverse, regarding the oldest known fossils failing to represent the first appearance of a taxon, is alternatively called the '''Jaanusson effect''' after researcher [[Valdar Jaanusson]], or the '''Sppil–Rongis effect''' (''Signor–Lipps'' spelled backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heads|first1=M.|title=Bayesian transmogrification of clade divergence dates: a critique|journal=[[Journal of Biogeography]]|date=2012|volume=39|pages=1749–1756|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02784.x|url=http://johngrehan.net/files/2613/6414/0679/Heads_2012_Bayesian_divergence.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fossil record gaps - delicate and soft-bodied animals.svg|thumb|left|The sporadic nature of the fossil record is reflected in huge gaps spanning a number of epochs]]
One famous example is the [[coelacanth]], which was thought to have become extinct in the very late [[Cretaceous]] – until a live specimen was caught in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jewett|first=S. L.|date=11 November 1998|title= On the Trail of the Coelacanth, a Living Fossil|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/horizon/nov98/fishstory.htm|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animals known as "[[Burgess Shale type fauna]]" are best known from rocks of the Early and Middle [[Cambrian]] periods. Since 2006, though, a few fossils of similar animals have been found in rocks from the [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], and Early [[Devonian]] periods, in other words up to 100&amp;nbsp;million years after the Burgess Shale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kühl|first=G.|author2=Briggs, D. E. G. |author3=Rust, J. |date=February 2009

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17646139"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Siveter D. J., Fortey R. A., Sutton M. D., Briggs D. E., Siveter D. J. |title=A Silurian 'marrellomorph' arthropod |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=274 |issue=1623 |pages=2223–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17646139 |pmc=2287322 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0712 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burgess Shale type preservation|particular way]] in which such animals have been fossilized may depend on types of ocean chemistry that were present for limited periods of time.&lt;ref name="Butterfield1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butterfield|first=N. J.|title=Secular distribution of Burgess-Shale-type preservation |year=1995 |journal=Lethaia|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1995.tb01587.x 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

But the Signor–Lipps effect is more important for the difficulties it raises in paleontology:
*It makes it very difficult to be confident about the timing and speed of [[mass extinction]]s, and this makes it difficult to test theories about the causes of mass extinctions. For example, the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s was long thought to be a gradual process, but evidence collected since the late 1980s suggests it was abrupt, which is consistent with the idea that an [[Chicxulub Crater|asteroid impact]] caused it.
*The uncertainty about when a taxon first appeared makes it difficult to be confident about the ancestry of specific [[genus|genera]]. For example,  if the earliest known fossil of genus X is much earlier than the earliest known fossil of genus Y and genus Y has all the features of genus X plus a few of its own, it is natural to suppose that X is an ancestor of Y. But this hypothesis could be called into question at any time by the finding of a fossil of Y that is earlier than any known fossil of X – unless an even older fossil of genus X is found, and so on.

The '''Teatro Novissimo''' was a theatre in Venice located in the [[Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] with its entrance on the Calle de Mendicanti. It was the first theatre built in Venice specifically for the performance of opera. Because it was purpose-built, it had a wider stage than its existing competitors which allowed for the elaborate productions which became the Novissimo's hallmark. The theatre opened in the Carnival season of 1641 with the premiere of Sacrati's opera ''[[La finta pazza]]''. After its last production in 1645, the theatre was closed amidst mounting debts and was demolished in 1647.&lt;ref name = "Rosand"&gt;Rosand, Ellen (1990).

==History==

Public commercial opera had begun in Venice in 1637. By the time the Teatro Novissimo was conceived and planned three years later, there were already three theatres staging operas in the city, [[Teatro San Cassiano]], [[Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo]], and [[Teatro San Moisè]]. The Novissimo (the word means "Newest" in English) would be unique in that it was purpose-built for staging opera and, unlike the other three, was built and owned by a consortium rather than a single noble family.{{efn|The [[Teatro San Cassiano|San Cassiano]] was built and owned by the [[Tron family]], the [[Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] by the [[Grimani family]], and the [[Teatro San Moisè|San Moisè]] by the [[Giustiniani|Giustiniani family]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B. (1994). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;pg=PA114 ''Italian Opera'']. p. 114. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521466431}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The consortium consisted of the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]  Luigi Michiel and members of the [[Accademia degli Incogniti]] who included the librettists [[Giulio Strozzi]], [[Giacomo Badoaro]], and [[Giovanni Francesco Busenello]].&lt;ref name = "Rosand" /&gt;

On 30 May 1640 the consortium signed a contract with the Dominican friars of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] allowing them to construct and operate a theatre on land adjacent to the monastery which at the time was occupied by a large shed. The contract stipulated that the new theatre would be only used for the performances of "heroic" operas, not comedies. Girolamo Lappoli, a businessman from Arezzo, was also involved in the project as the theatre's [[impresario]] and later claimed to have "built" the theatre. By October 1640, the composer [[Francesco Sacrati]] and the stage designer and architect [[Giacomo Torelli]] had joined the project along with the Venetian noblemen Gerolamo Landò, Giacomo Marcello, and Giacomo da Mosto who provided further financing. Torelli would not only create the sets and stage machinery, but also design the theatre itself. The stage, almost 11 [[metre]]s wide, was able to accommodate Torelli's complex stage sets and machinery which would characterise the theatre's productions.&lt;ref name = "Glixon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schwager" /&gt;
[[File:Teatro Novissimo, set design by Giacomo Torelli, 1644.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|One of [[Giacomo Torelli|Torelli]]'s set designs for the Teatro Novissimo depicting the City of Venice]]
The Teatro Novissimo was inaugurated in the Carnival season of 1641 with the premiere of ''[[La finta pazza]]'' composed by Francesco Sacrati to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi  with elaborate stage machinery by Giacomo Torelli. According to [[Ellen Rosand]], it "became the first and possibly the greatest operatic 'hit' of the century". Unusually for the time, the complete libretto was published prior to the opening night, and the performances were also advertised through the writings of various members of the Incogniti. The libretto itself contained paeans to the opera's star singer [[Anna Renzi]] and the "magical effects" of its stage designs.&lt;ref name = "Rosand" /&gt; 

Following the run of ''La finta pazza'' a 55-page book, ''Cannocchiale per la finta pazza'', written  by another Incognito, Maiolino Bisaccioni, gave a detailed account of  the opera's visual effects. The "cannocchiale" ("telescope") of the title refers to the book's stated purpose of providing a description of the visual effects not only for those who had been unable to attend, but also for those who had been seated far from the stage, implying that the Novissimo was probably a fairly large theatre. According to Rosand, the book also explicitly asserted for the first time the relationship between opera itself and "the miraculous city of Venice". The theme was continued in Bisaccioni's ''Apparati scenici per lo Teatro Novissimo di Venetia''. Printed in 1644, the text was illustrated with plates showing Torelli's set designs for the theatre's 1643 production of Sacrati's ''Venere gelosa'' and the 1644 production of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]]'s ''Deidemia''.&lt;ref name = "Rosand" /&gt;

The 1645 season, which saw the premiere of [[Giovanni Rovetta|Rovetta]]'s ''Ercole in Lidia'', proved to be the theatre's last.{{efn|For [[John Evelyn]]'s description of the 1645 production of ''Ercole in Lidia'', the music for which is now lost, see Carter, Tim (2005). {{URL|1=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mHJvKVq0vXoC&amp;pg=PA246|2=''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Music''}}, Vol. 1, p. 246. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521792738}}}} Debts had continued to mount and the friars were pressing for the return of their land. Girolamo Lappoli ceded the theatre to Maiolino Bisaccioni in May of that year. Several investors plus Giacomo Torelli, Paulo Morandi (the theatre's costume designer), and four singers, including Anna Renzi, sued Lappoli for unpaid debts and wages in the summer of 1645. The following year, Lappoli left Venice with his debts unpaid. The friars re-possessed the theatre and had it demolished in October 1647. In 1648 an equestrian school and stables were constructed on the site.&lt;ref name = "Glixon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claut, Anna (2014).

'''Tenochtitlan''' ({{lang-es|'''Tenochtitlan'''}}), originally known as '''México-Tenochtitlán''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Mēxihco-Tenōchtitlan|meːˈʃíʔ.ko te.noːt͡ʃ.ˈtí.t͡ɬan}}, {{IPA-es|ˈmexiko tenotʃˈtitlan|-|Mexico Tenochtitlan.ogg}}), was a large [[Mexica]] [[city-state]] in what is now the center of [[Mexico City]]. Founded on June 20, 1325, the city was built on an island in what was then [[Lake Texcoco]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The city was the capital of the expanding [[Aztec Empire]] in the 15th century&lt;ref name="tenochtitlan capital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenochtitlán, la capital azteca |url=http://www.historiang.com/articulo.jsp?id=1606479 |publisher=''www.historiang.com'' |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322114848/http://www.historiang.com/articulo.jsp?id=1606479 |archivedate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until it was [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|captured by the Spanish in 1521]].

At its peak, it was the largest [[city-state|city]] in the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]]. It subsequently became a ''[[Municipalities of Mexico|cabecera]]'' of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]].  Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center of the Mexican capital]].

Tenochtitlan was one of two [[Mexica]] ''[[altepetl|āltēpetl]]'' (city-states) on the island, the other being [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].

== Etymology ==

Traditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from [[Nahuatl]] {{wikt-lang|nci|tetl}} {{IPA-nah|ˈtetɬ|}} ("rock") and {{wikt-lang|nci|nōchtli}} {{IPA-nah|ˈnoːtʃtɬi|}} ("[[opuntia|prickly pear]]") and is often thought to mean, "Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as "the Bancroft dialogues" suggest the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Karttunen]] (1983) ''An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl'' p.225, Texas linguistic series, University of Texas, Austin {{ISBN|978-0-2927-0365-0}}; {{oclc|230535203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The western side of the shallow [[Lake Texcoco]]. {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}} is the southern part of the main island (under the red line). The northern part is {{lang|nci|[[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]]|italic=no}}.]]

{{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}} covered an estimated {{convert|8|to|13.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, situated on the western side of the shallow [[Lake Texcoco]].

At the time of Spanish conquests, Mexico City comprised both {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}} and {{lang|nci|[[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]]|italic=no}}. The city extended from north to south, from the north border of {{lang|nci|Tlatelolco|italic=no}} to the [[swamp]]s, which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west; the city ended more or less at the present location of {{lang|es|[[Avenida Bucareli]]|italic=no}}.

The city was connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways leading to the north, south, and west. The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely. The bridges could be pulled away, if necessary, to defend the city. The city was interlaced with a series of [[canal]]s, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via [[canoe]].

Lake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes. Since it formed in an [[endorheic basin]], Lake {{lang|nci|Texcoco|italic=no}} was [[brackish]]. During the reign of [[Moctezuma I]], the "[[levee]] of {{lang|nci|Nezahualcoyotl|italic=no}}" was constructed, reputedly designed by {{lang|nci|[[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]|italic=no}}. Estimated to be {{convert|12|to|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, the levee was completed circa 1453. The levee kept fresh [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]-fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike, to the east.

Two double [[chapultepec aqueduct|aqueducts]], each more than {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and made of [[terracotta]],&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the city with fresh water from the springs at {{lang|nci|[[Chapultepec]]|italic=no}}. This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing. For drinking, water from mountain springs was preferred. Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day; {{lang|nah|Moctezuma|italic=no}} was said to take four baths a day. According to the context of Aztec culture in literature, the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called {{lang|nci|copalxocotl}} (''[[Saponaria]] americana''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook to life in the Aztec world |last=Aguilar-Moreno |first=Manuel |year=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |location= |isbn=978-0-8160-5673-6 |page=368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iT5cww4rQdoC&amp;pg=PA368 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This species is only mentioned in the context of Aztec culture in literature, probably not accurate. --&gt; and to clean their clothes they used the root of {{lang|nci|metl}} (''[[Agave americana]]''). Also, the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a {{lang|nci|[[temazcal|temāzcalli]]}}, similar to a [[sauna]] bath, which is still used in the south of Mexico. This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures.

==City plans==
{{bquote| When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about.|[[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]|''The Conquest of New Spain''&lt;ref&gt;Bernal Diaz Del Castillo, "The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico 1517 1521", Edited by Genaro Garcia, Translated with an Introduction and Notes?, pp. 269–, A. P. Maudslay, first pub 1928 [https://archive.org/stream/bernaldiazdelcas002605mbp/bernaldiazdelcas002605mbp_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The city was divided into four zones, or ''camps''; each ''camp'' was divided into 20 districts (''[[calpulli]]s'', [[Nahuatl]] ''calpōlli''); and each ''calpulli'', or 'big house', was crossed by streets or ''tlaxilcalli''. There were three main streets that crossed the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Ixtapalpa, and Tlacopan.&lt;ref name="Coe, M. 2008, p. 193"&gt;Coe, M. 2008, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] reported that they were wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees.&lt;ref name="Walker, C. 1980, p. 162"&gt;Walker, C. 1980, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''calpullis'' were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night.

The earliest European images of the city were [[woodcut]]s published in [[Augsburg]] around 1522.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Newspaper About the Country that the Spaniards Found in 1521, Called Yucatan | work = World Digital Library | accessdate = 2014-06-22 | date = 2011-10-17
| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketplaces===
[[File:Tlatelolco Marketplace.JPG|thumb|300px|The Tlatelolco Marketplace as depicted at [[The Field Museum]], Chicago]]

Each ''calpulli'' (from Classical Nahuatl ''calpōlli'', Nahuatl pronunciation: [kaɬˈpoːlːi], meaning "large house") had its own ''tiyanquiztli'' (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] – Tenochtitlan's sister city. Cortés estimated it was twice the size of the city of [[Salamanca]] with about 60,000 people trading daily. [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] provides a more conservative population estimate of 20,000 on ordinary days and 40,000 on feast days. There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities.

===Public buildings===
[[Image:Reconstruction of Tenochtitlan2006.jpg|thumb|300px|A picture of Tenochtitlan and a model of the [[Templo Mayor]]]]

In the center of the city were the public buildings, temples, and palaces. Inside a walled square, 500 meters to a side, was the ceremonial center. There were about 45 public buildings, including: the [[Templo Mayor]], which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity [[Huitzilopochtli]] and the Rain God [[Tlaloc]]; the temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]]; the ''[[Mesoamerican ballgame#Aztec|tlachtli]]'' ([[Mesoamerican ballgame|ball game]] court) with the ''[[tzompantli]]'' or rack of skulls; the Sun Temple, which was dedicated to Tonatiuh; the Eagle's House, which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers; the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice; and some minor temples.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, M. 2008, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside was the palace of Moctezuma with 100 rooms, each with its own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the ''cuicalli'', or house of the songs, and the ''[[calmecac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city had great symmetry. All constructions had to be approved by the ''calmimilocatl'', a functionary in charge of the city planning.

===Palaces of Montezuma II===
The palace of [[Montezuma II]] also had two houses or [[zoo]]s, one for [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] and another for other [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[mammal]]s. About 300 people were dedicated to the care of the animals.

There was also a [[botanical garden]] and an [[aquarium]]. The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water, containing various fish and aquatic birds. Places like this also existed in [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], [[Chapultepec]], Huaxtepec (now called [[Oaxtepec]]), and [[Texcotzingo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social classes==
Tenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification.  The complex system involved many social classes. The ''macehualtin'' were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan. The ''pipiltin'' were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders, and lived in the confines of the island.  ''Cuauhipiltin'', or eagle nobles, were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess, and were treated as nobles.&lt;ref name="Coe, M. 2008, p. 193"/&gt; ''Teteuctin'' were the highest class, rulers of various parts of the empire, including the king. ''Tlacohtin'' were individuals who chose to enslave themselves to pay back a debt; they were not slaves forever and were not treated as badly as typical slaves seen in other ancient civilizations worldwide. Finally, the ''pochteca'' were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading.  The membership of this class was based on heredity.  ''Pochteca'' could become very rich because they did not pay taxes, but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of [[Xocotl Huetzi]] from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions.

Status was displayed by location and type of house where a person lived.  Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch. People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs.&lt;ref name="Coe, M. 2008, p. 193"/&gt; The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs. They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court.  The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city.

Adding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the ''calpolli''. ''Calpolli'', meaning ‘big house’ is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners.  Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, M. 2008, pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Statue of Foundation of Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[Mexico City]] statue commemorating the foundation of Tenochtitlan]]
Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the [[Mexica]] people, founded in 1325. The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy: the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a ([[Opuntia]]) cactus.

The Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, a vision that is now immortalized in [[Coat of arms of Mexico|Mexico's coat of arms]] and on the [[Mexican flag]]. Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain, they set about building their city, using the ''[[chinampa]]'' system (misnamed as "floating gardens") for agriculture and to dry and expand the island.

A thriving culture developed, and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in [[Mesoamerica]]. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[Pacific Ocean]] and perhaps even the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. A Very Short History of the World, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After a flood of [[Lake Texcoco]], the city was rebuilt under the rule of [[Ahuitzotl]] in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica.

Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. With an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000, many{{Who|date=September 2014}} scholars believe Tenochtitlan to have been among the largest cities in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conquistador: Hernán Cortés, King Montezuma, and the Last Stand of the Aztecs |last=Levy |first=Buddy |year=2008 |publisher=Bantam Books |location= |isbn=978-0553384710 |page=106 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the cities of Europe, only [[Paris]], [[Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] might have rivaled it. It was five times the size of the [[London]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name="Coe, M. 2008, p. 193"/&gt; In a letter to the Spanish king, Cortés wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as [[Seville]] or [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]. Cortes' men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Latin American urbanization |last=Butterworth |first=Douglas |last2=Chance |first2=John K. |year=1981 |publisher=CUP Archive |location= |isbn=978-0-521-28175-1 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wA4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some popular sources put the number as high as 350,000,&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, D. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; the most common estimates of the population are of over 200,000 people. One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of 212,500 living on {{convert|13.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2005), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that at one time, Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods.&lt;ref name="Walker, C. 1980, p. 162"/&gt;

===Conquest era===
{{Further|Fall of Tenochtitlan}}

[[File:The Conquest of Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|400px|The Conquest of Tenochtitlan]]
When Cortés and his men arrived in Tenochtitlan, [[Moctezuma II]], who precariously ruled over a large empire, chose to welcome Cortés as an honored guest, rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people. Moctezuma may have feared that Cortés was the returning god [[Quetzalcoatl]], because the Spanish arrival coincided with the close of an Aztec calendar cycle consistent with such a return. This claim is found in the Florentine Codex, among other early sources, and accepted as true in many later histories. However, some scholars doubt it.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Camilla.  "Burying the White Gods: New Perspectives on the Conquest of Mexico," American Historical Review (June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Cortés approached Tenochtitlan, the natives celebrated [[Toxcatl]]. At this event the most prominent warriors of [[altepetl]]{{clarify|date=December 2017}} would dance in front of a huge statue of [[Huitzilopochtli]]. The Spanish leader, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], who was left in charge, worried that the natives  planned a surprise attack. He captured three natives and tortured them until they said that this{{clarify|date=February 2018}} was indeed true. There was no proof, however, but Alvarado decided to attack first. During the festival, the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit from the courtyard so that no one would escape. This happened during their last days in Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Camilla. 2006. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobles lined each side of the city's main causeway, which extended about a league.  Walking down the center came Moctezuma II, with two lords at his side, one his brother, the ruler of [[Iztapalapa]]. Cortés dismounted and was greeted by the ruler and his lords, but forbidden to touch him. Cortés gave him a necklace of crystals, placing it over his neck.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p.  69.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city. Once they were settled, Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Cortés. The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature.  Although the Spaniards were seeking gold, Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort, but all of it was to be given to Cortés if he desired it.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since arriving in Tenochtitlan, Cortés faced early trouble.  Leaving a post in [[Veracruz|Vera Cruz]], the officer left in charge received a letter from [[Qualpopoca]], the leader of [[Almería]], asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards. He requested that officials be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission. To reach the province, the officers would have to travel through hostile land. The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they arrived, they were captured and two were killed, the other two escaping through the woods. Upon their return to Vera Cruz, the officer in charge was infuriated, and led troops to storm Almería. Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who ordered the officers executed.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, Hernan. 1520, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Tenochtitlan, Cortés detained Moctezuma and questioned him.&lt;ref&gt;Cortés, H. 1520, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Though no serious conclusions were reached, this started the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards on a bad note.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, D. 1992, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortés subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for 75 days, causing a famine;&lt;ref name="Walker, C. 1980, p. 162"/&gt; directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city;&lt;ref&gt;"The Colonial Spanish-American City: Urban Life in the Age of Atlantic Capitalism", [[Jay Kinsbruner]], University of Texas Press, 2005, p. 20, {{ISBN|0-292-70668-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began its rebuilding, despite opposition, with a central area designated for Spanish use (the ''traza''). The outer Indian section, now dubbed ''San Juan Tenochtitlan'', continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, D. 1992, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; While the people of Tenochtitlan were celebrating the few Spaniards who were not able to escape and were killed, the city was in great ruins.{{clarify|date=January 2018}}

The people of Tenochtitlan were exposed to diseases. Someone who was exposed would not feel it for the first ten days, then the disease would spread throughout the body, causing many sores, pain in the body and high fever. People were weak to the point that they could not move, nor  obtain food and water. They couldn't cook or bury the remaining dead bodies from the conquest. The population of the people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken. The death toll rose steadily over the course of the next 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Camilla. 2006, 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=January 2018}}

{{Main|History of Mexico City}}
Cortés founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. Despite the extensive damage to the built environment, the site retained symbolic power and legitimacy as the capital of the Aztec empire, which Cortés sought to appropriate. For a time this {{lang|es|ciudad de españoles}}, the highest rank in the Spanish hierarchy of settlement designation, was called Mexico–Tenochtitlan. [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]] devotes the final chapter of his classic work, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', to what he called "The City,"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; with later historians building on his work.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Munday, ''The Death of Aztec Tenochtitlan, the Life of Mexico City''. Austin: University of Texas Press 2016. {{ISBN| 978-1477317136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards established a {{lang|es|[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]}} or town council, which had jurisdiction over the Spanish residents. The Spanish established a Europeans-only zone in the center of the city, an area of 13 blocks in each direction of the central plaza, which was the {{lang|es|traza}}.  Although many native residents died during the siege of Tenochtitlan, the indigenous still had a strong presence in the city, and were settled in two main areas of the island, designated San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, each with a municipal council that functioned the entire colonial period. San Juan Tenochtitlan was a Spanish administrative creation, which amalgamated four indigenous sections, with each losing territory to the Spanish {{lang|es|traza}}.  The Spanish laid out the streets of the {{lang|es|traza}} in a checker board pattern, with straight streets and plazas at intervals, whereas the indigenous portions of the city were irregular in layout and built of modest materials. In the colonial period both San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco retained jurisdiction over settlements on the mainland that they could draw on for labor and tribute demanded by the Spanish, but increasingly those subordinate settlements ({{lang|es|sujetos}}) were able to gain their autonomy with their own rulers and separate relationship with the Spanish rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, ''Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', pp. 368–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern about the health of the indigenous population in early post-conquest Mexico–Tenochtilan led to the founding of a royal hospital for indigenous residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leiby |first=John S. |title=The Royal Indian Hospital of Mexico City, 1553–1680. |journal=The Historian |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=573–580 |via=[[JSTOR]] |jstor=24451466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of colonial-era pictorial manuscripts dealing with Tenochtitlan–Tlatelolco, which shed light on litigation between Spaniards and indigenous over property.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, John B. in collaboration with Donald Robertson.

===Ruins===
[[File:Templo Mayor 2007.JPG|thumb|The ruins of the Templo Mayor]]

Tenochtitlan's main temple complex, the [[Templo Mayor]], was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it. The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral. The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early 20th century, but major excavations did not take place until 1978–1982, after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]].  The disc is {{convert|3.25|m|ftin|sp=us}} in diameter, and is held at the Templo Mayor Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean R.|title=Archaeology of Native North America|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-13-615686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Fundacion Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|left|''Fundación de México'' (The foundation of Mexico) – Tenochtitlán by [[Roberto Cueva del Río]]]]

The ruins, constructed over seven periods, were built on top of each other.  The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco; the ruins now rest at an angle instead of horizontally.

Mexico City's [[Zócalo]], the [[Plaza de la Constitución]], is located at the site of Tenochtitlan's original central plaza and market, and many of the original ''calzadas'' still correspond to modern city streets. The [[Aztec calendar stone]] was located in the ruins. This stone is {{convert|4|m|ftin|sp=us}} in diameter and weighs over {{convert|20|ST|LT t|1|abbr=off|sp=us}}. It was once located half-way up the great pyramid. This sculpture was carved around 1470 under the rule of King [[Axayacatl]], the predecessor of [[Tizoc]], and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and to prophesy the future.&lt;ref&gt;Walker,  p. 162–167&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1987, archaeologists discovered a mix of 1,789 human bones {{convert|5|m|ftin|spell=in|sp=us}} below street level in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web| title=Venerable Bones | author=A.R Williams| publisher=National Geographic| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/pictures/120829-aztec-sacrifice-templo-mayor-bones-archaeology/|  date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial dates back to the 1480s and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital. The bones are from children, teenagers and adults. A complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site.&lt;ref name=NG /&gt;

The '''Theatre Royal''' is a historic theatre, a Grade I [[listed building]] situated on [[Grey Street, Newcastle|Grey Street]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

==History==
The theatre was designed by local architects [[John and Benjamin Green]] as part of [[Richard Grainger]]'s grand design for the centre of Newcastle, and was opened on 20 February 1837 with a performance of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name ="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/happy-180th-birthday-newcastles-magnificent-12620352|date=20 February 2017|title=Happy 180th birthday to Newcastle's magnificent Theatre Royal|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first managers here was Thomas Ternan who employed his wife, [[Frances Eleanor Jarman|Frances Ternan]] as the main actress.&lt;ref name=spart&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/ARTternanT.htm Thomas Ternan], John Simkin, Spartacus Educational, retrieved 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The shareholders of the Proprietors` Committee appointed lessees to manage and programme the theatre. The longest running individual lessee, before Ltd companies, was Edward D Davis from 1845 to 1870 during which in 1867 the interior was redesigned by architect [[Charles J. Phipps]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;  William Glover and George Francis, both of the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow]] took over from 1871 to 1878; to be followed by Charles Bernard of the [[Gaiety Theatre, Glasgow]] until 1882. James Howard and Fred Wyndham of Edinburgh and Glasgow became lessees from 1883 to 1887. Due to their intention, carried out, of also leasing the [[Tyne Theatre and Opera House]], the shareholder committee did not renew their lease of the Royal. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Robert Arthur of Glasgow and now lessee of [[Her Majesty`s Theatre, Dundee]] took over in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Dundee/HerMajestysTheatreDundee.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire of 1899 he instructed architect Frank Matcham to totally redesign the interior, re-opening in 1901. The venues of Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd in Scotland and England, which had many shareholders in Tyneside, prospered until losses overwhelmed the company in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008),''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the Arthur shareholders, led by the family of [[Joseph Cowen]] MP, appointed a new chairman of the lessee company, Michael Simons, of Glasgow, who in 1895 had created [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1912 onwards the Theatre Royal Newcastle was an important part of the [[Howard &amp; Wyndham]] group, led successfully by chairman Simons, followed by the Cruikshank family, whose [[King's Theatre, Edinburgh]] joined the group in 1928. Newcastle City Council took over ownership in 1967. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008),''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh formed a triangle of industry, commerce and entertainment business from the 1870s onwards. From 1962  and increasingly from the 1970s the interchange of shows and pantomimes was joined by tours each year of [[Scottish Opera]] and of [[Scottish Ballet]]. [[Opera North]] joined in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008), ''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', a huge fire destroyed the interior of the building in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butcher |first=Joanne |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-theatre-royal-set-35m-4477317 |title=Newcastle Theatre Royal set for £3.5m restoration |publisher=The Journal |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had its interior redesigned by [[Frank Matcham]]&lt;ref name = "guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/sep/09/theatre-royal-newcastle-frank-matcham-grey-street-wakefield-blackpool-firth-carpets|date=9 September 2011|publisher=The Guardian|title=Geordieland's theatrical phoenix spreads its bright new wings|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reopened on 31 December 1901.&lt;ref name ="chronicle"/&gt; Externally, the building is exactly as it was when it was first built.

It underwent a major refurbishment and restoration in the latter part of the 1980s, reopening on 11 January 1988 with a performance of ''[[A Man For All Seasons]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].

The Theatre Royal went dark on 14 March 2011 due to a major restoration of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 [[Frank Matcham]] [[Edwardian]] interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The [[proscenium]] arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats in keeping with the restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes at the rear of the grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for [[opera]] and [[musicals]]. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New [[frescos]] for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with [[Alan Bennett]]’s epic period drama ''[[The Madness of George III]]'';&lt;ref name = "guardian"/&gt; [[George III]] was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.

The theatre currently hosts a variety of shows, including ballet, contemporary dance, drama, musicals and opera.The Christmas [[pantomime]] is one of the UK's most popular.

Almost all of the shows that come to the Theatre Royal are part of national British tours, and in a typical year the theatre will have 30 to 35 visiting shows.  For the annual pantomime, and any visiting musicals and opera performances, there is a sizeable orchestra pit available which can seat 60 musicians if necessary.  The stage itself is also of substantial size, and can house 50 singers, dancers, actors and musicians.

==The Original Theatre Royal==
Newcastle's original Theatre Royal opened on 21 January 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp229-231 |title=Public buildings: The Theatre Royal &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its location on Mosley Street obstructed plans for the redevelopment of the city centre (as it was on the route of [[Grey Street, Newcastle|Grey Street]]), so it was demolished to make way for the present building. One of the theatre's most successful managers at this time was [[Stephen Kemble]] of the famous [[Kemble family]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/18th-century-newcastle-theatre-royal-8635356&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the theatre from 1791 to 1806. The original theatre's final performance was on 25 June 1836.

==Technical details==
The current theatre has a [[proscenium stage]], and accommodates a variable orchestra pit on 2 lifts - which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247).

==Project A==
Project A is a one-year actor training programme led by an artistic director and supported by leading industry specialists. Delivered from within the Theatre Royal over an academic year (3 terms) participants gain professional standard actor training culminating in a production term to be performed in the Studio Theatre and toured nationally.

The course started in September 2015 with the first year free for the successful actors. The programme is seen as an alternative to drama school and is expected to lift the actors involved into the industry.

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] have very strong ties to the theatre and are involved with the programme heavily in the second term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/taking-part/project-a Theatre Royal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912125220/http://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/taking-part/project-a |date=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodgson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/newcastle-theatre-royal-launches-young-9398928 |title=Newcastle Theatre Royal launches young actor training scheme |publisher=Chronicle Live |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thread Routes''''' is a 16mm film series by artist [[Kimsooja]].

Divided into six chapters, ''Thread Routes'' takes place in six different cultural zones around the world. The artist considers her approach to this film as a 'visual poem' and a 'visual anthropology', in that it juxtaposes and presents structural similarities in performative elements of textile culture with the structures in nature, architecture, agriculture and gender relationships in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226023659/http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biaci.org/en/kim-sooja/&lt;/ref&gt; These non-descriptive and unnarrative documentary films were conceived after being inspired in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], in 2002, by the performative elements of traditional [[Bobbin lace|lace making]], and the city's architectural structure.

The first chapter, completed in 2010, explores [[Peru]]vian weaving culture, and its tight alignment with its landscapes and historic archeological structures. This piece journeys throughout the country, from the Sacred Valley around [[Cusco]] and [[Machu Picchu]] to the Taquila Island villages, forming a non-linear timeline of the connection between people and their geographical environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://broadstrokes.org/2014/09/09/artist-spotlight-kimsoojas-threads-of-culture-and-landscape/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mello, Laeticia, "The Pilgrimage of Our Own existence"- Arte Al Limite, Published by Arte Al Limite ltd. March 2012, pp 30-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter II, which finished filming in the summer of 2011, focused on [[Europe]]an lace making actions such as bobbin lace-making from Bruges (Belgium), [[Lepoglava]] and [[Pag (town)|Pag]] ([[Croatia]]); industrial lace-making in [[Calais]] ([[France]]); needle point lace-making by nuns in a monastery in [[Hvar]] ([[Croatia]]) who use threads from dry [[aloe vera|aloe]] leaves; and traditional needlepoint on the small island of [[Burano]] ([[Italy]]). These scenes are set against representative European architecture such as the [[Duomo of Milan|Duomo in Milan]]; the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]; and the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in [[Kutna Hora]] ([[Czech Republic]]), which is decorated by human bones and skulls. Local vegetation and flowers overlap with scenes from [[Alhambra|La Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] ([[Spain]]) which, in its detailed and complex decorative Islamic architectural forms, conveys a spatial sensibility and a spiritual dimension that is mirrored in lace-making. The bold, masculine, and power-oriented monumental architectural forms are revealed as similar acts to the delicate, feminine, and ephemeral textile making.

The third chapter (2012) journeys to [[India]] and studies the traditions of dyeing, sewing, weaving, embroidery, tattoo and woodblock printing; juxtaposing them with the archeological structures and temporary housing structures of the nomadic communities in [[Gujara]], as well as the Step Well and the Sun Temple in [[Ahmedabad]].

Most recently, [[Kimsooja]] filmed Chapter IV in China, where she encountered the specific weaving, dyeing and garment culture of the [[Miao people|Miao minority]] in the [[Guizhou]], [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces. These are depicted alongside elaborate silver adornment and paper making, as well as the ancient local housing structures in [[Fujian]], the rice terraces of [[Yunnan]] and the landscapes of [[Guizhou]] and [[Hainan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in preproduction phase, ''Thread Routes - Chapter V''  will explore [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] textile culture.

The first three chapters were presented at [[Guggenheim Bilbao]] between March and July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Daughters of the Confederacy''' ('''UDC''') is an American [[Lineal descendant|hereditary]] association of [[Southern United States|Southern]] women established in 1894 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The stated purposes of the organization includes the commemoration of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers and the funding of the erection of memorials to these men. The organization's treatment of the Confederacy, along with its promotion of the [[Lost Cause]] movement, is viewed by historians as advocacy of [[white supremacy]].{{sfn|Mills|Simpson|2003}}&lt;ref name="NewGeorgia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Elder |first=Angela Esco |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/united-daughters-confederacy |title=United Daughters of the Confederacy |encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |date=2010 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Murrin|Johnson|McPherson|Fahs|2014|page=425}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lampen |first1=Claire |title=White women helped build the Confederate statues sparking conflict across the South |url=https://mic.com/articles/183773/white-women-helped-build-the-confederate-statues-sparking-conflict-across-the-south |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |work=[[Mic (media company)]] |date=August 17, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cox |first1=Karen L. |title=Analysis {{!}} The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/ |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=August 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-washington-post-sunday/20170820/282286730383237|dead-url=no|archivedate=August 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffman&gt;{{cite news

== Formation and purpose ==
The group was founded on September 10, 1894, by Caroline Meriwether Goodlett and Anna Davenport Raines as "the National Association of the Daughters of the Confederacy". The first chapter was formed in Nashville.{{sfn|Simpson|2003|pages=75-76}} The name was soon changed to "United Daughters of the Confederacy".&lt;ref name="NewGeorgia" /&gt; Their stated intention was to "tell of the glorious fight against the greatest odds a nation ever faced, that their hallowed memory should never die." Their primary activity was to support the construction of [[List of Confederate monuments and memorials|Confederate memorials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG97/stone/udc.html |title=Shades of Gray: United Daughters of the Confederacy |last1=Muller |first1=Matthew G. |last2=McLellan |first2=Corey W. |last3=Irons |first3=Charles F. |date=1996 |website= |publisher=University of Virginia |location=Charlottesville |access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDC includes that members support U.S. troops and honor veterans of all U.S. wars.{{sfn|Mills|Simpson|2003}}

In 1896, the organization established the Children of the Confederacy to impart similar values to younger generations through a [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|mythical depiction]] of the Civil War and Confederacy. According to historian Kristina DuRocher, "Like the KKK's children's groups, the UDC utilized the Children of the Confederacy to impart to the rising generations their own white-supremacist vision of the future."{{sfn|DuRocher|2011|p=88-89}} The UDC denies assertions that it promotes white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/united-daughters-confederacy-statues-monuments-udc-653103|title=As Confederate Statues Fall, The Group Behind Most of Them Stays Quiet|last1=Kutner|first1=Max|date=August 25, 2017|work=Newsweek|accessdate=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communications studies scholar W. Stuart Towns notes UDC's role "in demanding textbooks for public schools that told the story of the war and the Confederacy from a definite southern point of view". He adds that their work is one of the "essential elements [of] perpetuating Confederate mythology".{{sfn|Towns|2012|page=xi}}

The UDC was incorporated on July 18, 1919. Its headquarters is located in the [[Memorial to the Women of the Confederacy|Memorial Building to the Women of the Confederacy]], [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=UDC Handbook|pages=3-5 |edition=6th |location=Richmond, Virginia |publisher=United Daughters of the Confederacy |date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Minutes of the One Hundred and Twenty-first Annual General Convention of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Incorporated, Held in Richmond, Virginia, November 6-10, 2014|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the [[Southern United States]], associations were founded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], chiefly by women, to organize burials of Confederate soldiers, establish and care for permanent cemeteries, organize commemorative ceremonies, and sponsor impressive [[Confederate monuments|monuments]] as a permanent way of remembering the Confederate cause and tradition.{{sfn|Mills|Simpson|2003}}

Thank you. --&gt;The organization was "strikingly successful at raising money to build monuments, lobbying legislatures and Congress for the reburial of Confederate dead, and working to shape the content of history textbooks".{{sfn|Faust|2008|p= 237–247}} They also raised money to care for the widows and children of the Confederate dead. Most of these [[Ladies Memorial Association|memorial associations]] gradually merged into the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which grew from 17,000 total members in 1900 to nearly 100,000 by [[World War I]].{{sfn|Blight|2001|p=272–273}}

The UDC was influential primarily in the early twentieth century across the South, where its main role was to preserve and uphold the memory of the Confederate veterans, especially those husbands, sons, fathers and brothers who died in the Civil War. Memory and memorials became the central focus of the organization.{{sfn|Mills|Simpson|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;Megan B. Boccardi, "Remembering in Black and White: Missouri Women's Memorial Work, 1860-1910" (PhD. Dissertation, University of Missouri-Columbia, 2011, [https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/14392/research.pdf?sequence=2 online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715071304/https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/14392/research.pdf?sequence=2 |date=July 15, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] notes that the UDC had a particular interest in the position of Southern (Confederate) women, with "a commitment to bolstering vanquished and disheartened veterans and keeping the memory of the dead alive. But it was also committed to immortalizing the heroism of Confederate women, whose valor, its leaders believed, had been every bit as important as men's". The UDC's methods were wide-ranging and ahead of their times:

&lt;blockquote&gt;UDC leaders were determined to assert women's cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region's past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jacquelyn Dowd|last=Hall|authorlink=Jacquelyn Dowd Hall|title='You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique|journal=[[Journal of American History]]|year=1998|pages=439-465|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The number of women's clubs devoted to filiopietism and history was staggering", says historian [[W. Fitzhugh Brundage]], noting that women were much more likely to be involved in a variety of (historical) organizations than men, who devoted their energies to fraternal societies. Brundage notes that after women's suffrage came in 1920, the historical role of the women's organizations eroded.&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage,  "White Women and the Politics of Historical Memory in the New South, 1880-1920." in Jane Dailey, Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, &amp; Bryant Simon, eds., ''Jumpin' Jim Crow: Southern Politics from Civil War to Civil Rights'' (Princeton UP, 2000) pp. 115-39. esp. 119, 123, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1900 the UDC became an umbrella organization coordinating local memorial groups.{{sfn|Janney|2012}} The UDC women specialized in sponsoring local memorials. After 1945, they were active in placing historical markers along Southern highways.{{sfn|Gulley|1993}} The UDC has also been active in national causes during wartime. According to the organization, during [[World War I]], it funded 70 hospital beds at the American Military Hospital on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]] and contributed over [[United States dollar|US$]]82,000 for French and Belgian war orphans. The homefront campaign raised $24 million for [[war bond]]s and savings stamps. Members also donated $800,000 to the [[Red Cross]]. During [[World War II]], they gave financial aid to student nurses. The UDC donated $50,000 for the construction of a Confederate memorial hall on the campus of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="tennesseanvanderbilttoremoveconfederate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tamburin|first1=Adam|title=Vanderbilt to remove 'Confederate' from building name|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2016/08/15/vanderbilt-remove-confederate-building-name/88771680/|accessdate=August 15, 2016|work=The Tennessean|date=August 15, 2016|quote=Anonymous donors recently gave the university the $1.2 million needed for that purpose; the Vanderbilt Board of Trust authorized the move this summer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="korenthecollegedormandthecon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koren|first1=Marina|title=The College Dorm and the Confederacy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/08/vanderbilt-confederate-hall/495941/|accessdate=August 15, 2016|work=The Atlantic|date=August 15, 2016|quote=Vanderbilt will return $1.2 million to the Tennessee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the present value of the $50,000 the group donated to the school in 1933 for the construction of the dorm.

=== Memoirs ===
The UDC encouraged women to publish their experiences in the war, beginning with biographies of major southern figures, such as [[Varina Davis]]'s of her husband [[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederacy]]. Later, women began adding more of their own experiences to the "public discourse about the war", in the form of memoirs, such as those published in the early 1900s by [[Sara Agnes Rice Pryor|Sara Pryor]], [[Virginia Clay-Clopton|Virginia Clopton]], Louise Wright and others. They also recommended structures for the memoirs. By the turn of the twentieth century, a dozen memoirs by southern women were published. These memoirs were part of the growing public memory about the antebellum years and the [[Lost Cause]] narrative, which critics have described as white supremacist, as they vigorously defended the Confederacy and its founding principles (which included the enslavement of African-Americans).{{sfn|Blight|2001||p=259}}{{sfn|Gardner| 2006|p=128–130}}

The [[Southern Cross of Honor]] was a postbellum honor presented by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to members of the [[United Confederate Veterans]]. The first Cross was bestowed on April 26, 1900.{{sfn|Lawton|1956|p=44}}  The UDC kept records of the descendants of Confederate soldiers and sailors who served in the U S Armed Forces during World War I. &amp;nbsp;In 1919, it was decided that a medal be created to honor them. &amp;nbsp;The first World War I Crosses of Military Service were awarded on November 22, 1923, with the first being placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery.{{sfn|Lawton|1956|p=218, 328.}} The Crosses of Military Service Awards has been expanded over the years to include the Spanish-American War (1930), the Philippine Insurrection Cross of Military Service (1930), the World War II Cross of Military Service, the Korean War Cross of Military Service (1952), the Vietnam Conflict Cross of Military Service (1966), and the Global War on Terror Cross of Military Service (2005).{{sfn|Lawton|1956|p=327-328.}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=UDC Ritual Book – Eighth Edition|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Cross of Honor and the Cross of Military Service are the highest honors the UDC bestows. "The UDC is the only patriotic organization in America that bestows such an award."{{sfn|Lawton|1956|p=327}} Each Cross is presented to the recipient with the following words: &amp;nbsp;"Fortes creantur fortibus – the brave beget the brave."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Scholarships ===
During the first decades of their existence, the UDC focused on caring for Confederate soldiers and their widows. When the numbers of Confederate veterans began to dwindle, they focused on their remaining objectives.  Education of the descendants of those who served the Confederacy became one of the key interests of the organization.{{sfn|Cox|2003|p=73-74}} Some state divisions within the UDC built dormitories and sponsored scholarships, but there was no coordinated support for education by the national organization.  The divisions were responsible for scholarships and building dormitories for women.  At the 1907 General Convention, Caroline Meriwether Goodlett spoke of the shift in the UDC's focus.  As monuments were erected, she "sat by… thinking that the monument fever would abate". She believed that "the most thoughtful and best educated women" in the organization should have realized that the "grandest monument (they) could build in the South would be an educated motherhood".{{sfn|Cox|2003|p=90}}

The UDC combined education with support of the military during World War II by establishing a nurses' training fund. Each scholarship provided approximately $100 per year for a three-year nursing program.  When a scholarship was offered, local Chapters were encouraged to contact local schools to locate students who needed assistance to fund their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1942|title=News|url=|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|volume=Vol. 42, No. 7|pages=825|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the UDC sponsors essay and poetry compositions, in which the participants are not to use the phrase "Civil War", "[[Names_of_the_American_Civil_War#War_Between_the_States|War Between the States]]" being the preferred term.&lt;ref name=woodruff&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Last of the Southern Belles|first=Juliette|last=Woodruff|journal=[[Studies in Popular Culture]]|volume=8|issue=1|year=1985|pages=63-70|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23412915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children of the Confederacy ===
The Children of the Confederacy, also known as the CofC, is an auxiliary organization to the UDC. The official name is ''Children of the Confederacy of the United Daughters of the Confederacy''. It comprises children from birth through the time of the Children of the Confederacy Annual General Convention following their 18th birthday. All Children of the Confederacy chapters are sponsored by UDC chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The History of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

During the period 1880–1910, the UDC was one of many groups that celebrated [[Lost Cause]] mythology and presented "a romanticized view of the slavery era" in the United States.{{sfn|Murrin|Johnson|McPherson|Fahs|2014|page=425}} The UDC promoted white Southern solidarity, allowing white Southerners to refer to a mythical past in order to legitimize [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and white supremacy.{{sfn|Janney|2012|p=12–13, 139}} The UDC worked to "define southern identity around images from an Old South that portrayed slavery as benign and slaves as happy and a Reconstruction that portrayed blacks as savage and immoral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Drill into us... the Rebel Tradition': The Contest over Southern Identity in Black and White Women's Clubs, South Carolina, 1898–1930|first=Joan Marie|last=Johnson|journal=[[The Journal of Southern History]]|volume=66|issue=3|year=2000|pages=525-562|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2587867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[James M. McPherson]] has said that the present-day UDC promotes a [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Confederate]] agenda,&lt;ref&gt;Angela Esco Elder, "[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/united-daughters-confederacy United Daughters of the Confederacy]" in ''[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]'' (Georgia Humanities Council/[[University of Georgia Press]]: original entry July 23, 2010; last updated October 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; saying 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think I agree a hundred percent with Ed Sebesta, though, about the motives or the hidden agenda not too deeply hidden I think of such groups as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of the Confederate Veterans. They are dedicated to celebrating the Confederacy and rather thinly veiled support for white supremacy. And I think that also is the again not very deeply hidden agenda of the Confederate flag issue in several Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Amy|title=Democracy Now – interview with James McPherson, Ed Sebesta|publisher=Pacifica Radio Network|date=November 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Savage, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=50dstwAACAAJ Monument Wars: Washington, D.C., the National Mall, and the Transformation of the Memorial Landscape]'', (University of California Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quote|date=September 2017}}  Savage wrote in ''When Should the Removal of Confederate Monuments Stop?'', 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the 1890s, with the rise of openly white supremacist state and local governments, the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) among others embarked on a systematic campaign of commemoration that extended from monument building to rewriting school textbooks and sponsoring rituals for white schoolchildren. While much of the overt indoctrination is now gone, the material traces of this campaign still permeate cities and small towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/399061/confederate-monument-removal-op-ed/|title=When Should the Removal of Confederate Monuments Stop?|date=September 6, 2017|website=hyperallergic.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;--&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] considers the UDC as part of the [[Neo-Confederate]] movement that began in the early 1980s, which the Center states is "a reactionary conservative ideology that has made inroads into the Republican Party from the political right, and overlaps with the views of white nationalists and other more radical extremist groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NEO-CONFEDERATES|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/neo-confederates|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2010/01/25/neo-confederate-movement | title=  The Neo-confederate Movement | first=  Euan  | last =  Hague | date = January 25, 2010 | accessdate = August 23, 2018 | publisher = [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ku Klux Klan ===
"Perhaps nothing illuminates the UDC's true nature more than its relationship with the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Many commentators have said the UDC simply supported the Klan. That is not true. The UDC during Jim Crow venerated the Klan and elevated it to a nearly mythical status. It dealt in and preserved Klan artifacts and symbology. It even served as a sort of public relations agency for the terrorist group."&lt;ref name=Huffman/&gt; UDC funded a now-vanished&lt;ref name=Huffman/&gt; memorial to the Klan near Concord, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The spelling varies with region.

===History===
Vaisakhi is one of the three traditionally Hindu festivals chosen by [[Guru Amar Das]] in which Sikhs were to congregate and celebrate together (the others being [[Maha Shivaratri]] and [[Diwali]]).&lt;ref name="ColeSambhi1995p135"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&amp;pg=PA135|year=1995|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=135–136}}, '''Quote:''' "Since the time of Guru Amar Das it has been customary for Sikhs to assemble before their Guru on three of the most important Hindu festival occasions – Vaisakhi, Divali and Maha Shivaratri".&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view is that Guru Amar Das chose [[Makar Sankranti|Maghi]], instead of Maha Shivaratri.&lt;ref&gt;Fauja Singh, Gurbachan Singh Talib (1975), Punjabi University [https://books.google.com/books?id=7g0eAAAAMAAJ Guru Tegh Bahadur: Martyr and Teacher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

Subsequent events gave a new meaning to the festival which is, in part, a remembrance of the foundation of the Khalsa Sikh order which started after the ninth [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] was persecuted and then beheaded under the orders of the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], after he stood up for freedom of religious practice and refused to convert to Islam.&lt;ref name="Seiple 2013 96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pashaura236" /&gt; The guru's martyrdom triggered the coronation of the tenth and last Guru of Sikhism, and the formation of the ''sant-sipahi'' group of [[Khalsa]],&lt;ref name="Chanchreek 2007 142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chanchreek|first=Jain|title=Encyclopaedia of Great Festivals|year=2007|publisher=Shree Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788183291910|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dugga 2001 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dugga|first=Kartar|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: The Last to Lay Arms|year=2001|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170174103|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; both on the Vaisakhi day.&lt;ref name="pashaura236"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pashaura Singh and Louis Fenech | title=The Oxford handbook of Sikh studies | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford, UK | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-969930-8 | pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaisakhi festival Khalsa tradition started in the year 1699,&lt;ref name=bakshi208/&gt; as it is on this day that the 10th Guru of the Sikhs, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] laid down the foundation of the [[Khalsa|Panth Khalsa]], that is the Order of the Pure Ones, by baptizing Sikh warriors to defend religious freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), ''Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan'', Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johar|first1=Surinder|title=Guru Gobind Singh: A Multi-faceted Personality|date=1999|publisher=M.D. Publications |isbn=978-8175330931|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1606 -1708 | publisher=Atlantic Publishers | author=Singh Gandhi, Surjit | year=2008 | pages=676–677 | isbn=8126908572}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the Vaisakhi or Baisakhi festival being observed as a celebration of Khalsa panth formation and is also known as Khalsa Sirjana Divas&lt;ref&gt;Laws of the State of Illinois Enacted by the ...

It is regionally known by many names among the Hindus, though the festivities and its significance is similar.

Vaisakhi coincides with the festival of '[[Vishu]]' celebrated in [[Kerala]] a day after Vaisakhi. The festivities include fireworks, shopping for new clothes and interesting displays called 'Vishu Kani'. Hindus make arrangements of flowers, grains, fruits which friends and family visit to admire as "lucky sight" (''Vishukkani''). Giving gifts to friends and loved ones, as well as alms to the needy are a tradition of Kerala Hindus on this festive day.&lt;ref name="Roy2005p479"/&gt;

Vaisakhi is celebrated as Pohela Boishakh in West Bengal and [[Bohag Bihu|Bahag Bihu]] in [[Assam]], but typically one or two days after Vaisakhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aghr.cag.gov.in/holidays.pdf |title=2017 Official Central Government Holiday Calendar |accessdate=4 March 2017 |publisher = Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puthandu====
Puthandu, also known as ''Puthuvarusham'' or ''Tamil New Year'', is the first day of the month ''Chithirai'' on the [[Tamil calendar]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p406"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton2011p633"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Households clean up the house, prepare a tray with fruits, flowers and auspicious items, light up the family [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] altar and visit their local temples. People wear new clothes and youngster go to elders to pay respects and seek their blessings, then the family sits down to a vegetarian feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel S.

In the Mithal region of [[Bihar]] and [[Nepal]], the new year is celebrated as Jurshital.&lt;ref&gt;Hari Bansh Jha (1993) The terai community and national integration in Nepal.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JShuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=JurShital+new+year&amp;dq=JurShital+new+year&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yFYzVZaiD5LaaPLFgCg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional to use lotus leaves to serve [[sattu]] (powdered meal derived from grains of red gram and jau (Hordeum vulgare) and other ingredients) to the family members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ugVFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jurshital&amp;dq=Jurshital&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J6MzVYuBGtOWavbCgIgO&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw Ethnobotany (2002)Aavishkar Publishers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikh celebrations outside India==

Pakistan has many sites that are of historic importance to the Sikh faith, such as the birth place of Guru Nanak. These sites attract pilgrims from India and abroad every year on Vaisakhi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1176098 Glare and galore at Baisakhi festival], The Dawn, Pakistan (15 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vaisakhi-2015-sikh-devotees-celebrate-major-festival-india-pakistan-photos-1496358 Vaisakhi 2015: Sikh devotees celebrate major festival in India and Pakistan], David Sims, International Business Times&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan used to have many more Sikhs, but a vast majority moved to India during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition.

According to Aziz-ud-din Ahmed, [[Lahore]] used to have Baisakhi Mela after the harvesting of the wheat crop in April. However, adds Ahmed, the city started losing its cultural vibrancy in 1970s after Zia-ul-Haq came to power, and in recent years "the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] government in Punjab banned kite flying through an official edict more under the pressure of those who want a puritanical version of Islam to be practiced in the name of religion than anything else".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/02/21/cultural-decline-in-lahore/ Cultural Decline in Pakistan], Pakistan Today, Aziz-ud-din Ahmed (21 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Indian state of Punjab that recognizes the Vaisakhi Sikh festival as an official holiday,&lt;ref&gt;[http://punjab.gov.in/list-of-holidays Official Holidays], Government of Punjab, India (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; the festival is not an official holiday in Punjab or Sindh provinces of Pakistan where Islamic holidays are officially recognized instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schools.punjab.gov.pk/system/files/Notification_2.pdf Official Holidays 2016], Government of Punjab – Pakistan (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmc.gos.pk/Contents.aspx?id=48 Official Holidays 2016], Karachi Metropolitan, Sindh, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest concentrations of [[Sikhs]] in the UK are to be found in the West Midlands (especially [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]]) and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Amarjeet Singh (2014) Indian Diaspora: Voices of Grandparents and Grandparenting [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vo_HBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=largest+sikh+community+in+england+birmingham&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt; The Southall [[Nagar Kirtan]] is held on a Sunday a week or two before Vaisakhi.

==={{USA}}===
Amongst Sikh populations in the [[United States]], there is usually a parade commemorating the Vaisakhi celebration. In [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsikhdayparade.com/|title=Annual NYC Sikh Day Parade|author=|date=30 April 2012|publisher=www.nycsikhdayparade.com|accessdate=22 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322192021/http://www.nycsikhdayparade.com/|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; people come out to do "[[Selfless service|Seva]]" (selfless service) such as giving out free food, and completing any other labor that needs to be done. In [[Los Angeles, California]], the local Sikh community consisting of many [[gurdwara]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gururamdasashram.org/baisakhi|title=Baisakhi – Guru Ram Das Ashram|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds a full day [[Kirtan]] (spiritual music) program followed by a parade.

==={{MYS}}===
The Sikh community, a subgroup of the [[Malaysian Indian]] ethnic minority race, is an [[ethnoreligious]] minority in Malaysia, which is why Vaisakhi is not a public holiday. However, in line with the government's efforts to promote integration among the country's different ethnic and religious groups, the prime minister, [[Najib Razak]] has announced that beginning 2013, all government servants from the Sikh [[Malaysian Indian]] community will be given a day off on Vaisakhi Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/5/8/nation/11249703&amp;sec=nation|title=Sikh civil servants get Vaisakhi holiday|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaisakhi 'open houses' are also held across the country during the day of the festival, or the closest weekend to it.

==Spelling of Vaisakhi==
The spelling varies with region. In Punjab region, Vaisakhi is common, while in the [[Doabi]] and [[Malwi dialect|Malwai]] regions, it is common for speakers to substitute a "B" for a "V".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_gdr5.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123940/http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_gdr5.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the spelling used is dependent on the dialect of the writer.

An evening reception took place in the [[Chateau de Laeken]], a royal residence.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Popular reactions and effects==
The run up to the wedding was said to have led to widespread feelings of positive sentiment in Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Belgium's Prenuptial Glow |magazine=[[Business Week]] |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |publication-date=6 December 1999 |issue=3658-3661 |pages=7, 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the potential for greater unity between the country's Flemish-speaking north and French-speaking south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Barry |date=25 October 1999 |title=A Boon for Unity?/ Smiles Almost All Around : For Belgium, Crown Prince's Wedding Comes at Opportune Time |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/news/25iht-belgium.2.t.html |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 50,000 people lined the streets of Brussels on the occasion of Philippe and Mathilde's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Political Risk Yearbook: West Europe |volume= 6 |location= |publisher=Political Risk Services Group |page=53 |date=2001 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As many as 200,000 people had been expected but the lower numbers were perhaps on account of the bitterly cold weather on the day.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  After the wedding some popular culture academics commented that the wedding had had a unifying effect on the Belgian people as well as marking a new phase of positivity in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blain |first1=Neil |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Hugh |date=2003 |title=Media, Monarchy and Power |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRU7ax9dXPYC&amp;pg=PT350&amp;lpg=PT350 |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=9781841500430}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC however reported that academics and political commentators in Belgium deemed that the national rift was too great for the wedding to have much effect.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

'''Wolf-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of [[wolf|wolves]]. 

Historically, the baiting of wolves was more in the context of training dogs for [[wolf hunting]] than public entertainment.  Wolves would sometimes be caught, either at the end of hunts, or in set traps, and would be set upon by the dogs, usually as a way of helping them master their fear of the animal. When training young or inexperienced dogs, the wolf would be [[hamstringing|hamstrung]].&lt;ref name="JJA"&gt;{{cite book | author=Audubon, John James | title=The Imperial Collection of Audubon Animals | year=1967 | asin=B000M2FOFM  | page=307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts as to how wolves react to being attacked by dogs vary, though [[John James Audubon]] wrote that young wolves generally show submissive behaviour, while older wolves fight savagely.&lt;ref name="JJA" /&gt; 
[[File:Dogue loup.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Sculpture of a [[Dogue de Bordeaux]] fighting a [[wolf]] from the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]]] 
One of the earliest recorded incidents of wolf-baiting occurred during one of the [[Roman civil wars]]. The [[Dacians]], hoping to take advantage of Rome's division, pressed their chieftain Scorlyo to launch an offensive. Scorlyo brought several dogs to the city square, which immediately began fighting one another. However, a captured wolf was brought in, to which the dogs ceased their fighting and attacked it. By this, Scorlyo intended to teach his people that whatever war a nation had within itself, it would always stand firm in attacking an outsider.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry'', by Christine, Sumner Willard, Charity Cannon Willard, translated by Sumner Willard, published by Penn State Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-271-01881-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wolves can be extremely dangerous opponents for dogs, even when outnumbered. [[Louis XIII of France]] once acquired an old wolf and set his best dogs on it three at a time. The wolf managed to kill twelve of them without sustaining any serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Field Sports of France: Being a Practical View of Hunting, Shooting and Fishing, on the Continent'', by Roderic O'Connor published by J. Murray, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting styles of wolves and dogs differ significantly; while dogs typically limit themselves to attacking the head, neck and shoulder, wolves will make greater use of body blocks, and attack the extremities of their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training: Adaptation and learning'', By Steven R. Lindsay, Edition: illustrated, Published by Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8138-0754-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8138-0754-6}}, 410 pages&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] once wrote that he considered a large mastiff a match for a wolf only if the latter was a young or undersized [[Texas wolf]], though he conceded that even if the dog was the heavier of the two, its teeth and claws would be very much smaller, weaker and its hide less tough.&lt;ref name="TEDDY"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fulltextarchive.com/page/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches3/#p3| title = ''Hunting the Grisly and Other Sketches'' | work = [[Theodore Roosevelt]]| publisher =  | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Quality Day''' is celebrated every year around the world in November. The day was designed to increase worldwide awareness of the important contribution that quality makes towards both organisational and national growth, and prosperity.

World Quality Day takes place every year on the second Thursday of November. Businesses across the world take part in a variety of activities such as business-wide seminars, presentations, quizzes and competitions at their workplace. Events are usually organised by quality professionals based within organisations and are designed to spread the ‘importance of quality’ message to non-quality professionals.

According to the [[Chartered Quality Institute]] (CQI), the responsibility of the quality professional can be defined through five main areas – governance, assurance, improvement, leadership and context.
