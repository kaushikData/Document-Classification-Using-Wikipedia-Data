'''''"Civilized" Sexual Morality and Modern Nervous Illness''''' ({{lang-de|'''Die „kulturelle“ Sexualmoral und die moderne Nervosität'''}}) is an article published by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in the journal ''Sexual-Probleme'' ("Sexual Problems").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=Die "kulturelle" Sexualmoral und die moderne Nervosität |trans-title="Civilized" Sexual Morality and Modern Nervous Illness |language=de |encyclopedia=Gesammelte Werke [Collected Works] |volume=VII |year=1999 |publisher=[[S. Fischer Verlag|Fischer Verlag]] |location=[[Frankfurt on Main]] |pages=141–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Freud|2009}}

Referencing [[Christian von Ehrenfels]]' distinction between cultural and natural sexual morality, Freud explains the [[Etiology|etiological significance]] of cultural [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] as a reason for [[neurosis]]. At the beginning, Freud states that cultural sexual mores impose constraints on the individual, which can cause damage to the person, which in turn threatens the [[culture]] as a whole.  While von Ehrenfels argues primarily on the basis of [[Social Darwinism]], saying social sexual morality may prevent [[sexual selection|male sexual selection]] in reproduction, Freud focuses on the consequences of socially-imposed [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] of the [[sexual instinct]] as a cause of neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;However, Freud does not contradict Ehrenfels on this point, thereby supporting the latter's social Social Darwinist model.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is based on [[renunciation]] of [[Drive theory|drive]]s. There is therefore a tension between a person's body, which seeks fulfilment of drives, and the demands of culture to renounce [[desire]].  Those who cannot conform to these requirements imposed by society are either viewed as criminals and perverts - if they cannot fulfil society's demand for renunciation - or escape into neurosis when the drives are suppressed to such an extent that neurotic substitute pleasures are developed in their stead. Neurosis is thus the negative counterpart of [[perversion]], "because they [neurotics] have the same appetites as the positive perverts in a 'repressed' state."{{sfn|Freud|1908|p=120}}&lt;ref&gt;At this point Freud comments on the [[gender difference]]s between neurosis and perversion, and writes of neurosis in women and perversion in men. This is explained by a weaker sex drive in women. However, Freud himself states that as a woman is subject to a more strict upbringing and rigorous instruction than a man, she needs to practice more abstinence than a man. Nevertheless, he interprets the "weak sex drive" in women as a biological fact and not a result of [[socialization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud said that the "perverse" part of the [[libido]] is caused by a disturbance in [[Human development (psychology)|development]]. The libido was originally meant for deriving pleasure, not only at the [[genital]]s but also at other [[erogenous zone]]s; but education has the purpose of limiting [[autoeroticism]] and directing love towards objects other than oneself, finally achieving the "primacy of genitals put into the service of procreation".{{sfn|Freud|1908|p=118}} Thus Freud was one of the first people who said that sexuality by itself does not generate any internal conflict, and explained that the conflict arises only through interaction with the outside world, with its social norms and its expectation of repression of instincts, which leads to disease (repression thesis). The suppressed perverse drives are ideally channeled through [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] and harnessed for cultural work. The sex drive in humans is aperiodic{{sfn|Freud|2009|p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;Here Freud goes back to referring to the smell stimulus and the [[Menstrual taboo|taboo of menstruation]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is divorced from reproduction. Therefore, it can be [[metonymic]]ally shifted and applied to other areas. Thus, culture benefits to a great extent - and is even dependent - on sexual energy that is redirected through sublimation. Therefore, Freud concluded that a complete renunciation of the sex drive is detrimental to culture. [[Abstinence]] only produces "brave weaklings",{{sfn|Freud|1908|p=125}}{{sfn|Freud|1908|p=128}}&lt;ref&gt;This statement underlines all sorts of remarks by Freud on [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], which allegedly lead to [[impotence]] in marriage.&lt;/ref&gt; but not great thinkers with bold ideas.&lt;ref&gt;At this point there is a conflict with the goal of [[psychotherapy]]: Perversion is to be "cured", but at the same time the therapist is also aware that perversion is useful for culture.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud thus describes the dilemma of culture, which simultaneously calls for renunciation while still needing the sexual instinct to preserve itself. The repression model that imposes cultural sexual morality should therefore be abandoned in favor of a sublimation, [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], and distribution model of sexual energies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">'''al-Mahdi al-Husayn''' (987 - 1013) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled in the years 1003-1013, in rivalry with another imam.

Al-Husayn bin Imam al-Qasim bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Imam al-Qasim al-Rassi bin Ibrahim Tabataba bin Isma'il al-Dibaj bin Ibrahim bin al-Hasan al-Ridha bin Imam al-Hasan bin Imam Ali bin Abi Talib.

He was a [[Sayyid]] originally from Tarj, Tihamah. His father was the imam [[al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani]] who briefly held power in the Yemeni inland in 999-1002, and died in 1003. After the death of al-Mansur, al-Husayn set forth his claim to the imamate, in rivalry with his distant relative [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]]. He declared himself with the title al-Mahdi.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296.&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by large groups from [[Himyar]] and [[Hamdan]]. At this time, the key city [[San'a]] was governed by the Zaidi [[sharif]] al-Qasim bin al-Husayn. The sharif was expelled from the city, pursued and killed in 1012. The rival imam ad-Da'i died in the same year. With this, the power of al-Mahdi al-Husayn extended from Alhan to [[Sa'dah]] and San'a. However, in 1013, the imam was attacked by a Hamdanite force near Dhu Bin and lost his life.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman; Its early Medieval History''. London 1892, pp. 228-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Zaidi imams, al-Mahdi al-Husayn was a prominent author. After his demise, his brother Ja'far played a political role as [[emir]] in the Yemeni highlands for several decades. He established himself in the impenetrable stronghold Shahara and was the main opponent of the [[Sulayhid dynasty]] in the second half of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. XI, Leiden 2002, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RSAF Tornado ADV.JPEG|thumb|250px|A central part of the Al Yamamah deal was the sale of [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado fighters]] to the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]].]]

'''Al Yamamah''' ({{lang-ar| اليمامة|translation=The [[Dove]]}}) is the name of a series of record [[arms sales]] by the United Kingdom to [[Saudi Arabia]], paid for by the delivery of up to {{convert|600000|oilbbl|m3}} of [[crude oil]] per day to the [[UK government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = | last = | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/285963.stm | title =Arms sales fuel BAe's profits  | work = | publisher =BBC News | pages = | page = | date =25 February 1999 | accessdate =19 August 2006 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime contractor has been [[BAE Systems]] and its predecessor [[British Aerospace]]. The first sales occurred in September 1985 and the most recent contract for 72 [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] multirole fighters was signed in August 2006. [[Pakistan]] is also said to have formed a key intermediary in these deals.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[Michael Turner (businessman)|Mike Turner]], then CEO of BAE Systems, said in August 2005 that BAE and its predecessor had earned £43 billion in twenty years from the contracts and that it could earn £40 billion more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =O'Connell| first =Dominic | title =BAE cashes in on £40bn Arab jet deal | work=The Sunday Times| publisher = News International | date = 20 August 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2320097,00.html | accessdate =22 August 2006  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Britain's largest ever export agreement, and employs at least 5,000 people in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectay.co.uk/|accessdate=18 December 2006|title=Welcome to Project AY|publisher=BAE Systems|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229151746/http://www.projectay.co.uk/|archivedate=29 December 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, BAE Systems pleaded guilty to a United States court, to charges of false accounting and making misleading statements in connection with the sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAE admits guilt over corrupt arms deals |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/bae-systems-arms-deal-corruption |publisher=Guardian |date=6 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |location=London |first=David |last=Leigh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209002847/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/05/bae-systems-arms-deal-corruption |archivedate=9 February 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by the British [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments.

==Background==
The UK was already a major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia prior to Al Yamamah. In 1964 The [[British Aircraft Corporation]] conducted demonstration flights of their [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]] in [[Riyadh]] and in 1965 Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent for the supply of Lightning and [[BAC Strikemaster|Strikemaster]] aircraft as well as [[English Electric Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] surface to air missiles. The main contract was signed in 1966 for 40 Lightnings and 25 Strikemasters (eventually raised to 40). In 1973 the Saudi government signed an agreement with the British government which specified BAC as the contractor for all parts of the defence system ([[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]] was previously contracted to supply the radar equipment and [[Airwork Services]] provided servicing and training). Overall spending by the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF) was over £10 billion GBP (SAR 57 Billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Charles |title=British Aircraft Corporation. A history by Charles Gardner |year=1981 |publisher=B.T. Batsford Ltd |isbn=0-7134-3815-0 |doi = |pages=224–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s United States defense contractors won major contracts, including 114 [[Northrop F-5]]s. In 1981 the RSAF ordered 46 [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15C]]s and 16 F-15Ds, followed in 1982 by the purchase of 5 [[E-3 Sentry|E-3]]A AWACS aircraft. Following these deals and partly due to pro-Israeli sentiment in the US Congress, which would have either blocked a deal or insisted on usage restrictions for exported aircraft, Saudi Arabia turned to the UK for further arms purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Bridget|last= Bloom|author2= Johns, Richard|title= A deal in a different dimension; The UK-Saudi arms sale|work= Financial Times|publisher= The Financial Times|page= 16 |date= 19 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported Saudi Arabian "interest" in the [[Panavia Tornado]] in July 1984. Export had become a possibility after West Germany lifted its objections to exports outside of [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael | title = Saudi Arabia considers Tornado fighter deal | work = Financial Times | publisher = The Financial Times Limited | page = 6 | date = 11 July 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1985 Saudi Arabia agreed "in principle" to a Tornado, [[BAE Hawk|Hawk]] and missile deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Fairhill | title = Saudis agree 'in principle' to 3 billion pound plane deal: Israelis angered by Tornado sale 'arms race escalation' | work = Financial Times | publisher = The Financial Times Limited | date = 16 September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 1985 the defence ministers of the UK and Saudi Arabia sign a Memorandum of Understanding in London for 48 Tornado IDSs, 24 Tornado ADVs, 30 Hawk training aircraft, 30 [[Pilatus PC-9]] trainers, a range of weapons, radar, spares and a pilot-training programme.&lt;ref name="flightintdir"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Michael J.H.|title=Flight International World Aircraft &amp; Systems Directory |edition=3rd|year=2001|publisher=Reed Business Information |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-617-01289-X |pages=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage (Al Yamamah II) was signed on 3 July 1988 in [[Bermuda]] by the defence ministers of the UK and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Fairhill | title = Britain signs 6 billion pounds Saudi arms contract | work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Limited | date = 9 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the full extent of the deal has never been fully clarified, it has been described as "the biggest [UK] sale ever of anything to anyone", "staggering both by its sheer size and complexity".&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'', 9 July 1988, cited in Hirst, C., [http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/saudi-arabia.php 'The Arabian Connection: The UK Arms Trade to Saudi Arabia'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922154928/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/saudi-arabia.php |date=22 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it is believed to involve the supply and support of 96 [[Panavia Tornado]] ground attack aircraft, 24 [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Air Defence Variants]] (ADVs), 50 [[BAE Hawk]] and 50 [[Pilatus PC-9]] aircraft, specialised naval vessels, and various infrastructure works. The initial Memorandum of Understanding committed the UK to purchasing the obsolete Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft, along with associated equipment and spare parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2006/10/27/PJ5_39AYMoUSep1985.pdf| title = Memorandum of Understanding for the provision of equipment and services for the Royal Saudi Air Force| accessdate = 2 November 2006|date=September 1985| format = PDF| work = The Guardian| publisher = | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110010530/http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2006/10/27/PJ5_39AYMoUSep1985.pdf| archivedate= 10 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government's prime contractor for the project is BAE Systems. BAE has approximately 4,000 employees working directly with the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (also see [[Military of Saudi Arabia]]).

The success of the initial contract has been attributed to Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who lobbied hard on behalf of British industry. A Ministry of Defence briefing paper for Thatcher detailed her involvement in the negotiations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2006/10/27/PJ5_39BriefforThatcherSept85.pdf| title = Briefing for the Prime Minister's meeting with Prince Sultan| accessdate = 2 November 2006| last = Mottram| first = R| date = 25 September 1985| format = PDF| work =The Guardian| publisher = | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110011719/http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2006/10/27/PJ5_39BriefforThatcherSept85.pdf| archivedate= 10 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since early 1984, intensive efforts have been made to sell Tornado and Hawk to the Saudis. When, in the Autumn of 1984, they seemed to be leaning towards French [[Dassault Mirage 4000|Mirage fighters]], [[Michael Heseltine|Mr Heseltine]] paid an urgent visit to Saudi Arabia, carrying a letter from the Prime Minister to [[King Fahd]]. In December 1984 the Prime Minister started a series of important negotiations by meeting [[Bandar bin Sultan|Prince Bandar]], the son of [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan]]. The Prime Minister met the King in Riyahd in April this year and in August the King wrote to her stating his decision to buy 48 Tornado IDS and 30 Hawk.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were no conditions relating to security sector reform or human rights included in the contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 November 2003|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2003-11-18.137764.h|title=Defence – Saudi Arabia|publisher=Hansard|author=Adam Ingram|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts between BAE Systems and the Saudi government have been underwritten by the [[Export Credits Guarantee Department]], a tax-payer funded insurance system.  Guarantees on a contract worth up to £2.7billion were signed by the Government on 1 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/military/story/0,,1094206,00.html |date=27 November 2003 |title=Millions risked on BAE contract |author=Rob Evans |author2=David Leigh |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 December 2006 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217030227/http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0%2C%2C1094206%2C00.html |archivedate=17 December 2006 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, the Commons Trade Committee chairman, Martin O'Neill, accused the Government of being foolish for concealing a £1billion guarantee they have given to BAE Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1373727,00.html|date=15 December 2004|publisher=The Guardian|title=£1bn BAE guarantee 'foolish', says MP|author=David Leigh|author2=Rob Evans|accessdate=16 December 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliveries early 1990s – 1998
*48 Panavia Tornado IDS'

===Eurofighter Typhoon (al-Salam) ===

In December 2005 the governments of the UK and Saudi Arabia signed an "Understanding Document" which involved the sale of Typhoon aircraft to replace RSAF Tornados and other aircraft. Although no details were released, reports suggested the deal involved the supply of 72 aircraft. On 18 August 2006 a contract was signed for 72 aircraft. The aircraft cost approximately £4.43 billion, and the full weapons system is expected to cost approximately £10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nic| last = Fildes| url =http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13130-2319186,00.html | title =BAE confirms £5bn Eurofighter sale to Saudi Arabia | publisher =The Times | date =19 August 2006 | accessdate =19 August 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornado upgrade===
In February 2006 ''[[Air Forces Monthly]]'' suggested that the eventual Eurofighter order may reach 100 and the deal could include the upgrade of the RSAF's Tornado IDS aircraft, likely similar to the RAF's [[Panavia Tornado#Tornado GR4|Tornado GR4]] standard. In an editorial the magazine also raises the prospect of a requirement for a new [[Jet trainer|lead-in fighter trainer]] to replace the earlier generation of Hawk 65/65As and to provide adequate training for transition of pilots to the advanced Typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Saudi Arabia Signs Typhoon Deal | publisher =Air Forces Monthly | pages =4–5 | date =February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAE System's 2005 Interim Report noted that three RSAF Tornado IDS' arrived at their [[Warton Aerodrome|Warton]] facility for design evaluation tests with the ultimate aim being "to improve serviceability, address obsolescence, and enhance and sustain the capability of the aircraft". On 10 September 2006 BAE won a £2.5bn (€3.7bn, $4.6bn) contract for the upgrade of 80 RSAF Tornado IDS'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Steiner | first = Rupert | title = BAE clinches new £2.5bn Tornado deal with Saudis | publisher = [[The Business (magazine)|The Business]] | date = 10 September 2006 | url = http://www.thebusinessonline.com/Stories.aspx?BAE%20clinches%20new%20%C2%A32.5bn%20Tornado%20deal%20with%20Saudis&amp;StoryID=CCB0F5FD-9EAB-4177-ACEE-4288DA084899&amp;SectionID=F3B76EF0-7991-4389-B72E-D07EB5AA1CEE | accessdate = 12 September 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption allegations==
There have been numerous allegations that the Al Yamamah contracts were a result of [[bribery|bribes]] ("douceurs") to members of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] and government officials.

Some allegations suggested that the former prime minister's son [[Mark Thatcher]] may have been involved, however he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother's connections in his business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/corruption/submission-0900.php |title=Submission from the Campaign Against Arms Trade to the International Development Committee's Inquiry into corruption |accessdate=19 August 2006 |date=September 2000 |publisher=Campaign Against Arms Trade |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619115415/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/corruption/submission-0900.php |archivedate=19 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, the solicitor of a former BAE Systems employee, Edward Cunningham, notified [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] of the evidence that his client was holding which related to an alleged "slush fund".  The SFO wrote a letter to [[Kevin Tebbit]] at the MoD who notified the Chairman of BAE Systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2003-11-17.137234.h|date=17 November 2003|author=Adam Ingram|publisher=Hansard|title=Defence – Saudi Arabia|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the Secretary of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2004-05-25.171750.h|date=25 May 2004|author=Geoff Hoon|publisher=Hansard|title=Al Yamamah Contracts|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further action was taken until the letter was leaked to and reported on by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1061671,00.html |date=13 October 2003 |title=MoD chief in fraud cover-up row |publisher=The Guardian |author=David Leigh |author2=Rob Evans |accessdate=15 December 2006 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129051434/http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0%2C%2C1061671%2C00.html |archivedate=29 January 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, [[Sir Richard Evans]] appeared before parliament's defence [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] and said: "I can certainly assure you that we are not in the business of making payments to members of any government."&lt;ref&gt;http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/business/BAE-faces-fresh-claims-of.2569857.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the BBC's ''Money Programme'' broadcast an in-depth story, including allegations in interviews with Edward Cunningham and another former insider, about the way BAE Systems alleged to have paid bribes to Prince [[Turki bin Nasser]] and ran a secret £60 million [[slush fund]] in relation to the Al Yamamah deal.&lt;ref name="moneyprog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3712770.stm|title=BBC lifts the lid on secret BAE slush fund|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=BBC Money Programme|date=4 October 2004|accessdate=15 December 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061221151825/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3712770.stm| archivedate= 21 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the money was alleged to have been spent through a front company called Robert Lee International Limited.

In June 2007 the [[BBC]]'s investigative programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' alleged that BAE Systems "..paid hundreds of millions of [[pound sterling|pound]]s to the ex-Saudi ambassador to the US, [[Prince Bandar bin Sultan]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6728773.stm Saudi prince 'received arms cash'], [[BBC]], 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 NAO report===
The [[UK National Audit Office]] (NAO) investigated the contracts and has so far not released its conclusions – the only NAO report ever to be withheld. Official statements about the contents of the report go no further than to state that the then chairman of the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]], now [[Lord Sheldon]], considered the report in private in February 1992, and said: "I did an investigation and I find no evidence that the MOD made improper payments. I have found no evidence of fraud or corruption. The deal... complied with Treasury approval and the rules of Government accounting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2002-02-13.35029.h|date=13 February 2002|publisher=Hansard|author=Alan Williams|title=Public Accounts Commission – Al-Yamamah Arms Agreement|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, Sir [[John Bourn]], the head of the NAO, refused to release a copy to the investigators of an unpublished report into the contract that had been drawn up in 1992.&lt;ref name="jbou"&gt;{{cite news | first =David | last =Leigh |author2=Evans, Rob| url =https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1828253,00.html | title =Parliamentary auditor hampers police inquiry into arms deal | work =The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date =25 July 2006 | accessdate =12 August 2006 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP [[Harry Cohen]] said, "This does look like a serious conflict of interest. Sir John did a lot of work at the MoD on Al Yamamah and here we now have the NAO covering up this report."&lt;ref name="jbou"/&gt; In early 2002 he had proposed an Early Day Motion noting "that there have been... allegations made of large commission payments made to individuals in Saudi Arabia as part of... Al Yamamah... [and] that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network have received substantial funds from individuals in Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2002-02-07.1046.5|date=7 February 2002|title=Business of the House|author=Harry Cohen|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serious Fraud Office investigation===
The Serious Fraud Office was reported to be considering opening an investigation into an alleged £20 million slush fund on 12 September 2003, the day after ''The Guardian'' had published its slush fund story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1040440,00.html |title=Fraud Office looks again at BAE |date=12 September 2003 |accessdate=16 December 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |author=David Leigh |author2=Rob Evans |author3=David Gow |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128181028/http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0%2C%2C1040440%2C00.html |archivedate=28 January 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO also investigated BAE's relationship with [[Travellers World Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BAE subject of fraud investigation | work = The Herald | publisher = Scottish Media Newspapers Limited | page = 23 | date = 18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004 the SFO made two arrests as part of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3978703.stm|title=SFO to investigate BAE contracts|date=3 November 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAE Systems stated that they welcomed the investigation and "believe[d] that it would put these matters to rest once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4020905.stm|date=17 November 2006|title=BAE included in SFO investigation|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, BAE refused to comply with compulsory production notices for details of its secret offshore payments to the Middle East.&lt;ref name="guardianbrutal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1973421,00.html| title=Brutal politics lesson for corruption investigators|author=David Leigh|author2=Rob Evans|date=16 December 2006|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 December 2006 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110031640/http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0%2C%2C1973421%2C00.html| archivedate= 10 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the investigation was for a prosecution under [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001#Part 12 (Bribery and corruption)|Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]].

====Threats by the Saudi government====
At the end of November 2006, when the long-running investigation was threatening to go on for two more years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6206298.stm|title=Defence firms fear Saudi fall-out|date=4 December 2006|accessdate=15 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211150723/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6206298.stm|archivedate=11 December 2006 |deadurl=no|first=Robert|last=Peston}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAE Systems was negotiating a multibillion-pound sale of [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]s to Saudi Arabia. According to the BBC the contract was worth £6billion with 5,000 people directly employed in the manufacture of the Eurofighter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6195260.stm|title=Unions confirm BAE job loss fears|date=29 November 2006|accessdate=15 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207022554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6195260.stm|archivedate=7 December 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other reports put the value at £10billion with 50,000 jobs at stake.&lt;ref name="tenday" /&gt;

On 1 December The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' ran a front-page headline suggesting that Saudi Arabia had given the UK ten days to suspend the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE/Saudi Arabian transactions or they would take the deal to France,&lt;ref name="tenday"&gt;{{cite news |first= Christopher |last=Hope |title=Halt inquiry or we cancel Eurofighters |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/01/nsaudi01.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this threat was played down in other quarters.  A French official had said "the situation was complex and difficult... and there was no indication to suggest the Saudis planned to drop the Eurofighter." This analysis was confirmed by [[Andrew Brookes]], an analyst at the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], who said "there could be an element here of trying to scare the SFO off. Will it mean they do not buy the Eurofighter? I doubt it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bowell, James |author2=Fidler Stephen |author3= Hollinger, Peggy|author4=Khalaf, Roula|author5=Peel, Michael |title=BAE investors take flight at potential loss of Eurofighter deal |work=Financial Times |page=3 |date=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports of a systematic PR campaign operated by [[Tim Bell]] through newspaper scare stories, letters from business owners and MPs in whose constituencies the factories were located to get the case closed.&lt;ref name="guardianbrutal" /&gt;

Robert Wardle, head of the SFO, also stated (in a later High Court challenge, see below) that he had received a direct threat of a cessation of [[counterterrorist]] co-operation from the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the UK, in the first of three meetings held to assess the seriousness of the threat: "as he put it to me, British lives on British streets were at risk".

Article 5 of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery prohibits the decision to drop investigations into corruption from being influenced by considerations of the national economic interest or the potential effect upon relations with another state. This does not however explicitly exclude grounds of national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/20/0,3343,en_2649_34859_2017813_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This prompted the investigation team to consider striking an early guilty plea deal with BAE that would minimise the intrusiveness to Saudi Arabia and mitigate damage. The Attorney General agreed the strategy, but briefed Prime Minister Blair - who in a reply dated 5 December 2006 - urged that the case be dropped. Despite affirming his government's commitment to bribery prosecution, he stressed the financial and counter-terrorism implications. That same day, [[Prince Bandar]] met with Foreign Office officials, after spending a week with Jacques Chirac to negotiate a French alternative to the BAE deal.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard 16 May 2007, Col 781W&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, after consultation with the SFO, the Attorney General met with Blair to argue against dropping the case. It was Blair's opinion that "Any proposal that the investigation be resolved by parties pleading guilty to certain charges would be unlikely to reduce the offence caused to the Saudi Royal Family, even if the deal were accepted, and the process would still drag out for a considerable period".

On 13 December, the Director of the SFO wrote to the Attorney General to inform him that the SFO was dropping the investigation and would not be looking into the Swiss bank accounts, citing "real and imminent damage to the UK's national and international security and would endanger the lives of UK citizens and service personnel."&lt;ref&gt;''R. (on the application of Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office'' [2008] EWHC 1354 (Admin)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation discontinued====
On 14 December 2006, the [[Attorney General]] [[Lord Goldsmith]] announced that the investigation was being discontinued on grounds of the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6182137.stm|title=Timeline: BAE corruption probe|date=15 December 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110031949/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6182137.stm| archivedate= 10 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15-strong team had been ordered to turn in their files two days before.&lt;ref name="guardianbrutal"/&gt; The statement in the House of Lords read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has decided to discontinue the investigation into the affairs of BAE Systems plc as far as they relate to the Al Yamamah defence contract. This decision has been taken following representations that have been made both to the Attorney General and the Director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security. It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider [[public interest]]. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2006-12-14a.1711.2|author=Lord Goldsmith|title=BAE Systems: Al Yamamah Contract|date=15 December 2006|accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, justified the decision by saying "Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is vitally important for our country in terms of counter-terrorism, in terms of the broader Middle East, in terms of helping in respect of Israel and Palestine. That strategic interest comes first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6182125.stm|title=Blair defends Saudi probe ruling|date=15 December 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103204533/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6182125.stm| archivedate= 3 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Aitken]], a former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government minister and convicted [[perjury|perjurer]], who was connected with the deals in the 1980s, said that even if the allegations against BAE were true, it was correct to end the investigation to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6181977.stm|date=15 December 2006|title=Criticism of ditched Saudi probe|accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=BBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110031941/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6181977.stm| archivedate= 10 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Pieth]], director of anti-fraud section at the [[OECD]], on behalf of the United States, Japan, France, [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Greece]], addressed a formal complaint letter before Christmas 2006 to the [[Foreign Office]], seeking explanation as to why the investigation had been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/12/0,2340,en_2649_37447_38251148_1_1_1_37447,00.html |author=OECD |title=OECD decision to re-open investigation |date=14 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2007 |publisher=OECD |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526060030/http://www.oecd.org/document/12/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_37447_38251148_1_1_1_37447%2C00.html |archivedate=26 May 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transparency International]] and Labour MP [[Roger Berry]], chairman of the [[Commons Quadripartite Committee]], urged the government to reopen the corruption investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Watchdog chief warns Saudi arms probe 'must be re-opened' | date = 17 January 2007 | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23382130-details/Watchdog%20chief%20warns%20Saudi%20arms%20probe%20'must%20be%20re-opened'/article.do | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130506155801/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23382130-details/Watchdog%20chief%20warns%20Saudi%20arms%20probe%20'must%20be%20re-opened'/article.do | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 6 May 2013 | publisher = Evening Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper interview, Robert Wardle, head of the Serious Fraud Office, acknowledged that the decision to terminate the investigation may have damaged "the reputation of the UK as a place which is determined to stamp out corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sylvia|last=Pfeifer|author2=Helen Power|title=	I like shooting things|work=Daily Telegraph|date=15 July 2007|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/07/15/ccsfo115.xml | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivery of the first two Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft (of 72 purchased by the Saudi Air Force) took place in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://bae-systems-investor-relations-2009.production.investis.com/~/media/Files/B/BAE-Systems-Investor-Relations-2009/PDFs/results-and-reports/results/2009/hyres09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2007 BAE announced that the [[United States Department of Justice]] had launched its own investigation into Al Yamamah.  It was looking into allegations that a US bank had been used to funnel payments to Prince Bandar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=BAE says U.S. is investigating dealings with Saudi Arabia|date=26 June 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/26/business/EU-FIN-COM-Britain-BAE-Saudi.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Riggs Bank]] has been mentioned in some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/9323168 "Will a row over a British arms deal affect Saudi politics?"] ''The Economist'', 11 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2008 BAE confirmed that its CEO Mike Turner and non-executive director [[Nigel Rudd]] had been detained "for about 20 minutes" at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|George Bush Intercontinental]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] airports respectively the previous week and that the DOJ had issued "a number of additional subpoenas in the US to employees of BAE Systems plc and BAE Systems Inc as part of its ongoing investigation".&lt;ref name="dojdetentions"&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzy |last=Jagger |title=BAE accused of being uncooperative with US investigators |url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article3964882.ece |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2008  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' suggests that, according to [[Alexandra Wrage]] of [[Trace International]], such "humiliating behaviour by the DOJ" is unusual toward a company that is co-operating fully.&lt;ref name="dojdetentions"/&gt;

Under a plea bargain with the US Department of Justice BAE was sentenced in March 2010 by US District Court Judge John D. Bates to pay a $400 million fine, one of the largest fines in the history of the DOJ. US District Judge John Bates said the company's conduct involved "deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law, I think it's fair to say, on an enormous scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bae-protesters-win-sfo-injunction-1914892.html |title=BAE protesters win SFO injunction |author=Alistair Dawber |date=3 March 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |accessdate=14 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAE was not convicted of bribery, and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts.

{{Armenians}}
The association of [[Armenians]] with [[India]] and the presence of '''Armenians in India''' are very old, and there has been a mutual [[economic]] and [[cultural]] association of Armenians with India for the last several centuries. Their presence has enriched India in several ways.

==Antiquity==
Armenians are believed to have come to India, when some Armenians joined the auxiliary elements of the forces under the command of [[Alexander the Great]] when he crossed [[Armenia]] en route to India. The earliest documented references to the mutual relationship of Armenians and Indians are found in [[Cyropaedia]] ([[Persian Empire|Persian]] Expedition), an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work by [[Xenophon]] (430 BC – 355 BC). These references indicate that several Armenians traveled to India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianembassy.am/eng/india_arm_partners.html India and Armenia Partners - Embassy of India in Armenia [ENG&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320082701/http://www.indianembassy.am/eng/india_arm_partners.html |date=20 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were well aware of land routes to reach India, as also the general and political [[geography]], socio-cultural milieu, and [[economic]] life of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==History==
[[File:The tomb of Rezabeebeh.jpg|thumb|175px|Located in an Armenian Church, the oldest Christian tombstone in Calcutta belongs to Rezabeebeh, who died on 11 July 1630.]]
Armenians had [[Trade|trading]] relations with several parts of India, and by the 7th century a few Armenian [[town|settlement]]s had appeared in [[Kerala]], an Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] located on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Armenians controlled a large part of the [[international trade]] of the area, particularly in [[precious stone]]s and quality fabrics.

An archive directory (published 1956) in [[Delhi]], India states that an Armenian merchant-cum-diplomat, named [[Thomas Cana]], had reached the Malabar Coast in 780 using the overland route.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/merchants-on-a-mission/article4970153.ece|author=Anusha Parthasarathy|title=Merchants on a mission|date=30 July 2013|accessdate=25 December 2013|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven hundred years thereafter, in the year 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached the Malabar Coast by sea. Thomas Cana was an affluent merchant dealing chiefly in [[spice]]s and [[muslin]]s. He was also instrumental in obtaining a [[decree]], inscribed on a [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], from the rulers of [[Chera Dynasty|Malabar]], which conferred several [[commerce|commercial]], [[social]] and [[religious]] privileges for the [[Christian]]s of that region. In current local references, [[Thomas Cana]] is known as "Knayi Thomman" or "Kanaj Tomma", meaning ''Thomas the merchant''.

An additional incentive for Armenian settlements in India was an Armenian agreement with the British East India Company. The agreement was signed in London, on 22 June 1688, and a Julfan merchant, resident in London at the time, signed the treaty on behalf of the “Armenian Nation.” Competing with the Portuguese and the French, the British wanted to boost the Armenian presence in India, and the agreement accorded special trading privileges to the Armenians, as well as equal rights with British subjects regarding the freedom of residence, travel, religion, and unrestricted access to civil offices.

The Armenian diaspora, having immigrated to India many hundreds of years ago, are well woven into the fabric of Indian society. Upon the founding of the Armenian nation in 1991, many Armenian-Indians chose to return to their ancestral homeland. Now there are hardly 100 Armenians in India, mostly in [[Kolkata]], where the [[Armenian College (Kolkata)|Armenian College]] still functions.
[[File:The grave of Astwasatoor Mooradkhan.jpg|thumb|175px|The grave of Astwasatoor Mooradkhan (died at Calcutta on 29.09.1799), who was one of the founders of the [[Armenian College (Kolkata)|Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy, Kolkata]].]]

Several centuries of presence of Armenians, described as "The Merchant Princes of India", resulted in the emergence of a number of several large and small Armenian [[town|settlement]]s in several places in India, including [[Agra]], [[Surat]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kanpur]],  [[Chinsurah]], [[Chandernagore]], [[Calcutta]], Saidabad, a [[suburb]] of [[Murshidabad]], [[Chennai]], [[Gwalior]], [[Lucknow]], and several other locations currently in the [[Republic of India]]. [[Lahore]] and [[Dhaka]] – currently respectively in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], – but, earlier part of [[Undivided India]], and [[Kabul]], [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Afghanistan]], also had an Armenian population. There were also many [[Armenians in Burma]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

*[[Akbar]] (1556–1605), the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[emperor]], invited Armenians to settle in Agra in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/julfa-v-armenians-in-india Julfa v. Armenians in India]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the middle of the 19th century, Agra had a sizeable Armenian population. By an imperial decree, Armenian merchants were exempted from paying taxes on the merchandise imported and exported by them, and they were also allowed to move around in the areas of the Mughal empire where entry of [[Alien (law)|foreigner]]s was otherwise prohibited. However, for the Armenians, who were recognized by the emperors for their innovative skills, earned their exceptional status in India. In 1562, an Armenian Church was constructed in Agra.
*During the 16th century onwards, the Armenians (mostly from [[Persian Empire|Persia]]) formed an important trading community in [[Surat]], the most active Indian [[port]] of that period, located on the western coast of India. The port city of Surat used to have regular sea borne to and fro [[traffic]] of  merchant [[Ship|vessels]] from [[Basra]] and [[Bandar Abbas]]. Armenians of Surat built two Churches and a [[cemetery]] there,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} and a [[tombstone]] (of 1579) in Surat bears Armenian [[inscription]]s. The second Church was built in 1778 and was dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A [[manuscript]] written in Armenian language in 1678 (currently preserved in Saltikov-Shchedrin Library, [[St. Petersburg]]) has an account of a permanent [[colony]] of Armenians in Surat.
*The Armenians settled in [[Chinsurah]], near [[Calcutta]], [[West Bengal]], and in 1697 built a Church there. This is the second oldest Church in [[Bengal]] and is still in well preserved on account of the care of the Calcutta Armenian Church Committee.
*During the period of Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], a decree was issued which allowed Armenians to form a settlement in Saidabad, a [[suburb]] of [[Murshidabad]], then the capital of Mughal suba (province) of Bengal. The imperial decree had also reduced the [[tax]] from 5% to 3.5% on two major items traded by them, namely piece goods and [[raw silk]]. The decree further stipulated that the [[estate (law)|estate]] of deceased Armenians would pass on to the Armenian community. By the middle of the 18th century, Armenians had become a very active, vibrant merchant community of Bengal. In 1758, Armenians had built a Church of the virgin Mary in Saidabad’s Khan market.

==Armenians in the Republic of India==
Armenians have continued their presence after the establishment of the Republic of India

The best known Armenian institution in India is the '''Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy''' (est. 1821)&lt;ref&gt;[http://armeniancollege.in/ Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226042354/http://armeniancollege.in/ |date=26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; better known as the [[Armenian College (Kolkata)|Armenian College]], in [[Kolkata]], funded by endowments and donations. The management of the college was handed over to the Armenian Holy See of Echmiadzin of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] some years ago. There are presently around 125 children studying there from Armenia, Iran and Iraq and the local Armenian population.

There is also the Armenian Sports Club (est. 1890). It is still active.

Landmarks of contributions made to the city of Chennai still exist. Woksan, an Armenian merchant who had amassed a fortune from trade with the [[Nawab of Arcot]], invested a great amount in buildings. The [[Marmalong Bridge]], with many arches across the river [[Adyar (River)|Adyar]] was constructed by him, and a huge sum of maintenance donated to the local authorities. Besides building rest houses for pilgrims, he built the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles in Madras. The only reminder of the bygone era is the [[Armenian Church, Chennai|Holy Virgin Mary church]] of 1772 at 2/A [[Armenian Street, Chennai|Armenia Street]], South Black Town (this area is now called [[George Town, Chennai|Georgetown]]).

The [[Armenian Church of Holy Nazareth]], located in Brabourne Road, [[Kolkata]] was constructed in 1734 and is the oldest Church in Kolkata.&lt;ref name=poulami&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Poulami|title=Church Children|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100523/jsp/calcutta/story_12477031.jsp|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph.

==Personalities==
Armenians in India share a history of 2,000 years with Indians. In India, they had remained involved basically with trade and commerce, but had also contributed for enrichment of the Indian civilization and culture. Several Armenians in India rose to prominence at different point of time and under different [[Ruler (potentate)|rulers]].

*Abdul Hai was the [[Chief Justice]] of Mughal Empire during the time of Akbar.
*Domingo Pires was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Interpreting|interpreter]] of Akbar’s court, and he was sent to [[Goa]] in September 1579 to present royal invitations to [[Jesuits]] to come to Akbar’s court for [[religious]] discussions.
*[[Lady Juliana (Agra)|Lady Juliana]], believed to be a sister of one of Akbar’s Armenian wives,  was a [[Physician|doctor]] in the royal [[harem]] of Akbar. Lady Juliana built the first [[Church (building)|Church]] in Agra. She was later married Jean Philippe de [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] of Navarre, a royal descendant of [[France]].
*Mariam Zamani Begum, one of the wives of Akbar, was believed to be an Armenian. Marium Zamani Begum’s palace still stands in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. But now most historians agree that Mariam Zamani was the First Hindu Wife of Akbar and the princess of Amber.
*An Armenian lady, Nawab Sultan Mariam Begum Saheba, also known as Vilayati Begum (literal meaning English Queen) was married to a king of [[Oudh]], when the British conferred on him the title of King in 1814.
*Mirza Zul Quarnain, adopted son of Akbar and his Armenian wife, was an Armenian. He was well versed in several languages, particularly Portuguese. Upon the death of his father in 1613, he succeeded as a collector of tax levied on salt produced in Sambhar ([[Rajputana]]). His rise was fast and he held positions in turn as the Governor of [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]], [[Mogor]], [[Babraich]] (Oudh), [[Lahore]] and Bengal. Emperor [[Jahangir]] conferred on him the title of [[Amir]]. He also maintained very cordial relations with Jesuits in India of his time. Mirza was also a [[poet]], singer and [[playwright]], and he composed verses in [[Urdu]] and Persian.
*''[[Sarmad]]'' (a Persian word for "eternal"), an Armenian of Aurangjeb’s (1658–1707) time was a scholar and a mystic saint and his grave is near the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]]. His poetic talents are often compared with gifted poets like [[Firdausi]], [[Sayadi]], [[Hafez]] and [[Khayam]]. He was allegedly executed by Aurangjeb in 1671.
*Eliza Kewark or ''Kevork'' whose father was Armenian was the wife of Theodore Forbes, making her the fourth great-grandmother of [[Lady Diana]].
*[[Gauhar Jaan]] (born Angelina Yeoward) was an Indian singer and dancer (or [[tawaif]]) of Armenian origin from [[Calcutta]].

[[Thackers Indian Directory]] (1864–1960) lists many Armenian names in business and government.

==Contributions==

===Medical profession===
Armenians in India have also contributed to the [[Health profession|medical profession]], and some prominent Indo-Armenian personalities associated with medical sciences include:
*Dr. Joseph Marcus Joseph, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], an Armenian joined the Indian Medical Service in 1852 and rose to the level of Deputy Surgeon General by 1880. The Indian Army, under the British, had several Armenians Lieutenant Colonels, Surgeon Captains, and Surgeon Majors.
*Stephan Manouk, son of a prominent business man, Hovsep Manouk, obtained a Diploma Of Doctor Surgeon from the [[Royal Medical University]], [[London]], in 1862. His services during a [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] of that time earned him a Certificate of Honors by the British Government.
*Dr. Sargis Avetoom of the Indian Army, participated in British Army’s actions in Afghanistan, Egypt and Burma, and was honored by the British Government, Medal and Clasp and Khedives star with Clasp from Egypt, and Medal and Clasp from Burma. He discovered a medicine for [[dysentery]], and was fluent in many languages like [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Belugi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]].
*Dr Arthur Zorab, an eye specialist, perfected an operating style for [[glaucoma]], which was named after him as the "Zorab operation".
*Dr. Stepen Owen Moses pioneered St. John’s Ambulance Courses in Calcutta,&lt;ref name=poulami/&gt; and initiated the first Red Cross ambulance in Calcutta during the [[World War I]].
*Dr. Marie Catchatoor, an Armenian lady, was the first woman of India to be appointed as Presidency Surgeon of West Bengal. She retired in the early 1980s as the superintendent of Lady Dufferin Hospital, Calcutta.&lt;ref name=poulami/&gt;
*Dr.Lt Col. Frederick Joseph Satur (Indian)Army Medical Corps M.B., B.S, DV. Graduated From Madras Medical College 1938. Saw active service in North Africa WW2 Indo-China war of 1962 UN Peace Keeping force Hospital Congo 1960. Retired fro service in 1969.

===Legal profession===
The Indo-Armenian community in India had produced a number of leading barristers, solicitors and advocates, including members of the Bengal Assembly and the Bengal Legislative Council. Some such illustrious Indo-Armenians are:
*M. P. Gasper, a leading [[barrister]] of the Calcutta High Court, was the first Armenian who passed the Indian Civil Service Examination in 1869.
*Gregory Paul, who had graduated from the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], held different posts in the High Court in India.&lt;ref name=poulami/&gt;

===Other areas===
Contributions of Indo-Armenians in several other fields are also notable, like:
*[[Joseph Melik Beglar]], an [[archeologist]] in the Public Works Department of British India, was associated with significant archeological excavations, which included excavations of [[Mahabodhi Temple]] complex in [[Bodh Gaya]], India.
* [[Coja Petrus Uscan]] led the Armenian community in [[Madras]]. He constructed the Marmalong Bridge across the [[River Adyar]] and the steps to the chapel on top of [[St Thomas Mount]].
* [[Harutyun Shmavonyan]] ({{lang-hy|Հարություն Շմավոնյան}}) published [[Azdarar]], the first [[Armenian Language]] ever published in Madras on 14 October 1794.

Sir Gregory Charles Paul K.C.S.I.,(1831–1900) an Armenian born in Calcutta, educated at Cambridge University, was the Advocate General of Bengal during British rule. He served as Advocate General for more than 30 years and his achievement were honoured with him being knighted and given the title of Sir Gregory Charles Paul. He lies buried in the Greek Cemetery, Narkeldanga. The Armenian Church committee at this death refused to allow him to be buried in the Armenian Church precincts. His distinction can be measured by the fact, that for more than 30 years, British Government allowed itself to be represented by an Indian born Barrister.

[[Image:Armenians in calcutta.jpg|thumb|Armenian boy scouts in Calcutta, 1915/1916.]]
It was Sir Gregory and other eminent Armenians Barristers of the day who brought the Calcutta Armenian Trusts under the Administration of the Calcutta High Court in 1888. (John Gregory Apcar and ors versus 1. Thomas Malcolm and 2. Sir Gregory Charles Paul, Advocate General of Bengal, Calcutta High Court 1888. Two Trusts were formulated by them one for the Management of the Armenian Charity Trusts managed by the officers of the Armenian Church and another Trust for the Management of the Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy. (Advocate General vs Arabella Vardon, Calcutta High Court).

It is these Trusts that have allowed the tiny Armenian Community to stay alive and recognised. Without these Trusts they would have disappeared.

The '''Australian honours system''' consists of a number of [[Order (distinction)|orders]], decorations, and [[medal]]s through which the [[Monarchy of Australia|country's sovereign]] awards its citizens for actions or deeds that benefit the nation. Established in 1975 with the creation of the [[Order of Australia]], the system's scope has grown since then and over time has replaced the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|Imperial/British honours system]] that previously applied to Australians. The system includes an array of awards, both [[Civil awards and decorations|civil]] and [[Military awards and decorations|military]], for gallantry, bravery, distinguished service, meritorious service, and long service. Various [[campaign medal|campaign]] and commemorative medals have also been struck. New honours can be awarded at any time, but conventionally most new honours are awarded on [[Australia Day]] (26 January) and on the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's Birthday]] (as observed in the eastern states, that is, on the second Monday in June) every year, when lists of new honours are published.

==History==
The Australian [[States and territories of Australia|states]] and the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] originally used the Imperial honours system, also known as the [[British honours system]]. The creation in 1975 of the '''Australian Honours System''' saw Australian recommendations for the Imperial awards decline, with the last awards being gazetted in 1989. The Commonwealth of Australia ceased making recommendations for Imperial awards in 1983, with the last Queen's Birthday [[:Template:Australian Honours Lists|Australian Honours list]] submitted by [[Queensland]] and [[Tasmania]] in 1989. The Queen still confers upon Australians honours [[Royal Prerogative|that emanate from her personally]] such as the [[Royal Victorian Order]], apart from the Order of Australia. Only a handful of peerages and baronetcies were created for Australians. Some were in recognition of public services rendered in Britain rather than Australia. Hereditary peerages and baronetcies derive from Britain. There have never been Australian peerages or baronetcies created under the Australian Crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who Australia'' 2008. Details are provided at [[Australian peers and baronets]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Australian states, as well the Commonwealth Government, were full participants in the Imperial honours system. Originally there was bipartisan support, but [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) governments, both national and state, ceased making recommendations for Imperial awards – in particular, appointments to the [[Order of the British Empire]] mainly after 1972. During the Second World War, the Governor-General, on the advice of wartime Labor governments, made recommendations for gallantry awards, including eleven for the [[Victoria Cross]]. Appointments to the Order of the British Empire were for officers and men engaged in operational areas.

In 1975, the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] (which had been out of power federally from 1949 until 1972) created the Australian Honours System. Recommendations were processed centrally, but State Governors still had the power, on the advice of their governments, to submit recommendations for Imperial awards. From 1975 until 1983, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was in power federally, under [[Malcolm Fraser]] and, although it retained the Australian Honours System, it reintroduced recommendations for meritorious Imperial awards, but not for Imperial awards for gallantry, bravery or distinguished service. Recommendations for Imperial awards by the Federal Government ceased with the election of the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] in 1983. In 1989, the last two states to make Imperial recommendations were Queensland and Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', 17 June 1989, pp. B29 &amp; B30&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat of both governments at the polls that year marked the end of Australian recommendations for Imperial awards.

Following the UK New Year Honours List in 1990, which contained no Australian nominations for British honours, the Queen's Private Secretary, Sir [[William Heseltine]], wrote to the Governor-General, saying "this seems a good moment to consider whether the time has not arrived for Australia, like Canada, to honour its citizens exclusively within its own system". There followed more than two years of negotiations with State governments before the Prime Minister, [[Paul Keating]], made the announcement on 5 October 1992 that Australia would make no further recommendations for British honours.&lt;ref&gt;''A matter of honour: the report of the review of Australian honours and awards'', December 1995, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Order of Wear states that "all imperial British awards made to Australian citizens after 5 October 1992 are foreign awards and should be worn accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Medals/_Master/docs/DHAM/04A.pdf |title=The Order of Wearing Australian Honours and Awards |work=Special Gazette No. S192 |date=2012 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Australian Honours System has followed United States rather than British practice in allowing for late awards years after an action that is being commended. More than one hundred late awards for the Second World War and Vietnam have been gazetted.  In the British system, no Victoria Cross has been awarded more than six years after the action commended. The longest period between action and award of the US Medal of Honor is 137 years, when in January 2001 President [[Bill Clinton]] presented the Medal of Honor to descendants of a Civil War soldier. Although 'The Report of the inquiry into unresolved recognition for past acts of naval and military gallantry and valour' released in March 2013 did not recommend any belated Victoria Cross for Australia awards, it did recommend a Unit Citation for Gallantry to HMAS ''Yarra'' for February and March 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defence-honours-tribunal.gov.au/inquiries/completed-inquiries/valour/hmas-yarra/|title=HMAS Yarra|work=Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Australian Bravery Awards have been gazetted years after the action being commended, including a Commendation for Brave Conduct awarded in 1987 to Robert Anderson for his courage in rescuing a child from a burning car at Kalgoorlie eight years earlier in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=866069&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true Commendation for Brave Conduct], ANDERSON, Robert Graham, 30 January 1987, ''It's an Honour''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating or applying for awards==
Australians become recipients of each of the 55 different types of Australian awards and honours through one of two separate processes; by nomination or by application.&lt;ref name = "itsanhonour"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nomination''': Individual nominations may be made by members of the public or a community group for the Order of Australia and Australian Bravery Decorations. Nominations for Meritorious Service Awards are based on nominations from each specific organisation. The Department of Defence also nominates individuals for a range of service decorations.&lt;ref name = "itsanhonour"/&gt; Non-Australians can be given honorary awards for "extraordinary service to Australia or humanity at large".&lt;ref name="che01"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomination forms for the Order of Australia are available through the Australian Honours Secretariat [http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au website], or upon application to the Honours Secretariat at Government House, Canberra or from any state Government House.
* '''Application''': Many of the honours or awards are based on an application by the recipient or a recommendation on their behalf. Awards that fall under this category include service awards for defence force and police personnel for operational service or to other individuals for special civilian services recognised by the Australian Government. Unlike Imperial bravery or gallantry awards, any person can nominate themselves for an Australian Bravery Award under the current design of the nomination form.&lt;ref name="itsanhonour" /&gt;

==Categories of honours and awards==
{{See also|Australian Honours Order of Wearing}}

There are two broad categories of honours and awards.

===Individual honours and awards===

The Honours and the Awards in the Australian system are, and have been:
* those within the Australian System of Honours and Awards;
* those conferred by The Sovereign in exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]];
* those within the Order of St John; 
* Imperial/British awards conferred before 6 October 1992; and 
* foreign awards, the acceptance and wearing of which have been authorised by the Governor-General.

Note that awards of the British Empire/United Kingdom are now foreign awards.&lt;ref name=Imp&gt;''"- all Imperial awards made to Australian citizens '''after''' 5 October 1992 are foreign awards and should be worn accordingly."'' [http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/docs/order_of_wearing.pdf ''Order of Wearing''], updated 25 September 2007. page 1. (Generally, foreign awards are worn ''after'' Australian awards, and postnominals of foreign awards are not recognised.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military theatre and battle honours, honour titles and distinctions===
{{see also|Battle and theatre honours of the Australian Army|Battle and theatre honours of the Royal Australian Navy}}
The [[Australian Defence Force]] has a system of [[battle honour]]s, theatre honours, honour titles and honour distinctions to recognise exemplary service by units (not individuals) in combat and combat-related roles. Normally, Defence Honours are not awarded below sub-unit level (an organisation normally commanded by a [[Major]] or equivalent). The recommendation for the award of battle honours, theatre honours, honour titles and honour distinctions is made by a Battle Honours Committee.&lt;ref name=DIA&gt;{{cite book
 | title        = Administration of Australian Battle Honours, Theatre Honours, Honour Titles and Honour Distinctions

 | date         = 4 May 2012
 | publisher    = [[Australian Army]]
 | location     = [[Canberra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four categories of honours in the Defence system as follows:&lt;ref name=DIA/&gt;

* '''Theatre Honour:''' A theatre of operations is defined as a geographic area in which a [[Military campaign|campaign]] or series of [[Military operations|operations]] is conducted and for which an [[Operational level of war|operational level]] joint or combined commander is appointed. A Theatre Honour can be made where a unit or sub-unit of any Corps is deployed under warlike conditions. Any unit that qualifies for a Battle Honour will automatically also qualify for a Theatre Honour. Examples of Theatre Honours awarded to Australian units include [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli 1915]], [[Western Front (World War I)|France and Flanders 1914–1918]], [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East 1941–1944]], [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific 1942–1945]], [[Korean War|Korea 1950–1953]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam 1965–1972]].&lt;ref name=DIA/&gt;
* '''Battle Honour:''' A battle is an operational action conducted under warlike conditions. A Battle Honour is defined as the title of a battle or a series of battles fought as a campaign, an action or an engagement and is awarded to close combat elements of a Combat Corps of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Australian Army]] or [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a public commemoration of outstanding achievement in battle(s), action or engagement. Examples of Battle Honours awarded to Australian units include the [[Landing at Anzac]] Cove, [[Battle of Hamel|Hamel]], [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]], [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track]], [[Battle of Kapyong|Kapyong]] and [[Battle of Coral–Balmoral|Coral-Balmoral]].&lt;ref name=DIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |dead-url=yes
 |archive-date=2012-02-27
 |accessdate=2007-03-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Honour Title:''' An Honour Title is awarded to any non-combat unit or sub-unit that is not entitled to a Battle Honour but which satisfies the same requirements for the award of a Battle Honour. An example of the award of an Honour Title is the title Coral, awarded to [[102nd Medium Battery, Royal Australian Artillery|102nd Field Battery]] for its outstanding achievement during the [[Battle of Coral–Balmoral]] in [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=DIA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coral&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher   = Arrow Books
 | location    = London, England

* '''Honour Distinction:''' An Honour Distinction is defined as a public commemoration of creditable performance by a unit or sub-unit in an operation which does not attract a Theatre, Battle or Honour Title. Honour Distinctions are intended to recognise service under operational conditions in security-related, peace keeping and peace enforcement and similar operations. The first award of an Honour Distinction was the award made to the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]] for the [[Australian contribution to UNTAG|Australian contribution]] to the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) [[peacekeeping]] mission in [[Namibia]] in 1989 and 1990.&lt;ref name=CALetter1&gt;{{cite journal

It is common that units claim Honours from original units with a historical connection to a military predecessors of the current Unit. For example, [[4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment]] which is a modern amalgamated unit, is entitled to the previous Honours of the [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd Battalion]], the [[4th Battalion (Australia)|4th Battalion]] as well as the World War I Honours of the 3rd and 4th Battalions [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. The term Battle Honour can be used to denote both battle and theatre honours.&lt;ref name=DIA/&gt;

Historically the system was drawn from the British system adopted during [[World War I]] but has been modified since. A relatively recent change is the introduction of the Honours for recognition of outstanding service in dangerous operations short of declared theatres of war.&lt;ref name=ArmyNews&gt;{{cite journal

==Australian honours and awards==

===Order of Australia===
{{Main|Order of Australia}}

The Order of Australia insignia were designed by [[Stuart Devlin]] in 1976. Devlin used the livery colours of the [[Australian Coat of Arms]], gold and royal blue. He also translated an individual ball of [[wattle blossom]] into a simple convex golden disc with a rich texture of beads and radiating lines accentuating a ring of blue [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] representing the sea.

The disc is surmounted by an enamel Crown signifying the position of The Order of Australia as an [[Australian Royal Honour]]. The Sovereign is Head of the Order of Australia. The Governor-General is Principal Knight or Dame and Chancellor of the Order of Australia. The blue and gold theme is continued in the ribbon. Most of the insignia pieces are produced by the [[Royal Australian Mint]] in [[Canberra]]. The actual pieces for the two Divisions of the Order are identical: it is only the ribbon which differentiates an award between the General and the Military Divisions. In the Military Division the ribbon is distinguished by the addition of a narrow gold band on each edge.

When established, only the grades of Member, Officer and Companion of the Order existed. In 1976, Malcolm Fraser recommended to Queen Elizabeth II the addition of the Medal and grade of Knight and Dame in the Order. The grade of Knight and Dame was removed on the advice of Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] in 1986 without prejudice to any person who had been admitted to the Order at that grade. The grade of Knight and Dame was restored on the advice of [[Tony Abbott]] in March 2014. In November 2015, the Australian government announced that the Queen approved the Government's request to amend the Order's [[letters patent]] and cease awards in this class, after [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] agreed that the titles are no longer appropriate in the modern awards system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/knights-and-dames-to-be-scrapped/6904474 |title=Knights and dames scrapped from Order of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull says |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |publisher= |location=Australia |author1=Norman, Jane |author2=Iggulden, Tom |date=2 November 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/02/knights-and-dames-removed-from-order-of-australia-by-malcolm-turnbull |title=Knights and dames removed from Order of Australia by Malcolm Turnbull |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |location=Australia |author=Medhora, Shalailah  |date=2 November 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are four grades within the Order in both Military and General Divisions. People cannot be admitted to the Order posthumously; if a person is successfully nominated but dies prior to the scheduled announcement, the date of effect of the award is deemed to be a date before they died.

The [[Council for the Order of Australia]] makes recommendations to the Governor-General as to the appropriateness of a nominee to be admitted to the Order and at what grade. It is up to the Honours Secretariat to provide the council with as much fully verified information as is possible on each nominee so that appropriate consideration may be given to each case. This is a long process and up to eighteen months can elapse between the original submission and publication of a successful nomination.

[[File:The 1854 Muluki Ain codification of entire Nepalese society into a single hierarchical fold.jpg|thumb|The Muluki Ain caste/ethnicity hierarchy of Nepal, 1854]]
 
The '''Nepalese caste system''' is the traditional system of [[social stratification]] of [[Nepal]]. The Nepalese [[caste]] system broadly borrows the classical Hindu ''Chaturvarnashram'' model consisting of four broad social classes or [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]: [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]], [[Shudra|Sudra]].

The caste system defines social classes by a number of hierarchical endogamous groups often termed ''jaat''. This custom was traditionally only prevalent in the Hindu-Aryan societies of the [[Khas people|Khas]], [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]], and [[Newars]]. However, since the unification of Nepal in the 18th century, Nepal's various tibetian imigrant nationalities "Adivasi Janajati" have been incorporated within the caste hierarchy, to varying degrees of success. Despite the forceful integration by the state into the pan-Hindu social structure, the ethnic indigenous groups and tribes do not necessarily adhere to the customs and practices of the caste system.

[[File:Khas male Nepal 1860s.jpg|alt=|thumb| indigenous Ethnic Khas male]]
[[File:Népal rana tharu1818a Crop.jpg|thumb|Ethnic Tharu women]]
The social structure of caste-origin Hill Hindu or [[Khas people|Khas]] groups is simple, reflecting only three groups in hierarchy, with the distinct absence of the Vaishya and Shudra varnas. Much of the previously animist/tribal Khas population of the western Nepal region acquired the 'Chhetri' status in the 1850s with the proclamation by the Rana Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana, making Chhetris the most populous caste/tribe of Nepal. The mother tongue of these groups is [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and its various dialects. In 2001 the CBS recorded only nine groups in the caste-origin Hill Hindu groups.&lt;ref name=MOPE&gt;MOPE (2002). Nepal Population Report, 2002.

===Caste-origin Madhesh Hindu groups/Madheshi===

The social structure of the caste-origin [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] Hindu groups is complex, reflecting four varna groups with distinct hierarchical structure within them. These various cultural groups belong to four distinct language groups: [[Maithili language|Maithili]], Bajika, [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Tharu languages|Tharu]] and [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]]. In 2001 the CBS recorded 43 caste-origin Hindu groups in the [[Madhesh]].&lt;ref name=MOPE /&gt;

===Caste-origin [[Nepal Mandala]] groups/Newārs===
{{Further|Newar caste system}}

The case of [[Newars|Newār]] is exceptional. This group presents a complicated social structure, not only reflecting the model of four Hindu varna categories, but is also clearly divided into two distinct religious groups: the Hindu and the Buddhist. Newars are divided internally into distinct cultural groups of over 25 occupational caste categories who share a common language (mother-tongue) [[Newar language|Nepal Bhasa]] and its regional dialects.&lt;ref name=MOPE /&gt;

== Muluki Ain (1854)==

The Nepali [[civil code]] Muluki Ain was commissioned by [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] after his European tour and enacted in 1854. It was rooted in traditional [[Hindu Law]] and codified social practices for several centuries in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Stiller, L. F. (1993). Nepal: Growth of a Nation. Human Resources Development Research Center, Kathmandu.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also comprised ''[[Prāyaścitta]]'' (avoidance and removal of sin) and ''[[Ācāra]]'' (the customary law of different castes and communities).

It was an attempt to include the entire Hindu as well as non-Hindu population of Nepal of that time into a single hierarchic civic code from the perspective of the Khas rulers. Terai and Newar Brahmins and Kshatriyas were officially placed below their Khas equivalents. Similarly, serious limitations and oversights of this code include the complete exclusion of the large middle-ranking Terai groups. Most notable contradiction is the inclusion of previously non-Hindu tribes "Adivasi Janajati" groups, as well as non-Nepalis including Muslims and Europeans into the hierarchical fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofer|first1=Andras|title=The Caste Hierarchy and the State of Nepal: A Study of the Muluki Ain of 1854|date=1979|publisher=Universitatsverlag Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guneratne|first1=Arjun|title=Many Tongues, One People: The Making of Tharu Identity in Nepal|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801487286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social values preached by the Muluki Ain, however, were providing restrictive, anachronic and out of step with the spirit of times. These values were seen as a potent instrument of Rana political repression. After the Rana regime, caste rules relating to food, drink and intercaste marriage were openly louted but the Muluki Ain had not been abrogated. In 1963, Legal Code was replaced by New 1964 Legal Code. The legal recognition to caste and all the discriminatory laws made on the grounds of caste were ceased.

== The caste system today ==
The caste system is still intact today but the rules are not as rigid as they were in the past. In 1962, a law was passed making it illegal to discriminate against other castes led all castes to be equally treated by the law.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Education is free and open to all castes.

The caste system conjoints a structural class divide which persists, in which lower castes/ethnicities are generally socio-economically are not equal like those of higher castes/ethnicities. Recent research has also shown that when it comes to Nepali people's impressions of social change, "Poverty, Human Resources and Region" explain more of the variation than "Ethnicity, Caste or Religious belonging" – i.e. people's perception of their own social situation has more to do with geography and objective social class, than with their association with the groups that the state has based its internal social policy on.&lt;ref&gt;Aasland, Aadne and Marit Haug: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110430042505/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post42 Class, Caste or Location? How Do Different People Assess Social Change In Nepal?] ''The NIBR International Blog'', 27.05.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation of Khas-Brahmins in Civil Service is 41.3% in spite of its population size of less than 13%. The population of Newars is around 5%, but its occupancy in Civil Service is more than one-thirds (33.2%), the population of Khas-Chhetris constitutes 17.6% but its participation is mere 14.7%. If these major three castes (Khas Brahmin &amp; Chhetris, and Newars) combine together their shares in the Government of Nepal, civil service employment is 89.2% in 1991. Their dominance is reflected in education, administration and economical activities of the nation. Among those 73.8% in higher education belong to higher castes, 22.0% Janajatis and 2.9% Dalit.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Gurung, H. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

They have become major decision makers in the bureaucracy of Nepal has become crystal clear. In terms of earning/income generation, Newars have the highest per capita income of Rs. 38,193. Khas upper castes come next with an average income of Rs. 24,399, Adivasi Janajatis ranks third with an average income of Rs. 15,630, Dalit Rs. 12,114 and Muslim ranks the lowest, Rs.11,014'&lt;ref&gt;NLSS II, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The democratic transitions also failed to be inclusive management and functioning governance mainly because government was unable to understand and articulate the spirit of all Nepalese people irrespective of their caste, gender, ethnicity, and religion.

In this process the left outs were oppressed class (Dalits), women, the poorest of the poor, powerless and the second class citizen and indigenous nationalities (Adivasi Janajatis). In Nepal, high castes dominate 91.2% among the prominent position in politics and bureaucracy. The Dalits who constitute 12.8 percent of the total population of the country have no representation in the higher echelons of power' (Gurung, H. 2006). Similarly, the Janajati has 36.0% of the total population of the country, has representation of 7.1%.&lt;ref&gt;G.Neupane, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of education, 88.0% of Khas Brahmins &amp; Chhetris, and Newars have access to school, 12.0% have never been to school. More than fifty (52.0%) of Hill Dalits, 47.0% of the Tarai Dalits, 48.0% of the Muslims and 30 percent of the Hill Adivasi Janajatis have never been to school.(Census, 2001)

In recent times, following the overthrow of the Nepali monarchy and move towards a federal republic, ethnicity and caste have taken center stage – the indigenous peoples (''Adivasi Janajati'') who make up a third of the country having been guaranteed rights that have not yet been fulfilled. There is an observable reaction to this among certain Khas Brahmin and Chhetri groups, seeking to prevent group-based rights from becoming an important factor in the country that earlier had a political system associated with group-based discrimination. Certain outside analysts have suggested that "seeking a balance in approach requires addressing both specific indigenous historical injustices while creating a common citizenship for all marginalised citizens regardless of identity, which remains a particularly challenging issue for Nepal".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peris S.: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110430042505/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post43 Deepening Democracy: International Labour Organisation Convention 169 and Nepal's Democratic Transition] ''The NIBR International Blog'', 11.06.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">In the context of [[slavery in the colonial United States]], the expression '''"children of the plantation"''' was a [[euphemism]] used to identify the offspring of black female [[plantation slaves]] by white men, usually the owner or one of his sons or the [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|plantation overseer]]. 

Such children, who were born into slavery (a legal doctrine known as ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''), were seldom acknowledged by their white fathers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} These children were classified as [[Mulatto#Antebellum_era|mulatto]], a historic term for a [[multiracial]] person. The [[one drop rule]] meant that they could never be part of white society.

One famous example is the decades-long relationship between President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his slave and possible half-sister of his wife, the 3/4 white [[Sally Hemings]]. The [[Jefferson–Hemings controversy]], now resolved by DNA testing, shows that all her children were his. In the [[antebellum period]], theirs would have been called a "shadow family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Jan|title=Sally Hemings &amp; Thomas Jefferson: History, Memory, and Civic Culture|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Haley]]'s ''[[Queen: The Story of an American Family]]'' (1993) is a [[historical novel]], later a movie, that brought knowledge of the "children of the plantation" to public attention.

After the Civil War and emancipation, similar relationships continued. For example, [[Strom Thurmond]], who as a senator pursued segregationist policies, fathered a child when he was a young man, forcing himself on his family's 15-year-old maid. This child, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]], did not reveal the story until he died, when she was 78. Her parentage had been an open secret in the black community, but came as a surprise to the late senator's colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Congolese people in France''' consist of migrants from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Republic of the Congo]] and their descendants living and working in France.

== History ==
The first Congolese people in [[France]] arrived later than the first Black [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] immigrants. While people from the [[Senegal River]] Valley ([[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Guinea]]) first arrived in the 1960s, [[Central Africa]]ns (chiefly from [[Cameroon]] and Congo), arrived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/067041.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them come for work or familial reunification, but there is also a large number of Congolese people who come with the statute of political asylum during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives-fr.novopress.info/16928/limmigration-noire-africaine-un-phenomene-qui-samplifie/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130702110039/http://archives-fr.novopress.info/16928/limmigration-noire-africaine-un-phenomene-qui-samplifie/ |archivedate=2 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''coolie''' (also spelled ''koelie'', ''kuli'', ''cooli'', ''cooly'' and ''quli''); ([[Hindi]]: कुली, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: কুলি, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: કૂલી, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਕੁਲੀ, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: கூலி, [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: కూలీ, [[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕೂಲೀ, [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: കൂലി, [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: කූලී, [[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|ٹھنڈا}}, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 苦力, [[Persian language|Persian]]: کولی) meaning a [[labourer]], has a variety of other implications and is sometimes regarded as offensive or a pejorative, depending upon the historical and geographical context. It is similar, in many respects, to the Spanish term [[peon]], although both terms are used in some countries, with slightly differing implications.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, coolie was usually a term implying an [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourer]] from [[South Asia]], [[South East Asia]] or [[China]].

In South Asia, it is now a commonly used and inoffensive word for workers in unskilled manual labour, especially [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] at railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gaurav |first1=Kumar |last2=Singhal |first2=Mayank |title = Licensing and Livelihood: Railway Coolies |publisher=Centre for Civil Society (CCS), India |location = |url = http://ccs.in/internship_papers/2003/chap22.pdf |accessdate = 6 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, coolie is now regarded as derogatory and/or a [[racial slur]] in the [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]], [[North America]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Europe]] – in reference to [[Asian people|people from Asia]].{{efn|1= Some current dictionaries do not record any offensive meaning ("an unskilled laborer or porter usually in or from the Far East hired for low or subsistence wages" [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=coolie Merriam-Webster]) or make a distinction between an offensive meaning in referring to "a person from the Indian subcontinent or of [[Non-resident Indian|Indian descent]]" and an at least originally inoffensive, old-fashioned meaning, for example "''dated'' an unskilled native labourer in [[South Asia]], [[China]], and some other [[Asia]]n countries" ([https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/coolie Compact Oxford English Dictionary]). However, some dictionaries indicate that the word may be considered offensive in all contexts today. For example, [[Dictionary.com]]
considers all uses of the noun "Disparaging and Offensive".  [http://pewebdic2.cw.idm.fr Longman]'s 1995 edition had "''old-fashioned'' an unskilled worker who is paid very low wages, especially in parts of Asia", but the current version adds "''taboo old-fashioned'' a very offensive word ... Do not use this word.}} This is particularly so in [[South Africa]], [[East Africa]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Malema-under-fire-over-slur-on-Indians-20111020 |title = Malema under fire over slur on Indians |date = 20 October 2011 |publisher = [[News24|News 24]] |accessdate = 24 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the [[parliament of South Africa]] enacted the Promotion of Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, which has among its primary objectives the prevention of [[hate speech]] terms such as coolie (koelie).&lt;ref name="Ppudaact"/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word are uncertain but it is thought to have originated from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for a payment for work, ''kuli'' ({{lang|ta|கூலி}}).&lt;ref name="oed_full"&gt;{{Citation |title = Oxford English Dictionary |url = http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/40991 |accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136194/coolie |title = Britannica Academic Edition |accessdate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative etymological explanation is that the word came from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''qulī'' ({{lang|hi|क़ुली}}, قلی), which itself could be from the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] word for slave (or as a general name for imperial subjects regardless of other social status), [[:wikt:قول|قول]] (''qul'').&lt;ref name=oed_full/&gt; Another explanation is that the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''qulī'' originated from the Gujarati aboriginal tribe or caste known as ''Kuli'', and the word was picked up by the Portuguese who then used it in South India, hence the Tamil word ''kuli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/coolie|title=coolie|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in this sense for labourers from India. In 1727, Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Engelbert Kaempfer|Engelbert Kämpfer]] described "coolies" as dock labourers who would unload Dutch merchant ships at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="Kämpfer"&gt;{{cite book

The Chinese phrase [[wikt:苦|苦]][[wikt:力|力]] ([[pinyin]]: kǔlì) literally translates as "bitter strength" but is more commonly understood as meaning "bitter labour".

==History of the coolie trade==
Social and political pressure led to the abolition of the slave trade throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1807, with other European nations following suit. Labour-intensive industries, such as [[cotton plantation|cotton]] and [[sugar plantation]]s, mines and railway construction, in the colonies were left without a cheap source of manpower.&lt;ref name="ChineseCoolies5"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://personal.anderson.ucla.edu/eloisa.borah/chronology.pdf |title = Chronology of Filipinos in America Pre-1989 |author=Eloisa Gomez Borah |year=1997 |work=Anderson School of Management |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] |accessdate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, a large-scale slavery-like trade in Asian (primarily Indian and Chinese) indentured labourers began in the 1820s to fill this vacuum. Some of these labourers signed contracts based on misleading promises, some were kidnapped and sold into the trade, some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to coolie brokers, while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joaquin |last=Gonzalez |title=Filipino American Faith in Action: Immigration, Religion, and Civic Engagement |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vxdJXdqPuuEC&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=filipino%20landing%20morro%20bay&amp;pg=PA20 |year=2009 |publisher=NYU Press |ISBN = 9780814732977 |pages=21–22 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Yo |editor1-last=Jackson |title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcurFqnQioC&amp;lpg=PA216 |year=2006 |publisher=SAGE |ISBN = 9781412909488 |page=216 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

In addition to having their passage paid for, Coolies were also paid under twenty cents per day, on average. However, over a dollar would be taken from them every month in order to pay off their debts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Distant |first=W.L |year = 1874 |title = Eastern Coolie Labour |url= |journal = The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=3 |page = 145  }}&lt;/ref&gt; British companies were the first to experiment with this potential new form of cheap labour in 1807, when they imported 200 Chinese men to work in [[Trinidad]].

Much like slave plantations, there were preconceived notions of how different ethnicities worked. In his paper "Eastern Coolie Labour," W. L. Distant recalled his time on an estate observing the work ethic and behaviors of Coolies. Just as many believed that Africans had an affinity for hard outdoor labor, Distant believed that Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Coolies were different in their ability to perform certain jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Indian Coolies were viewed as lower in status. Those who ran estates believed that Chinese and Japanese Coolies were harder working, united, and clean. Indian Coolies, on the other hand, were viewed as dirty and were treated as children who required constant supervision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although there are reports of ships for Asian coolies carrying women and children, the great majority of them were men. Regulations were put in place as early as 1837 by the [[British Raj|British authorities in India]] to safeguard these principles of voluntary, contractual work and safe and sanitary transportation, although in practice this rarely occurred (especially during examples such as the Pacific Passage or the Guano Pits of Peru). The Chinese government also made efforts to secure the well-being of their nation's workers, with representations being made to relevant governments around the world.

=== Chinese coolies ===
Workers from China were mainly transported to work in [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]]. However, many Chinese laborers worked in British colonies such as Singapore, [[Jamaica]], [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]), [[British Malaya]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]) - as well as in the Dutch colonies within the [[Dutch East Indies]], and [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Chinese-in-the-English-Speaking-Caribbean.html : Chinese in the English-Speaking Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Look Lai |first=Walton |title = The Chinese in the West Indies: a documentary history, 1806–1995 |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of the West Indies Press|The Press University of the West Indies]] |ISBN = 976-640-021-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shipment of Chinese labourers was to the British colony of [[Trinidad]] in 1806.

In 1847, two ships from Cuba transported workers to [[Havana]] to work in the sugar cane fields from the port of [[Xiamen]], one of the five Chinese [[treaty port]]s opened to the British by the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. The trade soon spread to other ports in [[Guangdong]], and demand became particularly strong in Peru for workers in the [[silver mine]]s and the [[guano]] collecting industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Asia-Canada:Chinese Coolies |url = http://asia-canada.ca/changing-perspectives/chinese/chinese-labour-builds-cpr |accessdate = 14 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507045115/http://asia-canada.ca/changing-perspectives/chinese/chinese-labour-builds-cpr |archive-date = 7 May 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = American Involvement in the Coolie Trade |url = http://www.ea.sinica.edu.tw/eu_file/12011679494.pdf |accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Chinese Coolies in Cuba |url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1876/07/16/81694895.pdf |accessdate=14 June 2013 |work = The New York Times |date=16 July 1876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Chinese Indentured Labour in Peru |url = http://www.historytoday.com/lawrence-clayton/chinese-indentured-labour-peru |accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia began importing workers in 1848, and the United States began using them in 1865 on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] construction. These workers were deceived about their terms of employment to a much greater extent than their Indian counterparts, and consequently, there was a much higher level of Chinese emigration during this period.

[[File:Amoy, from Kulangseu.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the [[Xiamen|port of Amoy]], where many Chinese labourers were shipped to foreign lands, by Edwin Joshua Dukes.]]
The trade flourished from 1847 to 1854 without incident, until reports began to surface of the mistreatment of the workers in Cuba and Peru. As the British government had political and legal responsibility for many of the ports involved - including [[Amoy]] - such ports were immediately closed. Despite these closures, the trade simply shifted to the more accommodating port within the Portuguese enclave of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

Many coolies were first deceived or kidnapped and, then kept in [[barracoon]]s (detention centres) or loading vessels in the ports of departure, as were [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]]. Their voyages, which are sometimes called the Pacific Passage, were as inhumane and dangerous as the notorious [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=britain1&gt;{{cite web |title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trade2&gt;{{Citation |title=Slave Trade:Coolie Trade |url = http://facweb.northseattle.edu/cadler/Global_Dialogues/Readings/Monkey_Hunting_Readings/Slave%20Trade%20Coolie%20Trade.pdf |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality was very high;  it is estimated that from 1847 to 1859, the average mortality rate for coolies aboard ships to Cuba was 15.2 percent, and losses among those aboard ships to Peru were as high as 40 percent in the 1850s, and 30.44 percent from 1860 to 1863.&lt;ref name=Trade2/&gt;

They were sold and were taken to work in plantations or mines with very bad living and working conditions. The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not live out their term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment. Survivors were often forced to remain in servitude beyond the contracted period. The coolies who worked on the sugar plantations in Cuba and in the guano beds of the [[Chincha Islands]] (the islands of Hell) of Peru were treated brutally. Seventy-five percent of the Chinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period. In 1860 it was calculated that of the 4000 coolies brought to the Chinchas since the trade began, not one had survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th edition |article=Coolie |year=1877 |publisher=Adam and Charles Black }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these unbearable conditions, Chinese coolies often revolted against their Ko-Hung bosses and foreign company bosses at ports of departure, on ships, and in foreign lands. The coolies were put in the same neighbourhoods as Africans and, since most were unable to return to their homeland or have their wives come to the New World, many married African women. The coolies' interracial relationships and marriages with Africans, Europeans and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples, formed some of the modern world's [[Afro-Asian]] and [[Asian Latin American]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |title = Taste of Peru |publisher = Taste of Peru |date =  |accessdate = 2013-06-16 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927041027/http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |archive-date = 27 September 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-311X2006001100018 Influência da aculturação na autopercepção dos idosos quanto à saúde bucal em uma população de origem japonesa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf Identity, Rebellion, and Social Justice Among Chinese Contract Workers in Nineteenth-Century Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035052/http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html CIA – The World Factbook].

Chinese immigration to the United States was almost entirely voluntary, but working and social conditions were still harsh.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1868, the [[Burlingame Treaty]] allowed unrestricted Chinese immigration into the country. Within a decade significant levels of anti-Chinese sentiment had built up, stoked by populists such as [[Denis Kearney]] with racist slogans – "To an American, death is preferable to life on a par with the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/3437.htm University of Arkansas] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029040736/http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/3437.htm |date = 29 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese workers]] contributed to the building of the first First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States and of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in western Canada, Chinese settlement was discouraged after completion of the construction. California's [[Anti-Coolie Act of 1862]] levied a monthly tax on Chinese immigrants doing business in the state, and the federal [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] prohibited immigration of Chinese laborers (repealed 1943).

Despite attempts to restrict the influx of cheap labour from China, beginning in the 1870s Chinese workers helped construct a vast network of [[levee]]s in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]]. These levees made thousands of acres of fertile [[marsh]]lands available for agricultural production.

The 1879 [[Constitution of the State of California]] declared that "Asiatic coolieism is a form of human slavery, and is forever prohibited in this State, and all contracts for coolie labour shall be void."&lt;ref name="calcon"&gt;[http://www.stcl.edu/faculty_pages/faculty_folders/steiner/aal/thechineseincalifornia_files/frame.htm#slide0019.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927160736/http://www.stcl.edu/faculty_pages/faculty_folders/steiner/aal/thechineseincalifornia_files/frame.htm#slide0019.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} The Chinese in California, 1850–1879&lt;/ref&gt;

''Colonos asiáticos'' is a Spanish term for coolies.&lt;ref name="Narvaez, Benjamin N 1886"&gt;Narvaez, Benjamin N. "Chinese Coolies in Cuba and Peru: Race, Labor, and Immigration, 1839–1886." (2010): 1–524. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish colony of Cuba feared slavery uprisings such as those that took place in Haiti and used coolies as a transition between slaves and free labor. They were neither free nor slaves. Indentured Chinese servants also labored in the [[sugarcane]] fields of Cuba well after the 1884 abolition of slavery in that country. Two scholars of Chinese labor in Cuba, Juan Pastrana and Juan Perez de la Riva, substantiated horrific conditions of Chinese coolies in Cuba&lt;ref name="CubanCoolies7"&gt;{{Citation |title = Significance of Chinese Coolies to Cuba |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jaas/summary/v004/4.2yun.html |accessdate=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that coolies were slaves in all but name.&lt;ref name="CubanCoolies7" /&gt; Denise Helly is one researcher who believes that despite their slave-like treatment, the free and legal status of the Asian laborers in Cuba separated them from slaves. The coolies could challenge their superiors, run away, petition government officials, and rebel according to Rodriguez Pastor and Trazegnies Granda.&lt;ref&gt;Helly, "Idéologie et ethnicité"; Rodríguez Pastor, "Hijos del Celeste Imperio"; Trazegnies Granda, "En el país de las colinas de arena", Tomo II&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had fulfilled their contracts the ''colonos asiáticos'' integrated into the countries of Peru, [[The Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]] and Cuba. They adopted cultural traditions from the natives and also welcomed in non-Chinese to experience and participate into their own traditions.&lt;ref name="Narvaez, Benjamin N 1886"/&gt; Before the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] had Latin America's largest [[Chinatown]].

In South America, Chinese indentured labourers worked in Peru's silver mines and coastal industries (i.e., [[guano]], sugar, and cotton) from the early 1850s to the mid-1870s; about 100,000 people immigrated as [[Indentured servant|indentured]] workers. They participated in the [[War of the Pacific]], looting and burning down the [[haciendas]] where they worked, after the [[occupation of Lima|capture of Lima]] by the invading Chilean army in January 1880. Some 2000 coolies even joined the Chilean Army in Peru, taking care of the wounded and burying the dead. Others were sent by Chileans to work in the newly conquered [[Tarapacá Region|nitrate fields]].&lt;ref name="bonilla"&gt;Bonilla, Heraclio. 1978. The National and Colonial Problem in Peru. ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation, of which later U.S. president [[Herbert Hoover]] was a director, was instrumental in supplying Chinese coolie labour to South African mines from c.1902 to c.1910 at the request of mine owners, who considered such labour cheaper than native African and white labour.&lt;ref name="Liggett 1930"&gt;[[Walter Liggett]], The Rise of Herbert Hoover (New York, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; The horrendous conditions suffered by the coolie labourers led to questions in the British parliament as recorded in [[Hansard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Indian South Africans:Coolie commission 1872|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/report-coolie-commission-1872|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, the British, French and Chinese governments agreed to mitigate the abuse by requiring all traders to pay for the return of all workers after their contract ended. The employers in the [[British West Indies]] declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse than those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better – if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the [[Qing government]], put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt; By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title = The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847–1874 |last = Meagher |first = Arnold J. |year=2008 |publisher = Arnold J. |accessdate = 2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''coolie'' was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in German Samoa. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their "coolie" labour supply from China. In 1908 a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914. More than 2000 Chinese "coolies" were present in the islands in 1914 and most were eventually repatriated by the New Zealand administration.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

By the 1820s, many Indians (they were referred to as Klings, or [[Keling]], which was used as a derogatory word, much as the word Coolie&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life. European merchants and businessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting them for work as a cheap source of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Coolie (Asian labourers) |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136194/coolie |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Chinese American Experience:1857–1892 |url = http://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/2KeyIssues/CoolieLabor.htm |accessdate = 29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British began shipping Indians to colonies around the world, including [[British Mauritius]], [[Colony of Fiji|British Fiji]], [[Colony of Natal|British Natal]], [[British East Africa]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|British Tanganyika]], [[British Somaliland]], [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|British Bechuanaland]], [[Seychelles|British Seychelles]], [[Uganda Protectorate|British Uganada]], [[Northern Rhodesia|British Northern Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia|British Rhodesia]], [[Nyasaland|British Nyasaland]], [[British Guiana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago#British rule|British Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Colony of Jamaica|British Jamaica]], [[Saint Lucia|British Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Grenada]], [[British Honduras]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Barbados|British Barbados]], the rest of the [[British West Indies]], and [[British Malaya]]. The Dutch shipped workers to labor on the plantations on [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Surinam]] the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The French shipped laborers to [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[French Guiana]], the rest of the [[French West Indies]], and [[Réunion]].

A system of agents was used to infiltrate the rural villages of India and recruit labourers. They would often deceive the credulous workers about the great opportunities that awaited them for their own material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], but also from [[Tamil Nadu]] and other areas to the south of the country.&lt;ref name="whkmla"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/lse/lse2.html |title = History of Indian and Chinese Coolies and their Descendants |accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians had faced a great number of social and economic disasters, causing them to be more eager than other groups to leave India. In the last part of the nineteenth century alone, there were 24 famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture |last=Gaiutra |first=Bahadur |publisher=Chicago University Press |year=2014 |ISBN = |location=Chicago |page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without permission from the [[British Raj|British authorities]], the French transported Indian workers to their sugar producing colony, [[Reunion Island]], from as early as 1826. By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.&lt;ref name=CoolieLabor18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Lucia's Indian Arrival Day|year=2009|publisher=Caribbean Repeating Islands|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/st-lucia’s-indian-arrival-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began to transport Indians to [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean islands|Indian Ocean]], starting in 1829. [[Slavery]] had been abolished, with the planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites.&lt;ref name=SouthAsianLabourers4&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian indentured labourers |publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |year=2010 |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, the [[East India Company|Raj]] issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]

Despite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[Réunion|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt; Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being "dirty".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these indiscretions were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

The first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

In 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.

[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]

Starting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–71|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

This system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government. By that time tens of thousands of Chinese workers were being used along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] by the [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] (see [[Chinese Labour Corps]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/labour.htm The Long, Long Trail: The Labour Corps of 1917–1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex ratios and intermarriage among coolies===

A major difference between the Chinese and the Indian coolie trades was that women and children were brought from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=8|pages=|year=2008|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=Temple University Press|volume=|author=Lisa Yun|quote=|location=|title=The Coolie Speaks: Chinese Indentured Laborers and African Slaves in Cuba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWSC2ynmdgAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=indian+coolie+woman+chinese+men&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nm2TVfLJEIeQyQTRwrHgAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20coolie%20woman%20chinese%20men&amp;f=false|isbn=1592135838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities like Indian women and mixed race Creole women.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Patricia Mohammd, "Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947," in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed. Nicola Foote (New York: Routledge, 2013), 192-194.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese women were scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the migration was dominated by Chinese men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=69|pages=|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=walton+look+lie+carribean+chinese+indian+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=we2SVaqOPIj5yQS074HgAg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=walton%20look%20lie%20carribean%20chinese%20indian%20women&amp;f=false|isbn=9004182136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 1940s men made up the vast majority of the Costa Rican Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=116|pages=|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9004182136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=68|pages=|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9004182136}}&lt;/ref&gt; One stark difference between Indian and Chinese coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the Chinese communities in Manila, Singapore, Mauritius, New Zealand, Victoria in Australia, the United States, and Victoria in British Columbia in Canada were all male dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=348|pages=|year=1995|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|volume=Volume 22 of McGill-Queen's studies in ethnic history|issn=0846-8869|edition=illustrated|author=Brian L.

Generally, it was believed that women were unwilling to perform the hard outdoor labor. Those who did perform it were still seen as not as good as men.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Mohammd, "Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947," in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed.

==In art, entertainment, and media==

===Films===
In the 1957 film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', when his officers are ordered to participate in the construction of the bridge, British officer Col. Nicholson ([[Alec Guinness]]) declares that they will not be used as coolies by their captors. The enlisted men cheer when their social betters are excused the work.
[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|''Coolie'']] (1983) is an Indian film about a coolie, played by [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who works at a railway station and has a lover. His lover's father once murdered a girl's father in an attempt to force her to marry him, but she did not give in. After 10&amp;nbsp;years of imprisonment, he flooded her village (injuring her new husband) and causing her to awaken with amnesia. It also starred [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Kader Khan]], [[Waheeda Rehman]] among others.

In the racially controversial film "[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]" (1932) [[Sir Denis Nayland Smith]] mentions his team's temporarily hired Chinese workers at the 27:20 mark regarding [[Dr. Fu Manchu]], "... his spies are all around us. I can't even trust our own coolies."

The film "The Sand Pebbles" (1966) depicts coolies working as laborers assisting American sailors aboard an American gun boat in 1926 civil war era China. The story, among many parallel story lines, involves an American Navy engineer (Steve McQueen) befriending a coolie working under his command (Mako) in the engine room. The film was nominated for 8 Oscars. Richard Attenborough won the best supporting actor Golden Globe.

The film ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992) shows a white power skinhead named Hando (played by [[Russell Crowe]]) expressing distress about the idea of being a coolie in his own country. Also, the gang he directs makes frequent attacks at gangs of working class Vietnamese Australians.

The documentary film directed by [[Yung Chang]] called ''[[Up the Yangtze]]'' (2007) follows the life of a family in China that is relocated due to the flooding of the Yangtze. The daughter is sent directly from finishing middle school to work on a cruise ship for western tourists, to earn money for her family. Her father referred to himself as a "coolie" who used to carry bags on and off of boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://films.nfb.ca/up-the-yangtze/index.php |title=Up the Yangtze (Trailer) by Yung Chang – NFB |publisher=Films.nfb.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In ''[[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|Hell on Wheels]]'' (e.g., [[Hell on Wheels (season 3)|season 3, episode 1]]), frequent references are made to the hardworking, underpaid Chinese coolies who helped build the [[Transcontinental Railroad]].

===Books===
In the 1899 novelette ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]], the captain is transporting a group of coolies in the South China Sea.

===Music===
The 2014 [[Chutney music|chutney]] song called ''Coolie Bai Dance'' by the [[Indo-Guyanese]] singer, Romeo "Mystic" Nermal, is about the lifestyle of the traditional, villager  "coolie" ([[Indo-Caribbean]]) people in [[Guyana]] and the rest of the [[Caribbean]].

A '''council of war''' is a term in [[military science]] that describes a meeting held to decide on a course of action, usually in the midst of a battle. Under normal circumstances, decisions are made by a commanding officer, optionally communicated and coordinated by staff officers, and then implemented by subordinate officers. Councils of war are typically held when matters of great importance must be decided, consensus must be reached with subordinates, or when the commanding officer is unsure of his position. The classic council of war includes a discussion and then a vote, often taken without the senior commander present to influence or intimidate the subordinates. The tradition in such meetings is that the officers vote in reverse sequence of their seniority, with the junior officers voting first.

A variation on the traditional council of war is one in which the subordinates vote, but the results are considered merely advisory to the overall commander, who then makes a final decision. Such a meeting was held on July 2, 1863, during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in which [[Major General]] [[George G. Meade]], commanding the [[Union army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], convened his [[Corps]] commanders and staff to discuss whether they should withdraw from the battlefield or, if not, whether they should attack [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] army or await his attack. Historical evidence indicates that Meade had already determined to stay and await Lee's attack, which occurred on July 3, the disastrous attack known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. But Meade formed consensus in his staff and improved their confidence by encouraging a two-hour discussion and vote, which resulted in the outcome he was seeking.

In civilian usage, ''council of war'' can describe any important meeting, such as in business, that must reach a decision under the pressure of adverse conditions.

Since 2004, the President of the Cyprus Red Cross has been Fotini Papadopoulou, daughter of [[Anastasios George Leventis]] and wife of former President of Cyprus [[Tassos Papadopoulos]]

==History==
The Cyprus Red Cross was created in 1950, while Cyprus was under [[Modern history of Cyprus|British rule]], as a voluntary aid society and was originally operating as a branch of the [[British Red Cross]]; it was later evolved into the Cyprus Red Cross Society after the independence of Cyprus from the [[United Kingdom]] and the establishment of the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960.  After the Independence of Cyprus, the society was recognised by the Cyprus Red Cross law of 1967 as the National Red Cross Society of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csodirectory-cyprus.eu/gcc/?id=165|title=Civil Society Organizations directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus Red Cross is a properly constituted [[Red Cross Society|National Society]], recognised as an auxiliary to the public authorities in the humanitarian field by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, where the four [[Geneva Conventions]] are in force. 
Cyprus Red Cross is an autonomous body directed by its Central Committee, operating under the Cyprus Red Cross Law of 1967 and its own statutes and in conformity with the fundamental principles of the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

The Society, was recognised by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) on 23 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/interview/2012/cyprus-interview-2012-02-23.htm|title=Cyprus Red Cross Society: the Movement's 188th National Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted in the [[International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC), in accordance with the terms defined in the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of the International Federation, on 12 November 2013; it constitutes the [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|188th member]] of the [[International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement]].

==Organisation==
The main authorities of the SRCS are the General Assembly, the Council and the Executive Committee, which are responsible for the policy and overall administration.  It has 6 branches, one for each district, namely:

* [[Nicosia]]
* [[Larnaca]]
* [[Paphos]]
* [[Kyrenia]]
* [[Famagusta]]
* [[Limassol]]

In addition, the Society has a '''Youth Section'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.cy/en/branches--youth-section/youth-section-history|title= The Cyprus Red Cross Youth Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1973.

==Activities==
The Cyprus Red Cross carries out a wide spectrum of activities, primarily based on volunteers from all segments of society, in response to vulnerabilities among people in Cyprus and abroad, ranging from alleviation of the hardships of those internally displaced as a result of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974 invasion]], day-to-day response to local disasters and social hardship, to public information about new and re-emerging threats to health.

==The Cyprus Red Cross Youth Section==
Members of the Cyprus Red Cross Youth Section (CRCYS) participate in all of the Cyprus Red Cross activities but are especially active in the following projects:

'''Services to Society'''
*Blood Donation – blood donation groups are organised within the secondary schools and contribute a substantial proportion of the needs in blood in Cyprus.
*The Red Cross Children Therapy Centre – the centre is warmly embraced by the youth section by offering material as well as psychological and emotional support to the children. In addition, it contributes a substantial sum towards the operational expenses of the centre on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.cy/en/crc-children-therapy-centre|title=The Cyprus Red Cross Children Therapy Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visits to Institutions – groups of the CRCYS volunteers adopt one or more humanitarian institutions which they visit regularly offering recreation and presents to the inmates.
*Help to Needy Families – members visit needy families and talk with them about their problems and possible solutions and provide them with food, clothing and toys for the children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenationalherald.com/32991/cyprus-red-cross-feeds-needy|title=Food parcel distribution to the needy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enclaved Children – Every Christmas and Easter the Youth Section sends presents to the [[Enclaved Greek Cypriots|enclaved Greek Cypriot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2016.nsf/mfa11_en/mfa11_en?OpenDocument|title=The Enclaved of Cyprus}}&lt;/ref&gt; children that live in the north of Cyprus. 
*Emergency Relief – The CRCYS participates in the general Cyprus Red Cross Disaster Relief Scheme and is always ready to help and relieve sufferers of natural disasters.  The Youth Section also participated most actively and effectively in the relief of the victims of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2016.nsf/mfa08_en/mfa08_en?OpenDocument|title=Cyprus:A historical review}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Help to other Countries - The section participates in provision of assistance to victims of armed conflicts and natural disasters in other countries by supplying items of immediate need and even sending representatives and aid to children in stricken areas as it did in [[Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș|Romania in March 1990]].

'''Services to members of the CRCYS'''
*Seminars and lectures - Members take part in national and international seminars that promote information exchange, education and a spirit of solidarity among the young members of the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].  The CRCYS also organizes lectures on the prevention/handling of serious problems that threaten society, especially the youth, such as drugs, AIDS, smoking, violence etc.
*Excursions, Recreation and Performances – The CRCYS organizes these activities to enable the members in becoming more acquainted with one another and to create a sense of friendship and cooperation.
*Camping – this national activity is organized every July at the Mitsis School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gym-lemithou-lem.schools.ac.cy/index.php?id=homepage|title=Emporiki Scholi Mitsi}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lemithou]] and it’s open to all youth members of the CRCYS.  The camping event serves as both a pleasant holiday to members from needy families and a meeting platform of all the Cyprus Red Cross youth members.

'''Protection of the Environment'''
*Tree Planting- this event is organized together with the Cyprus Forest Department &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/fd/fd.nsf/DMLindex_en/DMLindex_en?OpenDocument|title=The Forest Department of Cyprus}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the members get to actively join the reforestation of the island by planting their own trees.
*Cleaning Campaign- the CRCYS undertakes the cleaning of parks, beaches and other public spaces.

'''Fundraising'''
*Door to Door collection – The Youth participate most actively in this yearly, national Cyprus Red Cross event that takes place around the 8th of May (World Red Cross Day)
*Christmas Bazaar – this major event takes place around the Christmas holiday every year at certain public locations where everybody can buy various sweets prepared by the CRCYS, Christmas decorations and presents. In addition, people can join games and listen to Christmas carols performed by the Youth Section choirs.
*Christmas Carols - Youth Section choirs sing Christmas carols at institutions, companies, shopping malls and neighborhoods thus creating a festive atmosphere but also collecting money for further activities.

The '''Eight Immortals of Huainan''' ({{zh|s=淮南八仙|p=Huáinán bāxiān}}), also known as the '''Eight Gentlemen''' (八公 bāgōng), were the eight scholars under the patronage of [[Liu An]] (劉安 Liú Ān), the prince of [[Huainan]] during the [[Western Han Dynasty]]. They are not deified in any [[religion]]s and the ''[[Xian (Daoist)|xian]]'' ("immortal") is used [[metaphor]]ically to describe their talent. Together, they wrote the philosophical collection ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (淮南子, Huáinánzǐ, literally "The Philosophers of Huainan"). 

They were:

* Jin Chang (晉昌 jǐn chāng),
* Lei Bei (雷被 leí beì),
* Li Shang (李尚 lǐ shàng),
* Mao Bei (毛被 máo beì),
* Su Fei (蘇非 sū feì),
* Tian You (田由 tián yoú),
* Wu Bei (伍被 wǔ beì), and
* Zuo Wu (左吳 zǔo wú).

The "Bagong Mountain" ("Eight Gentlemen Mountain") in China is named after them.

A portrait of Emily painted in 1878 by [[Theodore Blake Wirgman]] shows her with a violin, and in December 1880 she was one of the instrumentalists for the Congregational Band of Hope in the Richmond Hill Congregational School-room, Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampshire Telegraph'', 24 December 1880, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1881 she held a notable fancy dress dance "at the Assembly Room of the Red House, Bournemouth".&lt;ref&gt;''Hampshire Telegraph'', 15 January 1881, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1882 she held a "fashionable concert" at the Red House in aid of funds for the Bournemouth Dispensary.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampshire Telegraph'', 16 September 1882, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1881 she was staying in [[Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name=camp/&gt; An enthusiastic supporter of [[women's suffrage]], she made her first speech in favour of it at [[Caxton Hall|Westminster Town Hall]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=camp/&gt;

In Bournemouth, on 15 December 1883, suffragettes Laura Ormiston Grant and Caroline Biggs "held a drawing-room meeting at the home of Mrs Langton (The Red House, Derby Road)".&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uUrKCVn9VZkC&amp;pg=PA166 ''The Women's Suffrage Movement in Britain and Ireland: A Regional Survey'']. Routledge, 2013. p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Langton is listed at the Red House in [[Kelly's Directory]] of Hampshire for 1885.&lt;ref name=camp/&gt;

When her father died in 1887 she succeeded to Gunby Hall and resumed her maiden name by royal licence, and thenceforth went by "Mrs. Massingberd" rather than "Mrs. Langton". For the next four years she managed the estate herself, and then moved to London.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{Cite ODNB|first=Mark|last=Clement|title=Massingberd, Emily Caroline Langton (1847–1897)|id=53060|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In London she involved herself in the temperance, [[anti-vivisectionist]], and [[women's movement]]s. Becoming a vice-president of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]], a Manchester-based temperance movement, she was also honorary treasurer to [[Lady Henry Somerset]]'s Cottage Homes for Inebriates, a farm colony for women at Duxhurst, just south of [[Reigate]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

===Pioneer Club===
Massingberd founded the [[Pioneer Club (women's club)|Pioneer Club]] in 1892 to provide women, in particular middle-class women and unmarried women, with a place to socialise outside their homes, "a place where women gathered to meet each other, to help each other and to discuss the leading questions and principal progressive work of the day". It remained active until 1939.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

It was the only British club to be affiliated to the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]].&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

By 1895 it had more than 300 members (by 1899 more than 600), stressed the unimportance of social position,&lt;ref name=looker/&gt; provided members and their guests with meals and on Thursday evenings organised lectures, debates and discussion on social political and literary themes. Speakers included [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Millicent Fawcett]], [[Hannah Whitall Smith|Mrs Pearsall Smith]], [[Lady Henry Somerset]] and [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]]. Men might be invited by members on Wednesday evenings.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD&gt;{{Cite ODNB|first=David|last=Doughan|title=Pioneer Club (act. 1892–1939)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/96079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
Following a long illness, Emily Langton Massingberd underwent a serious operation at [[Llandudno]] in Wales, but a few weeks later died on 28 January 1897. She was 50 years old.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Following Massingberd's untimely death, [[L. T. Meade]] wrote a novel in 1898 based on her life titled ''The Cleverest Woman in England''.&lt;ref name="Irish Women's Writing"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=w583DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women and Power"&gt;https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gunby-estate-hall-and-gardens/features/women-and-power-emily-massingberd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=pNhTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&lt;/ref&gt; In it she writes of the protagonist:

{{quote|She was one of the pioneers in a great movement; and although her life ceased when her work was hardly begun, there are still some women in London who remember her, and can never forget her ... who but for her would not have dared to break through the thraldom of the narrow walls of old prejudice, and those women still in memory hear her voice, and touch her hand.&lt;ref name="Irish Women's Writing"/&gt;}}

'''Fashion activism''' is the practice of using fashion as a means of social change. It merges popular styles of dress, from clothing and shoes, to headwear and accessories, with efforts to implement social and political change. '''Fashion activism''' can be used as a form of [[Protest|protest]], whether expressing dissent or support. 

The term 'fashion activism' was coined by designer [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/fashion/refugees-fashion-slow-factory.html?_r=0 Céline Semaan]. The New York based founder of the design and tech lab Slow Factory has used key items in her collections as means of fashion activism; a 'Dignity Key' necklace with which people can show support for displaced Middle Eastern refugees, a 'Banned' scarf showing the universal impact of President Trump's Muslim ban, and a '1st Amendment Flight Jacket' collaboration with [[American_Civil_Liberties_Union|ACLU]], featuring the [[First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|First Amendment]] text written in Arabic, standing up to the rise in [[Islamophobia_in_the_United_States|islamophobia in the United States]] and [[Hate_crime|hate crimes]] against American Muslims.

Other examples of fashion activism range from apparel with [[Peace_symbols|peace sign]] symbols that were popularized in the mid-1900s, to the [[Make_America_Great_Again|'Make America Great Again']] hats sported by Donald Trump supporters throughout and following the 2016 presidential campaign. 

== Fashion Design Items That Influenced Socio-Political Events ==
 

=== The Mini Skirt ===


The mini skirt made its debut in 1964 and quickly became a bastion of youth culture and defiance&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, L. (2014, September 22). A History of the Miniskirt: How Fashion’s Most Daring Hemline Came To Be. Retrieved July 14, 2017, from http://stylecaster.com/history-of-the-miniskirt/
&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Mary Quant]], the London-based designer responsible for the skirt, sought to reflect an era that was “arrogant, aggressive, and sexy.”&lt;ref&gt;Parks, C. (2015, March 23). The Miniskirt: An Evolution From The '60s To Now. Retrieved July 14, 2017, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/23/mini-skirt-evolution_n_6894040.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the mini skirt was a popular choice for independent and progressive women in the 1960s. During the violent protests and events of [[May 1968 in France]], the mini skirt became a symbol of female revolution and defiance. [[Andre Courrèges]] popularized the hemline in France. While the nostalgia of the 1970s saw a return to more conventional hemlines, the mini skirt persists as a symbol of women’s rights and sexual liberation to this day.

=== The Slogan T-Shirt ===

 
The slogan T-shirt has been favored by activists since its inception. Fueled by the DIY ethos of the punk era, [[Vivienne Westwood|Vivienne Westwood’s]] subversive t-shirt designs brought the slogan aesthetic into the mainstream in the 1970s. In 1979, designer [[Katharine Hamnett]] launched a label and line of shirts driven by the concept of ‘[[right livelihood]];’ the shirt slogans were based on the central messages of [[Buddhism]]. The T-shirts were “designed to be seminal, to make people think, and then hopefully act,” Hamnett said in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ethical Designer Katharine Hamnett. (2013, November 21). Retrieved July 14, 2017, from http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/351665-katharine-hamnett-interview/
&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, slogan tees have become a staple in popular culture, from runways to stadiums. British designer Daniel W. Fletcher organized an anti-Brexit sit-in with protesters wearing “stay” shirts and hoodies. Many prominent designers and labels such as [[Dior]], Public School, [[Everlane]], and [https://slowfactory.com/ Slow Factory] have produced slogans supporting women’s rights, gay rights, immigrants, refugees, and conservation efforts.

=== The Keffiyeh ===
 
 
The [[Keffiyeh]] is a traditional black and white scarf worn around the head or neck. According to design critic Hala Malak, the Keffiyeh dates back to pre-Islamic [[Sumer]]. High priests would wear turbans and fishing nets when praying for prosperous fishing seasons; the integration of these two textiles eventually led to the classic fishnet pattern the Keffiyeh is known for. Following the [[1936 Arab Revolt]], the Keffiyeh became a symbol of political uprising and rebellion. It was not until the rise of [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]] in the 1960s that the scarf came to symbolize Palestinian solidarity. The scarf has appeared among many leftist groups and anti-war organizations. The scarf was appropriated as a fashion accessory in a 2007 [[Balenciaga]] show. The Keffiyeh is a fashion staple in the west, although few are aware of its rich political history.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K. (2007, February 10). Where Some See Fashion, Others See Politics. Retrieved July 14, 2017, from https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/fashion/shows/11KAFFIYEH.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [http://www.kaflab.org/ Kaflab Foundation] works with artists and designers to explore and destigmatize Arab heritage and identity through the Keffiyeh.

There is a small community of '''Indians in Argentina''' who are mainly immigrants from [[India]] and the neighboring countries in [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]] with [[Indo-Caribbean]] influence (i.e. [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Suriname]]) and some of whom were born in Argentina and are of Indian heritage.

==History==
The first Indians to arrive in [[Argentina]] were [[Sikhs]] from the Indian state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] who came to [[Argentina]] in the early 19th century to work on a British-built railroad. In the 1970s, others came after being barred entry to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the preferred destinations, along with Britain, for the emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhnet.com/news/indian-sikhs-grafting-argentina-culture: Indian Sikhs grafting onto Argentina culture.] sikhnet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina seemed the most promising of South American nations, and so they stayed, eventually concentrating in the north, which reminded them of the scrappy mountains and plains of Punjab. Most of the immigrants settled in [[Rosario de la Frontera]]. This remote northern Argentine town is home to the only Sikh [[gurdwara]] in South America. Today, there are about 300 of them,{{clarify|date=January 2014}} many of whom run supermarkets and other shops. Mixed marriages with Catholic Argentines are common.

A large number of Indians living in [[Buenos Aires]] are businessmen, doctors, financial or business executives, and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained their Indian citizenship.
Many [[Indo-Caribbean]]s from places like [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Suriname]] have also migrated to [[Argentina]].

==Culture==
The Indian community in Argentina has established an Indian Association in the northern provinces to organize social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals such as [[Diwali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalsindia.com/diwali-festival-in-argentina/ Diwali Festival In Argentina.] Festivals India.&lt;/ref&gt; Some community members are involved in keeping traditional cultural practices alive, such as [[ayurveda]], [[yoga]], [[Indian classical music]] and the [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani language]] and [[Punjabi language]].

'''Iranian Australians''' or '''Persian Australians''' are citizens of Australia whose national background or ancestry is traced from [[Iran]].

== Terminology ==
'''Iranian-Australian''' is used interchangeably with '''Persian-Australian''',&lt;ref name="Daha"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maryam|last=Daha|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0743558411402335|title=Contextual Factors Contributing to Ethnic Identity Development of Second-Generation Iranian American Adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|publisher=Sage journals|date=September 2011|accessdate=December 21, 2016|volume=26|issue=5|pages=543–569|doi=10.1177/0743558411402335|quote=... the majority of the participants self-identified themselves as Persian instead of Iranian, due to the stereotypes and negative portrayals of Iranians in the media and politics. Adolescents from Jewish and Baha'i faiths asserted their religious identity more than their ethnic identity. The fact Iranians use Persian interchangeably is nothing to do with current Iranian government because the name Iran was used before this period as well.

Cultural, religious and political, and various other differences among Iranians reflect their diverse social and interpersonal interactions. Some studies suggest that, despite the existence of subgroup within Iranian immigrants (e.g. various ethno-religious groups), their nationality as Iranians has been an important point of reference and identifiable source of their identification as a group across time and setting.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, in the [[Western world]], [[Name of Iran|Iran]] was known as "Persia". On the [[Nowruz]] of 1935, [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] asked foreign delegates to use the term '''Iran''', the [[endonym]] of the country used since the [[Sasanian Empire]], in formal correspondence. Since then the use of the word "Iran" has become more common in the Western countries. This also changed the usage of the terms for Iranian nationality, and the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from "Persian" to "Iranian". In 1959, the government of [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], Reza Shah Pahlavi's son, announced that both "Persia" and "Iran" could officially be used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="yarshater1"&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan [http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm Persia or Iran, Persian or Farsi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033230/http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm |date=2010-10-24 }}, ''Iranian Studies'', vol.

==History==

Few Iranians migrated to Victoria in the nineteenth century, with only seven recorded in the 1891 census. From 1950 to 1977, the first wave of immigration from Iran to Australia occurred, but it was relatively insignificant in terms of the number of immigrants. Annually, few thousand tourists entered Australia which only a few hundreds were immigrants during this period, mostly university students who decided to stay. The vast majority of Iran's emigrants left their homeland just after [[Iranian Revolution|the 1979 Islamic revolution]] which was end of 2500 years monarchy. For the period 1978–1980, the average number of Iranians entering Australia as immigrants annually increased to more than 5,000. From the period 1980–1988, there was a strong trend of emigration to Australia. Since 2000, there has been a wave of Iranian migration to Australia, especially engineers and doctors, through skilled migration program.

Iranians speak [[Persian language|Persian]] and also [[Azerbaijani Language|Azerbaijani Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] and some other languages and dialects are spoken in different regions of Iran. They practice the Iranian culture, which includes [[Nowruz]]. Along religious lines, both [[Muslim]] and non-Muslim Iranians reside in Australia. Non-Muslim Iranians include [[Iranian Christians]] mainly Eastern Armenian, Iranian [[Baha'is]], Iranian [[Persian Jews|Jews]] and Iranian [[Zoroastrians]]. The Bureau of Statistics reports that at the 2011 census the major religious affiliations amongst Iran-born were Islam (12 686) and Baha'i (6269). Of the Iran-born, 18.4 per cent stated 'No Religion', which was lower than that of the total Australian population (22.3 per cent), and 9.4 per cent did not state a religion.

Several sources have noted estimates of [[Iranian diaspora]] mainly left Iran since the 1979 revolution, the significant number of which currently reside in the United States and Western Europe while the community is Australia is very small. The Iranian-Australian community, in line with similar trends in Iran and other countries around the world, has produced a sizeable number of individuals notable in many fields, including Law, Medicine, Engineering, Business and [[Fine Arts]].

==Demography==

Large concentrations{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2015}} of Iranian Australians live in the state of [[New South Wales]], particularly around Sydney. There are also large concentrations in [[Melbourne]]. Smaller but also significant{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2015}} communities can be found in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.

In New South Wales, [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] and [[Baulkham Hills]] are suburbs with higher number of Iranians. Persian is 4th language spoken at home in North Shore region of Sydney. Persian is an accepted language in the NSW HSC and there is a Persian school in [[Ryde]], NSW.

In Victoria, Iranian culture is supported through the activities of organisations including the Iranian Society of Victoria and the Iranian Cultural School in East Doncaster, Vic.

==Iranian Australian census==
In 1991, the ABS figures revealed an Iranian population of 12,914. In 2004, 18,798 people in Australia claim to be of Iranian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By 2005, Iranian Australians had reached 24,588 with 11,536 of these residing in New South Wales.The largest populations of Iranian-Australians can be found in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland.

Iranian Australians have founded or participated in senior leadership positions of many major companies, including many Fortune 500 and Australian branch of companies such as GE, Intel, Verizon, Motorola, and AT&amp;T.

==Background==

===Origins===
{{Main|Caucasian origin of the Azerbaijanis|Iranian origin of the Azerbaijanis}}
A comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azeris are more related to the people of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], than they are to other [[Iran]]ians, as well as to [[Armenians]].

According to the scholar of historical geography, Xavier de Planhol:  “Azeri material culture, a result of this multi-secular symbiosis, is thus a subtle combination of indigenous elements and nomadic contributions…. It is a Turkish language learned and spoken by Iranian peasants”.&lt;ref&gt;De Planhol, X. (2005), “Lands of Iran” in Encyclopædia Iranica.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Richard Frye]]: "The Turkish speakers of Azerbaijan (q.v.) are mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers, several pockets of whom still exist in the region.".&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica"&gt;R.

Here they divided into Ottomans, who were [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and settled, and Turkmens, who were nomads and in part [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] (or, rather, [[Alevism|Alevi]]). The latter were to keep the name “Turkmen”for a long time: from the thirteenth century onwards they “Turkised” the Iranian populations of [[Azerbaijan]] (who spoke west Iranian languages such as [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Caucasian Tat]], which is still found in residual forms), thus creating a new identity based on Shiism and the use of Turkish. These are the people today known as Azeris.".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Roy. “The new Central Asia”, I.B. Tauris, 2007.Pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rybakov: "Speaking of the Azerbaijan culture originating at that time, in the XIV-XV cc., one must bear in mind, first of all, literature and other parts of culture organically connected with the language. As for the material culture, it remained traditional even after the Turkicization of the local population. However, the presence of a massive layer of Iranians that took part in the formation of the Azeri ethnos, have imposed its imprint, primarily on the lexicon of the Azeri language which contains a great number of Iranian and Arabic words. The latter entered both the Azeri and Turkish language mainly through the Iranian intermediary. Having become independent, the Azeri culture retained close connections with the Iranian and Arab cultures. They were reinforced by common religion and common cultural-historical traditions.”.&lt;ref name="Rybakov"&gt;"“History of the East” ("Transcaucasia in 11th-15th centuries" in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes. v. 2. “East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. – {{ISBN|5-02-017711-3}}. {{cite web |url=http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HE2/he2510.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713173615/http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HE2/he2510.htm |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }} )".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''The Persians are a people whose borders are the Mahat Mountains and Azerbaijan up to [[Armenia]] and [[Arran (Caucasus)|Aran]], and Bayleqan and [[Derbent|Darband]], and Ray and [[Tabaristan]] and Masqat and Shabaran and Jorjan and Abarshahr, and that is Nishabur, and Herat and Marv and other places in land of Khorasan, and Sejistan and Kerman and Fars and Ahvaz...All these lands were once one kingdom with one sovereign and one language...although the language differed slightly.

This claim is supported by the many figures of [[Persian literature]], such as [[Qatran Tabrizi]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Nizami (name)|Nezami]], and [[Khaghani]], who wrote in Persian prior to and during the Oghuz migration, as well as by [[Strabo]], Al-Istakhri, and Al-Masudi, who all describe the language of the region as [[Persian language|Persian]]. The claim is mentioned by other medieval historians, such as [[Al-Muqaddasi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Muqaddasi]], ''Ahsan al-Taqāsīm'', p. 259 &amp; 378, "... the Azerbaijani language is not pretty [...] but their Persian is intelligible, and in articulation it is very similar to the Persian of Khorasan ...", tenth century, Persia (retrieved 18 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Other common Perso-Azeribaijani features include Iranian place names such as [[Tabriz]]&lt;ref name="Tabriz"&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/SUS_TAV/TABRIZ.html "Tabriz"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515131323/http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/SUS_TAV/TABRIZ.html |date=2007-05-15 }} (retrieved 8 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and the name Azerbaijan itself.

Following the Russo-Persian Wars of [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|1804–13]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|1826–28]], the territories of the Iranian [[Qajar dynasty]] in the Caucasus were forcefully ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813 and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828 finalized the borders between the Russian Empire and Qajar Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harcave, Sidney|year=1968|title=Russia: A History: Sixth Edition|publisher=Lippincott|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirouz|year=2007|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran with Its 15 Neighbors in the Middle East by a Number of Renowned Experts in the Field|publisher=Universal|isbn=1-58112-933-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas to the north of the river [[Aras River|Aras]], including the territory of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia over the course of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski Borderland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Swietochowski|first=Tadeusz |authorlink= Tadeusz Swietochowski |year=1995|title=Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition|pages= 69, 133 |edition=  |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FfRYRwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Russia+and+Iran+in+the+great+game:+travelogues+and+orientalism|isbn=978-0-231-07068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century settled the modern-day boundary of [[Iran]], stripping it of all its Caucasian territories and incorporating them into the Russian Empire.

===Russo-Persian War (1826–28)===
The burden of the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)]] was on the tribes of [[Arasbaran|Qaradağ]] region, who being in front line, provided human resources and provision of Iranian army. In the wake of the war a significant fraction of the inhabitants of this area lived as nomadic tribes (ایلات). The major tribes included;  Cilibyanlu 1,500 tents and houses, Karacurlu 2500, Haji Alilu 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500.&lt;ref&gt;R. Khanam, Encycl.

[[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] is not the only Azeri intellectual in framing Iranian ultra-nationalism. [[Hassan Taqizadeh]], the organizer of "Iran Society" in [[Berlin]], has contributed to the development of Iranian nationalism. Since 1916 he published "Kaveh" periodical in Farsi language, which included articles emphasizing the racial unity of Germans and Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;بهنام، جمشید (1386). برلنی ها: اندیشمندان ایرانی در برلن 1915-1930. نشر فرزان، تهران.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;فشار یزدی، محمود (1338).

===Pan-Turkism===
{{Main|Pan-Turkism}}
The most important political development affecting the Middle East at the beginning of the twentieth century was the collapse of the Ottoman and the Russian empires. The idea of a greater homeland for all Turks was propagated by pan-Turkism, which was adopted almost at once as a main ideological pillar by the Committee of Union and Progress and somewhat later by other political caucuses in what remained of the Ottoman Empire. On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkist propaganda focused chiefly on the Turkic-speaking peoples of the southern Caucasus, in Iranian Azerbaijan and Turkistan in Central Asia, with the ultimate purpose of persuading them all to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland.

It was this latter appeal to Iranian Azeris which, contrary to pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azeri intellectuals to become the most vociferous advocates of Iran’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. If in Europe "romantic nationalism responded to the damage likely to be caused by modernism by providing a new and larger sense of belonging, an all-encompassing totality, which brought about new social ties, identity and meaning, and a new sense of history from one’s origin on to an illustrious future,"(42) in Iran after the Constitutional movement romantic nationalism was adopted by the Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the irredentist policies threatening the country’s territorial integrity. In their view, assuring territorial integrity was a necessary first step on the road to establishing the rule of law in society and a competent modern state which would safeguard collective as well as individual rights. It was within this context that their political loyalty outweighed their other ethnic or regional affinities.

The failure of the Democrats in the arena of Iranian politics after the Constitutional movement and the start of modern state-building paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism. Whereas the adoption of integrationist policies preserved Iran’s geographic integrity and provided the majority of Iranians with a secure and firm national identity, the blatant ignoring of other demands of the Constitutional movement, such as the call for formation of society based on law and order, left the country still searching for a political identity.  The ultimate purpose was to persuade these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and join the new pan-Turkic homeland.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"&gt;Touraj Atabaki, “Recasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan-Turkism and Iranian Nationalism” in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor).

Actual Quote: {{quote|As far as Iran is concerned, it is widely argued that Iranian nationalism was born as a state ideology in the Reza Shah era, based on philological nationalism and as a result of his innovative success in creating a modern nation-state in Iran. However, what is often neglected is that Iranian nationalism has its roots in the political upheavals of the 19th century and the disintegration immediately following the Constitutional revolution of 1905– 9. It was during this period that Iranism gradually took shape as a defensive discourse for constructing a bounded [[territorial entity]] – the "pure Iran" standing against all others. Consequently, over time there emerged among the country’s intelligentsia a political xenophobia which contributed to the formation of Iranian defensive nationalism. It is noteworthy that, contrary to what one might expect, many of the leading agents of the construction of an Iranian bounded territorial entity came from non Persian-speaking ethnic minorities, and the foremost were the Azeris, rather than the nation’s titular ethnic group, the Persians.

Contrary to their expectations, however, the Ottomans did not achieve impressive success in Azerbaijan. Although the province remained under quasi-occupation by Ottoman troops for months, attempting to win endorsement for pan-Turkism ended in failure.

The idea of a greater homeland for all Turks was propagated by pan-Turkism, which was adopted almost at once as a main ideological pillar by the Committee of Union and Progress and somewhat later by other political caucuses in what remained of the Ottoman Empire. On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkist propaganda focused chiefly on the Turkic-speaking peoples of the southern Caucasus, in Iranian Azerbaijan and Turkistan in Central Asia, with the ultimate purpose of persuading them all to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was this latter appeal to Iranian Azeris which, contrary to pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azeri intellectuals to become the most vociferous advocates of Iran’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. If in Europe ‘romantic nationalism responded to the damage likely to be caused by modernism by providing a new and larger sense of belonging, an all-encompassing totality, which brought about new social ties, identity and meaning, and a new sense of history from one’s origin on to an illustrious future’,(42) in Iran after the Constitutional movement romantic nationalism was adopted by the Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the irredentist policies threatening the country’s territorial integrity. In their view, assuring territorial integrity was a necessary first step on the road to establishing the rule of law in society and a competent modern state which would safeguard collective as well as individual rights. It was within this context that their political loyalty outweighed their other ethnic or regional affinities. The failure of the Democrats in the arena of Iranian politics after the Constitutional movement and the start of modern state-building paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism. Whereas the adoption of integrationist policies preserved Iran’s geographic integrity and provided the majority of Iranians with a secure and firm national identity, the blatant ignoring of other demands of the Constitutional movement, such as the call for formation of society based on law and order, left the country still searching for a political identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azeris, which, contrary to [[Pan-Turkist]] intentions, caused a small group of Azeri intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;

After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies threatening Iran’s territorial integrity.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azeris.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and a modern state.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  The adoption of these integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;

===World War II and Soviet intervention===

In late 1941 Soviet forces invaded Iran in coordination with British Army under an operation known as [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. Their forces broke through the border and moved from the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] into [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah]] was forced by the invading British to [[Abdication|abdicate]] in favor of his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] who replaced his father as Shah on the throne on 16 September 1941. At the aftermath of a four-year-long tumultuous period the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]], a Soviet puppet state, was established in [[Tabriz]], perhaps through direct involvement of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Cold War International History Project-Collection- 1945-46 Iranian Crisis.  http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=va2.browse&amp;sort=Collection&amp;item=1945%2D46%20Iranian%20Crisis   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715220624/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=va2.browse&amp;sort=Collection&amp;item=1945-46+Iranian+Crisis |date=July 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This government autonomously ruled the province from November 1945 to November 1946.&lt;ref name="Dewaal"&gt;Thomas De Waal, "The Caucasus: an introduction", Oxford University Press US, 2010. pp 87: "Soviet troops moved into Iranian, and a shored lived "[[Azerbaijan People's Government]] in Iran," led by the Iranian Azeri Communist [[Ja'far Pishevari]], was set up in Tabriz in 1945-46.

The autonomous republic collapsed soon afterward, and the members of the Democratic Party took refuge in the Soviet Union, fleeing Iranian revenge.. In Tabriz, the crowds that had just recently applauded the autonomous republic were now greeting the returning Iranian troops, and Azeri students publicly burned their native-language textbooks. The mass of the population was obviously not ready even for a regional self-government so long as it smacked of separatism”.  (Swietochowski, Tadeusz 1989.

===Iranian Azeri migration to Azerbaijan===
Beginning in the 1850s, many Iranian Azeris opted to become [[work migrant]]s and seek job opportunities in the [[Russian Empire]], primarily in the economically booming Azeri-populated part of the [[Caucasus]]. Due to them being Persian subjects, Russian offices often recorded them as "Persians". The migrants referred to one another as ''hamshahri'' ("compatriot") as an in-group identity. The word was adopted by the Azeri-speaking locals as ''həmşəri'' and has since been applied by them to Iranian Azeri migrants in general. Already in the nineteenth century, the word also spread to urban varieties of [[Russian language|Russian]] of [[Baku]] and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] in the form of ''gamshara'' (''гамшара'') or ''amshara'' (''амшара''), where it was, however, used with a negative connotation to mean "a raggamuffin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vechernitbilisi.net/item_prn.asp?id=148 «Кругом как хочу»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131222109/http://www.vechernitbilisi.net/item_prn.asp?id=148 |date=2016-01-31 }}.

Iranian Azeris often worked menial jobs, including on [[dyer's madder]] plantations in [[Guba, Azerbaijan|Guba]] where 9,000 out of 14,000 Iranian Azeri contract workers were employed as of 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Сумбатзаде А.

Children from such families would be completely integrated in the community and not be regarded as foreigners or outsiders by its residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OKknAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164 Экономический быт государственных крестьян в южной части Кубинского уезда Бакинской губернии] (comp. by Yagodynsky).&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from the late nineteenth century, Baku was another popular destination for Iranian Azeris, thanks to its highly developing oil industry. By the beginning of the twentieth century, they already constituted 50% of all the oil workers of Baku,&lt;ref&gt;Реза Годс М. Иран в XX веке: политическая история. — М.: Наука, 1994. — С. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and numbered 9,426 people in 1897, 11,132 people in 1903 and 25,096 people in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Altstadt.

Hoover Press, 1992; p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haydar Khan e Amo-oghli|Amo-oghli]] and [[Sattar Khan]] notably worked in the Baku oil fields before returning to Iran and engaging in politics.

In 1925, there were 45,028 Iranian-born Azeris in the [[Azerbaijan SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Большая советская энциклопедия. — 1-е изд.. — М.: Советская энциклопедия, 1926. — Т. 1. — С. 641.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, 15,000 (mostly oil workers, port and navy workers and railway workers) had retained Iranian citizenship by 1938 and were concentrated in Baku and [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]]. In accordance with the 1938 decision of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], residents of Azerbaijan with Iranian citizenship were given 10 days to apply for Soviet citizenship and were then relocated to [[Kazakhstan]]. Those who refused (numbering 2,878 people) became subject to deportation back to Iran immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexanderyakovlev.org/fond/issues-doc/1021188 Постановление ЦК ВКП(б) о принятии советского подданства подданными Ирана с приложением справки о наличии иранцев в Азербайджане] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131222108/http://www.alexanderyakovlev.org/fond/issues-doc/1021188 |date=2016-01-31 }}. 1938.

After the fall of the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] in 1946, as many as 10,000 Iranian Azeri political émigrés relocated to Soviet Azerbaijan, fleeing the inevitable repressions of the Shah's government.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Shaffer.

===Islamic republic era and today===

However, with the advent of the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, emphasis shifted away from nationalism as the new government highlighted religion as the main unifying factor. Within the Islamic Revolutionary government there emerged an Azeri nationalist faction led by [[Ayatollah Kazem Shariatmadari]], who advocated greater regional autonomy and wanted the constitution to be revised to include secularists and opposition parties; this was denied.&lt;ref name="Iranian Studies"&gt;"Shi'ite Leadership: In the Shadow of Conflicting Ideologies", by David Menashri, ''Iranian Studies'', 13:1&amp;ndash;4 (1980) (retrieved 10 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Azeris played an important rule in the revolution including [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], [[Mehdi Bazargan]], [[Sadeq Khalkhali]], and [[Ali Khamenei]].

More recently, the Azerbaijani language and culture is being taught and studied at university level in Iran, and there appears to exist publications of books, newspapers and apparently, regional radio broadcasts too in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Annika Rabo, Bo Utas, “The role of the state in West Asia”, Swedish Research institute in Istanbul, 2005. pg 156.

Despite sporadic problems, Azeris are an intrinsic community within Iran.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"/&gt; Currently, the living conditions of Azeris in Iran closely resemble that of [[Persian people|Persians]]:
{{cquote|The life styles of urban Azeri do not differ from those of Persians, and there is considerable intermarriage among the upper classes in cities of mixed populations. Similarly, customs among Azeri villagers do not appear to differ markedly from those of Persian villagers.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress Iran 1" /&gt;}}
Azeris in Iran are in high positions of authority with the Azeris Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] currently sitting as the [[Supreme Leader]]. Azeris in Iran remain quite conservative in comparison to most Azeris in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, since the Republic of Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, there has been renewed interest and contact between Azeris on both sides of the border.

According to Bulent Gokay:

According to Michael P. Croissant:
{{cquote|Although Iran's fifteen-million Azeri population is well integrated into Iranian society and has shown little desire to secede, Tehran has nonetheless shown extreme concern with prospects of the rise of sentiments calling for union between the two Azerbaijans.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Croissant, "The Armenia&amp;ndash;Azerbaijan Conflict: Causes and Implications", Praeger/Greenwood, 1998, pg 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Iranian Azerbaijan has seen some anti-government protests by Iranian Azerbaijanis in recent years, most notably in 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2015{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. In cities across northern Iran in mid-February 2007, tens of thousands of ethnic Azerbaijanis marched in observance of International Mother Language Day, although it's been said that the subtext was a protest against what the marchers perceive to be "the systematic, state-sponsored suppression of their heritage and language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details_print.cfm?id=17508 Karl Rahder. The Southern Azerbaijan problem, ISN Security Watch, 19/04/07] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702002147/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details_print.cfm?id=17508 |date=2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}

While Iranian Azeris may seek greater cultural rights, few of them display separatist tendencies. Extensive reporting by [[Afshin Molavi]], an Iranian Azeri scholar, in the three major Azeri provinces of Iran, as well as among Iranian Azeris in Tehran, found that irredentist or unificationist sentiment was not widely held among Iranian Azeris . Few people framed their genuine political, social and economic frustration – feelings that are shared by the majority of Iranians – within an ethnic context.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/culture/articles/eav041503.shtml|title=Eurasianet|author=|date=|website=www.eurasianet.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162308/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/culture/articles/eav041503.shtml#|archivedate=2017-10-06|df=|access-date=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another Iranian Azeri scholar Dr. Hassan Javadi – a Tabriz-born, Cambridge-educated scholar of Azerbaijani literature and professor of Persian, Azerani d English literature at George Washington University – Iranian Azeris have more important matters on their mind than cultural rights. "Iran’s Azeri community, like the rest of the country, is engaged in the movement for reform and democracy," Javadi told the Central Asia Caucasus Institute crowd, adding that separatist groups represent "fringe thinking." He also told EurasiaNet: "I get no sense that these cultural issues outweigh national ones, nor do I have any sense that there is widespread talk of secession."&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"/&gt;

==Culture==

===Literature===
[[Jahan Shah]] (r. 1438-67), the [[Qara Qoyunlu]] (“black sheep”) ruler of Azerbaijan was a master poet. He compiled a ''[[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'' under the pen-name Haqiqi. Shah Isma'il (1487-1524), who used the pen-name [[Khata'i]], was a prominent ruler-poet and has, apart from his [[Diwan (poetry)|''diwan'']] compiled a mathnawi called Deh-name, consisting of some eulogies of Ali, the fourth Caliph of early Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu (Editor), Culture and Learning in Islam, 2003, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Azeri could not sustain its early development. The main theme of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was the development of verse-folk stories, mainly intended for performance by [[Ashik|Ashugh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in weddings. The most famous among these literary works are ''[[Koroghlu]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Renard, Islam and the Heroic Image: Themes in Literature and the Visual Arts, 1999, Mercer University Press, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashiq Qərib, and ''Kərəm ile Əslı''.

Following the establishing of [[Qajar dynasty]] in Iran Azerbaijani literature flourished and reached its peak by the end of the nineteenth century. By then, journalism had been launched in Azerbaijani language and social activism had become the main theme of literary works. The most influential writers of this era are Fathali Akhondzadeh&lt;ref&gt;Feraydoon Adamyat, Andishe-ha-ye Mirza Fathali Akhondzadeh (The Thoughts of Mirza Fathali Akhondzadeh) (Tehran: Kharazmi Publications, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and Mojez Shabestari.

[[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] era was the darkest period for Azerbaijani literature. The education and publication in Azerbaijani language was banned and writers of Azerbaijan, such as [[Gholam Hossein Saedi|Gholam-Hossein Saedi]],  [[Samad Behrangi]]  and [[Reza Barahani]], published their works in [[Farsi]] language. The only exception was [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar]], who is famous for his verse book, ''[[Heydar Babaya Salam]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hail to Haydar Baba|url=http://www.umich.edu/~turkish/links/manuscripts/haydarbaba/haydarbaba.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204102652/http://www.umich.edu/~turkish/links/manuscripts/haydarbaba/haydarbaba.htm|archivedate=2007-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; simply he was too mighty to be censored. [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar|Shahriar's]] work was an innovative way of summarizing the [[Cultural identity]] in concise poetic form and was adapted by a generation of lesser known poets, particularly from [[Arasbaran|Qareh Dagh]] region, to record their oral traditions. One remarkable example is '''Abbas Eslami''', known with his pen-name '''Barez''', (1932-2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbas Barez|url=http://www.aharnoma.ir/news/2482|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083927/http://www.aharnoma.ir/news/2482#|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=|access-date=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who described the melancholic demise of his homeland in a book titled mourning [[Sabalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=اسلامی|first=عباس|title=یاسلی ساوالان|date=۱۳۷۹-۱۰-۰۵|location=تبریز|url=http://vista.ir/article/598286|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329012303/http://vista.ir/article/598286|archivedate=2014-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is  '''Mohamad Golmohamadi's''' long poem, titled ''I am madly in love with [[Arasbaran|Qareh Dagh]]'' (قاراداغ اؤلکه‌سینین گؤر نئجه دیوانه‌سی ام), is a concise description of the region's cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh |url=http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1828 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329005421/http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1828 |archivedate=2014-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long lasting suppression finally led to a generation of revolutionary poets, composing verses by allegoric allusion to imposing landscape of Azerbaijan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
[[Sahand]], o mountain of pure snow,
Descended from Heaven with [[Zoroaster]]
Fire in your heart, snow on your shoulders,
with storm of centuries,
And white hair of history on your chest ...
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Yadollah Maftun Amini'' (born in 1926)&lt;ref&gt;Gholam-Reza Sabri-Tabrizi, Iran: A Child's Story, a Man's Experience, 1989, MAINSTREAM PUBLISHING COMPANY, P. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Islamic revolution of 1979 the ban on Azeri publications in Iran has eased. However, great literary works have not yet appeared and glory days of fifteenth century ruler-poets is not on the horizon. The contemporary literature is restricted to oral traditions, such as ''bayaties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.ir/node/18008 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055033/http://anthropology.ir/node/18008# |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.ir/node/17835 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055316/http://anthropology.ir/node/17835# |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
[[File:Askik Changiz.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Ashugh performance]]
The autocratic nation building policies of [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] era has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favor of a government sanctioned culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 2008, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, by the turn of twentieth century the genuine Azeri music had been preserved in remote corners of Azerbaijan.  Thanks to the more liberal policies of [[Khatami]] era (1998-2006) a cultural renaissance took place and Azeri music was brought in the spotlight.

The traditional Azeri music can be classified into two categories: the music of "[[ashugh]]" and the "[[mugham]]". [[Mugham]], despite its similarity to Persian classic music and utmost importance in Azerbaijan, has not been popular among Iranian Azeris. The ashugh music had survived in mountainous region of [[Arasbaran|Qaradağ]] and presently is identified as the representative of the cultural identity of Azeris. Recent innovative developments,  aiming to enhance the urban-appealing aspects of this ashugh performances, has drastically enhanced the status of ashugh music. The opening of academic style music classes in Tabriz by master [[ashug]]hs, such as Ashig Imran Heidari and Ashig Changiz Mehdipour, has greatly contributed to the ongoing image building.

===Art===
Living in cross-road of many civilizations, Azeris artisans have developed a rich tradition of decorative arts including rugs, lace, printed textiles, jewelry,  vessels made of copper, engraved metals, wooden articles and ceramics. Among these, [[Azerbaijani carpet weaving|carpet weaving]] stands out as the acme of Azeri art.

====Carpet weaving====
Tabriz is one of the main centers of carpet weaving in Iran. At present 40% of Iranian carpet exports are originated from [[Tabriz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tabriz rug]]&lt;/ref&gt; These carpets are generally known as [[Tabriz rug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Another carpet weaving center is [[Ardebil]], which, despite being overshadowed by Tabriz in recent years, has produced the finest carpets in past. Two most famous Iranian rugs in the world had been woven in Ardebil in 1540. One is hung in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, and the other is in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Arts]]. These carpets have silk warps and contain over thirty million knots.&lt;ref&gt;Rami Yelda, A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited, authourHOUSE, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The acme of carpet weaving art is manifested in [[Azerbaijani rug|Verni]],&lt;ref&gt;K K Goswam, Advances in Carpet Manufacture, 2008, Woodhead Publishing in Textiles, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taqipour|first=Reza|title=An introduction to verni|url=http://www.aharri.com/?p=1684|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206120054/http://www.aharri.com/?p=1684|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was originated in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. [[Azerbaijani rug|Verni]] is a carpet-like [[kilim]] with a delicate and fine warp and woof, which is woven without a previous sketch, thanks to the creative talents of nomadic women and girls. [[Azerbaijani rug|Verni]] weavers employ the image of birds and animals (deer, rooster, cat, snake, birds, gazelle, sheep, camel, wolf and eagle) in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the [[earthenware]] patterns that were popular in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilim: Embodiment of Iranian art and culture|url=http://english.irib.ir/radioculture/art/cultural-traditions/item/151028-kilim-embodiment-of-iranian-art-and-culture|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322001833/http://english.irib.ir/radioculture/art/cultural-traditions/item/151028-kilim-embodiment-of-iranian-art-and-culture#|archivedate=2014-03-22|df=|access-date=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key décor feature, which is intrinsic to many [[Azerbaijani rug|Vernis]], is the S-element. Its shape varies, it may resemble both figure 5 and letter S. This element means “dragon” among the nomads. At present, [[Azerbaijani rug|Verni]] is woven by the girls of [[Tribes of Arasbaran|Arasbaran Tribes]], often in the same room where the nomadic tribes reside,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verni-weaving is a unique art of northwestern Iran.|url=http://www.tishineh.com/touritem/310/verni%20bafi%20(%20verni-weaving%20)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402164145/http://tishineh.com/touritem/310/Verni%20bafi%20(%20Verni-weaving%20)|archivedate=2014-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a significant income source for about 20000 families in [[Arasbaran|Qaradagh]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verni; a gold mine!|url=http://farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920625000692|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311210842/http://farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920625000692|archivedate=2014-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verni; An economic opportunity for Qaradagh|url=http://www.aharnews.ir/10807/%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%B4-%D9%86%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%BA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312000711/http://www.aharnews.ir/10807/%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%B4-%D9%86%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%BA/|archivedate=2014-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verni weavers employ the image of birds and animals in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the earthenware patterns that were popular in prehistoric times.

&lt;/center&gt;

===Religion===

The majority of Azeris are followers of [[Shia Islam]]. Azeris commemorate Shia holy days (ten first days of the holy month of Muharram) at least with the same intensity as other Iranians. In metropolitan cities with mixed ethnic composition, such as [[Tehran]], Azeris are thought to be more intense in their expression of religious ritual than their [[Persian people|Persian]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography Of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, vol. I, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; However, Azeris are less inclined to [[Islamism]]. This is evident by the fact that just before revolution Azeris followed either [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] or Kho'i, both traditionalist jurists. In contrast, [[Persian people|Persians]] followed more radical [[Ruhollah Khomeini]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

There is also a small minority of Azeris who practice the [[Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranpresswatch.org/post/13946/|title=Burial Denied to a Baha'i Citizen in Tabriz - Iran Press Watch|author=|date=26 January 2016|website=iranpresswatch.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822051443/http://iranpresswatch.org/post/13946/|archivedate=22 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/curtis_iran_country_study|title=Iran|author=|date=|website=bahai-library.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413181053/http://bahai-library.com/curtis_iran_country_study|archivedate=2016-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in recent years, some Azeris in Iran have begun converting to [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue20646.html|title=Three Iranian-Azeri Christians Arrested; Their Fate Unknown|author=|date=|website=www.christiantelegraph.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806034606/http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue20646.html|archivedate=2016-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is strictly prohibited and can result in imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/09/iran-christianity-conversion|title=The cost of religious conversion in Iran - Theresa Malinowska|first=Theresa|last=Malinowska|date=9 May 2009|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220142203/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/09/iran-christianity-conversion|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers of [[Yarisan]] religion (Goran in the Azeri language) constitute a significant fraction of the population. In some regions [[Yarisan]] followers are sometimes known as Shamlus, a clear reference to the name of Shamlu tribe, which was one of the main constituents of [[Qizilbash]] confederation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''June Allyson''' (born '''Eleanor Geisman'''; October 7, 1917{{spaced ndash}}July 8, 2006) was an American [[Stage actress|stage]], [[Film actress|film]], and [[television actress]], [[dancer]], and [[singer]].

Allyson began her career in 1937 as a dancer in short subject films and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1938. She signed with [[MGM]] in 1943, and rose to fame the following year in ''[[Two Girls and a Sailor]]''. Allyson's "[[girl next door]]" image was solidified during the mid-1940s when she was paired with actor [[Van Johnson]] in five films. In 1951, she won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Too Young to Kiss]]''. From 1959 to 1961, she hosted and occasionally starred in her own [[anthology series]], ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'', which aired on [[CBS]].

In the 1970s, she returned to the stage starring in ''[[Forty Carats]]'' and ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. In 1982, Allyson released her autobiography ''June Allyson by June Allyson'', and continued her career with guest starring roles on television and occasional film appearances. She later established the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research and worked to raise money for research for urological and gynecological diseases affecting senior citizens. During the 1980s, Allyson also became a spokesperson for [[Depend (undergarment)|Depend undergarment]]s,&lt;ref name="Kimberly-Clark"&gt;[http://investor.kimberly-clark.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=203430 "Kimberly-Clark Corporation Honors June Allyson And Her Humanitarian Contributions: Long-Time Depend Brand Spokesperson Educated Millions on Incontinence."] ''Kimberly-Clark Corporation,'' July 11, 2006.

==Early life==
Allyson was born Eleanor Geisman,&lt;ref name="census"&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/default.aspx?o_iid=19250&amp;o_lid=19250&amp;offerid=0%3a7858%3a0 Ancestry.com] according to the 1920 U.S. census&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed "Ella", in [[the Bronx]], New York City. She was the daughter of Clara (née Provost) and Robert Geisman. She had a brother, Henry, who was two years older. She said she had been raised as a [[Roman Catholic]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} but a discrepancy exists relating to her early life, and her studio biography was often the source of the confusion. Her paternal grandparents, Harry Geisman and Anna Hafner, were immigrants from [[Germany]]&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; although Allyson claimed her last name was originally "Van Geisman", and was of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0107/04/lkl.00.html "June Allyson Discusses Her Career."] ''CNN Larry King Live''.

MGM was partly to blame as the studio PR machine created a "goody two-shoes" image of a young ingenue which required some imaginative tailoring of her age, family circumstances, and even her famous "tree limb" story.|group=N}}

In April 1918 (when Allyson was six months old), her [[alcoholic]] father, who had worked as a janitor, abandoned the family. Allyson was brought up in near poverty, living with her maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 1"&gt;Parish and Pitts 2003, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; To make ends meet, her mother worked as a telephone operator and restaurant cashier.  When she had enough funds, she would occasionally reunite with her daughter, but more often Allyson was "farmed" out to her grandparents or other relatives.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 1"/&gt;

In 1925 (when Allyson was eight), a tree branch fell on her while she was riding on her tricycle with her pet terrier in tow.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;Harmetz, Aljean. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/movies/11allyson.html?_r=1 "June Allyson, Adoring Wife in MGM Films, Is Dead at 88."] ''nytimes.com'', July 11, 2006. Retrieved: March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Allyson sustained a fractured skull and broken back, and her dog was killed. Her doctors said she would never walk again and confined her to a heavy steel brace from neck to hips for four years, and she ultimately regained her health, but when Allyson had become famous, she was terrified that people would discover her background from the "tenement side of New York City", and she readily agreed to studio tales of a "rosy life" including a concocted story that she underwent months of swimming exercises in rehabilitation to emerge as a star swimmer.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 1"/&gt; In her later memoirs, Allyson does describe a summer program of swimming that did help her recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

After gradually progressing from a wheelchair to crutches to braces, Allyson's true escape from her impoverished life was to go to the cinema, where she was enraptured by [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Fred Astaire]] movies.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 1"/&gt; As a teen, Allyson memorized the trademark Ginger Rogers dance routines; she claimed later to have watched ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' 17 times.&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She also tried to emulate the singing styles of movie stars although she never mastered reading music.&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, pp. 10, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; When her mother remarried and the family was reunited with a more stable financial standing, Allyson was enrolled in the Ned Wayburn Dancing Academy and began to enter dance competitions with the stage name of "Elaine Peters".&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, pp. 1, 3."&gt;Parish and Pitts 2003, pp. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of her stepfather and a bleak future ahead, she left high school after completing two and half years, to seek jobs as a dancer. Her first $60-a-week job was as a tap dancer at the Lido Club in Montreal. Returning to New York, she found work as an actress in movie short subjects filmed by [[Educational Pictures]] at its Astoria, Long Island, studio.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 3."&gt;Parish and Pitts 2003, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiercely ambitious, Allyson tried her hand at modeling, but to her consternation became the "sad-looking before part" in a before-and-after bathing suit magazine ad.&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first career break came when Educational cast her as an ingenue opposite singer Lee Sullivan, comic dancers Herman Timberg, Jr., and Pat Rooney, Jr., and future comedy star [[Danny Kaye]]. When Educational ceased operations, Allyson moved to [[Vitaphone]] in Brooklyn and starred or co-starred (with dancer [[Hal Le Roy]]) in musical shorts.

==Career==
Interspersing jobs in the chorus line at the Copacabana Club with acting roles at Vitaphone, the diminutive 5'1" (1.55 m), weighing less than 100 pounds, red-headed Allyson landed a chorus job in the Broadway show ''Sing out the News'' in 1938.&lt;ref name="IBDB" /&gt; The legend is that the choreographer gave her a job and a new name: Allyson, a family name, and June, for the month,&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; although like many aspects of her career resume, the story is highly unlikely as she was already dubbing herself "June Allyson" prior to her Broadway engagement and has even attributed the name to a later director.{{#tag:ref|The name "June Allyson" has been attributed to three different sources and June herself had a different memory of from where it came, but the use of a nickname and stage name had already begun in her teen years. On the Larry King interview, her recollection was that Broadway producer George Abbott had given her the name, while other sources have her first stage choreographer calling her that in exasperation, as he could not be bothered to remember her real one; at least that was the tale in her book. Probably, it made sense to her, as she liked "Allison", her brother's name, and simply tacked "June" onto it, and was reportedly using it before her Broadway debut.|group=N}} Allyson subsequently appeared in the chorus in the [[Jerome Kern]]-[[Oscar Hammerstein II]] musical ''[[Very Warm for May]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 3."/&gt;
[[File:June Allyson (handprints in cement).jpg|right|thumb|250px|The handprints of June Allyson in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park.]]

When Vitaphone discontinued New York production in 1940, Allyson returned to the New York stage to take on more chorus roles in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s ''Higher and Higher'' (1940) and [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Panama Hattie]]'' (1940). Her dancing and musical talent led to a stint as an understudy for the lead, [[Betty Hutton]], and when Hutton contracted measles, Allyson appeared in five performances of ''Panama Hattie''.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 3."/&gt; Broadway director George Abbott caught one of the nights, and offered Allyson one of the lead roles in his production of ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name="Basinger p. 482"&gt;Basinger 2007, p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her appearance in the Broadway musical, Allyson was selected for the 1943 film version of ''[[Best Foot Forward (film)|Best Foot Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn 1991, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived in [[Hollywood]], the production had not started, so MGM "placed her on the payroll" of ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' (1943). Despite playing a "bit part", Allyson received good reviews as a sidekick to ''Best Foot Forward'''s star, [[Lucille Ball]], but was still relegated to the "drop list".&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's musical supervisor, Arthur Freed, saw her test sent up by an agent and insisted that Allyson be put on contract immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin 1996, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Another musical, ''Thousands Cheer'' (1943), was again a showcase for her singing and dancing, albeit still in a minor role.&lt;ref name="Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 22"&gt;Allyson, June and Frances Spatz Leighton. ''June Allyson by June Allyson''. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1982. {{ISBN|0-399-12726-7}}..&lt;/ref&gt; As a new starlet, although Allyson had already been a performer on stage and screen, she was presented as an "overnight sensation," with Hollywood press agents attempting to portray her as an ingenue, selectively slicing years off her true age. Studio bios listed her variously as being born in 1922 and 1923.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 1"/&gt;

Allyson's breakthrough was in ''[[Two Girls and a Sailor]]'' (1944) where the studio image of the "girl next door"&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1998, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; was fostered by her being cast alongside long-time acting chum [[Van Johnson]], the quintessential "boy next door."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; As the "sweetheart team," Johnson and Allyson were to appear together in four later films.&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 4."&gt;Parish and Pitts 2003, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allyson's early success as a musical star led to several other postwar musicals, including ''[[Two Sisters from Boston]]'' (1946) and ''[[Good News (1947 film)|Good News]]'' (1947).&lt;ref name="Basinger p. 482"/&gt; Her "[[Thou Swell]]" was a high point of the [[Rodgers and Hart]] biopic ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948), as performed in the "[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]" segment with the Blackburn Twins. Allyson also played straight roles, such as Constance in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1948), the tomboy [[Jo March]] in ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), and a nurse in ''[[Battle Circus (film)|Battle Circus]]'' (1953).&lt;ref name="Parish and Pitts, p. 4."/&gt; She was very adept at opening the waterworks on cue, and many of her films incorporated a crying scene. Fellow MGM player [[Margaret O'Brien]] recalled that she and Allyson were known as "the town criers".&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:June Allyson in Too Young To Kiss trailer.JPG|thumb|left|June Allyson in ''[[Too Young to Kiss]]'' (1951)]]

In 1950 Allyson had been signed to appear opposite her childhood idol Fred Astaire in ''[[Royal Wedding]]'', but had to leave the production because of pregnancy. (She was replaced initially by [[Judy Garland]], and later by [[Jane Powell]].) In 1956 she starred with a young rising star named [[Jack Lemmon]] in the musical comedy, ''You Can't Run Away From It''. Besides Van Johnson, [[James Stewart]] was a frequent co-star, teaming up with Allyson in three popular biographies, ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'', and ''[[The Stratton Story]]'' for which the real-life counterparts of their characters assisted as consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JFLcz5v_DeA June Allyson Dick Cavett TV interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

A versatile performer, Allyson also appeared on radio, and after her film career ended she made a handful of nightclub singing engagements. In later years, Allyson appeared on television, not only in her own series but also in popular programs including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''. ''The DuPont Show with June Allyson'' ran for two seasons on CBS and was an attempt to use a "high budget" formula.  Her efforts were dismissed by the entertainment reviewer in the ''LA Examiner'' as "reaching down to the level of mag fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Becker 2009, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''TV Guide'' and other fan magazines such as ''TV'' considered Allyson's foray into television as revitalizing her fame and career for a younger audience, and remarked that her stereotyping by the movie industry as the "girl next door" was the "waste and neglect of talent on its own doorstep."&lt;ref&gt;Becker 2009, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
[[File:June Allyson Dick Powell 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|June Allyson and [[Dick Powell]] in 1962]]
On her arrival in Hollywood, studio heads attempted to enhance the pairing of Van Johnson and Allyson by sending out the two contracted players on a series of "official dates", which were highly publicized and led to a public perception that a romance had been kindled.&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although dating [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[John Kennedy]], Allyson was actually being courted by [[Dick Powell]], who was 13 years her senior and had been previously married to Mildred Maund and [[Joan Blondell]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2007, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1945, Allyson caused MGM studio chief [[Louis B. Mayer]] some consternation by marrying Dick Powell.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2002, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; After defying him twice by refusing to stop seeing Powell, in a "tactical master stroke", she asked Mayer to give her away at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Eyman 2005, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He was so disarmed that he agreed but put Allyson on suspension anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2006, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Powells had two children, Pamela Allyson Powell&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actress-june-allyson-dies-at-88/2/&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1948 through the [[Tennessee Children's Home Society]] in an adoption arranged by [[Georgia Tann]]) and Richard Powell, Jr., (born December 24, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Allyson and Leighton 1982, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Allyson underwent a kidney operation and later, throat surgery, temporarily affecting her trademark raspy voice.&lt;ref name ="Parish and Pitts, p. 5"&gt;Parish and Pitts 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple briefly separated in 1961, but reconciled and remained married until his death on January 2, 1963. She also went through a bitter court battle with her mother over custody of the children she had with Powell.

Reports at the time revealed that writer/director Dirk Summers, with whom Allyson was romantically involved from 1963 to 1975, was named legal guardian for Ricky and Pamela as a result of a court petition. Members of the nascent [[jet-set]], Allyson and Summers were frequently seen in [[Cap d'Antibes]], Madrid, Rome, and London. However, Summers refused to marry her and the relationship did not last.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Harrison. "June Allyson &amp; Dirk Summers Marriage." ''Herald Examiner,'' Vol. XCV, Issue 223, November 4, 1965, p. Front Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her separation from Summers, Allyson was twice married to and divorced from businessman Alfred Glenn Maxwell, who owned a number of barbershops and had been Powell's barber.&lt;ref name ="Parish and Pitts, p. 5"/&gt; During this time, Allyson struggled with [[alcoholism]], which she overcame in the mid-1970s.

In 1976, Allyson married David Ashrow, a dentist turned actor. The couple occasionally performed together in regional theater, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, toured the United States with the stage play ''My Daughter, Your Son''. They also appeared on celebrity cruise ship tours on the ''Royal Viking Sky'', in a program that highlighted Allyson's movie career.&lt;ref name="Allyson"&gt;[http://www.juneallyson.com/Biography.htm "Biography: June Allyson."] juneallyson.com. Retrieved: October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
After Dick Powell's death, Allyson committed herself to charitable work on his behalf, championing the importance of research in urological and gynecological diseases in seniors, and represented the [[Kimberly-Clark]] Corporation in commercials for adult [[Adult diaper|incontinence products]]. Following a lifelong interest in health and medical research (Allyson had initially wanted to use her acting career to fund her own training as a doctor),&lt;ref name="Allyson and Leighton 1982, p. 22"/&gt; she was instrumental in establishing the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research. Allyson also financially supported her brother, Dr. Arthur Peters, through his medical training, and he went on to specialize in [[otolaryngology]].&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

===Politics===
Allyson was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and was a strong supporter of [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doyle |first=Jack |title=1968 Presidential Racd: Republicans |url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/1968-presidential-racerepublicans/ |date=March 11, 2009 |publisher= PopHistoryDig.com |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Powell's wealth made it possible for Allyson effectively to retire from show business after his death, making only occasional appearances on talk and variety shows. Allyson returned to the Broadway stage in 1970 in the play ''[[Forty Carats]]''&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=29730 "June Allyson."] ''Internet Broadway Database''.  Retrieved: September 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and later toured in a production of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''.

Her autobiography, ''June Allyson by June Allyson'' (1982), received generally complimentary reviews due to its insider look at Hollywood in one of its golden ages. A more critical appraisal came from Janet Maslin at the ''New York Times'' in her review, "Hollywood Leaves Its Imprint on Its Chroniclers",  who noted: "Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen in Hollywood... like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen."&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; Privately, Allyson admitted that her earlier screen portrayals had left her uneasy about the typecast "good wife" roles she had played.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Martin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/10/AR2006071001237.html "Perky Actress June Allyson, 88."] ''Washington Post'', July 11, 2006, p. B06. Retrieved: March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a personal friend of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, she was invited to many White House dinners, and in 1988, Reagan appointed her to the Federal Council on Aging. Allyson and her later husband, David Ashrow, actively supported fund-raising efforts for both the James Stewart and Judy Garland museums; both Stewart and Garland had been close friends.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

In 1993, actor-turned-agent [[Marty Ingels]] publicly charged Allyson with not paying his large commission on the earlier deal on incontinence product advertising. Allyson denied owing any money, and Ashrow and she filed a lawsuit for [[slander]] and [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]], charging that Ingels was harassing and threatening them, stating Ingels made 138 phone calls during a single eight-hour period. Earlier that year, Ingels had pleaded no contest to making annoying phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/307240/ALLYSON-LAWSUIT-ACCUSES-MARTY-INGELS-OF-SLANDER.html "Allyson Lawsuit Accuses Marty Ingels of Slander."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510022755/http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/307240/ALLYSON-LAWSUIT-ACCUSES-MARTY-INGELS-OF-SLANDER.html |date=2009-05-10 }} ''archive.deseretnews.com''. Retrieved: September 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993, Allyson christened the ''Holland America Maasdam'', one of the flagships of the Holland America line. Although her heritage, like much of her personal story, was subject to different interpretations, Allyson always claimed to be proud of a Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

Allyson made a special appearance in 1994 in ''[[That's Entertainment III]]'', as one of the film's narrators. She spoke about MGM's golden era and introduced vintage film clips. In 1996, Allyson became the first recipient of the Harvey Award, presented by the James M. Stewart Museum Foundation, in recognition of her positive contributions to the world of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimmy.org/node "The Jimmy Stewart Museum."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313051943/http://www.jimmy.org/node |date=2010-03-13 }} jimmy.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2003, Allyson remained busy touring the country making personal appearances, headlining celebrity cruises, and speaking on behalf of Kimberly-Clark, a long-time commercial interest.&lt;ref name="Allyson"/&gt; The American Urogynecologic Society established the June Allyson Foundation in 1998 made possible by a grant from Kimberly-Clark. As the first celebrity to undertake the role of public spokesperson for promoting the use of the Depend undergarment, Allyson did "more than any other public figure to encourage and persuade people with incontinence to lead fuller and more active lives".&lt;ref name="Kimberly-Clark"/&gt;

==Death==
Following hip-replacement surgery in 2003, Allyson's health began to deteriorate. With her husband at her side, she died July 8, 2006, aged 88 at her home in [[Ojai, California|Ojai]], California. Her death was a result of pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;Mormon 2007, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; On her death, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) contributed $25,000 to the June Allyson Foundation to support research advances in the care and treatment of women with urinary incontinence.&lt;ref name="Kimberly-Clark"/&gt;

The '''Kyrgyz people''' (also spelled '''Kyrghyz''' and '''Kirghiz''') are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[ethnic group]] native to Central Asia, primarily [[Kyrgyzstan]].

== Etymology ==
There are several theories on the origin of [[ethnonym]] ''Kyrgyz''. It is often said to be derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic word]] ''kyrk'' ("forty"), with -''iz'' being an old plural suffix, so ''Kyrgyz'' literally means "a collection of forty tribes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pulleyblank1990|Pulleyblank 1990]], p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; It also means "imperishable", "inextinguishable", "immortal", "unconquerable" or "unbeatable", as well as its association with the epic hero [[Epic of Manas|Manas]], who – according to a [[founding myth]] – unified the 40 tribes against the [[Khitans]]. A rival myth, recorded in 1370 in the [[History of Yuan|''Yuán Shǐ'']] ("history of Yuan"), concerns 40 women born on a [[steppe]] motherland.&lt;ref&gt;Zuev, Yu.A., ''Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms (Translation of Chinese composition "Tanghuyao" of 8–10th centuries)'', Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences, Alma-Ata, 1960, p. 103 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original root of the ethnonym appears to have been the word ''kirkün'' (Chinese ''Tszyan-kun''), probably meaning "field people" (or, arguably, "field [[Huns]]").  This and the Chinese transcription ''Tse-gu (Gekun; Jiankun)'' suggest that the original ethnonym was ''Kirkut'' (pronounced "kirgut") and/or ''Kirkur'' ("kirgur"), both of which can be traced back to ''kirkün''. By the time of the [[Mongol Empire]], the meaning of the word ''kirkun'' had apparently been forgotten – as was shown by variations in readings of it across different reductions of the ''Yuán Shǐ''. This may have led to the adoption of ''Kyrgyz'' and its mythical explanation.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, European writers used the early Romanized form  ''Kirghiz'' – from the contemporary Russian {{lang|ru|киргизы}} – to refer not only to the modern Kyrgyz, but also to their more numerous northern relatives, the [[Kazakhs]]. When distinction had to be made, more specific terms were used:
the Kyrgyz proper were known as the ''[[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]]'' ("Black Kirghiz", from the colour of their tents),&lt;ref name=EB11/&gt;
and the Kazakhs were named the ''Kaisaks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The early Kyrgyz people, known as [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]], have their origins in the western parts of modern-day [[Mongolia]] and first appear in written records in the Chinese annals of the [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (compiled 109 BC to 91 BC), as ''Gekun'' ({{lang|zh-hant|鬲昆}}, {{lang|zh-hant|隔昆}}) or ''Jiankun'' ({{lang|zh-hant|堅昆}}).  They were described in [[Tang Dynasty]] texts as having "red hair and green eyes", while those with dark hair and eyes were said to be descendants of a Chinese general [[Li Ling]].&lt;ref name="lung"&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=15 June 2012|title=Interpreters in Early Imperial China|author=Rachel Lung|editor=|quote=During the reign period of Kaiyuan of [emperor] Xuanzong, Ge Jiayun, composed ''A Record of the Western Regions'', in which he said "the people of the Jiankun state all have red hair and green eyes.

with a mixture of European and Mongol features.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Mitchell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HZbOBPoTGfUC ''Kyrgyzstan: The Bradt Travel Guide''], 2008, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bdZbe3zOz_MC The Turks in World History]'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei A.

''The Kirgiz and their ethnogenetical historical and cultural connections'', Moscow, 1971, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent historical findings, Kyrgyz history dates back to 201 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. State Dept.|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5755.htm|publisher=U.S. State Dept|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yenisei Kyrgyz lived in the upper [[Yenisey River]] valley, central [[Siberia]]. In [[Late Antiquity]] the Yenisei Kyrgyz were a part of the [[Tiele people]]. Later, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Yenisei Kyrgyz were a part of the confederations of the [[Göktürks|Göktürk]] and [[Uyghur Khaganate]]s.

In 840 a revolt led by the Yenisei Kyrgyz brought down the Uyghur Khaganate, and brought the Yenisei Kyrgyz to a dominating position in the former [[Turkic Khaganate]]. With the rise to power, the center of the [[Yenisei Kirghiz|Kyrgyz Khaganate]] moved to [[Zhetysu|Jeti-su]], and brought about a spread south of the Kyrgyz people, to reach [[Tian Shan]] mountains and [[Xinjiang]], bringing them into contact with the existing peoples of western [[China]], especially [[Tibet]].
By the 16th century the carriers of the ethnonym ''Kirgiz'' lived in South [[Siberia]], Xinjiang, Tian Shan, [[Pamir-Alay]], [[Middle Asia]], [[Urals]] (among [[Bashkirs]]), in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramzon S.M., p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tian Shan and Xinjiang area, the term ''Kyrgyz'' retained its unifying political designation, and became a general ethnonym for the Yenisei Kirgizes and aboriginal Turkic tribes that presently constitute the Kyrgyz population.&lt;ref&gt;Abramzon S.M., pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is obviously impossible to directly identify the [[Yenisei]] and [[Tien Shan]] Kyrgyz, a trace of their ethnogenetical connections is apparent in archaeology, history, language and ethnography. A majority of modern researchers came to the conclusion that the ancestors of Kyrgyz tribes had their origin in the most ancient tribal unions of [[Sakas]]/[[Scythians]], [[Wusun]]/[[Issedones]], [[Dingling]], [[Mongols]] and [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramzon S.M., p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there follow from the oldest notes about the Kyrgyz that the definite mention of Kyrgyz ethnonym originates from the 6th century. There is certain probability that there was relation between Kyrgyz and Gegunese already in the 2nd century BC, next, between Kyrgyz and Khakases since the 6th century A.D., but there is quite missing a unique mention. The Kyrgyz as ethnic group are mentioned quite unambiguously in the time of [[Genghis Khan]] rule (1162–1227), when their name replaces the former name Khakas.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XRXVbGwPgqIC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Kyrgyz&amp;nbsp;– Children of Manas.

Because of the processes of migration, conquest, intermarriage, and assimilation, many of the Kyrgyz peoples who now inhabit Central and Southwest Asia are of mixed origins, often stemming from fragments of many different tribes, though they speak closely related languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com{{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a genetic study based on geographic location of the 26 Central Asian populations shows the admixture proportions of East Eurasian ancestry is predominant in most Kyrgyz living in Kyrgyzstan. East Eurasian ancestry makes up roughly two-thirds with exceptions of Kyrgyz living in Tajikistan and the western areas of Kyrgyzstan where it forms only half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3025785 | pmid=20823912 | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.153 | volume=19 | issue=2 | title=In the heartland of Eurasia: the multilocus genetic landscape of Central Asian populations | year=2011 | journal=Eur J Hum Genet | pages=216–23 | last1 = Martínez-Cruz | first1 = B | last2 = Vitalis | first2 = R | last3 = Ségurel | first3 = L | last4 = Austerlitz | first4 = F | last5 = Georges | first5 = M | last6 = Théry | first6 = S | last7 = Quintana-Murci | first7 = L | last8 = Hegay | first8 = T | last9 = Aldashev | first9 = A | last10 = Nasyrova | first10 = F | last11 = Heyer | first11 = E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political development ==

The Kyrgyz state reached its greatest extent after defeating the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 840 AD, in alliance with the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]].

The Kirghiz [[khagan]]s of the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] Khaganate claimed descent from the Han Chinese general [[Li Ling]], which was mentioned in the diplomatic correspondence between the Kirghiz khagan and the [[Tang Dynasty]] emperor, since the Tang imperial Li family claimed descent from Li Ling's grandfather, [[Li Guang]]. The Kirghiz qaghan assisted the Tang dynasty in destroying the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] and rescuing the [[Princess Taihe]] from the Uyghurs. They also killed a Uyghur khagan in the process.

Then Kyrgyz quickly moved as far as the [[Tian Shan]] range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years. In the 12th century, however, Kyrgyz domination had shrunk to the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]] and [[Sayan Mountains]] as a result of [[Mongol]] expansion. With the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the 13th century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. In 1207, after the establishment of ''Yekhe Mongol Ulus'' (Mongol empire), Genghis Khan's oldest son [[Jochi]] occupied Kyrgyzstan without resistance. The state remained a Mongol vassal until the late 14th century.

Various [[Turkic peoples]] ruled them until 1685, when they came under the control of the [[Oirats]] ([[Dzungars]]).

== Religion ==
[[File:Mešita v Tokmoku.jpg|thumb|A mosque in [[Tokmok]], Kyrgyzstan]]
{{Further|Islam in Kyrgyzstan}}
Kyrgyz are predominantly [[Muslim]]s of the [[Hanafi]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148795.htm |title=Kyrgyz Republic |publisher=U.S. Department of State |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam in Kyrgyzstan|Islam]] was first introduced by Arab traders who travelled along the [[Silk Road]] in the seventh and eighth centuries. In the 8th century, orthodox Islam reached the [[Fergana valley]] with the [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]]. However, in the tenth-century Persian text ''[[Hudud al-'alam]]'', the Kyrgyz was still described as a people who "venerate the Fire and burn the dead".&lt;ref name="anthology"&gt;{{cite book |author=Scott Cameron Levi, Ron Sela |title=Islamic Central Asia: An Anthology of Historical Sources |chapter=Chapter 4, Discourse on the Qïrghïz Country |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=30 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-253-35385-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheism]] has some following in the northern regions under Russian communist influence. As of today, few cultural rituals of [[Shamanism]] are still practiced alongside Islam, particularly in Central Kyrgyzstan. During a July 2007 interview, [[Bermet Akayeva]], the daughter of [[Askar Akayev]], the former President of Kyrgyzstan, stated that [[Islam]] is increasingly taking root, even in the northern portion which came under communist influence.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav071707a.shtml |title=Eurasianet  Civil Society – Kyrgyzstan: Time to Ponder a Federal System |website=www.eurasianet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized that many [[mosque]]s have been built and that the Kyrgyz are "increasingly devoting themselves to [[Islam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/node/3892|title=Kyrgyzstan: An interview with Bermet Akayeva, daughter of ex-president Askar Akayev {{!}} Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures|website=www.wluml.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient indigenous beliefs and practices, including [[shamanism]] and [[totemism]], coexisted syncretically with Islam. Shamans, most of whom are women, still play a prominent role at funerals, memorials, and other ceremonies and rituals. This split between the northern and southern Kyrgyz in their religious adherence to Muslim practices can still be seen today. Likewise, the Sufi order of Islam has been one of the most active Muslim groups in Kyrgyzstan for over a century.

== In Afghanistan ==
The Kyrgyz population of [[Afghanistan]] was 1,130 in 2003, all from eastern [[Wakhan District]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Estrin  |first=James |date=February 4, 2013 |title= A Hard Life on the ‘Roof of the World’|url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/a-hard-life-on-the-roof-of-the-world/ |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Badakhshan Province]] of northeastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt; They still lead a nomadic lifestyle and are led by a ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'' or ''[[Tegin|tekin]]''.

The suppression of the [[Central Asian Revolt|1916 rebellion]] against [[Russian Empire|Russian]] rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to [[China]] and Afghanistan. Most of the Kyrgyz refugees in Afghanistan settled in the [[Wakhan]] region. Until 1978, the northeastern portion of Wakhan was home to about 3–5 thousand ethnic Kyrgyz.&lt;ref name="reu"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSSP389507 FACTBOX-Key facts about the Wakhan Corridor].

They requested 5,000 visas from the United States consulate in [[Peshawar]] for resettlement in [[Alaska]], a state of the United States which they thought might have a similar climate and temperature with the [[Wakhan Corridor]]. Their request was denied.  In the meantime, the heat and the unsanitary conditions of the refugee camp were killing off the Kyrgyz refugees at an alarming rate. [[Turkey]], which was under the military coup rule of General [[Kenan Evren]], stepped in, and resettled the entire group in the [[Lake Van]] region of Turkey in 1982. The village of [[Ulupamir]] (or “Great Pamir” in Kyrgyz) in [[Erciş]] in [[Van Province]] was given to these, where more than 5,000 of them still reside today.

A '''logo''' (abbreviation of '''logotype''',&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/logo | title = logo: definition of logo in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English) | accessdate = 2014-03-05 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-el|λόγος|translit=logos|lit=word|italic=yes}} and {{lang-el|τύπος|translit=typos|lit=imprint|italic=yes|link=no}}) is a [[graphic]] mark, [[emblem]], or [[symbol]] used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a [[wordmark]].

In the days of [[hot metal typesetting]], a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF [[Garamond]]), as opposed to a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]], which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word.&lt;ref&gt;Fyffe, Charles. ''Basic Copyfitting'', Studio Vista, London, 1969, SBN 289797055, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged [[typeface]] or [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. At the level of [[mass communication]] and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its [[trademark]] or [[brand]].&lt;ref name="wheeler_dbi_pg4"&gt;Wheeler, Alina.

As the [[industrial revolution]] converted western societies from [[Agriculture|agrarian]] to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated [[typography]] and imagery together on the page.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=138–159}} Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet [[poster]]s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=126–134}}

The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs.

Innovators in the visual arts and lithographic process—such as French printing firm Rouchon in the 1840s, Joseph Morse of New York in the 1850s, Frederick Walker of England in the 1870s, and Jules Chéret of France in the 1870s—developed an illustrative style that went beyond tonal, representational art to figurative imagery with sections of bright, flat colors.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Playful children’s books, authoritative newspapers, and conversational periodicals developed their own visual and editorial styles for unique, expanding audiences. As printing costs decreased, literacy rates increased, and visual styles changed, the [[Victorian decorative arts]] led to an expansion of typographic styles and methods of representing businesses.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=159–161}}

[[File:Bass logo.svg|thumb|upright|The first logo to be trademarked was the [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] red triangle in 1876]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] of late-19th century, partially in response to the excesses of Victorian typography, aimed to restore an honest sense of craftsmanship to the mass-produced goods of the era.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=162–167}} A renewal of interest in craftsmanship and quality also provided the artists and companies with a greater interest in credit, leading to the creation of unique logos and marks.

By the 1950s, [[Modernism]] had shed its roots as an avant-garde artistic movement in Europe to become an international, commercialized movement with adherents in the United States and elsewhere. The visual simplicity and conceptual clarity that were the hallmarks of [[Modernism]] as an artistic movement formed a powerful toolset for a new generation of graphic designers whose logos embodied [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]’s dictum, "Less is more." Modernist-inspired logos proved successful in the era of mass visual communication ushered in by television, improvements in printing technology, and digital innovations.

==Contemporary logos==
[[File:Croixrouge logos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent (symbol)|Red Crescent]] emblems]]

The current era of logo design began in the 1870s{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} with the first abstract logo, the Bass red triangle. {{As of | 2014}}, many corporations, products, brands, services, agencies, and other entities use an ideogram (sign, icon) or an emblem (symbol) or a combination of sign and emblem as a logo. As a result, only a few of the thousands of ideograms in circulation are recognizable without a name. An effective logo may consist of both an ideogram and the company name (logotype) to emphasize the name over the graphic, and employ a unique design via the use of letters, colors, and additional graphic elements.

[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Coca-Cola logo is identifiable in other writing-systems, here written in [[Cyrillic]].]]

Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many [[alphabet]]s in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in [[Arabic script]] might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms  keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the [[Red Cross]] (varied as the [[Red Crescent]] in Muslim countries and as the [[Magen David Adom|Red Star of David]] in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.

[[Brand]]ing can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TICoRD'13: Global Product Development|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9788132210498e|website=Springer|publisher=Springers|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers and potential consumers can identify the [[Coca-Cola]] name written in different alphabets because of the standard color and "ribbon wave" design of its logo. The text was written in [[Spencerian Script]], which was a popular writing style when the [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola Logo]] was being designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coca-Cola logo story|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/history/advertising/the-logo-story/|website=Coca Cola Official Website|publisher=The Coca Cola Company|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo design==

Since a logo is the visual entity signifying an organization, logo design is an important area of [[graphic design]]. A logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to all communications of an organization. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation in a visual identity system is one of the most difficult and important areas of graphic design. Logos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs, such as Chase Bank, are completely abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; logotypes (or wordmarks) depict the name or company initials. Because logos are meant to represent companies' brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to frequently redesign logos.

The logo design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the [[Modernist movement]] in the [[United States]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=363}} Three designers are widely{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=369–374}} considered the pioneers of that movement and of logo and [[corporate identity]] design: The first is [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=373–374}} which is the firm responsible for a large number of iconic logos, such as [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] Bank (1964), [[Mobil Oil]] (1965), [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (1984), [[NBC]] (1986), [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] (2003), and others. Due to the simplicity and boldness of their designs, many of their earlier logos are still in use today. The firm recently designed logos for the [[Library of Congress]] and the fashion brand [[Armani Exchange]]. Another pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Paul Rand]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=369}} who was one of the originators of the Swiss Style of [[graphic design]]. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the famous logos for [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The third pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Saul Bass]].{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=375}} Bass was responsible for several recognizable logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] globe (1983). Other well-known designs were [[Continental Airlines]] (1968), Dixie (1969), and [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1972). Later, he would produce logos for a number of Japanese companies as well.
An important development in the documentation of logo design is the study of French trademarks by historian Edith Amiot and philosopher Jean Louis Azizollah.&lt;ref&gt;Les Marques Francaises 1824–1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo color==
Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important role in brand differentiation. The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection.  In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride. 

Choosing an organisation's logo's color is an important decision because of its long term implications and its role in creating differentiation among competitors' logos. A methodology for identifying potential logo colors within an industry sector is color mapping, whereby existing logo colors are systematically identified, mapped, and evaluated (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zena O'Connor|title=Logo Colour and Differentiation: A New Application of Environmental Colour Mapping |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.20594/abstract |journal=Color Research and Application |volume=36 |number=1 |pages=55–60 |doi=10.1002/col.20594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo design process===
Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization, investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products, and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.

===Dynamic logos===

}}

In 1898, the French tire manufacturer [[Michelin]] introduced the [[Michelin Man]], a cartoon figure presented in many different contexts, such as eating, drinking, and playing sports. By the early 21st century, large corporations such as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Google]], [[Morton Salt]], and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] had adopted ''dynamic logos'' that change over time from setting to setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=2008-05-21
|date=2007-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-compatible logos===
A company that uses logotypes (wordmarks) may desire a logo that matches the firm's Internet address. For short logotypes consisting of two or three characters, multiple companies are found to employ the same letters. A "CA" logo, for example, is used by the French bank [[Credit Agricole]], the Dutch clothing retailer [[C&amp;A]], and the US software corporation [[CA Technologies]], but only one can have the Internet domain name CA.com.

In today's digital interface adaptive world, a logo will be formatted and re-formatted from large monitors to small handheld devices. With the constant size change and re-formatting, logo designers are shifting to a more bold and simple approach, with heavy lines and shapes, and solid colors. This reduces the confusion when mingled with other logos in tight spaces and when scaled between media. Social networks like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[Google+]] use such logos.

==Design protection==
Logos and their design may be protected by copyright, via various [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]] organisations worldwide which make available application procedures to register a design to give it protection at law. For example, in the UK, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm.htm|publisher =UK Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; govern registered designs, patents, and trademarks. Ordinarily, the trademark registration will not 'make claim' to colors used, meaning it is the visual design that will be protected, even if it is reproduced in a variety of other colors or backgrounds.

==Sports==
For many teams, a logo or "[[crest (sports)|crest]]" is an important way to recognize a team's history and can intimidate opponents.
For certain teams, the logo and color scheme are synonymous with the team's players. For example, [[Manchester United]], the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], or [[New York Yankees]] all have a recognizable logo that can be identified by any fan of the respective sport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">The original '''United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790 ''' ({{USStat|1|103}}) provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national [[citizenship]]. This law limited [[naturalization]] to immigrants who were free White persons of good character. It thus excluded [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Indentured servitude in the Americas|indentured servants]], [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], free blacks and later Asians, although free blacks were allowed citizenship at the state level in certain states. It also provided for citizenship for the children of U.S. citizens born abroad, stating that such children "shall be considered as [[natural born citizen]]s," the only US statute ever to use the term. It specified that the right of citizenship did "not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hymowitz|last2=Weissman|title=A History of Women in America|publisher=Bantam|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz|first=Jeffrey D.|title=Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&amp;pg=PA284|page=284|year=2002|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11058038/ted-cruz-court ''Bad news for Ted Cruz: his eligibility for president is going to court.''] Dara Lind and Jeff Stein. Vox Media. 18 February 2016. Retrieved 20 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
In order to address one's good character, the law required two years of residence in the United States and one year in the state of residence, prior to applying for citizenship. When those requirements were met, an immigrant could file a Petition for Naturalization with "any common law court of record" having jurisdiction over his residence. Once convinced of the applicant's good moral character, the court would administer an oath of allegiance to support the [[Constitution of the United States]]. The clerk of the court was to make a record of these proceedings, and "thereupon such person shall be considered as a citizen of the United States."

The Act also establishes the United States citizenship of certain children of citizens, born abroad, without the need for naturalization: "the children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond Sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born Citizens: ''provided'', That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States"

==Afterwards==
The Act of 1790 was repealed by the [[Naturalization Act of 1795]], which extended the residence requirement to five years, and by the [[Naturalization Act of 1798]], which extended it to 14 years. The 1798 act was repealed by the [[Naturalization Law of 1802]].

Nevertheless, as it was passed by the [[1st United States Congress|same Congress]] who enacted the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], including members who had participated in the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], The Act of 1790 is thought to be an indicator of what the nation's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] thought about the powers of the [[U.S. Government]] over immigration. Some, like noted activist, author and publisher B.L. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lesbianauthorsguild.com/b-l-wilson&lt;/ref&gt; argue from The Act of 1790 that even today only White people and their progeny would be eligible to become U.S. citizens, a minority view rejected by other scholars in light of later legislation passed on immigration.

Major changes to the definition of citizenship were ratified in the nineteenth century following the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868 granted citizenship to people born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction; but it excluded untaxed “[[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]” (Native Americans living on reservations). The [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] extended "the naturalization laws" to "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent." In 1898 the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' granted citizenship to an American-born child of Chinese parents who had a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and who were there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the [[Emperor of China]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898). https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/169/649/&lt;/ref&gt; All persons born in the United States since ''United States v. Wong Kim Ark'' have been granted citizenship although the Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled on the matter of children born to parents who are not legal residents of the United States.

All Native Americans were finally granted citizenship by the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], whether or not they belonged to a federally recognized tribe; by that date two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens. Further changes to racial eligibility for naturalized citizenship were ratified after 1940, when eligibility was also extended to "descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere," "Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent," "Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent," and "persons of races indigenous to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v.

The case sparked outrage and [[protest]]s involving Na-young's parents and many others. In 2011, R&amp;B singer [[Ali (South Korean singer)|ALi]] released a [[song]] based on Na-young's story, titled "Nayoungee."

'''New Zealand Red Cross''' or '''Ripeka Whero Aotearoa''' is a humanitarian organisation, which has more than 15,000 members and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/yk-files/567d22b77c01bb581b1775d9208c0dc0/NZRC%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, New Zealand Red Cross is celebrating its ‘Century of Care’ – 100 years of Red Cross activity in New Zealand. In New Zealand, Red Cross delivers core community services, such as Meals on Wheels, Community Transport, Refugee Services, first aid courses and emergency management operations. Internationally, New Zealand Red Cross sends aid workers overseas to assist in areas where humanitarian assistance is needed; this includes disaster preparedness and response. In 2013, 17 workers were sent to the Philippines in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan and in 2014, 18 New Zealand aid workers responded to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

== History == 
Ad hoc activity on behalf of the Red Cross began in New Zealand in 1914, at the outbreak of World War I (WWI). After a number of enquiries, New Zealand’s first Governor-General Lord Liverpool convened a meeting of Red Cross and St John representatives in Wellington on 10 November 1915. This led to the formation of a national office and Council, and the emergence of the New Zealand Branch of the [[British Red Cross]], known from 1917 as the ‘New Zealand branch of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/welfare-services/page-5|title=RED CROSS SOCIETY |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Cross raised money and organised medical supplies, [[Red Cross parcel#World War I|clothing and food parcels]] for sick and wounded soldiers overseas and once they returned home. They also helped during the influenza epidemic in 1918 by training nurses and providing medical supplies and relief.

Although Red Cross personnel had previously responded to floods and to the Murchison earthquake of 1929, the Hawke’s Bay earthquake of 3 February 1931 raised awareness of the need for a more efficient, centralised response to natural disasters. This awareness, and pressure from the British Red Cross for New Zealand to develop an independent national Society, led to the founding of the New Zealand Red Cross Society by Nurse Beth Charpentier, which was incorporated on 22 December 1931.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.martinboroughstar.co.nz/martinborough-red-cross-group-celebrates-a-birthday/&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition by the New Zealand government and the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent followed in June 1932.

The New Zealand Red Cross Society again teamed up with the Order of St John during World War II as the Joint Council, sending medical relief, supplies, clothing and food to sick and wounded soldiers and New Zealand prisoners of war. In 1990, the Society changed its name to New Zealand Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/about-us/our-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Red Cross is registered as a charity in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.register.charities.govt.nz/CharitiesRegister/ViewCharity?accountId=d8130711-d58c-dc11-98a0-0015c5f3da29&amp;searchId=d30265db-923f-4d22-acd4-b27cf1e41cb9 |title=Charity Summary |publisher=Gov.nz |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand WW2 POW food parcels===
The New Zealand Red Cross Society provided 1,139,624 parcels during the war period, packed by 1,500 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.redcross.org.nz/100/world-war-two/new-zealand-red-cross-and-wwii/ |title=New Zealand Red Cross and WWII |publisher=New Zealand Red Cross |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054613/https://www.redcross.org.nz/100/world-war-two/new-zealand-red-cross-and-wwii/ |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners parcels included:

== New Zealand Red Cross programmes ==

=== Aid workers ===
New Zealand Red Cross has been sending ordinary New Zealanders overseas to help out where the need is greatest since 1937. Dr Robert Grey of Auckland and Dr Hector Tremewan of Wellington were sent to China during the Sino-Japanese war to help in medical centres and refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/100/aid-workers/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then hundreds of aid workers have been sent overseas to help in conflicts and disasters in roles such as communications, emergency telecommunications, health and first aid, security, organisational preparedness and water and sanitation.

New Zealand Red Cross aid workers are seconded to the IFRC and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  New Zealand Red Cross recruits, trains and provides aid workers for the ICRC. It is one of only a small number of national societies to do this worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/around-the-world/international-aid-worker-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canterbury Earthquakes Recovery Programme ===
Following the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes, New Zealand Red Cross has been committed to helping the recovery efforts in Canterbury. Red Cross’s two appeals for the earthquakes raised a combined $128 million, which is the largest New Zealand Red Cross appeal since World War II. New Zealanders alone gave more than $100 million to the appeal. New Zealand Red Cross has now helped one in four Cantabrians (more than 100,000 people), given out $91 million in grants and spent $11 million on recovery programmes. Programmes range from repairing quake-damaged homes, such as the ‘Let’s Find and Fix’ campaign, to Winter Warmer Packs and Supporting Schools. New Zealand Red Cross has also facilitated psychosocial support since the earthquakes to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/in-new-zealand/helping-in-canterbury/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community Services ===
Community services are the cornerstone of New Zealand Red Cross work. Two of these services have a long history in New Zealand - Community Transport and Meals On Wheels. Community Transport grew from the transportation of sick and wounded returned servicemen to medical appointments and outings in World War II.  After the war the Transport Corps extended their activities to disabled civilians as well as servicemen. Community Transport continues to take people to doctor appointments and hospital visits who otherwise may not be able to get there.  The Meals On Wheels programme was started in June 1951 by the North Canterbury Red Cross Centre during a gas, coal and electricity shortage when the volunteers decided to make soup for people in need. A local café proprietor, offered to cook stock for the soup and deliver it for free and a local butcher supplied the bones and meat for the soup to Red Cross free of charge. In 2014, 544,843 meals were delivered around New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/100/in-the-community/first-meals-on-wheels-delivery/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and Training ===
Since the influenza epidemic, New Zealand Red Cross has been involved in first aid training in New Zealand, with formal qualifications beginning in the 1920s. There were multiple courses available including first aid, home nursing and motherhood. New Zealand Red Cross holds an NZQA Category One First Aid Training Provider certification and trains tens of thousands of New Zealanders a year. They also sell first aid kits, AED (automated external defibrillator) products and training equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/first-aid/courses/&lt;/ref&gt;

On First Aid Day 2014 (13 September), New Zealand Red Cross launched a first aid and emergency app. The app provides step-by-step information on how to respond to emergency situations specific to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/first-aid/first-aid-app/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disaster Management === 
New Zealand Red Cross has a network of emergency response volunteers in New Zealand who are taught how to react to different disasters and help New Zealanders in need. They work closely with the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM). There are currently 19 New Zealand Red Cross Disaster, Welfare and Support Teams (DWSTs)which are made up entirely of volunteers. These teams take part in disaster simulation exercises throughout New Zealand, such as earthquake or cyclone scenarios, to ensure they are prepared.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/in-new-zealand/emergency-operations/&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Red Cross has responded to national disasters such as the Christchurch earthquakes, the Hawke’s Bay earthquake, the Tangiwai disaster, the Wahine disaster and most recently the June 2015 floods.

=== Red Cross Shops ===
Red Cross shops started in the World War I, with the first shop opening in Cathedral Square on 1 June 1915.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/in-new-zealand/emergency-operations/&lt;/ref&gt; There are now 53 Red Cross shops in New Zealand, which are staffed by 1,400 volunteers. The shops sell second hand goods and all the money raised is used to fund New Zealand Red Cross operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/retail-shops/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refugee Services ===
New Zealand Red Cross members first sent goods to refugees overseas. The arrival of 733 Polish refugee children and 102 adults on 1 November 1944 was the first refugee resettlement programme the New Zealand Red Cross participated in.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/100/refugee-resettlement/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, activities to welcome and support new settlers have been an ongoing feature of Red Cross efforts. In 2013, New Zealand Red Cross merged with Refugee Services. Each year around 750 refugees are welcomed to New Zealand through the United Nations Resettlement Programme. A 'Refugee of the Year' award was introduced to both promote the plight of refugees and award deserving people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tindall.org.nz/red-cross-refugee-year-awards-announced/ |title=Red Cross' Refugee of the Year Awards announced |publisher=The Tindall Foundation |date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Red Cross, which has a contract with the government, is the primary agency supporting quota refugees in New Zealand. They provide core resettlement services in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington and Nelson. A new programme called Pathways to Employment was started by New Zealand Red Cross in 2014 to help people with refugee backgrounds find work and reach their career goals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/in-new-zealand/refugee-services/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red Cross Red Crescent Movement ===
New Zealand Red Cross is part of the largest humanitarian organisation in the world, the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC). The Red Cross and Red Crescent movement has more than 97 million volunteers worldwide.

'''Nigerians''' or '''Nigerian people''' are citizens of [[Nigeria]] or people with ancestry from Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Gordon (2003), 233"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnic diversity within nations|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|location=Santa Barbara, California, USA|isbn=1576076822|pages=233|author=April A.

''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are multiple ethnic groups in Nigeria, economic factors result in significant mobility of Nigerians of multiple ethnic and religious backgrounds to reside in territories in Nigeria that are outside their ethnic or religious background, resulting in the intermixing of the various ethnic and religious groups, especially in Nigeria's cities.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 8"&gt;Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Nigerians.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233"&gt;April A. Gordon. ''Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 percent of Nigerians are [[Islam|Muslims]] and the other 50 percent are [[Christianity|Christians]].&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6"&gt;Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerians come from multiple ethnic and religious backgrounds as the creation of Nigeria was the result of a colonial creation by the [[British Empire]] that did not correlate with ethnic and religious boundaries.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233"/&gt;

There have been several major historical states in Nigeria that have influenced Nigerian society via their kings and their legal and taxation systems, and the use of religion to legitimize the power of the king and to unite the people.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"&gt;Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Nigeria has been culturally influenced by Islamic influence including several major historic Islamic states in the region.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/&gt; The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] and the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] were major historical Islamic states in northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/&gt; Southern Nigeria historically held several powerful states, including the [[Benin Empire]] and [[Oyo Empire]], Ife Confederacy and several other Yoruba states.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/&gt;

Nigerian culture was profoundly affected by the British [[Colonialism|colonial rule]].&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"&gt;Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Such as British colonial authorities' denouncements and attacks upon [[polygamy]], trial by ordeal, and certain types of sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/&gt; At the same time, British colonial authorities maintained and promoted traditional Nigerian culture that strengthened colonial administration.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/&gt; The British spread Christianity throughout southern Nigeria and Christian missionaries assisted British authorities in establishing a [[Western world|Western]]-style education system in Nigeria that resulted in the teaching of the English language in Nigeria and its subsequent adoption as Nigeria's main language.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/&gt; The British replaced unpaid household labour with [[wage labour]].&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/&gt; Prior to colonization in the twentieth century, Nigeria's tribes usually [[Land tenure|possessed the land]] as a community, such that land could not be bought or sold.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" /&gt; Colonization brought the notion of individuals owning land and commercialization of land began.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" /&gt;

In Nigeria a majority of seventy percent of Nigerians live in villages of two types: the first type used by the Igbo and Tiv involves a collection of dispersed compounds, the second type used amongst the Hausa, Yoruba, and Kanuri involves nucleii of compounds.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6" /&gt; These villages compose members of the ethnicity-related through ancestry as well as strangers who have been assimilated into the ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6" /&gt; Since the time prior to colonization to the present it has been common practice of Nigeria's tribes to adopt strangers into the tribes.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" /&gt; A male elder commonly serves as a village chief.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6" /&gt;

In Nigeria's large cities, there is substantial [[intermingling]] of Nigerians with foreigners, especially Europeans, [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], and [[Indian people|Indians]].&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 8"/&gt; The economic importance of Nigeria's cities has resulted in migrations of people from their traditional ethnic or cultural homeland to cities outside those territories.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 8"/&gt; Igbo and Ibibio people have commonly migrated to [[Lagos]] and many southerners migrate to the north to trade or work while a number of northerner seasonal workers and small-scale entrepreneurs go to the south.&lt;ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 8"/&gt;

Ethnic, religious, and regional disputes and tensions have commonly divided Nigerians on political issues.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 111"&gt;April A. Gordon. ''Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, cultural and political divisions between the [[Islam|Muslim]] north and the [[Christianity|Christian]] south has politicized religion and caused significant political disputes in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 111" /&gt; Ethnic-motivated and religious-motivated violence by extremists has increased these tensions as well.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt;

However, in spite of instances of extremism, most Nigerians continue to peacefully coexist with each other, and a common Nigerian identity has been fostered amongst the more-educated and affluent Nigerians as well as with the many Nigerians who leave small homogeneous ethnic communities to seek economic opportunities in the cities where the population is ethnically mixed.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt; Although there are cultural divisions amongst Nigerians, Nigerians commonly use the English language as their primary language.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt; Also, most Nigerians share a strong commitment to individual liberties and democracy.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt; Even during periods of military rule, such military governments were pressured to maintain democratic stances by the Nigerian people.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt; Nigeria's political figures commonly know multiple indigenous languages outside their own indigenous language.&lt;ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /&gt;

Approximately 15,000 people in [[Denmark]] belong to an autochthonous [[ethnic German]] minority traditionally referred to as ''hjemmetyskere'' meaning "domestic Germans" in [[Danish language|Danish]], and as ''Nordschleswiger'' in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordschleswig.dk  Nordschleswig]&lt;/ref&gt; This minority of Germans hold Danish [[citizenship]] and self-identify as [[ethnic Germans]]. They generally speak [[German language in the United States|German]] or [[Low German]] alongside [[South Jutlandic]] dialect of [[Danish language|Danish]] as their [[home language]]s. Furthermore, there are also several thousand German immigrants residing in Denmark with no historical connection to this group.

==History==
[[Image:Abstimmung-schleswig-1920.png|thumb|left|Results of the plebiscite]]

In 1920, in the aftermath of [[World War I]], two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] were held in the northernmost part of the Prussian [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]] (the northern half of the former [[Duchy of Schleswig]]). The plebiscites were held in two zones that were defined by Denmark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschichte-s-h.de/zeitreiseindex.htm ''Abstimmungsgebiet'', Plebiscite Zones and how they were defined (German), Gesellschaft für Schleswig-Holsteinische Geschichte (Society for History of Schleswig-Holstein)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513051709/http://www.geschichte-s-h.de/zeitreiseindex.htm |date=2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the ideas of the Danish historian Hans Victor Clausen. The northern Zone I was deliminated according to Clausen's estimation of where the local rural population identified itself as Danish, a survey published in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/leksikon/c/all/4549 Clausen-linjen, Grænseforeningen (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Clausen travelled extensively on both sides of the eventual border, in an attempt determine which communities that would vote for a return to Danish rule, and concluded that this was the case north of the [[Skelbæk]]ken creek, where most rural communities were both Danish-speaking and pro-Danish, while the communities south of this line were overwhelmingly pro-German (though some of these communities were also primarily Danish-speaking). Near Tønder, he deviated from this system, and included the German-majority towns of [[Tønder]] and [[Højer]] into the northern sector for economic purposes, and to achieve a line following a [[Levee|dyke]], consequently this line followed the dyke south of Højer.

[[File:Former German territories.svg|200px|thumb|North Schleswig and other German territories lost in both World Wars are shown in black, present-day Germany is marked dark grey on this 1914 map.]]

The northern Zone I voted ''en bloc'', i.e. as a unit with the majority deciding, and the result was 75% for Denmark and 25% for Germany, consequently resulting in a German minority north on the new border. In the southern Zone II, each parish/town voted for its own future allegiance, and all districts in Zone II showed German majorities. The eventual border was deliminated virtually identical with the border between Zones I and II.

In the northern Zone (Zone I), 25% of the population, i.e. around 40,000 people voted to remain part of Germany, the German North Schleswigers having their centres in the towns of [[Tønder]], [[Aabenraa]], and [[Sønderborg]], but also in a rural district between Tønder and Flensburg near the new border, most notably in [[Tinglev]]. Smaller German minorities existed in [[Haderslev]] and [[Christiansfeld]] (both towns with Danish majorities). Sønderborg and Aabenraa were strongly dominated by both nationalities (c. 55% Germans and 45% Danes). In Sønderborg, the German majority was partially due to a local military garrison, and the German element in this town decreased sharply in the 1920s, after the German garrison had been withdrawn and replaced with a Danish one. Tønder had a vast German majority (c. 80%) but was included in the northern Zone for geographical and economic reasons, and because of the small population of this (and the other) North Schleswig towns.

Between 1920–1939, the North Schleswig Germans elected Johannes Schmidt-Vodder as their representative in the Danish [[Folketinget|Parliament]] with c. 13–15% of the North Schleswig votes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/leksikon/s/all/4133 Johannes Schmidt-Vodder, Grænseforeningen (Danish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221215040/http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/leksikon/s/all/4133 |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the share of North Schleswigers that identified as Germans had decreased when compared with the 1920 referendum.

Since 1945, the North Schleswig Germans have been presented by ''[[Bund Deutscher Nordschleswiger]]'', a cultural organisation, and continued to elect a member of Parliament until the 1950s.

The North Schleswig Germans are currently represented in the municipal councils of Aabenraa, Tønder, and Sønderborg. Bund Deutscher Nordschleswiger estimates the current number of North Schleswig Germans to be around 15,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdn.dk/SEEEMS/4.asp Bund Deutscher Nordschleswiger (German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316100649/http://www.bdn.dk/SEEEMS/4.asp |date=2013-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. around 6% of the North Schleswig population of c. 250,000. Which are a lot fewer than the 50,000 Danish who lives in [[Southern Schleswig]], where for instance [[Flensborg Avis]], a newspaper in Danish is printed every day.

The '''Oirata–Makasai''', or '''Eastern Timor''', languages are a small family of [[Papuan languages]] spoken in eastern [[Timor]] and the neighboring island of [[Kisar]].

==Languages==
Mandala ''et al.'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Mandala, Halus; Aron Meko Mbete, Ni Made Dhanawaty and Inyo Yis Fernandez. 2011: [http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eol/article/view/3550/2581 “Phonological Evolution of Oirata and its Genetic Relationship with Non-Austronesian Languages in Timor-Leste”], ''Denpasar: Ejournal Universitas Udayana''.&lt;/ref&gt; found that Fataluku and Oirata are closer to each other than they are to Makasai:

*[[Makasai language|Makasai]] (including [[Makalero dialect]])
*Oirata–Fataluku
**[[Fataluku language|Fataluku]] ([[Rusenu language|Rusenu]] perhaps belongs here)
**[[Oirata language|Oirata]]

Fataluku has high dialect diversity, and may be more than a single language, for example with [[Rusenu language|Rusenu]]. An additional [[Makuv'a language|Makuv'a]] (Lovaea) branch was once assumed for East Timor, but that appears to be a heavily Papuan-influenced Austronesian language.

The fourth Papuan language spoken in East Timor, [[Bunak language|Bunak]], is more distantly related.  It is currently unknown if they are closer to each other or to the [[Alor–Pantar languages]]; all are clearly related.  They may be closest to the [[West Bomberai languages]] of mainland New Guinea, but this is as yet speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1861441/The_historical_relations_of_the_Papuan_languages_of_Timor_and_Kisar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Ross (2005) reconstructed first- and second-person pronouns for proto–East Timor:&lt;ref&gt;{{Malcolm Ross Pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Páez people''', also known as the '''Nasa''', are a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] people who live in the southwestern highlands of [[Colombia]], especially in the [[Cauca Department]], but also the [[Caquetá Department]] lowlands and [[Tierradentro]] .&lt;ref name=every&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/P-ez-Orientation.html "Páez - Orientation."] ''Countries and Their Cultures.'' (retrieved 2 Dec 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
In the early 1900s, [[Lazarists]] built missions among the Paez and began the work to convert them to [[Christianity]]. [[Jesuits]] had originally tried to convert the Paez, but failed. However, the Lazarists met some success.  The Paez developed a syncretic form of [[Roman Catholicism]] that absorbed their indigenous [[religion]].  For example, the Paez have [[shamans]] but many have also become [[Roman Catholic priest]]s.&lt;ref name=lds/&gt;

==Climate adaptation==
{{see|Andean textiles}}
Since they live in the cold [[climate]] of the Andes, the Paez build their homes using brick, metal, cement, and wood. The Paez women raise and shear sheep for wool. They clean the wool, spin yarn from it, dye it and knit clothes and blankets for their families.

==Punishment==
[[Punishment]] for wrongs is strict in the Paez culture. In June 2000, the Paez whipped an adulterous tribal leader and his mistress 17 strokes with a knotted leather whip. "As a Paez Indian," the flogged tribal leader said, "I'm proud to have received this punishment because it is glorifying my  race." Stripping the one being punished of his clothing and dunking him in a cold mountain lake is another form of punishment—this was done to Senator [[Jesus Pinacue]], a Paez who defied the community by supporting a political candidate in a presidential vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/coj00006.htm Colombian tribe whips cheating lovers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Petroleum Revolution''' ([[Valencian language|Valencian]]: ''La Revolució del Petroli'') was a workers' revolt of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[syndicalist]] nature, which took place in [[Alcoy (Spain)|Alcoy]], [[Alicante]], [[Spain]] in 1873.

==History==
[[File:Muerte del Alcalde de Alcoy D. Agustín Albors (Segunda parte de la Guerra Civil. Anales desde 1843 hasta el fallecimiento de don Alfonso XII).jpg|thumb|Death of the mayor of Alcoi Agustí Albors]]
During the [[First Spanish Republic]], Alcoy was one of the few Spanish cities where the [[Industrial Revolution]] had taken root. The city was occupied by the paper, textile, and metallurgic industries, which had engendred a great upswing in population and the implementation of a capitalist system of production, as well as introducing mechanisation as a substitute for much former manual labour. This provoked the appearance of [[Luddite]] movements, which began to destroy the machinery in vindication and defense of the [[working class]].

This situation placed the city of Alcoy at the frontlines of the social conflicts of this era, due to the poor situation of the workers, who organised themselves and were pioneers in the establishment of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (AIT) in Spain. Other [[proletarian]] revolutions arose in Spain, but the most significant was ''Petroleum Revolution''. In that event, the workers seized control of the city for days in July 1873, in the course of a general strike which eventually became a riot against the republican mayor [[Agustí Albors]] (better known as ''Pelletes''). During the revolt, Albors gave the order to fire on demonstrators, who defended themselves by assaulting the town hall and executing the mayor and trapping the rest of the municipal leadership in the building.

The city declared itself independent, and was governed from 9–13 July 1873 by the ''Committee of Public Health'', presided over by [[Severino Albarracín]]. The demonstrators declared a series of pay raises and reducing the work day. Finally, the revolt ended with the intervention of the federal army and the military occupation of the city, hefty repression against the revolutionaries, and practically no improvements for the labouring class. More than 600 workers were put on trial, including minors between 12 and 17 years of age. Many of the accused were condemned to death.

Those events broke the collaboration agreements between the republicans and anarchists, and gave the Marxists room to criticise the anarchists directing the workers' movement. [[Friedrich Engels]] himself put grim criticism in his 1873 mémoir on the bakunists' role in the Spanish uprising.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels]]: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1873/bakunin/ The Bakunists at Work. An account of the Spanish revolt in the summer of 1873.] K. Marx, F. Engels, Revolution in Spain, Lawrence &amp; Wishart, International Publishers, 1939;&lt;/ref&gt; After that point, the working class began to self-organise, aided by certain factors of the Catholic Church. They created various organisations and institutions: professional Catholic schools known as [[Salesianos]], Catholic workers' clubs, and savings funds like the [[Monte de Piedad]] (1875).

The event is called the ''Petroleum Revolution'' since the workers, desperate due to living conditions, carried as their standard petroleum-soaked torches. During those days, according to chroniclers, the city stank of petroleum.

== In popular culture ==

The writer [[Isabel-Clara Simó]] in her novel ''Julia'' (1983) narrates the history of Julia, a girl obliged to work in a fabric mill in [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]] after her father's death in prison as a result of participating in the ''Petroleum Revolution''.

[[File:Secretary Pompeo Conducts airborne questions and answers (43821739051).jpg|thumb|Members of the press ask questions of US Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]]]]
'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Political journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|publisher=mundoelectoral.com|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ranks of Nobility}}

A '''queen regnant''' (plural: queens regnant) is a female [[monarch]], equivalent in rank to a [[king (title)|king]], who reigns in her own right, as opposed to a [[queen consort]], who is the wife of a reigning king, or a [[regent|queen regent]], who is the guardian of a child monarch and reigns temporarily in the child's stead. 
An '''empress regnant''' is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an [[empire]].

A queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers, whereas a queen consort shares her husband's rank and titles, but does not share the sovereignty of her husband. The husband of a queen regnant traditionally does not share his wife's rank, title or sovereignty. However, the concept of a [[king consort]] is not unheard of in both contemporary and classical periods.

A [[queen dowager]] is the widow of a king. A [[queen mother]] is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign.

== History ==
[[File:Elizabeth II &amp; Philip after Coronation.JPG|left|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]], Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, here with her husband on the occasion of her coronation in 1953]]

In Ancient Egypt, Ancient Persia, Asian and Pacific cultures, and even some European countries, female monarchs have been given the title ''king'' or its equivalent, such as ''[[pharaoh]]'', when gender is irrelevant to the office, or else have used the masculine form of the word in languages where gender is needed. The [[Byzantine]] [[Empress Irene]] sometimes called herself ''[[basileus]]'' (βασιλεύς), 'emperor', rather than ''basilissa'' (βασίλισσα), 'empress' and [[Jadwiga of Poland]] was crowned as ''Rex Poloniae'', ''King of Poland''.

Among the [[Davidic]] Monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], there is mentioned a single queen regnant, [[Athaliah]], though the [[Hebrew Bible]] regards her negatively as a usurper. The much later [[Hasmonean]] Queen [[Salome Alexandra]] (Shlom Tzion) was highly popular.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Accession of a queen regnant occurs as a nation's [[order of succession]] permits. Methods of succession to queendoms, kingdoms, [[tribe|tribal]] chiefships, and such include nomination (the reigning monarch or a council names an heir), [[primogeniture]] (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest), and [[ultimogeniture]] (in which the children have preference in the reverse order of birth from youngest to eldest). The scope of succession may be matrilineal, patrilineal, or both; or, rarely, open to general election when necessary. The right of succession may be open to men and women, or limited to men only or to women only.
[[File:Margaret of Denmark, Norway &amp; Sweden (1389) effigy 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]] ruled Denmark, Sweden and Norway in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.]]

The most typical succession in European monarchies from the [[Late Middle Ages]] until the late 20th century was [[male-preference primogeniture]]: the order of succession ranked the sons of the monarch in order of their birth, followed by the daughters. Historically, many realms{{which|date=January 2014}} forbade succession by women or through a female line in accordance with the [[Salic law]], and some{{which|date=January 2014}} still do. No queen regnant ever ruled [[France]], for example. Only one woman, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], ruled Austria. As noted in the list below of widely-known ruling queens, many reigned in European monarchies.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544|title=Overturning centuries of royal rules|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32073399|title=New rules on royal succession come into force|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended their laws of succession to [[absolute primogeniture]] (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest regardless of gender). In some cases, the change does not take effect during the lifetimes of people already in the line of succession at the time the law was passed.

In 2011, the United Kingdom and 15 other [[Commonwealth realms]] agreed to remove the rule of male-preference primogeniture. Once the necessary legislation was passed, this means that had [[Prince William]] had a daughter first, a younger son would not become heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloxham|first=Andy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8854981/Centuries-old-rule-of-succession-in-British-Royal-family-scrapped-by-Commonwealth.html|accessdate=2011-12-31|newspaper=Telegraph|location=London|title=Centuries-old rule of primogeniture in Royal Family scrapped|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Elizabeth II]] became the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning queen regnant]] and female head of state in world history. In 2016, she became the [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest currently serving head of state]] and [[Current reigning monarchs by length of reign|longest currently reigning monarch]]. 

===East Asia===
In [[China]], [[Wu Zetian]] became the Chinese empress regnant and established the [[Zhou Dynasty (690–705)|Zhou Dynasty]] after dismissing her sons. The Empress Wu used the title ''huangdi'' (皇帝, "emperor") and in many European sources, is referred to as a female emperor rather than an empress regnant. A few decades earlier in Korea, [[Queen Seondeok of Silla]] and [[Jindeok of Silla]] developed the term ''yeowang'' (여왕, "female king") to refer to themselves, using the title instead of ''wangbi'' (왕비), which is usually translated as "queen consort" and refers to the wife of a king or emperor.

Although the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] of [[Japan]] is currently barred to women, this has not always been the case; throughout Japanese history there have been eight empresses regnant. Again, the Japanese language uses the term ''josei tennō'' (女性天皇, "female imperial ruler") for the position which would be "empress regnant" in English, with ''kōgō'' (皇后) being the term reserved for an empress consort.

'''Russians in Lithuania''' numbered 140,000 people, according to the Lithuanian estimates of 2015, or 4.8% of the total population of [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://alkas.lt/2015/12/16/a-butkus-lietuvos-gyventojai-tautybes-poziuriu/&lt;/ref&gt;

First early settlements of [[Ruthenians]] in what is now [[Lithuania]] date back to late medieval ages when the first proto-[[Russians|Russian]] merchants and craftsmen began to permanently reside in several Lithuanian towns. In the late 17th century they were joined by many Russian [[Old Believers]] who settled in eastern Lithuania, escaping religious persecution in [[Russia]].

The second, larger, influx of Russians followed the annexation of Lithuania by the [[Russian Empire]] during the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century. Under Russian rule, power in the region remained primarily in the hands of the [[Lithuanian nobility]], but some administrative jobs were gradually taken over by Russians, who also settled in cities such as [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]]. Also after the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]] in Poland some estates had been confiscated from the local nobility and given to Russian officials. Many of the Russians who migrated to Lithuania were soldiers, sailors, and merchants. 

Most{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} of the present-day Russians in Lithuania are migrants from the Soviet era and their descendants. Following the terms of the 1939 [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]], the [[Soviet Union]] occupied and annexed Lithuania, [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]] in 1940. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the three countries quickly fell under German control. Many Russians, especially Communist party members who had arrived in the area with the initial annexation, retreated to Russia; those who fell into German hands were treated harshly, many were murdered.  

As the war drew to a close, the Soviet Union resumed its occupation of the Baltic states in 1944–1945. Western democracies did not recognize the [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|Soviet occupation]].

Immediately after the war, [[Joseph Stalin]] carried out a major [[Population transfer|resettlement]] campaign in the three Baltic Soviet republics. The Russians, along with a smaller number of other Soviet ethnic groups, who migrated to the Baltic were mostly factory workers who settled in major urban areas, as well as military personnel stationed in the region in significant numbers due to the border location of the Baltic States within the Soviet Union. Many{{specify|date=December 2012}} military retirees chose to stay in the region, which featured higher living standards compared to most of Russia. 

After Stalin's death in 1953, the government of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], led by the "communist nationalist" [[Antanas Sniečkus]], objected to the resettlement policies and managed to slow down the influx of Russians by letting Lithuanians fill some of the higher party positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The flow of immigrants did not stop entirely, and there were further waves of Russian workers who came to work on major construction projects, such as power plants. 

At the last Soviet census in 1989, 9.4 percent of Lithuania's population were ethnic Russians, with a few more percent comprising other Soviet nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172519/http://db1.stat.gov.lt/statbank/default.asp?w=1920&lt;/ref&gt; 

Russians who reside in Lithuania live mainly in urban areas. In Vilnius they make up 13% of the population, and 28% in [[Klaipėda]]. Kaunas has just 4.4% ethnic Russians. The town of [[Visaginas]] was built for workers at the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] and therefore has an ethnic Russian majority (56%).

{{Expand German|''Stammtisch''|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Stammtisch.jpg|thumb|A typical sign for the ''Stammtisch'' is a special ashtray]]
[[File:2013 Stammtisch sign Munich pub.jpg|thumb|An enamel ''Stammtisch'' sign in a bar in [[Munich]]]]
[[File:Stammtisch Duisburg 20140816.jpg|thumb|The pennant of a usual Wikipedia ''Stammtisch'' (at [[:de:Wikipedia:Duisburg|Duisburg]])]]

A '''{{lang|de|Stammtisch}}''' (German for "regulars' table",&lt;ref&gt;Grimms Wörterbuch, stammtisch bis stammverschiedenheit (Bd. 17, Sp. 671 bis 672)&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈʃtamtɪʃ|}}) is an informal group [[meeting]] held on a regular basis, and also the usually large, often [[round table]] around which the group meets. A ''Stammtisch'' is not a structured meeting, but rather a friendly get-together.

Traditionally, the meeting table is marked with a somewhat elaborate sign reserving it for regulars. Historically, a ''Stammtisch'' was an all-male affair that might involve [[socialising]], card playing (such as [[Skat (card game)|skat]]), and often political or philosophical discussions. The words ''Stammtischpolitik'' (''Stammtisch'' politics) and ''Stammtischniveau'' (''Stammtisch'' level) describe the simplified nature of ''Stammtisch'' discussions, and have an established [[metaphor|metaphorical]] usage in describing simplified political and social discussions beyond the ''Stammtisch'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anke Rohde: "All too often woman-specific (medical) complaints are appreciated on a Stammtisch-level" („Viel zu oft werden frauenspezifische Beschwerden noch auf ''Stammtisch''niveau wahrgenommen“). In: Anja Maria Engelsing: ''Homöopathie ganz weiblich: Die sanfte Methode für umfassendes Wohlbefinden'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Past===
Especially in rural areas and smaller villages, being part of the ''Stammtisch'' was often related to a certain [[social status]]. In the second half of the 19th century a ''Stammtisch'' typically consisted of local dignitaries such as the [[mayor]], doctor, [[pharmacist]], [[teacher]], [[forester]] or wealthy farmers. Inviting a stranger to take a seat at the ''Stammtisch'' was a sign of extraordinary appreciation. This was similarly the case with types of regulars’ tables in cafes consisting of writers and artists.

This culture is still to be found in the [[Iberia]]n area ( [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Latin American literature|Latin America]] and [[Brazil]]) in the form of ''[[Tertulia]]s''. In Great Britain and Ireland many pubs fulfilled this function by offering separate back rooms (in case there was no doorkeeper). In the United States a group of regulars (such as in the T.V. series ''[[Cheers]]'') would be a close equivalent.

===Today's meaning===
Today a ''Stammtisch'' is not connected to a specific [[social status]]. It is now all about [[community]], intimacy and [[common interests]].

==Socio-cultural aspects==
===In the countryside===
Here the ''Stammtisch'' is still one of the main places for social interaction. Especially the lack of varied [[leisure time]] facilities and local media leads to the ''Stammtisch'' being an important center to socialise: Local relationships are being managed and news exchanged. A ''Stammtisch'' does not just take place in the evenings but also after the [[Sunday Mass]], called "[[Frühschoppen]]" (English: "Morning [[Half-Pint]]"). Sometimes a ''Stammtisch'' is the organizer of local events such as fairs.

===In the city===
In urban areas especially in the late 90s different kinds of ''Stammtisch'' groups have been established acting like a loose, informal club of people sharing similar interests on a specific topic. They are meant for socialising, exchange of experience and networking (e.g. ''Stammtisch'' for parents). [[Social network|Networking]] organisations such as [[clubs for marketers]] or entrepreneurs often call their regular events, which are also open to non members, a ''Stammtisch''.

===Historical examples===
* E. T. A. Hoffmanns literary ''Stammtisch'' in ''[[Lutter und Wegner]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Lutter &amp; Wegner]]&lt;/ref&gt; (a famous restaurant which still exists today, in [[Berlin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Velhagen &amp; Klasings Monatshefte - Volume 23, Issue 2 - Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spreegöttin mit Berliner Bär: Historische Miniaturen - Page 175&lt;/ref&gt;
* Die Brille, a ''Stammtisch'' of artists and young actors from the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin, which led to the founding of the cabaret „[[Schall und Rauch]]“&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Schall und Rauch]]&lt;/ref&gt; under the guidance of [[Max Reinhardt]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Narren, Henker, Komödianten: Geschichte und Funktion des ... - Page 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das Kabarett, der Spiegel des politischen Geschehens - Page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das literarische Berlin im 20. Jahrhundert: - Page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stammtisch'' in literature===
* ''The butterfly'', [[Wilhelm Busch]]
* ''Stammtisch'': my life and times'', Ernest Müller

===''Stammtisch'' in German TV===
* ARD broadcast with host [[Werner Höfer]] and five international journalists as his guests. A waitress would serve drinks to the group.
* Bayerische Fernsehen broadcasts a Sunday-''Stammtisch'' since 2007

===''Stammtisch'' in English===
Although not used popularly, the word itself is an idiomatic expression which does not have an English equivalent. The nearest would be 'group of regulars'. Thus the word has already two established plural versions in English:

* ''Stammtisches''. Here from a [[Munich]] guide book: "The ''Stammtisch''es are often filled with high ranking political figures..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beer Drinker's Guide to Munich|last=Hawthorne|first=Larry|publisher=Freizeit Publishers|year=2008|isbn=978-0962855535|edition=6th|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Stammtische''. Here from [[Max Lerner]]'s book ''Ideas are Weapons''(1936): "Such surely must have been the talk at the Munich ''Stammtisch''e where habitues of all descriptions gathered over their beer and quarreled about the diverse roads to a commonly held Germanic mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideas are Weapons: The History of Uses and Ideas|last=Lerner|first=Max|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0887383649|location=|pages=358|orig-year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “'''ReGeneration'''” refers to people of all ages who share a common interest in renewable resources, recycling and other means of sustaining the earth’s natural environment. In contrast to previous age-specific generations, like the ‘Me Generation, [[Generation X]] or [[Generation Y]], this new generation comprises globally connected and like-minded individuals using technology to harness their collective beliefs – regardless of age or geographic location.".{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Social networking Web sites are enabling members of the “ReGeneration” to interact and share ideas with others based on common interests like conservation and alternative energy.

While not specifically defined, the prefix ‘Re’ in “ReGeneration” could be interpreted to include widespread environmental practices such as reusing, [[recycling]] and restoring.

==History==

The modern environmental movement gained traction in the early 1970s following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], the first time multiple nations joined together to discuss the state of the world’s environment

The concept of a generation that includes people of all ages who share a common interest in the environment was first introduced by [[Dell]] Chairman and CEO Michael Dell on [[World Environment Day]] 2007.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Background==
The ''Treasury of Lives'' is an online biographical encyclopedia that was established in 2007 with the mission of providing open access to the lived history of Tibet and surrounding regions. Biographies are intended for a wide audience of scholars, independent researchers and practitioners. Essays cover a wide range of figures, from Buddhist masters to artists and political officials, most of which are peer reviewed. Website localization into Tibetan and Chinese languages in is progress in order to meet the growing numbers of users active in those languages. 

The Treasury of Lives is a collaborative resource with over 100 contributing authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treasuryoflives.org/about/authors|title=The Treasury of Lives: A Biographical Encyclopedia of Tibet, Inner Asia and the Himalayan Region|website=The Treasury of Lives|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury has published over 1100 biographies. Many essays are peer-reviewed and benefit from extensive internal and external links to associated art, maps, place descriptions, family and clan information, and timelines. 

The Treasury of Lives was originally known as The Tibetan Lineages Project, lead by Moke Mokotoff, [[Matthieu Ricard]] and [[Vivian Kurz]]. Alexander Gardner, Ph.D., serves as the Executive Director and Editor in Chief. The Treasury of Lives is also closely linked with [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|Buddhist Digital Resource Center]] (BDRC, formerly known as TBRC). The late [[E. Gene Smith]] and Jeff Wallman of the BDRC were instrumental in defining the vision of the site and in forging the plan for its development; and its database is closely linked to BDRC.&lt;ref name="About the Rubin Treasury of Lives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasuryoflives.org/about |title=About the Rubin Treasury of Lives | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date= |website=The Treasury of Lives|publisher=The Shelley &amp;amp; Donald Rubin Foundation|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdrubin.org/projects/Treasury |title=Projects: Treasury of Lives |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=The Shelley &amp;amp; Donald Rubin Foundation |publisher=The Shelley &amp; Donald Rubin Foundation |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.tbrc.org/treasury-of-lives/ |title=Treasury of Lives |last1=Wallman  |first1=Jeff  |date=June 8, 2010 |website=[[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] |publisher=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was initially funded and incubated by the Shelley &amp; Donald Rubin Foundation. It became an independent non-profit organization in 2017.

'''Visual Privacy''' is the relationship between collection and dissemination of visual information, the public [[expectation of privacy]], and the legal issues surrounding them.  In particular, large-scale camera networks have created increasing interest in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of such deployments.  It is estimated that over 4 Million Cameras Deployed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;McCahill, M. and Norris, C. 2004, From cameras to control rooms: the mediation of the image by cctv operatives, CCTV  and Social Control: The politics and practice of video surveillance-European and global perspectives, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to increasing security concerns, camera networks have continued to proliferate across other countries such as the United States.  While the impact of such systems continues to be evaluated, in parallel, tools for controlling how these camera networks are used and modifications to the images or video sent to end-users have been explored.

==Technologies==

To combat surveillance, a number of different technologies have been suggested.

===Forms of Visual Data===
Visual Privacy is often typically applied to particular technologies including
* [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTVs)
* [[Visual sensor network]] (Also referred to as Camera Networks)
* [[Camera phone]]

===Systems===
Many different forms of technologies are explored to preserve privacy while providing information collected from camera networks:
* [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jschiff/RespectfulCameras/index.html Respectful Cameras] is a solution that automatically obscures the faces of observed people in video by overlaying a colored dot over the face of the individual.  This technology tracks colored markers, worn by individuals, and then infers the location of a face by an offset from the marker.&lt;ref&gt;Respectful Cameras: Detecting Visual Markers in Real-Time to Address Privacy Concerns.

'''Working Artists and the Greater Economy''' ('''W.A.G.E.''') is a New York-based activist group and [[non-profit organization]] whose stated advocacy mission is "to establish sustainable economic relationships between artists and the institutions that contract our labor, and to introduce mechanisms for self-regulation into the art field that collectively bring about a more equitable distribution of its economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.A.G.E. Mission|url=https://wageforwork.com/about#top}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

W.A.G.E. was founded in 2008 with the writing of the wo/manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.A.G.E. wo/manifesto|url=https://wageforwork.com/about/womanifesto#top}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of artists, performers, and independent curators in New York City. The group, which has included [[A.K. Burns]], [[K8 Hardy]], Lise Soskolne, and [[A.L. Steiner]], grew out of a series of informal gatherings that evolved into a series of public meetings centering on issues of art and labor.

Early activity focused on education and consciousness raising about economic inequity in the form of videos, open teach-ins, workshops, panel discussions and symposia at museums, galleries, conferences, festivals, schools, summits, and art fairs.

In 2010, W.A.G.E. narrowed its platform to focus on the regulated payment of artist fees by nonprofit arts organizations and museums. They also initiated the 2010 W.A.G.E. Artist Survey to gather data about the payment practices of New York City nonprofits.

In Fall 2010, [[New Museum]] curator, [[Lauren Cornell]], invited W.A.G.E. to participate in the 2010-2011 group exhibition, 'Free'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An evening with W.A.G.E. (Working Artists and the Greater Economy)|url=http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/1095|website=New Museum Digital Archive|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; W.A.G.E., identifying not as an art-making collective, but rather as an activist group, opted to participate by negotiating artist fees on behalf of everyone in the exhibition, marking the event as "the first experimental platform for W.A.G.E. Certification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O’Neill-Butler|first1=Lauren|title=W.A.G.E.|url=http://www.artforum.com/words/id=29628|website=Art Forum|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, W.A.G.E. received its 501c3 non-profit status and narrowed its focus to W.A.G.E. Certification, a voluntary certification program that publicly recognizes nonprofit institutions paying artist fees meeting a minimum payment standard.

In March 2011, W.A.G.E. formed a temporary research partnership with [[Artists Space]]. This partnership served as a cooperative platform for hosting series of public programs and developing W.A.G.E. Certification. The first in the series, "Feeling the Shape of the Arts Economy", took place at Artists Space on January 9, 2012, and was led by sociologist and economist Hans Abbing, author of ''Why Are Artists Poor: The Exceptional Economy of the Arts''.&lt;ref name="revolt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cercone|first1=Katie|title=Biting the Hand that Feeds You: Artists Working for a Greater Arts Economy|url=http://revoltmagazine.org/Issue_02/Articles/BITTING_THE_HAND_article.htm|website=Revolt Magazine|accessdate=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=John|last2=Powhida|first2=William|title=Artists Respond to W.A.G.E. Open Forum with Hans Abbing|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/24/artists-respond/|website=Rhizome|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symposia included,  "Marion von Osten: Be Creative! With responses from Andrew Ross" on November 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marion von Osten: Be Creative! With responses from Andrew Ross|url=http://artistsspace.org/programs/marion-von-osten-be-creative|website=artistsspace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists Space also granted W.A.G.E. access to their financial history, thus facilitating the organization's first case study of artist fee payment practices.

In 2012, the results of the W.A.G.E. Artist Survey were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.A.G.E. Survey Report Summary|url=https://wageforwork.com/work/2010-w-a-g-e-survey#top}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
W.A.G.E. Certification was developed into a policy and regulatory tool in January 2014 at the 2014 W.A.G.E. Summit and was launched in October. Summit participants included: A.K. Burns, Howie Chen, [[Andrea Fraser]], Alison Gerber, Stephanie Luce, [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)]], Lise Soskolne, Marina Vishmidt, and staff members of [[Artists Space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.A.G.E. Certification Sets Standards for Compensation of Artistic Labor|url=http://artforum.com/news/id=48631|website=Art Forum|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit also marked the conclusion of W.A.G.E.'s Research Partnership with Artists Space.

==W.A.G.E. Artist Survey==
The purpose of the W.A.G.E. Survey was to gather data about the economic experiences of artists exhibiting in non-profit exhibition spaces in New York City between 2005 and 2010. Launched on September 22, 2010, the survey  remained open until May 1, 2011. It collected responses anonymously about forms of payment, compensation or reimbursement received by an artist for their participation in an exhibition, including information about installation expenses, shipping/transportation costs for works, material expenses, and travel expenses, among other things. The results of the survey, released in 2012, found that 58 percent of the 577 survey respondents who exhibited with small, medium, and large non-profit arts institutions in New York’s five boroughs between 2005 and 2010 did not receive any form of payment, compensation, or reimbursement––including the coverage of any expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chayka|first1=Kyle|title=Advocacy Group W.A.G.E. on What Its First Survey Tells Us About How Artists Are Treated in NYC|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/801870/advocacy-group-wage-on-what-its-first-survey-tells-us-about-how-artists-are-treated-in-nyc|website=blouinartinfo.com|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powhida|first1=William|title=Why Are (Most) Artists (So Fucking) Poor?|url=http://hyperallergic.com/50333/why-are-most-artists-so-fucking-poor-william-powhida-wage/|website=hyperallergic.com|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clements|first1=Alexis|title=New Data Reveals Artists Aren’t Gettin’ Paid|url=http://hyperallergic.com/50226/new-data-reveals-artists-arent-gettin-paid/|website=hyperallergic.com|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==W.A.G.E. Certification==

W.A.G.E. Certification is a voluntary program that publicly recognizes non-profit arts organizations demonstrating a commitment to ethical payment practices with the artists they contract.  W.A.G.E. Certification mandates that artists be compensated for the content they provide for the programs of arts institutions, and that this compensation must meet a minimum payment standards, as defined by the W.A.G.E. Fee Calculator.&lt;ref name="revolt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Christopher|title=Paying Artists, from MoMA to Momenta Art|url=http://www.in-terms-of.com/paying-artists-from-moma-to-momenta-art/|website=in terms of|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative is closely modeled after the [[Canadian Artists’ Representation]]/Le Front des artistes Canadiens (CARFAC) Minimum Fee Schedule, and advocates for many of the same bottom-up tactics for shifting the relations between artists and institutions. However, unlike CARFAC, which has support from the Canadian government through the provision of the Exhibition Right in the Copyright Act, W.A.G.E.’s model has no state supported mandate, and currently relies on organizations opting in or on large groups of artists opting out of working with arts organizations that aren't W.A.G.E. certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clements|first1=Alexis|title=How Are Artists Getting Paid?|url=http://hyperallergic.com/75549/how-are-artists-getting-paid/|website=hyperallergic.com|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions &amp; Requirements===
W.A.G.E. Certification advocates for hyper definition and clarity, and has set definitions and requirements for the following: artist, non-profit arts organization, artist fee, basic programming costs and services, production costs, fee categories, and fee calculation.

====Artist====
Artist refers to "all those who supply content and services in a non-profit visual arts presenting context."&lt;ref name=cue&gt;{{cite web|title=WAGE: How Creative Labor Should be Compensated|url=http://cueartfoundation.org/critical-distance/video-wage-how-creative-labor-should-be-compensated|website=CUE Art Foundation|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No distinction is made between individual and collective/collaborative providers. W.A.G.E. does distinguish between the "contracted artist" and a "sub-contracted artist".&lt;ref name=def&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vartanian|first1=Hrag|title=How Much Will Artists Be Paid Under the New W.A.G.E. Certification Program?|url=http://hyperallergic.com/155160/how-much-will-artists-be-paid-under-the-new-w-a-g-e-certification-program/|website=hyperallergic.com|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-Profit Arts Organization====
Non-profit arts organization refers to a "501(c)3 tax exempt arts organization or institution that produces programs and exhibitions for a viewing public in a visual arts presenting context".&lt;ref name=cue /&gt; Participating institutions could include 501(c)3 museums, advocacy organizations, professional societies, mid-size institutions, private foundations, artist-run initiatives, project spaces, independent websites, and publications.

====Artist Fee====
W.A.G.E. defines artistic labor as no different from other forms of subcontracted labor, and designates artist fees as compensation for content and services that are "distinct and separate from basic programming costs and services, production expenses, or the purchase of art works".&lt;ref name=cue /&gt; In addition, the payment of artist fees does not imply the transfer of rights; must meet the minimum standard as determined by the W.A.G.E. fee calculator; and must be listed as its own distinct visible line item in an organization's exhibition and operating budgets.&lt;ref name=def /&gt;

====Fee Categories====
W.A.G.E. has identified fourteen categories of commonly supplied content or services: 1) Solo Exhibition, 2) Solo Project, 3)  Two-Person Exhibition, 4) Group Exhibition, 3-5 Artists, 5) Group Exhibition, 6+ Artists, 6) Performance of Existing Work, 7) Performance, Commission of New Work, 8) Solo Screening with In-Person Appearance, 9) Event with 2 or More Participants, 10) Artist Talk or Reading, 11) Lecture, 12) Existing Text for Publication, 13) Commissioned Text for Publication, 14) Day Rate for Performers.&lt;ref name=cue /&gt;&lt;ref name=def /&gt;

====Fee Calculation====
W.A.G.E. Certification's fee calculator is a model used to determine fair compensation for the fourteen fee categories.  Fees are based on an organization’s total annual operating expenses (TAOE) and are broken down into three tiers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wikström|first1=Josefine|title=In and Out of Art and Work: On the W.A.G.E. Certificate|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/and-out-art-and-work-w..g.e.-certificate|website=metamute.org|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Floor W.A.G.E.''' - used to determine a minimum wage for organizations with TAOE below $500,000.
* '''Minimum W.A.G.E.''' - used to determine a rate for organizations with TAOE above $500,000. 
* '''Maximum W.A.G.E.''' - used to determine a specified maximum rate, or cap, for organizations with TAOE over $15,000,000.

===Certified Organizations===
* '''[[Artists Space]]''', New York, NY
* '''Art League Houston''', Houston, TX
* '''FD13''', St Paul, MN
* '''[[ISSUE Project Room]]''', New York, NY
* '''The Artist's Institute''', New York, NY
