{{Wiktionary|bel paese}}
'''''Bel paese''''' (or '''''Belpaese''''', {{IPA-it|ˌbɛl paˈeːze; -eːse|IPA}}) is the classical poetical appellative for [[Italy]], meaning the "beautiful country" in [[Italian language|Italian]], due to its mild weather, cultural heritage and natural endowment.

The usage of the term originated in the [[Middle Ages]], being used by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]]:

{{quote
| text = del '''bel paese''' là dove 'l sì suona,
| sign = [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]
| source = ''[[Divine Comedy]]'': [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], [[:s:it:Divina Commedia/Inferno/Canto XXXIII|canto XXXIII, line 80]]
}}

{{quote
| text = Of the fair land there where the 'Sì' doth sound,
| sign = [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]
| source = ''[[Divine Comedy]]'': [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], [[:s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXXIII|translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]
}}

{{quote
| text = &lt;poem&gt;il '''bel paese'''
ch'Appennin parte e 'l mar circonda e l'Alpe&lt;/poem&gt;
| sign = [[Petrarch]]
| source = ''[[Canzoniere]]'', [[:s:it:Canzoniere (Rerum vulgarium fragmenta)/O d'ardente vertute ornata et calda|CXLVI, lines 13-14]]
}}

{{quote
| text = &lt;poem&gt;that fair country
the Apennines divide, and Alps and sea surround&lt;/poem&gt;
| sign = [[Petrarch]]
| source = ''[[Canzoniere]]'', [http://petrarch.petersadlon.com/canzoniere.html?poem=146, translation by A.S. Kline]
}}

The term is currently widely used in modern Italian as in other languages as a synonym for Italy, but can sometimes be intended slightly [[irony|ironically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CE855BighvAC&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;ots=-4wCus6nzs&amp;dq=Italy%3A%20Farewell%20to%20the%20'Bel%20Paese&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Italy: Farewell to the 'Bel Paese'? |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as a term of endearment by members of the [[Italian diaspora]], and it is often used to endorse or promote goods&lt;ref&gt;[[Bel Paese (cheese)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=&amp;quot;bel+paese&amp;quot;+restaurant | title=Google results for '"Bel Paese" restaurant' |accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in Italy and abroad.

'''Bobr''' (also given as '''Bobr East''') was an air base in [[Belarus]] located 20&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Talacyn]].  It appears to have been a forward deployment field.  It is now plowed under into farmland.  A new major highway connecting [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]] is just 1&amp;nbsp;km north of the former site.

The '''British Australian (and) New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition''' ('''BANZARE''') was a research expedition into [[Antarctica]] between 1929 and 1931, involving two voyages over consecutive Austral summers. It was a British Commonwealth initiative, driven more by geopolitics than science, and funded by the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and New Zealand.

[[File:Cape Bruce proclamation.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas Mawson's team claim Mac. Robertson Land for the Crown during the BANZARE expedition]]
The leader of the BANZARE was Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] and there were several subcommanders (Captain K.N. MacKenzie, who replaced Captain [[John King Davis]] for the second summer) on board the [[RRS Discovery]], the ship previously used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]. The BANZARE, which also made several short flights in a small plane, mapped the coastline of [[Antarctica]] and discovered [[Mac. Robertson Land]] and [[Princess Elizabeth Land]] (which later was [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|claimed]] as part of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]).

The voyages primarily comprised an "acquisitive exploratory expedition",&lt;ref&gt;Collis, 2004:4&lt;/ref&gt; with Mawson making proclamations of British sovereignty over Antarctic lands at each of their five landfalls—on the understanding that the territory would later be handed to Australia (as it was in 1933). One such proclamation was made on 5 January 1931 at [[Cape Denison]], the site which Mawson's [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] had occupied in 1912–13. A hand-written copy of the proclamation was left at the site, enclosed in a container made of food tins and buried beneath a cairn. The letter was retrieved in 1977 by an Australian Antarctic expedition, and is part of the Mawson collection at the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/results?search=adv&amp;ref=coll&amp;collname=Sir+Douglas+Mawson+collection|title=Sir Douglas Mawson collection|publisher=National Museum of Australia|accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BANZARE was also a scientific quest, producing 13 volumes of reports, on geology, oceanography, meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, zoology and botany, between 1937 and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Falla]] was the assistant zoologist.

'''''Drazki'' (Дръзки – Daring)''' is a {{sclass-|Wielingen|frigate}} of the [[Bulgarian Navy]]. Originally constructed for the [[Belgian Navy]] as '''''Wandelaar''''', the ship was acquired by the Bulgarian Navy in 2004. The frigate is currently in active service.

==Construction and career==
''Wandelaar'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 June 1977 at the Boelwerf in [[Temse]]. The frigate was later [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 October 1978 with the [[pennant number]] F912. ''Wandelaar'' was the third ship in the ''Wielingen'' class. .

She was sold to the Bulgarian Navy in 2004. ''Wandelaar'' was  refurbished and commissioned as ''Drazki'' and with the pennant number 41.  In 2008 two other [[sister ship]]s, {{ship|Belgian frigate|Wielingen|F910|2}} and {{ship|Belgian frigate|Westdiep|F911|2}}, were sold to Bulgaria.

The '''Emblem of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]''' was first used from 1946 until the end of communist rule in 1990. Following the communist coup d’etat was held against the government of King Simeon on 9 September 1944, the insurgents used royal flags defaced by cutting out the crown and the royal cyphers. Around the arms was a garland of branches of oak and olive. On 15 September 1946, the Peoples’ Republic was proclaimed. On 6 December 1947 an emblem patterned after the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]] was adopted that consisted of a [[red star|red five-pointed star]] with eight ears of wheat or tied with a ribbon Gules inscribed with the motto: '''9 IX 1944'''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.5.%20Gerbove%20na%20narodnata%20republika.htm |first=Ivan |last=Voynikov |title=History of the Bulgarian State Symbols |chapter=Chapter V|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1948, the ribbon was changed to the colors of the [[flag of Bulgaria]]. However in 1967, the design of the emblem has changed slightly from the previous version with the white wheat replacing the gold. The most recent version of the emblem was used from 1971 with the emblem indicated the year 681, the year of the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]] was added next to 1944.

New [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] adopted in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.6.%20Epopeyata%20okolo%20noviya%20gerb.htm |first=Ivan |last=Voynikov |title=History of the Bulgarian State Symbols |chapter=Chapter VI|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Flag]] of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]''' was a modified British [[Blue Ensign]].  Centred in the fly of the flag was a depiction of the shield from the Federation's [[Coat of Arms]].  The rising sun is taken from the [[Coat of arms of Nyasaland|Arms of Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]), the lion rampant is taken from the [[Arms of Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), and the black and white wavy lines is taken from the [[Coat of arms of Northern Rhodesia|Arms of Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]).  In this form, it shows the Federation of all three British Colonies which lasted from 1953 to 31 December 1963.  This flag flew alongside the [[Union Jack]] for the duration of the existence of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/frn.html Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 net official '''foreign aid to Eritrea''' was US$135.8 million; in 2002 it reached US$217.6 million. The government of [[Eritrea]] prefers private-sector investment to official aid programs, and its relations with aid-dispensing nations and international institutions have often been difficult.

Eritrea now rejects foreign aid and aspires to be a self-reliant nation, viewing aid as a way to cripple a society.

'''Saint Fragan''' was a [[5th-century]] [[Pre-Congregational Saint]] and [[Prince]] of [[Scotland]].
He is celebrated on 3 October in the Calendar of the Breton Saints,&lt;ref name="grandterrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandterrier.net/wiki/index.php?title=Mod%C3%A8le:Almanak_Octobre|title=Modèle:Almanak octobre|website=GrandTerrier|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares with Gwen a [[Feast day]] on July 5 in the Roman Calendar.

Fragan came from Great Britain, and was a Prince of Albany in Scotland. In the 5th century he left Scotland to evangelize [[Armorica]].

==Family==
He was the [[husband]] of [[Gwen Teirbron|Saint Gwenn]] and father of the [[twin]] [[saint]]s [[Jacut]]&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baring3 /&gt; and [[Saint Wethenoc|Guethenoc]],&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baring3 /&gt; of [[Guénolé]], and of [[Saint]] [[Creirwy]], [[Winwaloe]],&lt;ref&gt;William Hone, The every-day book and table-book; or, Everlasting calendar of popular amusements (William Hone,  1837) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yxH3Vm9FcsYC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=st+Fragan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P4JxrnFNtA&amp;sig=oX_139i-yp62ixC5yPXWmiunTZg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd6erizejWAhWCzbwKHabHCCMQ6AEIWDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20Fragan&amp;f=false  p281].&lt;/ref&gt; son of Prince Fragan (or Fracan) and Teirbron.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, Alban.

J. Clark, 1908).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He left [[Great Britain|Britain]] and moved to [[Ploufragan]] ([[Côtes-d'Armor]]) towards the end of the [[4th century]] or perhaps as late as 418 [[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancien nom parfois attribué au vent, en particulier au [[mistral (vent)|mistral]], mais ici au vent de [[noroît (vent)|noroît]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moine Clément, ''Vie de saint Gwennolé confesseur'', dite ''Vie brève'', vers 860&lt;/ref&gt; There he settled in the [[Sang River]] valley. He was the founder of the castle of Lesguen, in the present commune of [[Plouguin]].&lt;ref name="infobretagne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobretagne.com/saint-fregant.htm|website=infobretagne.com|title=Saint-Frégant : Histoire, Patrimoine, Noblesse (commune du canton de Lesneven)|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infobretagne2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobretagne.com/plounevez-prieure-lochrist.htm|title=Prieuré de Lochrist-an-Izelvet (ou Izelvez) en Plounévez-Lochrist (Finistère - Bretagne)|website=infobretagne.com|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fragan is also known for having amassed a small army in haste to repel  a larger force of pagan pirates at the [[battle of Lochrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Le Grand, La vie, gestes, mort et miracles des Saints de la Bretagne Armorique, ensemble un catalogue des évêques des neuf eveschés d'icelle, 1659,&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ileana Cosânzeana''' is a figure in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian mythology]]. She is represented as a beautiful good-natured princess.&lt;ref name=theatre&gt;[http://greatromaniancharacters.com/ileana.html Ileana Cosanzeana], Petre Ispirescu, Great Romanian Characters, Retrieved 16 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In Romanian folklore, Ileana is the original concept of feminine beauty, the most beautiful amongst the fairies: her eyes look like the sun, her body is like the sea and her garments are made of flowers. Pearls and gold flow out of her mouth when she sings. She is also said to use her power of white magic to heal or revive. Ileana Cosânzeana signifies the most poetic imagination of Romanian genius. She personifies the beauty, the youth, and the angelic soul, in one word the perfection of humanity. She is a mythical character with supernatural powers and with symbolic features. Ileana Cosânzeana succeeds in defeating the evil forces because she is very brave, smart, modest and diligent. In some tales "Ileana Cosânzeana" is the fairy of the Spring flowers, who gives each flower its perfume, although she also has the power to take it back. The elves love her, as do the flowers; even the wind loves Ileana, but he can never catch her. In the myth, she is a beautiful [[princess]] who is kidnapped by the ''[[Zmeu]]'' (a Dragon equivalent), who locks her in his castle and waits for her to give in to his marriage proposal. She is saved by [[Făt-Frumos]], who is analogous to [[Prince Charming]]. Făt-Frumos is tested by many trials as he makes his way to Ileana Cosânzeana. Finally, he fights the ''Zmeu'', beats him, and frees Ileana Cosânzeana. They both live happily ever after.

The designation of '''King-Grand Duke''' was held by the three monarchs of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] that ruled [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]] in [[personal union]], between 1815 and 1890. These monarchs thus held the titles of [[King of the Netherlands]] and [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] concurrently, and, although not strictly a title in its own right, that of 'King-Grand Duke' was used in legislation and official documents in Luxembourg throughout the period.

The three King-Grand Dukes were:

* [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] (15 March 1815 – 7 October 1840)
* [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] (7 October 1840 – 17 March 1849)
* [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] (17 March 1849 – 23 November 1890)

The titles separated in 1890. Under the [[Nassau Family Pact]] of 1783, all 'German' lands, including the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, were to be inherited by [[Salic law]], whereas all non-German lands were unaffected. Thus, when [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] inherited the Dutch crown on the death of her father, William III, she was precluded from inheriting the crown of Luxembourg. Hence, it was inherited by [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]], formerly [[Duke of Nassau]], parting the titles and ending the period of the King-Grand Dukes.

'''''La verdad sospechosa''''' (The Suspicious Truth) is a play by [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whicker |first=Jules |date=2003 |title=The Plays of Juan Ruiz de Alarcón |publisher=Tamesis Books |page=52 |isbn=9781855660939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late sixteenth century, the theater is in a complete confusion of genres, topics and trends. Lope de Vega revolutionizes the scene by establishing a new model in a fabulous attempt to redirect the secular theater to a single formula. These new ideas appear epitomized in his new Art to make comedies (1609). [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón|Juan Ruiz de Alarcon]] is one of the most original followers of Lope, though, it brings an original vision on how to treat the characters. Obsession is thus seen to show that appearances are deceiving and that the conduct is not based on lineage but in the attitude of everyone. It seems that the theater failed in Madrid pens comedies for several reasons among which are his enmity with other playwrights and marked novelty of his theater before an audience not used to give him models of moral behavior. The author had to accommodate the press as saving table to survive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magarciaguerra.com/2012/12/la-verdad-sospechosa-de-juan-ruiz-de-alarcon/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Most Faithful Majesty''' ({{lang-pt|Sua Majestade Fidelíssima}}) was the title used by the [[Portuguese monarch]]s, from 1748 to 1910.

The sobriquet '''Most Faithful King''' ([[Latin]]: ''Rex Fidelissimus'', Portuguese: ''Rei Fidelíssimo'') was a title awarded by the [[Pope Benedict XIV]] – as spiritual head of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] – in 1748, to the King [[John V of Portugal]] and to his heirs. 

The title ''Fidelissimus'' remains attached to monarchs descended from whoever received the original sobriquet. The sobriquet can be awarded to either a king or a queen. The only European monarchy that has received the sobriquet was the now-defunct monarchy of Portugal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">The '''New York Peace Society''' was the first [[peace movement|peace society]] to be established in the [[United States]].  It has had several different incarnations, as it has merged into other organizations or dissolved and then been re-created.

== First incarnation (1815–28) ==
[[David Low Dodge]] founded the society in 1815, soon after the end of the [[War of 1812]].  It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.

In 1828, the society merged with others in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Massachusetts]] to form the [[American Peace Society]].

== Second and third incarnations (1837–44) ==
The society was re-formed as an independent organization in 1837.  Until 1844, it sought to prevent [[Mexican–American War|war against Mexico]] by advocating negotiation.  It then dissolved.  An attempt was made to re-create it, but this was short-lived.

== Fourth incarnation (1906–40) ==
[[Image:The Messenger of the New York Peace Society, 1918.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Messenger of the New York Peace Society'', 1918]]
The society was founded anew for the final time in 1906, in the context of the [[Philippine–American War]], the rapid expansion of American influence and military usage abroad and the rise of the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]].  It was organized by [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] and [[Charles Levermore]] with the support of steel magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]].

The society was involved in a "National Arbitration and Peace Conference" in 1907.  During the First World War, the society helped to organize the [[William Howard Taft|League to Enforce Peace]] in opposition to American involvement.

In 1940, the society merged into the [[Quaker]] [[World Alliance for International Friendship through Religion]].

[[Image:Offer Curve.PNG|thumb|right|An offer curve derived from the PPF to the left]]
In [[economics]] and particularly in international trade, an '''offer curve''' shows the quantity of one type of product that an agent will export ("offer") for each quantity of another type of product that it imports. The offer curve was first derived by [[English people|English]] economists [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]] and [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] to help explain international trade. 

The offer curve is derived from the country's [[Production possibilities frontier|PPF]]. We describe a Country named '''K''' which enjoys both goods '''Y''' and '''X'''. It is slightly better at producing good '''X''', but wants to consume both goods. It wants to consume at point C or higher (above the PPF). Country K starts in [[Autarky]] at point '''C'''. At point '''C''', country K can produce (and consume) 3 Y for 5 X. As trade begins with another country, and country K begins to [[Heckscher-Ohlin model|specialize]] in producing good '''X'''. When it produces at point '''B''', it can trade with the other country and consume at point '''S'''. We now look at our Offer curve and draw a [[Line (mathematics)|ray]] at the level 5 Y for 7 X. When full specialization occurs, K then produces at point '''A''', trades and then consumes at point '''T'''. The price has reduced to 1 Y for 1 X, and the economy is now at equilibrium.

'''Papel''' (Pepel, Papei), or ''Oium'' (''Moium''), is a [[Bak language]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]].

Papel is the language spoken by the Papel People, who live in the central coastal regions of Guinea-Bissau, namely the [[Biombo Region]] where it is spoken by 136,000 Bissau-Guineans. Papel speakers are estimated to be around 140,000 in total globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/pbo/|title=Papel|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papel is part of the Bak language family based in the Senegal/Guinea-Bissau region, thus it is linguistically similar to the Mankanya and Mandjak languages, members of the '[[Papel languages]]' a language sub-family. Today, Papel, along with its linguistic neighbours uses Latin-based script.

{{History of Azawad}}
The '''Pashalik of Timbuktu''' was a West African political entity that existed between the 16th and the 19th century.

==History==
By the end of the 16th century, Moroccan sultans were strengthened after the completion of the reunification of Morocco and the victory over the Portuguese at the [[Battle of the Three Kings]], but their financial needs lead them to extend their realm southward to Saharan gold mines and Songhay territories.&lt;ref&gt;R. Davoine (2003), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1577, a Moroccan expedition occupied [[Taghaza]]. In 1582, a first expedition to [[Timbuktu]] was defeated.

In 1591, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] expeditionary force defeated the [[Songhay Empire|Songhay]] army at [[Battle of Tondibi|Tondibi]] and conquered [[Gao]], [[Timbuktu]] and [[Djenné]]. The Pashalik of Timbuktu was then established and [[Timbuktu]] became its capital.

Starting from 1618, the Pasha, who was then appointed by the Sultan of Morocco, became elected by the [[Armas]].&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Ogot (1992), p.307&lt;/ref&gt; However, while governing the Pashalik as an independent republic, the [[Armas]] continued to recognize Moroccan sultans as their leaders. During the civil war that followed the death of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] in Morocco, the Pashalik supported the legitimate Sultan, [[Zidan al-Nasir]],&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Fage (1975), p.155&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1670 they recognized the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouite sultans]] and pledged allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Ogot (1992), p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the eighteenth century, the pashalik was in total eclipse. In about 1770, the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] took possession of [[Gao]], and in 1787 they entered [[Timbuktu]] and made the Pashalik their tributary.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Fage (1975), p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pilaf''' or '''pilau''' is a dish, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]],&lt;ref name="KTAchaya1994"/&gt; in which [[rice]] is cooked in a seasoned [[broth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1942,149173-247202,00.html "Rice Pilaf"]. Accessed May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the rice may [[Food browning|attain its brown or golden color]] by first being [[Sautéing|sauteed]] lightly in oil before the addition of broth. Cooked onion, garlic cloves, sliced carrot, other vegetables, as well as a mix of [[spice]]s, may be added. Depending on the [[local cuisine]], it may additionally contain [[meat]], [[fish]], [[vegetable]]s, [[Orzo (pasta)|pasta]] ([[orzo]]), or [[dried fruit]]. It is also sometimes called '''rice pilaf'''.

==Etymology==
The English spelling is influenced by the [[Modern Greek]] ''piláfi'', which comes from the Turkish ''pilav'',&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilaf|last=Harper|first=Douglas|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=pilaf|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''polow'', {{lang-hi|pulāo}}, from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''pulāka'' (meaning "a ball of rice"), which in turn, is probably of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2006 [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/pilau ''s.v.'' 'pilau']&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish dish, [[paella]], traditionally a communal meal made from rice and fish, shellfish, rabbit or chicken, cooked in a large pan, has similarities in recipe and methodology, but derives from a [[Valencian]] word, out of the Old French word ''paelle'' for "pan" (Latin: ''patella'').

==History==
The ancient [[Hindu]] text ''[[Mahabharata]]'' from the [[Indian subcontinent]] mentions rice and meat cooked together, and the word "pulao" or "pallao" is used to refer to the dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the ''[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]]''.&lt;ref name="KTAchaya1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[K. T. Achaya]] |title=Indian food: a historical companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cFcH2ZHWLcC |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narain2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Priti Narain |title=The Essential Delhi Cookbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwt7O80fshwC&amp;pg=PT116 |date=14 October 2000 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-93-5118-114-9 |page=116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilaf was known to have been served to [[Alexander the Great]] at a royal banquet following his capture of the [[Sogdia]]n capital of Marakanda (modern [[Samarkand]]).

[[File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2005-701.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Shirin plov'' on an [[Azerbaijan]]i postage stamp.]]
The first known recipe for pilaf is by the tenth-century [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Ibn Sina to be the "father" of modern pilaf.

Pilau became standard fare in the [[Middle East]] and [[Transcaucasia]] over the years with variations and innovations by the Persians, [[Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Armenians]]. It was introduced to [[Israel]] by [[Bukharan Jews|Bukharan]] and [[Persian Jews]].

During the period of the [[Soviet Union]], the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common [[Soviet cuisine]].

==Local varieties==

=== Afghanistan ===
[[File:Afghan Palo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Kabuli palaw]], a national dish of [[Afghan cuisine|Afghanistan]].]]
In [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]] cuisine, ''[[Kabuli palaw]]'' or ''qabili palaw'' (Dari : قابلی پلو ) is made by cooking [[basmati]] with mutton, lamb, beef or chicken, and oil. Kabuli Palaw is cooked in large shallow and thick dishes. Fried sliced [[carrot]]s and [[raisin]]s are added. Chopped nuts like [[pistachio]]s, [[walnut]]s, or [[almond]]s may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. The Kabuli Palaw rice with carrots and raisins is very popular in [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is known as ''roz Bukhari'' (Arabic: رز بخاري), meaning [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]]n rice.

===Armenia===
Armenians use a lot of ''[[bulgur]]'' (cracked wheat) in their pilav dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-280681-9| last = Davidson| first = Alan| title = The Oxford Companion to Food| accessdate = 2018-07-16| date = 2006| url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806819.001.0001/acref-9780192806819}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lapa'' is an Armenian word with several meanings one of which is a "watery boiled rice, thick rice soup, mush" and ''lepe'' which refers to various rice dishes differing by region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn = 978-3-447-03640-5| last = Dankoff| first = Robert| title = Armenian Loanwords in Turkish| date = 1995 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antranig Azhderian]] describes Armenian pilav as "dish resembling porridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Mershon Company| last = Azhderian| first = Antranig| title = The Turk and the Land of Haig; Or, Turkey and Armenia: Descriptive, Historical, and Picturesque| date = 1898 |page=171-172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Azerbaijan ===
Azerbaijani cuisine includes more than 40 different plov recipes.&lt;ref name=kukhnya&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cuisine/azerbaydjanskaya_kuhnya/ ''Азербайджанская кухня''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216024404/http://azeri.ru/az/cuisine/azerbaydjanskaya_kuhnya |date=2009-02-16 }}, (''Azerbaijani Cuisine'', Ishyg Publ. House, Baku {{ru icon}})&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most reputed dishes is plov from saffron-covered rice, served with various herbs and greens, a combination distinctive from Uzbek plovs. Traditional Azerbaijani plov consists of three distinct components, served simultaneously but on separate platters: rice (warm, never hot), ''gara'' (fried meat, dried fruits, eggs, or fish prepared as an accompaniment to rice), and aromatic herbs. Rice is not mixed with the other components even when eating plov.&lt;ref name=mamedov&gt;[http://restaurant.dsnews.ua/art18684.html Interview with Jabar Mamedov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221125707/http://restaurant.dsnews.ua/art18684.html |date=2008-12-21 }}, Head Chef at the "Shirvan Shah" Azerbaijani restaurant in Kiev, 31 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Brazil ===
A significantly modified version of the recipe, often seen as influenced by what is called {{lang|pt|arroz pilau}} there, is known in [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazil]] as {{lang|pt|arroz de frango desfiado}} or incorrectly {{lang|pt|risoto de frango}} ({{IPA-pt|aˈʁoʒ dʒi ˈfɾɐ̃gu dʒisfiˈadu|lang}}, "shredded chicken rice", {{IPA-pt|ʁiˈzotu|}}, "chicken [[risotto]]"). Rice lightly [[Sofrito|fried]] (and optionally seasoned), salted and cooked until soft (but neither soupy nor sticky) in either water or chicken stock is added to chicken stock, onions and sometimes cubed bell peppers (cooked in the stock), shredded chicken breast, green peas, tomato sauce, [[soy sauce|shoyu]], and optionally vegetables (e.g. canned sweet corn, cooked carrot cubes, courgette cubes, [[broccolini]] flowers, chopped broccoli or broccolini stalks/leaves fried in garlic seasoning) and/or herbs (e.g. mint, like in {{lang|pt|[[Canja de galinha|canja]]}}) to form a distantly [[risotto]]-like dish – but it is generally fluffy (depending on the texture of the rice being added), as generally, once all ingredients are mixed, it is not left to cook longer than 5 minutes. In the case shredded chicken breast is not added, with the rice being instead served alongside chicken and {{lang|fr|sauce suprême}}, it is known as {{lang|pt|arroz suprême de frango}} ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈʁo s(ː)uˈpɾẽm(i) dʒi ˈfɾɐ̃gu|lang}}, "chicken [[supreme (cookery)|supreme]] rice").

=== Caribbean ===
In the [[Eastern Caribbean]] and other Caribbean territories there are variations of ''[[pelau]]'' which include a wide range of ingredients such as [[pigeon pea]]s, green peas, string beans, corn, carrots, pumpkin, and meat such as beef or chicken, or cured pig tail.  The seasoned meat is usually cooked in a stew, with the rice and other vegetables added afterwards. Coconut milk and spices are also key additions in some islands.

=== Central Asia ===
[[File:Plov Tashkent.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Public ''plov'' cooking in [[Tashkent]].]]
[[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]], e.g. [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]] and [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]]  ''plov'' ({{lang-tg|палав |italic = palav}}, {{lang-uz|palov}}) or ''[[Osh (food)|osh]]'' differs from other preparations in that rice is not steamed, but instead [[simmer]]ed in a rich [[stew]] of meat and vegetables called ''zirvak'', until all the liquid is absorbed into the rice. A limited degree of steaming is commonly achieved by covering the pot. It is usually cooked in a ''[[Kazan (cookware)|kazan]]'' (or ''deghi'') over an open fire. The cooking tradition includes many regional and occasional variations.&lt;ref name="StreetFood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uzbekplov"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people-travels.com/uzbekistan-photo-gallery/uzbek-cuisine-photos.html| title=Uzbek Cuisine Photos: Pilaf| accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, it is prepared with [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], browned in lamb fat or oil, and then stewed with fried [[onion]]s, [[garlic]] and carrots. [[Chicken (food)|Chicken]] plov is rare but found in traditional recipes originating in [[Bukhara]]. Plov is usually spiced with whole black [[cumin]], [[coriander]], [[Barberry|barberries]], [[Peppercorn|red pepper]], [[Pot marigold|marigold]], and [[Black pepper|pepper]]. Heads of garlic and garbanzo beans are buried into the rice during cooking. Sweet variations with dried [[apricot]]s, [[cranberry|cranberries]] and raisins are prepared on special occasions. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Although often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, plov is made on special occasions by the ''oshpaz'' (osh master chef), who cooks the national dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. ''Oshi nahor'', or "morning plov", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Uzbek-style plov cooking recipes are spread nowadays throughout all post-[[Soviet cuisine|Soviet]] countries and [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of China. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Greece ===
In the [[Greek cuisine]], ''piláfi'' (πιλάφι) is the fluffy and soft, but neither soupy nor sticky, rice that has been boiled in a meat stock or [[Bouillon cube|bouillon broth]]. In Northern Greece, it is considered poor form to prepare ''piláfi'' on a [[stovetop]]; the pot is properly placed in the [[oven]]. ''Gamopílafo'' ("wedding pilaf") is the prized pilaf served traditionally at weddings and major celebrations in [[Crete]]: rice is boiled in lamb or goat broth, then finished with [[lemon]] juice. ''Gamopílafo'' though it bears the name is not a pilaf but rather a kind of [[risotto]], with creamy and not fluffy texture.

=== India ===
[[File:A traditional indian dish of bengal("pulao-mangsha" with misti doi).JPG|thumb|200px|right|''Pulao Mangsho'', with condiments and yogurt, [[West Bengal, India]].]]
Known as ''pulao'', ''polao'', ''pallao'' and ''pulav'' locally, the rice dish has been an integral part of [[Indian cuisine]] since the ancient era. The ''Mahabharata'' mentions rice and meat cooked together, and the word ''pulāka'' is used to refer to the dish in Sanskrit works such as the ''Yājñavalkya Smṛti''.&lt;ref name="KTAchaya1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Narain2000"/&gt; A ''pulao'' is a dish consisting of rice and a mixture of either [[lentil]]s or vegetables, mainly including [[pea]]s, [[potato]]es, [[french bean]]s, carrots or meat, mainly chicken, fish, lamb, pork or prawn. It is usually served on special occasions and weddings, though it is not uncommon to eat it for a regular lunch or dinner meal. It is considered very high in [[food energy]] and [[fat]]. A pulao is often complemented with either spiced yogurt or ''[[raita]]''.

=== Iran ===
[[File:Loobia Polo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lubia polo, rice with green beans in Iran.]]
[[Persian cuisine|Persian]] culinary terms referring to [[rice]] preparation are numerous and have found their way into the neighbouring languages: ''polo'' (rice cooked in broth while the grains remain separate, straining the half cooked rice before adding the broth and then "brewing"), ''chelo'' (white rice with separate grains), ''[[kateh]]'' (sticky rice) and ''tajine'' (slow cooked rice, vegetables, and meat cooked in a specially designed dish also called a [[tajine]]). There are also varieties of different rice dishes with vegetables and herbs which are very popular among Iranians.

There are four primary methods of cooking rice in Iran:
* ''Chelo'': rice that is carefully prepared through soaking and [[parboiling]], at which point the water is drained and the rice is steamed. This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the grains separated and not sticky; it also results in a golden rice crust at the bottom of the pot called ''[[tahdig]]'' (literally "bottom of the pot").
* ''Polo'': rice that is cooked exactly the same as ''chelo'', with the exception that after draining the rice, other ingredients are layered with the rice, and they are then steamed together.
* ''Kateh'': rice that is boiled until the water is absorbed. This is the traditional dish of Northern Iran.
* ''Damy'': cooked almost the same as ''kateh'', except that the heat is reduced just before boiling and a towel is placed between the lid and the pot to prevent steam from escaping. ''Damy'' literally means "simmered".

=== Pakistan ===
[[File:Cholistani Camel Meat Pulao.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Camel meat pulao, Pakistan.]]
In [[Pakistan]], ''Pulao'' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|پلاؤ}}}}) is a popular dish cooked with [[Basmati]] rice and [[meat]] ([[Chicken as food|chicken]] or [[mutton]] or [[beef]]). Pulao is a rice dish, cooked in seasoned broth with rice, meat and spices.  A pulao is often complimented with [[raita]]. The rice is made in mutton or beef or chicken stock and an array of spices including: coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cloves and others. Mutton and beef have, with time, been replaced with chicken due to higher prices of mutton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://images.dawn.com/news/1177603 How mutton pulao survived the chicken takeover in Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sindhi pulao]] ({{lang-sd|سنڌي پُلاءُ}}) in the province of [[Sindh]], prepared with mutton or beef or chicken. It is prepared by [[Sindhi people]] of Pakistan in their marriage ceremonies, condolence meetings, and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reejhsinghani|first1=Aroona|title=Essential Sindhi Cookbook|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780143032014|page=237|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=ym9IWIZELc8C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Sindhi+Pulao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sindhi%20Pulao&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reejhsinghani|first1=Aroona|title=The Sindhi Kitchen|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=1HAYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT175&amp;dq=Sindhi+Pulao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sindhi%20Pulao&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine and Syria===
Traditional Levantine cooking includes a variety of Pilaf known as "Maqlubeh", known across the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The rice pilaf which is traditionally cooked with meats, eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, and cauliflower also has a fish variety known as "Sayyadiyeh", or the Fishermen's Dish. 

===Turkey===
[[File:Pilav.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Typical [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] pilav. Rice with ''arpa şehriye'' ([[Orzo (pasta)|orzo]]).]]
Turkish cuisine contains many different pilav types and is the inspiration behind most of the variations in Armenia, Balkans, Greece, and Arab countries due to their past under Ottoman empire rule. Some of these variations are pirinc (''[[rice]]'') pilav, ''[[bulgur]]'' pilav, and arpa şehriye (''[[orzo]]'') pilav. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as ''[[perdeli pilav]]'', and etli pilav (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilav that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.

'''Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty''' ('''RFE'''/'''RL''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]-[[State media|funded]] organization that broadcasts and reports news, information, and analysis to countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] where it says that "the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFE/RL is a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] corporation supervised by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], an agency overseeing all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] [[international broadcasting]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov|title=BBG|website=BBG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], ''Radio Free Europe'' (RFE) was broadcast to Soviet [[satellite state|satellite countries]] and ''Radio Liberty'' (RL) targeted the [[Soviet Union]]. RFE was founded as an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] propaganda source in 1949 by the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]]. RL was founded two years later and the two organizations merged in 1976.  Communist governments frequently sent agents to infiltrate RFE's headquarters, and the [[KGB]] regularly [[radio jamming|jammed its signals]]. RFE/RL received funds covertly from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'' (Ivan R. Dee, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; During RFE's earliest years of existence, the CIA and [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] issued broad policy directives, and a system evolved where broadcast policy was determined through negotiation between them and RFE staff.&lt;ref name="Mickelson 1983 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFE/RL was headquartered at [[Englischer Garten]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], from 1949 to 1995. In 1995 the headquarters were moved to [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. European operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 17 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, as well as a corporate office in [[Washington, D.C.]] RFE/RL broadcasts in 25 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pressroom.rferl.org/p/6087.html|title=RFE/RL Language Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 23 countries&lt;ref name="flashvideo.rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm|title=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty :: Coverage Map|website=flashvideo.rferl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Armenia]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="flashvideo.rferl.org"/&gt;

==Early history==

=== Radio Free Europe ===
''Radio Free Europe'' was created and grew in its early years through the efforts of the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]] (NCFE), an anti-communist CIA [[front organization]] that was formed by [[Allen Dulles]] in [[New York City]] in 1949. The committee was composed of an "''A'' list" of powerful U.S. citizens including former ambassador and first NCFE chairman [[Joseph Grew]]; ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' owner [[DeWitt Wallace]]; former diplomat and the co-founder of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' Dewitt Clinton Poole; and prominent New York [[investment banker]] [[Frank Altschul]].&lt;ref name="Puddington 2003 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Tim: "Legacy of Ashes", p. 36.

''Radio Free Europe'' received widespread public support from Eisenhower's "[[Crusade for Freedom]]" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, over 16 million Americans signed Eisenhower's "Freedom Scrolls" on a publicity trip to over 20 U.S. cities and contributed $1,317,000 to the expansion of RFE.&lt;ref name="Cummings|2008|p=169"&gt;{{harvnb|Cummings|2008|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCFE's mission was to support the refugees and provide them with a useful outlet for their opinions and creativity while increasing exposure to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCFE divided its program into three parts: [[exile]] relations, [[radio]], and American contacts.&lt;ref name="Puddington 2003 12"/&gt; Although exile relations were initially its first priority, Radio Free Europe (RFE) became the NCFE's greatest legacy.

The United States funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; American policymakers such as [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] and [[John Foster Dulles]] acknowledged that the [[Cold War]] was essentially a [[war of ideas]]. The implementation of surrogate radio stations was a key part of the greater psychological war effort.&lt;ref name="Cummings|2008|p=169"/&gt;

RFE was modeled after [[Radio in the American Sector]] (RIAS) a U.S. government-sponsored radio service initially intended for Germans living in the [[West Berlin|American sector]] of Berlin (but more widely listened to in East Germany).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staffed almost entirely by Germans with minimal U.S. supervision, the station provided free media to German listeners.

[[File:RFE RL building construction.jpg|thumb|250px|Building of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Prague-Hagibor, 2008]]

In January 1950 the NCFE obtained a transmitter base at [[Lampertheim]], West Germany and on July 4 of the same year RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a "mouthpiece for exiles".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams of journalists were hired for each language service and an elaborate system of [[intelligence gathering]] provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected [[émigré]]s and interviews with travelers and defectors. RFE did not use paid agents inside the [[Iron Curtain]] and based its bureaus in regions popular with exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFE also extensively monitored [[Warsaw Pact|Communist bloc]] publications and radio services, creating an impressive body of information that would later serve as a resource for organizations across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its regular broadcasts, RFE spread broadcasts through a series of operations that distributed [[airborne leaflet propaganda|leaflets]] via [[meteorological balloon]]s; one such operation, Prospero, sent messages to [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_using_balloons_to_breach_iron_curtain/1844564.html Using Balloons to Breach The Iron Curtain], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (August 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1951 to November 1956, the skies of Central Europe were filled with more than 350,000 balloons carrying over 300 million leaflets, posters, books, and other printed matter.&lt;ref name="Cummings|2008|p=169"/&gt; The nature of the leaflets varied, and included messages of support and encouragement to citizens suffering under communist oppression, satirical criticisms of communist regimes and leaders, information about dissident movements and human rights campaigns, and messages expressing the solidarity of the American people with the residents of Eastern European nations. The project served as a [[publicity]] tool to solidify RFE's reputation as an unbiased broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio Liberty ===
Whereas ''Radio Free Europe'' targeted satellite countries, ''Radio Liberty'' targeted the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2010|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Liberty was formed by [[American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia]] (Amcomlib) in 1951.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2010 37, 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2010|pp=37, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named ''Radio Liberation'', the station was renamed in 1959 after a policy statement emphasizing 'liberalization' rather than "liberation".&lt;ref name="Cummings|2008|p=170"&gt;{{harvnb|Cummings|2008|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Radio Liberty'' began broadcasting from [[Lampertheim]] on March 1, 1953, gaining a substantial audience when it covered the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] four days later. In order to better service a greater geographic area, RFE supplemented its [[shortwave|shortwave transmissions]] from Lampertheim with broadcasts from a transmitter base at [[Glória do Ribatejo|Glória]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also had a base at Oberwiesenfeld Airport on the outskirts of Munich,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2010|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; employing several former Nazi agents who had been involved in the [[Ostministerium]] under [[Gerhard von Mende]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2010|pp=49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 ''Radio Liberty'' began airing programs to Russia's eastern provinces from shortwave transmitters located on [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1959 Radio Liberty commenced broadcasts from a base at [[Pals|Platja de Pals]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Radio Liberty'' expanded its audience by broadcasting programs in numerous non-Russian languages. By March, 1954 Radio Liberty was broadcasting six to seven hours daily in eleven languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1954, Radio Liberty was broadcasting in 17 languages including Ukrainian, [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and other languages of the [[Caucasus]] and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Cummings|2008|p=170"/&gt;

==Cold War years==
[[File:Biblis RFE RL 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty transmitter site, [[Biblis]], Germany, 2007]]

===Radio Free Europe===
RFE played a critical role in [[Cold War]] era Eastern Europe. Unlike government censored programs, RFE publicized anti-Soviet protests and nationalist movements. Its audience increased substantially following the failed [[Berlin riots of 1953]] and the highly publicized defection of [[Józef Światło]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] service's coverage of [[Poland]]'s [[Poznań 1956 protests|Poznań riots]] in 1956 arguably served as an inspiration for the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] RFE broadcasts encouraged rebels to fight and suggested that Western support was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffith|first1=William|title=Policy Review of Voice for Free Hungary Programming, October 23 – November 23, 1956|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc10.pdf|website=National Security Archive|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These RFE broadcasts violated [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s policy which had determined that the United States would not provide military support for the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Malcolm|title=The 1956 Hungarian Revolution: A History in Documents|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/|website=National Security Archive|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this scandal a number of changes were implemented at RFE including the establishment of the Broadcast Analysis Division to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists' autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
RFE was seen as a serious threat by Romanian president [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. From the mid-1970s to his overthrow and execution in December 1989, Ceaușescu waged a vengeful war against the RFE/RL under the program "Ether". Ether operations include physical attacks on other Romanian journalists working for RFE/RL, including the controversial circumstances surrounding the deaths of three directors of RFE/RL's Romanian Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cummings|2008|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1981 RFE/RL Munich bombing====
On February 21, 1981, RFE/RL's headquarters in Munich was struck by a massive bomb, causing $2 million in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Richard|title=Special Feature: The 1981 Bombing of RFE/RL|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1080043.html|website=RFE/RL|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several employees were injured, but there were no fatalities. [[Stasi]] files opened after 1989 indicated that the bombing was carried out by a group under the direction of [[Carlos the Jackal|Ilich Ramírez Sánchez]] (known as "Carlos the Jackal"), and paid for by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], president of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoorferl.stanford.edu/RFE/exhibits_show.php?id=7|title="Voices of Hope" Hoover Institution exhibit on RFE/RL|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018001510/http://hoorferl.stanford.edu/RFE/exhibits_show.php?id=7|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the former head of the KGB Counterintelligence Department K, general [[Oleg Kalugin]], the bombing operation was planned over two years by Department K with the active involvement of a KGB mole inside the radio station, Oleg Tumanov. This revelation directly implicates KGB colonel [[Oleg Nechiporenko]] who recruited Tumanov in the early 1960s and was his Moscow curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohranka.com/2013/08/%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3-%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%B1-%D1%87%D0%B0/|title=Олег Туманов, "ПРИЗНАНИЯ АГЕНТА КГБ", ЧАСТЬ III – окончание|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Kalugin – Spymaster. My Thirty-two Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against the West. Basic Books, Philadelphia, 2009 pp. 224–25&lt;/ref&gt; Nechiporenko has never denied his involvement. In an interview with Radio Liberty in 2003, he justified the bombing on the grounds that RFE/RL was an American propaganda tool against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="archive.svoboda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.svoboda.org/programs/TD/2003/TD.021603.asp|title=[ Радио Свобода: Программы: История и современность: Разница во времени ]|website=archive.svoboda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumanov was exfiltrated back to the USSR in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coldwarradios.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/russian-teddy-bear-was-kgb-mole-oleg.html|title=The Russian Teddy Bear was a KGB Mole: The Oleg Tumanov Story|website=coldwarradios.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nechiporenko contacts with Carlos in the 1970s were confirmed by Nechiporenko himself in an article published by ''Segodnya'' in 2000&lt;ref&gt;Андрей Солдатов – По Чечне шпионы ходят хмуро... Мировые разведцентры изучают Россию через северокавказский бинокль. Сегодня, 24 февраля 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and by an article in ''Izvestia'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Евгений Крутиков – Шпиономания. В Тель-Авиве предостерегают Россию от пакистанской разведки. Известия, 9 июля 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chernobyl disaster====
For the first two days following the [[Chernobyl disaster]] on April 26, 1986, the official Eastern Bloc media did not report any news about the disaster and no full account for another four months. The people of the Soviet Union became frustrated with inconsistent and contradictory reports and 36% of them turned to Western radio to provide accurate and pertinent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parta|first1=R. Eugene|title=Discoverying the Hidden Listener|date=2007|publisher=Hoover Institute Press Publication|isbn=978-0817947323|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listenership at RFE/RL "shot up dramatically" as a "great many hours" of broadcast time were devoted to the dissemination of life-saving news and information following the disaster.&lt;ref name="sosin195"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sosin|first1=Gene|title=Sparks of Liberty: An Insiders Memoir of Radio Liberty|date=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts topics included "precautions for exposure to radioactive fallout" and reporting on the plight of the Estonians who were tasked with providing the clean-up operations in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="sosin195" /&gt;

====Poland and Czechoslovakia====
Communist governments also sent agents to infiltrate RFE's headquarters. Although some remained on staff for extended periods of time, government authorities discouraged their agents from interfering with broadcast activity, fearing that this could arouse suspicions and detract from their original purpose of gathering information on the radio station's activities. From 1965 to 1971 an agent of the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] (Communist Poland's security service) successfully infiltrated the station with an operative, Captain Andrzej Czechowicz. According to former [[Voice of America]] Polish service director Ted Lipien, "Czechowicz is perhaps the most well known communist-era Polish spy who was still an active agent while working at RFE in the late 1960s. Technically, he was not a journalist. As a historian by training, he worked in the RFE's media analysis service in Munich. After more than five years, Czechowicz returned to Poland in 1971 and participated in programs aimed at embarrassing Radio Free Europe and the United States government."&lt;ref&gt;Lipien, Ted (23 June 2007), "[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=10038 Old spy scandals still haunting US broadcasters?]", ''Spero News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other espionage incidents also included a failed attempt by a Czechoslovak Intelligence Service (StB) agent in 1959 to poison the salt shakers in the organization's cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&amp;catid=18&amp;Itemid=49|title=Cummings, Richard, "The Best Spy Stories of the Cold War"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313045921/http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&amp;catid=18&amp;Itemid=49|archivedate=2009-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1960, an upheaval in the Czechoslovak service led to a number of dramatic changes in the organization's structure. RFE's New York headquarters could no longer effectively manage their [[Munich]] subsidiary, and as a result major management responsibilities were transferred to Munich, making RFE a European-based organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] and Russian reformer [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] would later recall secretly listening to the broadcasts despite the heavy jamming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamming===
The Soviet government turned its efforts towards blocking reception of Western programs. To limit access to foreign broadcasts, the Central Committee decreed that factories should remove all components allowing short wave reception from [[Soviet Union|USSR]] made radio receivers. However, consumers easily found out that the necessary spare parts were available on the black market while electronics engineers opposing the idea would gladly convert radios back to being able to receive short wave transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most aggressive and extensive form of reception obstruction was [[radio jamming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was controlled by the [[KGB]], which in turn reported to the Central Committee. Jamming was an expensive and arduous procedure, and its efficacy is still debated. In 1958, the Central Committee mentioned that the sum spent on jamming was greater than the sum spent on domestic and international broadcasting combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=786}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee has admitted that circumventing jamming was both possible and practised in the Soviet Union. Due to limited resources, authorities prioritized jamming based on the location, language, time, and theme of Western transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly political programs in Russian, broadcast at prime time to urban centers, were perceived as the most dangerous. Seen as less politically threatening, Western music such as [[jazz]] was often transmitted unjammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=784}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of jamming fluctuated over time. During and after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in late 1962, jamming was intensified. The Cuban Missile Crisis, however, was followed by a five-year period when the jamming of most foreign broadcasters ceased, only to intensify again with the Prague Spring in 1968. It ceased again in 1973, when [[Henry Kissinger]] became the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]]. The end to jamming came abruptly on November 21, 1988 when  Soviet and Eastern European jamming of virtually all foreign broadcasts including RFE/RL services ceased at 21:00 CET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=A. Ross |last2=Parta |first2=R. Eugene |title=Cold War Broadcasting |date=2010 |publisher=Central European University Press |location=Budapest |isbn=9789639776807 |pages=51-64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
During the Cold War RFE was often criticized in the United States as not being sufficiently anti-communist. Although its non-governmental status spared it from full scale [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] investigations, several RFE journalists including the director of the Czech service, [[Ferdinand Peroutka]], were accused of being soft on Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fulton Lewis]] a U.S. [[radio commentator]] and fervent anti-communist was one of RFE's sharpest critics throughout the 1950s. His critical broadcasts inspired other journalists to investigate the inner workings of the organization including its connection to the CIA. When its CIA ties were exposed in the 1960s, funding responsibility shifted to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC "Historical dictionary of American propaganda"], Martin J. Manning, Herbert Romerstein. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. {{ISBN|0-313-29605-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-29605-5}}. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than two decades during the Cold War, the public was bombarded by an enormous publicity campaign to shape American views of [[Russia]] and its foreign policy. Advertisements appeared on every TV network, on radio stations across the country and in hundreds of newspapers. The campaign may have been the largest and most consistent source of political advertising in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/cia-fake-news-russia.html|title=Opinion - The C.I.A.’s Fake News Campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====

RFE/RL received funds from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] until 1972.&lt;ref name="bbg.gov"&gt;Broadcasting Board of Governors' Annual Congressional Budget Submission Reports http://www.bbg.gov/reports/budget.html&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA's relationship with the radio stations began to break down in 1967, when ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine published an exposé claiming that the CIA was channeling funds to civilian organizations. Further investigation into the CIA's funding activities revealed its connection to both RFE and RL, sparking significant media outrage.&lt;ref name="Mickelson 1983 126"/&gt;

In 1971 the radio stations came under public spotlight once again when prominent [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Clifford Case]] introduced [[Senate Bill]] 18, which would have removed funding for RFE and RL from the CIA's budget, appropriated $30 million to pay for [[fiscal year]] 1972 activities, and required the State Department to temporarily oversee the radio stations.&lt;ref name="Puddington, Arch 2003"/&gt; This was only a temporary solution, however, as the State Department was reluctant to take on such a significant long-term responsibility.

In May 1972 President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed a [[Presidential Commission (United States)|special commission]] to deliberate RFE/RL's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission proposed that funding come from the United States Congress and that a new organization, the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB) would simultaneously link the stations and the federal government, and serve as an editorial buffer between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both radio stations initially received most of their funding from the CIA, RFE maintained a strong sense of autonomy. Under [[Cord Meyer]], the CIA officer in charge of overseeing broadcast services from 1954 to 1971, the CIA took a position of minimal government interference in radio affairs and programming.&lt;ref name="Puddington 2003 30"/&gt;

The CIA stopped funding Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in 1972.&lt;ref name="Puddington, Arch 2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 they came under the control of an organization called the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB). The BIB was designed to receive [[appropriation (law)|appropriations]] from Congress, give them to radio managements, and oversee the appropriation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the two radio stations merged to form Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and added the three [[Baltic states|Baltic]] language services to their repertoire.

In a response to [[United States Department of Justice]] requesting [[RT (TV network)|RT]] to register as a foreign agent under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]], Russia's [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Justice Ministry]] also labeled RFE/RL and [[Voice of America]] as foreign agents in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stahl|first1=Lesley|title=RT's editor-in-chief on election meddling, being labeled Russian propaganda|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rt-editor-in-chief-on-election-meddling-russian-propaganda-label/|accessdate=14 January 2018|agency=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Andrew|title=Russia designates Radio Free Europe and Voice of America as 'foreign agents'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-media-restrictions/russia-designates-radio-free-europe-and-voice-of-america-as-foreign-agents-idUSKBN1DZ0MP|accessdate=14 January 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s and the fall of communism==
Funding for RFE/RL increased during the [[Reagan Administration]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]], a fervent opponent of Communism, urged the stations to be more critical of the communist regimes. This presented a challenge to RFE/RL's broadcast strategy, which had been very cautious since the controversy over its alleged role in the Hungarian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era in the Soviet Union, RFE/RL worked hand in hand with [[Glasnost]] and benefited significantly from the Soviet Union's new openness. Gorbachev stopped the practice of jamming the broadcasts, and dissident politicians and officials could be freely interviewed by RFE/RL for the first time without fearing persecution or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990 Radio Liberty had become the most listened-to Western radio station broadcasting to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its coverage of the 1991 [[August coup]] enriched sparse domestic coverage of the event and drew in a wide audience from throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcasts allowed Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]] to stay in touch with the Russian people during this turbulent period.  Boris Yeltsin later expressed his gratitude through a [[presidential decree]] allowing Radio Liberty to open a permanent bureau in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFE/RL also played a significant role in the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], which brought an end to the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Following the [[Velvet Revolution#Friday, November 17, 1989|November 17 demonstrations]] and brutal crackdown by Czechoslovak riot police, RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service reported that a student, [[Martin Šmíd]], had been killed during the clashes. Although the report later turned out to be false – Šmid was alive and well – the story is credited by many sources with inspiring Czechoslovak citizens to join the subsequent (larger) demonstrations which eventually brought down the communist government.

Upon hearing about the story, RFE/RL did not run it immediately, but attempted to find a second corroborating source for the story, as per official RFE/RL policy. While a second source was never found, RFE/RL eventually decided to run the story of Šmíd's death after it was reported by several major news organizations, including [[Reuters]], the [[Associated Press]], and the [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_smid_death_story/1879520.html|title=Unraveling the Šmid death story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Pavel Pecháček, the director of RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service at the time, was mistakenly granted a visa to enter the country by the Czechoslovak authorities prior to the demonstrations. He reported live from the demonstrations in [[Wenceslas Square]], and was virtually the only reporter covering the events fully and openly in the Czech language for a Czech audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_front_row_seat_to_revolution/1881688.html|title=Front Row Seat To The Revolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the fall of communism==
In 1995, RFE/RL moved its headquarters from Munich to Prague, to the building of the [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak Federal Assembly]], which had been unoccupied since the 1992 [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. The [[Clinton Administration]] reduced funding significantly and placed the service under the [[United States Information Agency]]'s oversight.&lt;ref name="Puddington 2003 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFE/RL ended broadcasts to [[Hungary]] in 1993 and stopped broadcasts to [[Poland]] in 1997. In the late 1990s RFE/RL launched broadcast to [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] in Albanian and to [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in Macedonian. Broadcast to the [[Czech Republic]] proceed for three more years under the agreement with Czech Radio. In 2004 RFE/RL stopped broadcasting to [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. However, on January 31, 2004, RFE/RL launched broadcasts to the former [[Yugoslavia]] in Serbo-Croatian (Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian-Montenegrin).

RFE/RL states that its mission is to serve as a [[wikt:surrogate|surrogate]] free press in countries where a free press is banned by the government or not fully established. It maintains 20 local bureaus, but governments criticised often attempt to obstruct the station's activities through a range of tactics, including extensive jamming, shutting down local re-broadcasting affiliates, or finding legal excuses to close down offices.&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with RFE/RL Chief Jeffrey Gedmin" [http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=3039 World Politics Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these countries, RFE/RL and similar broadcasters provide more reliable domestic news than local sources{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

RFE/RL says that its journalists and freelancers often risk their lives to broadcast information, and their safety has always been a major issue, with reporters frequently threatened and persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;RFE/RL website [http://www.rferl.org/info/journalists_in_trouble/563.html Journalists in trouble]&lt;/ref&gt; RFE/RL also faces a number of central security concerns including [[cyberterrorist]] attacks&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120942466671951083 ''Wall Street Journal''], April 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and general terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepraguepost.com/P02/pp.php/?id=34466&amp;a=3 ''The Prague Post''], interview with RFE/RL President Thomas Dine, January 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the World Trade Center in New York, American and Czech authorities agreed to move RFE/RL's Prague headquarters away from the city center in order to make it less vulnerable to terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepraguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/0729/news6.php ''The Prague Post''], July 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 2009, RFE/RL began broadcasting from its modern new headquarters east of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/First_Broadcast_From_New_RFERL_Headquarters_/1378790.html RFE/RL Press Release] February 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

RFE/RL says that it continues to struggle with authoritarian regimes for permission to broadcast freely within their countries. On January 1, 2009, [[Azerbaijan]] imposed a ban on all foreign media in the country, including RFE/RL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/Azerbaijan_Bans_RFERL_Other_Foreign_Radio/1364986.html|title=Azerbaijan Bans RFE/RL, VOA, BBC Broadcasts|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kyrgyzstan]] suspended broadcasts of Radio Azattyk, RFE/RL's Kyrgyz language service, requesting that the government be able to pre-approve its programming. Other states such as [[Belarus]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] prohibit re-broadcasting to local stations, making programming difficult for average listeners to access.

In 1998, RFE/RL began broadcasting to [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="iraq"&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech Intelligence Reveals Iraqi Plot To Attack RFE/RL |date=30 November 2009  |accessdate=24 November 2015 |publisher=[[RFE/RL]] |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Czech_Intelligence_Reveals_Iraqi_Plot_To_Attack_RFERL/1891512.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]] ordered [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], to "violently disrupt the Iraqi broadcasting of Radio Free Europe". IIS planned to attack the headquarters with [[RPG-7]] from a window across the street. Czech [[Security Information Service]] (BIS) foiled the plot.&lt;ref name="iraq" /&gt;

In 2008 Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] urged his government to provide assistance to a rape victim after listening to her story on [[Radio Azadi]], RFE/RL's Afghan service.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Parker "Mightier than the Sword". [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2008/11/20/AR2008112002541.html ''The Washington Post''], November 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to REF/RL in 2009, Radio Azadi was the most popular radio station in Afghanistan, and Afghan listeners mailed hundreds of hand-written letters to the station each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/poetry_from_paktia_to_prague/1811546.html|title=Poetry from Paktia to Prague|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 RFE/RL announced that it would begin new [[Pashto language|Pashto-language]] broadcasting to the [[Afghanistan-Pakistan border]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Holbrooke_Reception/1826309.html|title=Flashback (Sep. 18, 2009) Holbrooke at RFE Event: 'Deal with Taliban Propaganda Head-On'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month RFE/RL introduced a daily, one-hour Russian-language broadcast,  broadcasting to the breakaway regions of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]]. The program, called ''Ekho Kavkaza (Echo of the Caucasus)'', focused on local and international 'news and current affairs, organized in coordination with RFE/RL's Georgian Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/New_program_to_south_ossetia_press_release/1846174.html|title=RFE/RL Launching Russian-Language Show to South Ossetia &amp; Abkhazia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2010, RFE/RL began broadcasting to the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan in [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. The service, known as [[Radio Mashaal]], was created in an attempt to counter the growing number of local Islamic extremist radio stations broadcasting in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. These local stations broadcast pro-Taliban messages as well as [[fatwas]] (religious edicts) by radical, pro-Taliban clerics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

''[[Radio Mashaal]]'' says that it broadcasts local and international news with in-depth reports on terrorism, politics, women's issues, and health care (with an emphasis on [[preventive medicine]]). The station broadcasts roundtable discussions and interviews with tribal leaders and local policymakers, in addition to regular call-in programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RFE/RL Launches Radio Station in Pakistan's Pashtun Heartland |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2010 |publisher=[[RFE/RL]] |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Press_Room_Press_Release_Radio_Mashaal_Launch_/1929887.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2017, Voice of America and RFE/RL launched ''[[Polygraph.info]]'', and the Russian-language ''factograph.info'', as fact-checking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Polygraph.info|url=https://www.polygraph.info/p/5981.html|website=Polygraph.info|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="We got our f**** a***s beat, Yankees made their point": Russian mercenaries in Syria lament U.S. strikes|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-f-russian-mercenaries-syria-lament-us-strike-killed-dozens-818073|accessdate=27 March 2018|work=Newsweek|date=23 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2018, RFE/RL announced it will be returning its news services to Romania and Bulgaria by the end of 2018 amid growing concern about a reversal in democratic gains and attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary in the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/rfe-rl-to-launch-news-services-in-romania-bulgaria/29376248.html|title=RFE/RL To Launch News Services In Romania, Bulgaria|last=Tomiuc|first=Eugen|date=2018-07-19|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6657">'''Rail transport in Djibouti''' is administered through the ''Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Rail Transport Share Company'', a bi-national company between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Djibouti]] to manage the only [[railway]] in Djibouti, the electrified [[standard gauge]] international [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]]. This railway opened on 1 January 2018 replaced the international [[metre gauge]] railway from Djibouti's capital [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]] to the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]], which was officially decommissioned in 2016.

== Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway ==
{{main article|Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway}}
Ethiopia and Djibouti's economies are reliant on each other with about 95 percent of all Ethiopian international trade going through Djibouti's port at the [[Port of Doraleh]]. The old metre gauge railway was almost defunct and unable to transport goods to and from Ethiopia to Djibouti for decades. In 2010, Ethiopia decided to build a new standard gauge railway. In 2011, one year after finalizing plans on a new national railway network, financing was secured for the [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]] and construction was awarded to [[China|Chinese]] [[construction]] firms.&lt;ref name="signature1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maasho|first1=Aaron|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/17/ethiopia-railway-idUSL6E7NH07M20111217|agency=Reuters|date=17 December 2011|title=Ethiopia signs Djibouti railway deal with China|quote=Ethiopia and Djibouti's economies are reliant on each other with about 70 percent of all trade through Djibouti's port coming from its land-locked neighbour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 and January 2017, the railway was completed and inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;"Ethiopia–Djibouti electric railway line opens". BBC News. 5 October 2016. Accessed 3 November 2016. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37562177]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ethiopia – Djibouti high speed railway finally completed|publisher=CGTN|date=17 January 2017|url= http://africa.cgtn.com/2017/01/10/44393/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The railway became operational on 1 January 2018.&lt;ref name="wpd"&gt;{{web cite|url=http://www.portdedjibouti.com/grand-plans-for-djibouti/|title=Grand plans for Djibouti|date=April 2017|publisher=''Port of Djibouti SA'' / ''World Port Development''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical railway of 759 km length alone did cost around US $3.5b (US $4m per km of railway) while the [[Exim Bank of China]] facilitated a package, that resulted in loans of about US $2.5b in total. Therefore, In 2013, loans totalling US$3 billion were secured from the Exim Bank of China, with US$2.4 billion going to the Ethiopian section of the railway and the balance to be spent in Djibouti. As the loans came from China, most contributing firms were from China.

A total of 93 km of the railway is running on Djiboutian territory. It is a single track railway line along the entire Djiboutian share of the railway. It connects the border with Ethiopia at [[Guelile]] with the [[Port of Doraleh]] in the capital Djibouti City. The border crossing with Ethiopia at Guelile has no railway station, the first railway station on Djiboutian territory is at [[Ali Sabieh]], 9 km inland. 81 km of the railway between the border post at Guelile and the [[Nagad railway station]] in the capital Djibouti City close to the [[Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport]] are electrified, standard operation happens with trains hauled by electric locomotives. The final stretch between the Nagad railway station and the Port of Doraleh (12.1 km) is non-electrified and only served by diesel locomotives to avoid interferences of loading / unloading cranes with the electric overhead catenary of an electrified railway.

Along the line, Djibouti has a total of four railway stations:
* [[Ali Sabieh]] passenger &amp; freight railway station, a single 300 m long boarding platform and a station building for passenger handling (ticketing, refreshments).
* [[Holhol]] passenger &amp; freight railway station, a single 200 m long boarding platform and a station building for passenger handling (ticketing, refreshments).
* [[Nagad railway station|Nagad]] passenger &amp; freight railway station, a single 300 m long boarding platform and a station building for passenger handling (ticketing, refreshments).
* [[Djibouti Port station]], freight yard without passenger services in the non-electrified railway section, for collecting and assembling freight trains.
All trains stations have at least three tracks and could serve as [[passing loop]]s on the single-track railway line. in addition, depots and maintenance facilities are located at the stations. The traction power for the overhead catenaries is delivered through three substations which are directly connected to the Ethiopian national grid.

As of January 2018, there is no domestic passenger traffic between Ali Sabieh, Holhol and Djibouti City, all trains are international trains from and to Ethiopia serving the Nagad and the Port train stations only.

== Proposed railways ==
* There is another major electrified standard gauge railway line proposed between Ethiopia and Djibouti, the [[Weldiya–Tadjoura Railway]]. That railway line was ''not'' expected to connect to the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. The Weldiya–Tadjoura Railway was considered to connect Ethiopia through the border station at [[Galafi]] with the new [[Tadjoura|Port of Tadjourah]], the second-largest Djiboutian port for bulk goods (potash). This railway was postponed during the tendering process. Private potash-mining companies in Ethiopia are planning a privately financed and built freight railway instead, if the potash mining produces transportation volumes above 2 million tonnes annually. Such a privately financed railway would also be running from the border post at Galafi to the Port of Tadjourah. The Djiboutian section would be around 180 km long. The railway might be extended to the proposed [[Bridge of the Horns]] and [[Yemen]] later.
* An extension of the port section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. This branch line would depart from ''Nagad train station'' then passing [[Camp Lemonnier]] and going to the border with [[Somaliland]] at the coast close to the villages of [[Damerjog]] / [[Loyada]]. Primary reason is another major Djiboutian port to be constructed at Damerjog. This [[branch line]] would be 15–20 km long. A later extension to Somaliland ([[Hargeisa]], [[Berbera]]) might be possible.

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) has a special role in lawmaking in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Through a variety of documents circulated within the Party, the CCP practically provides guidance to China's lawmaking organs such as the Standing Committee of the [[National People's Congress]] in the lawmaking process. Besides, the CCP itself assumes a role in setting internal norms (such as disciplinary rules for its Party members). There are several milestone Party documents that illustrate the CCP's leading role in China's lawmaking activities. They are:

1. Report Submitted by Comrade Peng Zhen on the Examination and Approval Process of Making and Revising Laws and Regulations (issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the CCP in August 1979);
2. Several Opinions on Intensifying the Leadership of the Legislation Work of the State (issued by the Central Committee of the CCP in February 1991);
3. Opinions on Strengthening the Work of the Party's Leadership in Lawmaking (February 2016).

The guidelines enshrined in these Party documents have had profound impacts on the lawmaking activities in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawscience.ecupl.edu.cn/s/288/t/71/6e/b0/info28336.htm|title=党领导立法工作需要研究解决的几个重要问题|author=刘松山, 2017-05-24, 法学月刊杂志社|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simonside Dwarfs''', also known as '''Brownmen''', '''[[Boggart|Bogles]]''' and '''Duergar''', are a race of ugly [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], particularly associated with the [[Simonside Hills]] of [[Northumberland]], in northern England. Their leader was said to be known as ''Roarie''.&lt;ref name="The North Country page.62"&gt;''Ghosts of The North Country'', Henry Tegner, 1991 Butler Publishing {{ISBN|0-946928-40-1}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In F. Grice's telling of the traditional story ''The Duergar'' in ''Folk Tales of the North Country'' (1944), one of them is described as being short, wearing a lambskin coat, moleskin trousers and shoes, and a hat made of moss stuck with a feather. 

The legendary dwarfs of Simonside were mentioned in the local newspaper, the ''Morpeth Gazette'', in 1889, and in Tyndale’s ''Legends and Folklore of Northumbria'', 1930. They delighted in leading travellers astray, especially after dark, often carrying lighted torches to lead them into bogs, rather like a [[Will-o'-the-wisp]].&lt;ref name="The North Country page.62"/&gt; The menacing creatures would often disappear at dawn.

The word ''duergar'' is likely to be derived from the [[Old Norse]] word for dwarf or dwarfs ([[Norse dwarves|''dvergar'']]), but it may also come from the dialectal words for ''"dwarf"'' on the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] which include ''dorch'', ''dwerch'', ''duerch'', ''Duergh'' and ''Duerwe'' amongst others &lt;ref name=famscott&gt;''Familiar letters of Sir Walter Scott, Volume 1'', Sir Walter Scott, Houghton Mifflin, 1894, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mairi Robinson 1999, pages 162-166"&gt;''Concise Scots dictionary'' Mairi Robinson, Edinburgh University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-902930-01-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-902930-01-5}} pages 162-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dwarf&lt;/ref&gt; with the added Norse ''-ar'' plural.&lt;ref name="famscott"/&gt; These ''Border'' words for ''"dwarf"'', like the [[Standard English]] form, all derive from the [[Old English]] ''dweorh'' or ''dweorg'' via the [[Middle English]] ''dwerg''.&lt;ref name="Mairi Robinson 1999, pages 162-166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dwarf Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
