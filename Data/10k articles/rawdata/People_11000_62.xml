'''Alfred Young Man, Ph.D.''' or '''Kiyugimah''' (Eagle Chief) (born 1948) is a [[Cree]] artist, writer, educator, and an enrolled member of the Chippewa-Cree tribe located on the [[Rocky Boy Indian Reservation]], [[Montana]], US. His Montana birth certificate lists him as being 13/16th Cree by [[Blood quantum laws|blood-quantum]], but one of his full sisters, Shirley, is listed as 16/16ths. He is a former Department Head (2007–2010) of Indian Fine Arts at the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] and former Chair (1999–2007) of Native American Studies, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;Blomberg 159&lt;/ref&gt; He is Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Lethbridge]] and [[University of Regina]].

==Background==
Born in 1948 on the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]] in [[Browning, Montana]],&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt; Young Man is the ninth child of fifteen brothers and sisters. His father Joseph Young Man White Horse (Sau-sti-qua-ńis) and mother Lillian Katherine Boushie were both Cree and fluent in Cree and English.

Young Man's paternal Cree grandmother Theresa Ground Woman Big Springs spoke Cree only and was married to Don't Talk Many White Horses, a Blackfeet Indian man. Since Don't Talk was deaf, he went by the nickname Deafy (pronoun: Deé-fee). Deafy was stricken with [[scarlet fever]] as a child in the late 19th century, as many Blackfeet children of his generation were, rendering him mute. Theresa and Deafy communicated their entire married lives using Indian sign-language. Theresa outlived Deafy to the approximate age of 113 years. Young Man's maternal grandfather Edward Boushie was Cree/Métis and Edward's wife Eliza was also Cree from the Erminskin Reserve in Hobbema, Alberta.

Young Man grew up in [[East Glacier Park, Montana]] and spoke Cree as a child. Like nearly all Indian children of his generation, when Alfred was six years old he and his siblings were taken away to Cut Bank Boarding School, a Bureau of Indian Affairs government school located a short distance north of Browning. Physical punishment was an everyday occurrence and Cree and Blackfeet traditions and customs were illegal to practise under US government law. Young Man stayed in government Indian boarding schools at various times and places until he was 20 years old when he went to the Slade School of Art in London, England in 1968 which was the first time ever that he attended an all-white school for any length of time. Alfred's memory of the Cree language is sparse and he speaks and understands only a little.&lt;ref name=abbot&gt;Abbot, Larry. [http://www.britesites.com/native_artist_interviews/aman.htm "Alfred Young Man, Cree."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529071604/http://www.britesites.com/native_artist_interviews/aman.htm |date=2016-05-29 }} ''Time of Visions.'' (retrieved 9 Dec 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Young Man attended the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] (1963–1968) where the German painter Fritz Scholder was his painting teacher for two years (1966–68). The IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts retains a considerable number of Young Man's paintings in its collection from the five years he spent there. Young Man went on to study painting, film history and photography at the [[Slade School of Fine Arts]], University College London in London, England for four years (1968–72) where he met many famous and influential artists and musicians, amongst these were Pop artist's Richard Hamilton and David Hockney who were visiting artists and who stopped by his painting studio on random occasions. While at the Slade, Young Man was tutored and mentored for two years (1970–1972) by Bernard Cohen; another tutor was landscape painter William Townsend (1909–1973). The director of the Slade during Young Man's time at the school was Sir William Coldstream, founder of the Euston Road School. While in London, Young Man met Jimi Hendrix just a month before the famous rock musician died in September 1970, introduced to Hendrix by Steven Stills of CSN&amp;Y who was cutting what Stills described as his pink giraffe album in a sound studio in London.

Young Man earned his M.A. at the [[University of Montana]] (1972–74) where George Longfish (Seneca-Tuscarora) was his teacher and mentor in the Graduate Program in American Indian Art. He graduated with his doctor of philosophy degree (Ph.D.) in Anthropology from [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1997 where he studied anthropology as a student of William Powers.&lt;ref name=abbot/&gt;

Young Man has been an art teacher since the early 1970s, beginning on his home reservation at the Rocky Boy Elementary School (1973–1974) after which he moved to the K.W. Bergan Elementary School in Browning, Montana on the Blackfeet Indian reservation for a short time. He continued on to the Flathead Valley Community College in Kalispell, Montana (1975 – 77) where he helped found the Total Community Education television training program. When that program came to a close he moved on to the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1977 where he eventually became Chair of Native American Studies (1999–2010). He taught in the Faculty Exchange Program at the University of Lethbridge/Leeds University Leeds, UK in 1985 and the Faculty Exchange Program University of Lethbridge/Hokkai Gakuen University Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan in 1992. He remained tenured at the U of L up until 2007 when he chose early retirement and began work as Department Head of Indian Fine Art at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=fnu&gt;[http://fnuniv.wordpress.com/2010/02/13/faculty-1/ "Faculty Profile #1: Alfred Young Man."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718095542/http://fnuniv.wordpress.com/2010/02/13/faculty-1/ |date=2011-07-18 }} ''First Nations University.'' 13 Feb 2010 (retrieved 9 Dec 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his teaching activities at the First Nations University, Young Man also worked as archival curator and custodian of the school's 1500 piece art collection. In August 2010 his employment at FNUC was terminated along with approximately 52 other professors and support staff, due to financial exigency budget cuts. He was appointed in 2015 Adjunct Professor to the Art Department, University of Calgary.

Most recently in terms of his lifetime, Young Man did an artist/writer's residency at the Lab 26 Tejiendo Identitdad Entre Las Culturas Originarias de America, Galeria de Arte Contemporaneo Paul Bardwell, Centro Colombo Americano de Medellin, Medellin, Colombia in 2011. He has spoken at numerous conferences and other venues held on every continent on the planet throughout his long professional career.

Pedagogically Young Man teaches his courses from the Native perspective, something unheard of when he began teaching Indian fine art at the University of Lethbridge in 1977 and something that, even today, very few if any Native art professionals of whatever category claim to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uregina.ca/news/urreport.php?issue=63&amp;article=209&amp;PHPSESSID=d1dacf9875825273a8d4c28d54fc46e0 "Native perspective not easily taught."]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''University of Regina Report.'' 14 June 2010 (retrieved 9 Dec 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
Young Man served as chair of the board of the [[Society of Canadian Artists of Native Ancestry]], which was instrumental in convincing the [[National Gallery of Canada]] to include [[First Nations art]] and artists in its vast collection.&lt;ref name=fnu/&gt;

[[Image:Franz Anton Maulbertsch 003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Franz Anton Maulbertsch]], ''Jupiter and Antiope'' (c. 1780).]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Antiope'''  ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə|p|i}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀντιόπη derived from ''αντι ''anti "against, compared to, like" and ''οψ ''ops "voice") was the daughter of the [[Boeotia]]n [[river god]] [[Asopos (Boeotia)|Asopus]], according to [[Homer]];&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey''. xi. 260&lt;/ref&gt; in later sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], epitomizing Euripides' ''Antiope''.&lt;/ref&gt; she is called the daughter of the "nocturnal" king [[Nycteus]] of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or, in the ''[[Cypria]]'', of Lycurgus, but for Homer her site is purely Boeotian. She was the mother of [[Amphion and Zethus]].

==Myth==

Her beauty attracted [[Zeus]], who, assuming the form of a [[satyr]], took her by force.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 5; Burkert 1983 suggests that this apparently summarises a passage on Antiope in the ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' that survives in a brief fragment (Hesiod, fr. 181-82).&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.B. Cook]] noted that her myth "took on a Dionysiac colouring, Antiope being represented as a [[Maenad]] and Zeus as a Satyr".&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Zeus'', vol. I, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the sole mythic episode in which Zeus is transformed into a satyr. After this she was carried off by [[Epopeus]], who was venerated as a hero in [[Sicyon]];&lt;ref&gt;His tomb was sited in the ''[[temenos]]'' of [[Athena]] at Sicyon. (Pausanias, 2.11.1; 2.6.3). Walter Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' 1983:186 notes the comparison with [[Athena|Athena Poleis]] at Athens and [[Erechtheus]].&lt;/ref&gt; he would not give her up till compelled by her uncle [[Lycus (brother of Nycteus)|Lycus]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antiope|display=Antiope (1)|volume=2|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way home she gave birth, in the neighbourhood of [[Eleutherae]] on [[Mount Cithaeron]], to the twins [[Amphion and Zethus]], of whom Amphion was the son of the god, and Zethus the son of Epopeus.&lt;ref&gt;For other twins of such dual parentage, see [[Dioscuri]]; some heroes, like [[Theseus]] or [[Achilles]], were born of mixed seed of a mortal and an immortal father.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were left to be brought up by herdsmen. At Thebes Antiope now suffered from the persecution of [[Dirce]], the wife of Lycus, but at last escaped towards Eleutherae, and there found shelter, unknowingly, in the house where her two sons were living as herdsmen.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This is the situation in Euripides' ''Antiope'', which turns upon the recognition of mother and sons and their rescue of her.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Image:Bartholomäus Spranger 020.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Antiope''. ]]
Here she was discovered by Dirce, who had come to celebrate a Bacchic festival; she ordered the two young men to tie Antiope to the horns of a wild bull. They were about to obey, when the old herdsman, who had brought them up, revealed his secret, and they carried out the punishment on Dirce instead, for cruel treatment of Antiope, their mother, who had been treated by Dirce as a slave.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabula'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In Euripides, the descent of [[Hermes]] stops the brothers from putting their uncle to death; Lycus then resigns power in the [[Cadmeia]] of Thebes to the twins.

For the treatment of Dirce, it is said, [[Dionysus]], to whose worship she had been devoted, visited Antiope with madness, which caused her to wander restlessly all over Greece&lt;ref&gt;Compare the wanderings of [[Io (mythology)|Io]].&lt;/ref&gt; until she was cured, and married by Phocus of Tithorca, on [[Mount Parnassus]], where both were buried in one grave.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ix. 17, x. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Amphion became a great singer and musician after [[Hermes]] taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre; Zethus was a hunter and herdsman. For Greeks of the Classical age, the contrast between the lifestyles of the two became the most salient element in the narrative; in Euripides' ''Antiope'' the best-recalled scene was where the two brothers in debate contrasted their active and contemplative lives.&lt;ref name="Gorgias 1992 pp. 121-141"&gt;As in ''Gorgias'', examined by Andrea Wilson Nightingale, "Plato's 'Gorgias' and Euripides' 'Antiope': A Study in Generic Transformation" ''Classical Antiquity'' '''11'''.1 (April 1992), pp. 121-141; noted by E.R. Dodds, ''Plato: Gorgias'' (Oxford, 1959) p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they built and fortified Thebes, huge blocks of stone forming themselves into walls at the sound of Amphion's lyre. Amphion married [[Niobe]], and killed himself after the loss of his wife and children. Zethus married [[Aedon]], or sometimes [[List of mythological figures named Thebe|Thebe]]. The brothers were buried in one grave.

==In Greek culture==

At [[Sicyon]], Antiope was important enough that a [[chryselephantine]] cult image was created of her and set up in the temple of [[Aphrodite]]. Pausanias speaks of it.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 2.10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one priestess, an elderly woman, was permitted to enter the ''[[cella]]'' of the temple, with a young girl chosen each year, to serve as ''Lutrophoros''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1983) iii.5 "Antiope and Epopeus" the "carrier of water" for lustrating the images.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euripides]]' ''Antiope'',&lt;ref&gt;Z. Ritoók, "Problems in Euripides’ Antiope" ''Acta Antiqua'', '''48'''.1/2 (January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; presented about 408 BCE,  was widely quoted, in [[Plato]]'s ''Gorgias'' and many other authors, resulting in a large array of fragments. In 1890 [[Flinders Petrie]] discovered further papyrus fragments, which had been reused in constructing a 3rd-century BCE Ptolemaic mummy case found in the [[Fayoum]]; the palaeography suggested that the scroll was old before it was reused as waste, making these fragments the earliest surviving text of any Greek play;&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Rutherford and Lewis Campbell, "Some Notes on the New Antiope Fragments" ''The Classical Review'' '''5'''.3 (March 1891), pp. 123-126.&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery occasioned a rash of new readings of the existing fragments. The modern comprehensive reconstruction of all the fragments is that of Jean Kambitsis, ed. and commentator, ''L'Antiope d'Euripide'' (Athens, 1972).

==Parallels==

The myth of [[Amphion]], the legendary founder of Thebes, and Antiope inspired a lot of other similar myths in several areas of Greece. Amphion was son of [[Zeus]] and of Antiope, daughter of the Boeotian river god [[Asopus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' Book xi,260&lt;/ref&gt; The myth took a [[Dionysos|Dionysiac]] colour because Zeus was transformed into a [[satyr]] in a sole mythic event{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} and Antiope into a [[maenad]]. After this she was carried off by [[Epopeus]] in [[Sicyon]], where he was venerated later as a hero in the [[temenos]] of [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],2.6.3,2.11.1&lt;/ref&gt; Burkert notices the similarity with the myth of [[Athena|Athena Polias]] and [[Erechtheus]] in [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1983).''Homo Necans'' iii 5.''Antiope and Epopeus''. p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Thebes, on [[Cithaeron|Mount Cithaeron]] she gave birth to the twins Amphion, son of the god, and [[Amphion and Zethus|Zethus]], son of the mortal [[Epopeus]]. The story is mentioned in fragments of the Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' (frr. 182, 183) and [[Asius of Samos]] (fr. 1).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Walter Burkert (1983).''Homo Necans'' iii 5.''Antiope and Epopeus''&lt;/ref&gt; Other twins of similar dual parentage are the Greek [[Dioscuri]] who often appear as snakes, protecting the temples.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nillson (1967).''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion. Vol. I''.Munchen p.228&lt;/ref&gt; Amphion, the founder of Thebes, became a great singer and musician with a golden lyre, and huge blocks of stone formed themselves into the walls of ''Thebes'', the city with the seven gates. His brother ''Zethus'' became a hunter and a herdsman and the two brothers represent the contrast between two different lifestyles. In [[Euripides]]' tragedy ''Antiope'' they contrasted in debate their active and contemplative lives.&lt;ref name="Gorgias 1992 pp. 121-141"/&gt;

[[Dionysos]], to whose worship Antiope was devoted, visited her with madness, causing her to wander restlessly all over Greece until she was cured.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This myth is similar to that of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a priestess of the goddess [[Hera]] in [[Argos]] who was stung by a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]] and wandered in madness to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;The story of Io was told in the ancient epic tradition at least four times: in the ''[[Danais (epic)|Danais]]'', in the ''[[Phoroneus|Phoronis]] in ''Aigimios'' of Hesiod, and in an [[Oxyrhynchus papyrus]] fragment. Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1974) 1983:164 note 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Her sons [[Cadmus]] and [[Danaos]] returned to Greece, where they became kings of ''Thebes'' and ''Argos''.

The house where [[Svetozar Ćorović]] was born has been transformed into a [[writer's home museum]]. The museum is located in [[Mostar]], Bosnia and Herzegovina. Svetozar Ćorović is one of the most important Herzegovina novelists&lt;ref name="www.imdb.com"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180620/bio/ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; who often wrote of life in Herzegovina region and in Mostar, is located at Mostar's 178, Maršala Tita Street, close to the Muyaga Komadina Bridge (or Luka Bridge). It was constructed in 1874 in a somewhat unusual [[Neo-Renaissance]] style.&lt;ref name="www.turizam.mostar.ba"&gt;[http://www.turizam.mostar.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:kua-svetozara-orovia-&amp;catid=43:muzeji-i-galerije&amp;Itemid=423&amp;lang=en/ City of Mostar]&lt;/ref&gt; The building style was also inspired by the Dalmatian architecture.&lt;ref name="www.muzejhercegovine.com"&gt;[http://muzejhercegovine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=32/ Svetozar Corovoc House - In local Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aleksa Šantić]], one of the country’s greatest poets, also lived here during the last years of his life. The building houses a room dedicated to his memory with a library collection containing his precious manuscripts.

The city honors Šantić by holding poetry reading evenings, the Šantićeve večeri poezije, an event much which has taken place every year for the past twenty three years.&lt;ref name="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701024925/http://www.comune.fi.it/mostar/en/live/museumhouse.html"&gt;[http://www.comune.fi.it/mostar/en/live/museumhouse.html/ House Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles Fergusson Forbes''', [[Royal Guelphic Order|KH]] (1779–1852) was an English army surgeon.

==Life==
Forbes was educated to the medical profession in London. He joined the army medical staff in [[Portugal]] in 1798, was gazetted next year assistant-surgeon to the Royals, served in Holland, at [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], in Egypt, the Mediterranean, the West Indies, and through the [[Peninsular War]], having been appointed to the staff in 1808 and made deputy inspector-general of hospitals in 1813.{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=381}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Fergusson (Sir) Forbes|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/1578|publisher=Royal College of Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1814 with that rank and the war medal with five clasps, and commenced practice as a physician in [[Argyll Street, London]].{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=381}} He graduated from [[Edinburgh University]] in 1808 with a Doctor of Medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fergusson|first=Forbes, Charles|date=1808-01-01|title=Dissertatio medica inauguralis de febre intermittente|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/10336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[College of Physicians of London]] in 1814, becoming a fellow in 1841.{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=381}}

In 1816 he was appointed physician to the newly founded [[Royal Westminster Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye]] in Warwick Street, Golden Square, having [[George James Guthrie]] as his surgical colleague. In 1827 a difference of opinion arose between Forbes and Guthrie as to the treatment of inflammatory affections of the eye; the subject was noticed in ''[[The Lancet]]'' adversely to Guthrie, who began an action for [[libel]] against the journal, but abandoned it on learning that Forbes had been subpoenaed as a witness. Having been insulted at the hospital by one Hale Thomson, a young surgeon in Guthrie's party, Forbes challenged Thomson to a duel. It was fought with pistols on [[Clapham Common]] at half-past three in the afternoon of 29 December 1827; when each had fired twice without effect, the seconds interposed, but another encounter was demanded by the principals, which was also harmless. The seconds then declared the duel at an end, against the wishes of the parties.{{sfn|Creighton|1889|pp=381–382}}

Forbes resigned his appointment at the hospital, carrying a number of its subscribers with him. He declined an offer by Guthrie to give him the satisfaction of a gentleman and an officer of the same service, on the ground that the offer was not made until after events at the hospital had been allowed to take their course. He had a considerable practice among a number of families of the nobility. He was a [[Knight of the Crescent]], in 1837 was made a [[Guelphic knight of Hanover]], and in 1844 an English knight. He died at Argyll Street on 22 March 1852.{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=382}}

==Works==
He wrote:
*Two pamphlets related the Guthrie affair (1828);{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=382}}
*A brief record of a case of fatal thrombosis of the thigh veins in the ''Medico-Chirurgical Transactions'', xiii. (1827);{{sfn|Creighton|1889|p=382}}

She was a co-anchor on ''[[Ten Eyewitness News]]''. Dragun, who had been diagnosed with [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and had a history of [[anorexia]], died by suicide on 2 November 2007.

==Education and career==
Dragun graduated from the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]] with a degree in broadcast journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Perth born Network Ten newsreader Charmaine Dragun|newspaper=PerthNow|date=1 November 2007|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/charmaine-dragun-found-dead/story-e6frg12c-1111114790789}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career as a radio journalist and newsreader at Perth radio stations [[6PR]] and [[96fm (Perth radio station)|96FM]]. She was nominated for ''Young Journalist of the Year'' and won both the Australian and state ''Best Radio Reports'' award.&lt;ref name=ownwords&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/charmaine-draguns-sydney-life/story-e6freuy9-1111114792035|title=Charmaine Dragun's Sydney Life|date=3 November 2007|accessdate=20 December 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragun switched from radio to television when she was offered a position at Network Ten. She started out reporting a wide range of stories from entertainment news to major national news stories and eventually began court reporting regularly. She occasionally filled in as a presenter on Perth's ''Ten News at Five'' and on 4 July 2005, she was appointed as permanent news anchor for the show, which was broadcast from Network Ten's [[TEN-10|Sydney studio TEN]] at [[Pyrmont, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=ownwords/&gt; She was a main co-anchor of ''[[Ten Eyewitness News]]'' and also filled in on the national morning and weekend news bulletins and presented ''[[Ten Late News and Sports Tonight|Ten Late News]]'' on Fridays. Dragun's co-anchor, veteran broadcaster [[Tim Webster]], described her as "one of the most professional I've ever seen, very meticulous...if she made a mistake she was distraught about it."&lt;ref name=AusStory&gt;{{cite episode|title=Friday's Child|url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/specials/fridayschild/default.htm|series=Australian Story|serieslink=Australian_Story|credits=Caroline Jones (Presenter)|network=[[ABC Television|ABC Television (Australia)]]|airdate=2008-04-28|season=2008|number=12|transcript=Transcript|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2007/s2230862.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Perth===
Charmaine Margaret Dragun was born in [[Perth, Western Australia]] to Estelle and Michael Dragun. According to her mother, Dragun was a perfectionist and developed anorexia while she was attending university at the WA Academy of Performing Arts and continued to have problems related to anorexia periodically for the next several years. When she was 18 years old, she saw a psychiatrist to address the [[eating disorder]] and was also diagnosed with depression and started on a class of antidepressants called [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), that she continued taking for several years.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;&lt;ref name=burden/&gt;&lt;ref name=perfect&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/09/2840639.htm?section=justin|title='Perfectionist' newsreader had eating disorder, inquest told|work=news.com.au|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragun was engaged to Simon Struthers, a forensic investigator,&lt;ref name=burden/&gt; whom she had been dating since she was 16 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Brave battle' of late newsreader|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 November 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7077678.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were planning to marry on Dragun's 30th birthday.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wolf whistle triggered Charmaine's tragic decline|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 April 2008|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/wolf-whistle-triggered-charmaines-tragic-decline/2008/04/27/1209234639614.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, eight months before moving to Sydney, Dragun told her mother that her medication made her feel numb and she started seeing a psychiatrist who recommended that Dragun discontinue medication altogether. Her mother said that Dragun's symptoms started to go "down hill" after six weeks off antidepressants. She moved back home with her parents and temporarily ended her relationship with Struthers, stating that she couldn't give him happiness.&lt;ref name=AusStory/&gt; She restarted [[pharmacotherapy]] on a new class of antidepressants, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs),&lt;ref name=Arlington&gt;{{citation|title=Slipping into the darkness|date=20 March 2010|first=Kim|last=Arlington|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/slipping-into-the-darkness-20100319-qmac.html|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prescribed by her [[general practitioner]] (GP), which she took until 2007.&lt;ref name=burden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/too-great-a-burden/story-e6frg6z6-1111116178599|title=Too great a burden|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=5 November 2009|first1=Paige|last1=Taylor|work=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sydney===
When she moved to Sydney in 2005, Dragun and Struthers reunited and after a few months, were living together in Sydney. Dragun had difficulty adjusting to the new city and being so far from family. She started working with a clinical psychologist there that she reportedly had a good rapport with, according to Dragun's mother.&lt;ref name=burden/&gt;

Around August or September 2007, Dragun's symptoms worsened and her psychologist recommended that Dragun consult a psychiatrist about adjusting her medication.&lt;ref name=burden/&gt; In October 2007, her new psychiatrist had initiated a cross-taper to change Dragun from the SNRI to a different brand of SSRI,&lt;ref name=burden/&gt;&lt;ref name=perfect/&gt; a change which can take up to six weeks to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=No warning of newsreader's anguish|first=Kate|last=Benson|date=5 November 2007|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/no-warning-of-newsreaders-anguish/2007/11/04/1194117883122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragun initially told her mother that she was optimistic about the switch, but after less than three weeks, she told her mother over the phone that she was having thoughts of suicide and that she felt "worthless." Dragun died by suicide a few days later.&lt;ref name=AusStory/&gt;&lt;ref name=burden/&gt;

==Suicide==
On 2 November 2007, at age 29, Dragun died by suicide near [[The Gap (Sydney)|The Gap]] in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs.&lt;ref name=AusStory/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite news |title=Fiance's tribute to Charmaine Dragun |work=The Sunday Times |url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22693062-2761,00.html |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=5 November 2009 |first1= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515144127/http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0%2C21598%2C22693062-2761%2C00.html |archivedate=15 May 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to news reports, Dragun sat near the gully for around two hours, something she had done several times in the weeks leading up to her suicide,&lt;ref name=burden/&gt; and sent a farewell text message to Struthers before jumping to her death.&lt;ref name=AusStory/&gt;&lt;ref name=burden/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribute/&gt; Witnesses who had seen someone sitting near the popular suicide spot had contacted the police, but Dragun was dead by the time officers arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Newsreader suicide at odds with social veneer|first=Louise|last=Hall|date=4 November 2007|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/11/03/1193619205917.html|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral was held ten days later at All Saints Church in [[Greenwood, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=funeral&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/hundreds-pay-tribute-to-charmaine/2007/11/12/1194766577942.html|title=Hundreds pay tribute to Charmaine|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2010, an official inquest into the medical support surrounding Dragun at the time of her death was held by the Coroner's Court in [[Glebe, New South Wales]], a suburb of Sydney. The deputy state coroner stated that the ease of access to the Gap had been a causal factor. He also speculated that Dragun may have been misdiagnosed with depression, but according to ''The Australian'', he also said that her medication did not "put [suicidal] ideas into her head or cause her to behave in an irrational way and with no control over her actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide of newsreader Charmaine Dragun could have been prevented, says coroner|date=15 October 2010|newspaper=The Australian|author=AAP|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/suicide-of-newsreader-charmaine-dragun-could-have-been-prevented-says-coroner/story-e6frg6nf-1225939139998|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ethnic groups in China include the related [[Hui people]] or "Chinese Muslims", the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] and [[Miao people|Miao]], who make up the five largest ethnic minorities in mainland China with populations exceeding 10 million. In addition, the [[Yi people|Yi]], [[Tujia people|Tujia]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and [[Mongols in China|Mongols]] each number populations between six and nine million.

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, many of whom live in the [[special administrative region]]s of the country. However, there exists several smaller [[Unrecognized ethnic groups in China|ethnicities who are "unrecognized" or subsumed]] as part another ethnic group. The [[Republic of China]] (ROC or commonly [[Taiwan]]) officially recognizes 14 tribes of [[Taiwanese aborigines]], who together with unrecognized tribes comprise about 2% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copper|first=John F.|title=Historical Dictionary of Taiwan (Republic of China)|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-4307-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]] the term "Chinese people" (Chinese: 中國之人 ''Zhōngguó zhī rén''; Manchu: ''Dulimbai gurun i niyalma'') was used by the Qing government to refer to all subjects of the empire, including Han, Manchu, and Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao |first=Gang |year=2006 |title=Reinventing China: Imperial Qing ideology and the rise of Modern Chinese national identity in the early twentieth century |url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf |journal=Modern China |publisher=Sage |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=3–30 |doi=10.1177/0097700405282349 |access-date=29 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Zhonghua minzu]]'' ({{zh|t=中華民族|s=中华民族|p=Zhōnghuá Mínzú}}), the "Chinese nation", is a supra-ethnic concept which includes all 56 ethnic groups living in China that are officially recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China. It includes established ethnic groups who have lived within the borders of China since at least the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatraveldepot.com/C247-Chinese-nationality |title=Brief Introduction Chinese nationality |website=Chinatraveldepot.com|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''zhonghua minzu'' was used during the Republic of China from 1911–1949 to refer to a subset of [[Five Races Under One Union|five ethnic groups]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millward|first=James A.|title=Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13924-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''zhongguo renmin'' ({{zh|中国人民}}), "Chinese people", was the government's preferred term during the life of [[Mao Zedong]]; ''zhonghua minzu'' is more common in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenner|first=W.J.F.|editor=Alan Lawrance|title=China Since 1919: Revolution and Reform: a Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWc9Ia7TcaMC&amp;pg=PA252|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-25141-9|pages=252–255|chapter=Race and history in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationality, citizenship and residence ==
The [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China]] regulates [[nationality]] within the PRC. A person obtains nationality either by birth when at least one parent is of Chinese nationality or by [[naturalization]]. All people holding nationality of the People's Republic of China are [[citizen]]s of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China (Article 33) |website=People's Daily Online |date=May 2, 1982|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Resident Identity Card]] is the official form of identification for residents of the People's Republic of China.

Within the People's Republic of China, a [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] or [[Macao Special Administrative Region passport]] may be issued to permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, respectively.

The [[Nationality law of the Republic of China]] regulates nationality within the Republic of China (Taiwan). A person obtains nationality either by birth or by naturalization. A person with at least one parent who is a national of the Republic of China, or born in the ROC to stateless parents qualifies for nationality by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0030001 |title=Nationality Act |website=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of the Republic of China|date=2006-01-27|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Identification Card (Republic of China)|National Identification Card]] is an identity document issued to people who have [[Hukou system|household registration]] in [[Taiwan]]. The [[Resident Certificate]] is an identification card issued to residents of the Republic of China who do not hold a National Identification Card.

The relationship between Taiwanese nationality and Chinese nationality is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/showactsregu.asp?id=3 |title=Nationality Act |work=National Immigration Agency, immigration.gov.tw |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192912/http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/showactsregu.asp?id=3 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overseas Chinese ==
[[Overseas Chinese]] refers to people of Chinese ethnicity or national heritage who live outside the People's Republic of China or Taiwan as the result of the continuing [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barabantseva|first=Elena|title=Overseas Chinese, Ethnic Minorities and Nationalism: De-Centering China|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-92736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with one or more Chinese ancestors may consider themselves overseas Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Yoon Jung|title=A Matter of Honour: Being Chinese in South Africa|year=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3553-2|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such people vary widely in terms of [[cultural assimilation]]. In some areas throughout the world [[ethnic enclave]]s known as [[Chinatown]]s are home to populations of Chinese ancestry.

In [[Southeast Asia]], Chinese people call themselves 華人 (''Huárén''), which is distinguished from (中國人) (''Zhōngguórén'') or the citizens of the [[People's Republic of China]] or the [[Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeson|first=Mark|title=Contemporary Southeast Asia|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-06880-4|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially so in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia.  The term ''Zhongguoren'' has a more political or ideological aspect in its use; while many in China may use ''Zhongguoren'' to mean the Chinese ethnicity, some in Taiwan would refuse to be called ''Zhongguoren''.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vouLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Language, Politics and Identity in Taiwan: Naming China |authors= Hui-Ching Chang, Richard Holt | pages= 162–164 |isbn=9781135046354|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Christoffel Joseph Brand''' (21 June 1797 [[Cape Town]] – 19 May 1875 Cape Town) was a South African jurist, politician, statesman and first Speaker of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Cape Colony]].

==Early life and education==
Christoffel Brand was born in 1797, during the twilight years of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch Cape Colony]]. Brand came from a long line of Dutch colonial administrators: both his father and grandfather ([[Christoffel Brand (Simon's Town)|Christoffel Brand]]) had been officials with the Dutch East India Company.&lt;ref name=Manners&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Robert|title=Status and Respectability in the Cape Colony, 1750–1870: A Tragedy of Manners|date=1999|pages=47–58|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0521621229}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the godson of [[Joseph Banks]], the noted British naturalist, whom his grandfather had worked with.&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt;

After receiving his initial education in Cape Town, Brand attended the [[University of Leiden]] from 1815,&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt; where he obtained a doctorate in law in 1820 with a dissertation on the relationship that colonies have to the mother country – ''Dissertatio politico-juridica de jure coloniarum''. He also earned a doctorate of letters with a thesis ''Quaestiones in Socratis sententiam de Deo''.

==Career==
He returned to South Africa and in 1821 established a law practice in Cape Town, before beginning to take an active interest in politics.&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt; He was one of the founders of the ''Zuid-Afrikaansch Athenaeum'' (South Africa's first university for Dutch-speaking students) in 1828, and was one of the first advocates in the Supreme Court in 1829. A founder member of the newspaper ''[[De Zuid-Afrikaan]]'', he was also its editor and championed the Dutch language in his editorials. Brand was bitterly disillusioned by the manner in which he perceived the British government to have marginalized the [[Cape Dutch]] community, treating them on an unequal basis with British colonists.&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt;

Together with [[John Fairbairn (educator)|John Fairbairn]], he campaigned for representative government and supported the Anti-Convict Movement. Together with F.W. Reitz, Sr. (father of State President [[Francis William Reitz]] of the [[Orange Free State]]), Fairbairn and [[Andries Stockenström|Stockenström]], he agitated for an elected Legislative Assembly. When representative government was finally introduced, Brand became the first Speaker of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape House of Assembly]] – a position he held for 20 years. He was knighted in 1860.

He was also a prominent supporter of the movement for [[responsible government]], and became the first Speaker of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape parliament]] under this new system, when it was instituted by the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno Ministry]] in 1872.&lt;ref name="ebooksread"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/ralph-kilpin/the-old-cape-house-being-pages-from-the-history-of-a-legislative-assembly-ala/page-7-the-old-cape-house-being-pages-from-the-history-of-a-legislative-assembly-ala.shtml|author=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander Zhulin|website=ebooksread.com|title=Read the eBook The old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly by Ralph Kilpin online for free (page 7 of 12)|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Christoffel was a [[Freemasonry in South Africa |South African Freemason]] and Deputy Grand Master National of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands (''Het Groot Oosten der Nederlanden'') in South Africa from 1847 to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[http://databases.tanap.net/ead/html/CapeTown_5.4.6/pdf/CapeTown_5.4.6.pdf Inventory of the Archives of the Secretary, Lodge De Goede Hoop, Cape Town, 1772–1963 (inventory 5/4/6)] in the [http://databases.tanap.net TANAP Collection].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[Image:CBrand A1025.jpg|left|thumb|Sir Christoffel Brand, 1860s–1870s]]
Christoffel Brand was married to Catharina Fredrica Küchler. His son was [[Johannes Brand]] who became 4th [[Presidents of the Orange Free State|State President of the Orange Free State]].&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt; His second name "Joseph" was after the naturalist Sir [[Joseph Banks]], a close friend of Christoffel's grandfather.

{{Joseph Smith}}
|}
[[Joseph Smith]] (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]&lt;!--*****NOTE TO EDITORS: Do not change this to read "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."--&gt; whose current followers include members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) and members of the [[Community of Christ]]. The '''early life of Joseph Smith''' covers his life from his birth to the end of 1827.

Smith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]], the fifth of eleven children born to [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]] and [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. By 1817, Smith's family had moved to the "[[burned-over district]]" of western New York, an area repeatedly swept by religious revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith family members held divergent views about organized religion, believed in visions and prophecies, and engaged in certain [[folk religion|folk religious]] practices typical of the era. Smith briefly investigated [[Methodism]], but he was generally disillusioned with the churches of his day.

Around 1820 Smith is said to have experienced a [[theophany]], now known as his [[First Vision]] among adherents. Around this time he, along with other male members of his family, was hired to assist in searching for buried treasure. In 1823, Smith said an angel directed him to a nearby [[Cumorah|hill]] where he said was buried a book of [[golden plates]] containing a Christian history of ancient American civilizations. According to Smith, the angel prevented him from taking the plates in 1823, telling him to come back in exactly a year. Smith made annual visits to the hill over the next three years, reporting to his family that he had not yet been allowed to take the plates.

Meanwhile, during one of Smith's treasure hunting expeditions, he met and fell in love with [[Emma Smith]] from [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]], whom he married in 1827. Returning with Emma to the hill in 1827, Smith said the angel allowed him to take the plates but forbade him from showing them to anyone except those to whom the angel directed. As news of the plates spread, Smith's former treasure hunting associates sought to share in the proceeds, ransacking places they thought the plates were hidden. Intending to translate the plates himself, Smith moved to Harmony Township to live with his in-laws.

==Childhood==
Smith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]], the fifth of eleven children born to [[Joseph Smith Sr.]] and [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. Through modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives, it's likely that the Smith family were of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent originally. Smith carried the Y-DNA marker R-M222, a subclade of Haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] found almost entirely in people of Northwestern Irish descent today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700249298/DNA-shows-Joseph-Smith-was-Irish.html?pg=all|title=DNA shows Joseph Smith was Irish|last=Groote|first=Michael De|date=2008-08-08|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perego|first=Ugo A.|last2=Myres|first2=Natalie M.|last3=Woodward|first3=Scott R.|date=2005|title=Reconstructing the Y-Chromosome of Joseph Smith: Genealogical Applications|jstor=23289931|journal=Journal of Mormon History|volume=31|issue=2|pages=42–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smiths were a middling farm family, but suffered a fateful loss when Smith Sr., after speculating in [[ginseng]] and being cheated by a business associate, was financially ruined. After he sold the family farm to pay his debts, the Smiths "crossed the boundary dividing independent ownership from tenancy and day labor." In the next fourteen years, the Smiths moved seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}}. Two of the Smiths' children died in infancy. {{Harvtxt|Hill|1977|pp=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the moves and the financial woes, Lucy Smith remembered the period of Joseph Smith's early childhood as "perfectly comfortable both for food and raiment as well as that which is necessary to a respectable appearance in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then during the winter of 1812–1813, [[typhoid fever]] struck along the [[Connecticut Valley]], including the area around [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], where the Smiths had recently moved.  A number of family members fell ill, and Joseph experienced a common complication whereby typhoid bacteria [[Osteomyelitis|infected bone]], in Smith's case, the shin bone.  Lucy later claimed that she had refused to permit her son's leg to be amputated; in fact, the Smiths had chanced on one of New England's most respected physicians, [[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]], who "probably alone in American medicine at this time" advocated removal of the dead portion of the bone rather than [[amputation]] of the leg. After the typically horrific early nineteenth-century surgery without either anesthetic or antiseptic, Smith eventually recovered, though he used crutches for several years and had a slight limp for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}};{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Donna|title=Joseph Smith: The First Mormon|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, N.Y.|isbn=0-385-00804-X|pages=35–36|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Smith family farm in Manchester.jpg|left|thumb|[[George Edward Anderson|George Edward Anderson's]] photograph of the [[Smith Family Farm]] in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]], c. 1907. (LDS Archives)]]
In 1814 the Smiths moved back across the [[Connecticut River]] to [[Norwich, Vermont]], where they suffered three seasons of crop failures, the last the result of the [[Year Without a Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Smith clan had already moved west to New York, and in 1817, Joseph Smith Sr. traveled alone to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], followed shortly by the rest of his family—although not before Lucy Smith was forced to settle with some last-minute creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=27–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Palmyra village, Smith Sr. and his oldest sons hired themselves out as common laborers, ran a "cake and beer shop," and peddled refreshments from a cart; Lucy painted cloth coverings for tables and stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=31}};{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=25–26}}. In 1818, the two Josephs and Hyrum Smith worked on a farm owned by one Jeremiah Hurlburt, but the relationship ended with each party suing the other.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, the family contracted to pay for a {{convert|100|acres|km2|1|adj=on}} farm just outside Palmyra in Manchester Township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=32–34}}. Manchester was part of [[Farmington, New York|Farmington]] until 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith family first built a log home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berge|1985}}. The log house was built just outside their property in the town of Palmyra.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1822, under the supervision of Joseph Smith's oldest brother [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], they began building a larger frame house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=53, 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvin died in November 1823, possibly as a result of being given [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]] for "[[bilious fever]]", and the house remained uncompleted for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Smith's death remains mysterious. Lucy thought it the result of a dose of [[Mercury(I) chloride]], or calomel, given for "bilious fever" after he ate green turnips. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=46}}. Alvin Smith may have died of [[appendicitis]], hastened by the laxative. [http://josephsmithpapers.org/person/alvin-smith Joseph Smith Papers].&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Joseph Smith Sr. may have partially abdicated family leadership to Alvin,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith Sr. confessed in 1834, "I have not always set that example before my family that I ought." Later, Joseph Smith Sr. told Hyrum he had "been out of the way through wine." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=42}} (noting that Smith's drinking was not excessive for the time and place). Vogel frankly calls Smith Sr.'s difficulty "low self-esteem and alcoholism."{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=xx}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1825, the Smiths were unable to make their mortgage payments. When their creditor foreclosed, the family persuaded a local [[Quaker]], Lemuel Durfee, to buy the farm and rent it to them.  Nevertheless, in 1829, the Smiths and five of their children moved back into the log house, with Hyrum Smith and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Smith had little formal schooling, but may have attended school briefly in Palmyra and received instruction in his home.&lt;ref&gt;Smith may have attended school briefly in Palmyra. He later wrote that he was "deprived of the bennifit of an education" and that he had been instructed only in reading, writing, and the ground rules of arithmetic. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=41–42}}; Smith also may have been educated at home by his father, who had taught school some winters to make ends meet. {{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Joseph worked on his family farm and perhaps took an occasional odd job or worked for nearby farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother described him as "much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of the children, but far more given to [[meditation]] and deep study." Lucy Smith also noted that though he never read through the [[Bible]] until he was at least eighteen, he was imaginative and could regale the family with "the most amusing recitals" of the life and religion of ancient Native Americans "with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=27}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=84–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was variously described as "remarkably quiet,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=73}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "taciturn," "proverbially good-natured," and "never known to laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|pp=16–17}}; {{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One acquaintance said Smith had "a jovial, easy, don't-care way about him," and he had an aptitude for debating moral and political issues in a local junior debating club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Turner|1852|p=214}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=37–38}}, and {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Fawn Brodie]] wrote, "He was a gregarious, cheerful, imaginative youth, born to leadership, but hampered by meager education and grinding poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious background==
Smith grew to maturity during the [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious excitement in the United States. New York west of the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains became known as the "[[Burned-over district]]" because it was "repeatedly singed by the fires of revival that swept through the region in the early years of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Randall Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism'' (Waco: Baylor University Press, 2004), 112; Michael McClymond, ed., ''Encyclopeida of Religious Revivals in America'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007), I, 63; {{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=7}}. The heightened religious interest increased membership in traditional denominations, but many new sects and [[communitarian]] experiments also sprang from the movement in upstate New York including the American [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]] of [[John Humphrey Noyes]]. {{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|pp=20–21}}; Whitney R. Cross, ''The Burned-over District: The Social and Intellectual History of Enthusiastic Religion in Western New York, 1800-1850'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; Major multi-denominational religious revivals occurred in the Palmyra area in both 1816-17 (when the Smiths were in the process of migrating from Vermont) and in 1824-25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36–37, 46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Small denominational revivals and camp meetings occurred during the intervals.&lt;ref name="Backman 1969 309"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Backman|1969|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton 1991 255"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Norton|1991|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn 2006"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|thumb|left|An [[engraving]] of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[camp meeting]] in 1819 (Library of Congress)]]
Joseph Smith's ancestors had an eclectic variety of religious views and affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Joseph Smith's paternal grandfather, Asael, was a [[Universalist]] who opposed evangelical religion. According to Lucy Smith, Asael once came to Joseph Smith Sr.'s door after he had attended a Methodist meeting with Lucy and "threw [[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine's]] ''[[The Age of Reason|Age of Reason]]'' into the {{sic|?|the}} house and angrily bade him read that until he believed it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in 1811 Smith's maternal grandfather, [[Solomon Mack]], self-published a book describing a series of heavenly visions and voices he said had led to his conversion to Christianity at the age of seventy-six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=25–26}};{{Harvtxt|Mack|1811|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's parents also experienced visions. Before Joseph was born, his mother [[Lucy Mack Smith|Lucy]], prayed in a grove about [[Joseph Smith Sr.|her husband's]] refusal to attend church and later said she had had a dream-vision, which she interpreted as a [[prophecy]] that Joseph Sr. would later accept the "pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=23}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lucy, [[Joseph Smith Sr.]] also had seven visions between 1811 and 1819, coming at a time when he was "much excited upon the subject of religion." These visions confirmed in his mind the correctness of his refusal to join any organized church and led him to believe that he would be directed in the proper path toward [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=56, 58–59, 70–72, 74}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy's account, recorded thirty years after the period in which the visions are said to have occurred, suggests "a tendency to make her husband the predecessor of her son" by echoing passages in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like perhaps thousands of contemporary Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=50}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=25–30}}: "Contemporary diaries, newspaper reports, and later town histories indicate that thousands of early Americans participated in treasure-digging nationwide.  A smaller number actually took the lead in practicing various forms of divination and magic." (25)&lt;/ref&gt; the Smith family practiced various forms of folk magic such as using divining rods and seer stones to search for buried treasure. Four witnesses reported that the Smiths used divining rods in the Palmyra area, and sometime between Joseph Smith's eleventh and thirteenth years, he began "following his father's example in using a divining rod."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Magical parchments handed down in the Hyrum Smith family may have belonged to Joseph Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Mack Smith noted in her memoirs that while family members were "trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or sooth saying," they did not neglect manual labor, "but whilst we worked with our hands we endeavored to remember the service of &amp; the welfare of our souls."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's reputation among his Palmyra neighbors was that of a "nondescript farm boy" who was "lazy and superstitious," and townspeople viewed his family as "treasure-seekers, not eager Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=35–36}};{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=16}} ("his reputation before he organized his church was not that of an adolescent mystic brooding over visions, but of a likable ne'er-do-well who was notorious for tall tales and necromantic arts and who spent his leisure leading a band of idler in digging for buried treasure."); {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=143}} ("In the neighbors' reports, he was a plain rural visionary with little talent save a gift for seeing in a stone.")&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Smith was reared in a family that believed in prophecy and visions, was skeptical of organized religion, and was interested in both folk magic and new religious ideas.&lt;ref name="Bushman3637"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36&amp;ndash;37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said he had become concerned about religion "at about the age of twelve years," although later he seems to have wondered whether "a Supreme being did exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith apparently attended the [[Presbyterian]] Sunday school as a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Matzko|2007|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later as an adolescent, he displayed interest in Methodism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Smith's acquaintances said that Smith had caught "a spark of Methodism" at camp meetings "away down in the woods, on the Vienna road."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even reportedly spoke during some of these meetings, and the acquaintance described Smith as a "very passable exhorter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, at some point after 1822,&lt;ref&gt;Orsamus Turner who reported Smith "catching a spark of Methodism on the Vienna road" visited Palmyra only between 1822 and 1828.{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith withdrew from organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=38}}; {{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his mother, Smith claimed, "I can take my Bible, and go into the woods, and learn more in two hours, than you can learn at meeting in two years, if you should go all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=90}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Smith seems to have been significantly influenced by the interdenominational revival of 1824-25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=61}}"The fact that Joseph twice lifted the revival out of its historical context, pushing it back to 1823, then to 1820, indicates that he considered the revival of 1824-25 important to his genesis as a prophet.  It seems evident that his quest for the true church began in 1824-25, not in 1820."&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Vision==
{{main|First Vision}}
Like his father, the younger Smith reportedly had his own set of visions, the first of which occurred in the early 1820s when Smith was in his early teens and is called by Latter Day Saints the First Vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=35, 38}} (placing the First Vision around 1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The first description of this event was not published until 1832,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said the event occurred in 1821;&lt;ref name="Smith 1832 3"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, most accounts date the event to the year 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith Jr. dated the vision to when he was "a little over fourteen years of age" {{Harvtxt|Roberts |1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 7}}, which would have been 1820. However, Smith's brother [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William]] stated it happened when Joseph was eighteen years old, when William himself would have been twelve {{Harvtxt|Smith|1883|p=6}}. For a discussion of these dating issues, see [[First Vision]].&lt;/ref&gt; The First Vision was a [[theophany]] (a personal and direct communication from [[God]]). The details of the theophany have varied as the story was retold throughout Smith's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=24}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to accounts by Joseph and his brother, [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William]], the First Vision was prompted in part by a reading of [[Epistle of James|James]] 1:5, which in the [[King James Version]] reads, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him"; William suggested that Smith "ask of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}(According to William, a minister had referred Smith to the scripture and suggested that he "ask of God");{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; William also suggested that much of the "religious excitement" in the area was caused by the Rev. George Lane, a "great revival preacher".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1883|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane is never recorded as having visited Palmyra until 1824, although he visited nearby [[Phelps (town), New York|Vienna]] in 1819 for a large Methodist conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Porter|1969|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph and his family could have traveled to sell cake and beer at this event, as they did other events in the Palmyra vicinity, but this is pure speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Anderson|1969|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|thumb|[[Stained glass]] depiction of Smith's [[First Vision]], completed in 1913 by an unknown artist (Museum of Church History and Art)]]
The exact details of the First Vision vary somewhat depending upon who is recounting the story and when. Smith's first account in 1832 dated the vision to 1821 and stated that he saw "a piller [sic] of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day", and that "the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee".&lt;ref name="Smith 1832 3"/&gt; Whether Smith regarded this event as a ''vision'' or as an actual ''visitation'' by a physical being has been debated, because a [[missionary]] [[Tract (literature)|tract]] published for Smith's church in 1840 stated that after Smith saw the light, "his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pratt|1840|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an account Smith dictated in 1838 for inclusion in the official church history, he described the First Vision as an appearance of two divine personages sometime during the spring of 1820:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me…When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other, 'This is my Beloved Son. Hear Him!'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is unclear who, if anyone, Smith told about his vision prior to his reported discovery of the golden plates in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;"At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision."{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith, he told his mother at the time that he had "learned for [him]self that Presbyterianism is not true";&lt;ref name="Roberts 1902 loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, mention of this conversation is omitted from Lucy's own history,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph never stated that he described the details of the vision to his family in 1820 or soon thereafter. He ''did'' say that he spoke about the vision with "one of the Methodist preachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=40}} "Joseph did tell a Methodist preacher about the First Vision. Newly reborn people customarily talked over their experiences with a clergyman to test the validity of the conversion."&lt;/ref&gt; who was very active in the before-mentioned religious excitement".&lt;ref name="Roberts 1902 loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have presumed this to be the Rev. Lane, but there is no record of Lane visiting the Palmyra vicinity in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Matzko|2007|loc=p. 68}}. Dr. Matzko notes that "Oliver Cowdery claimed that Smith had been 'awakened' during a sermon by the Methodist minister George Lane."&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph's brother William was apparently unaware of any visions until 1823,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1883|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although he would have only been nine years old in 1820.

Smith stated that the retelling of his vision story "excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase".&lt;ref name="Roberts 1902 loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6"/&gt; Tales of visions and [[theophany|theophanies]], however, were not unusual at the time, though the clergy of many organized religions often resisted the stories.&lt;ref name="Quinn 1998"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=40&amp;ndash;41}} "The preacher reacted quickly and negatively, not because of the strangeness of the story but because of its familiarity. Subjects of revivals all to often claimed to have seen visions."&lt;/ref&gt; Early prejudice against Smith may have taken place by clergy, but there is no contemporary record of this.{{original research inline|date=May 2015}} The bulk of Smith's persecution seems to have arisen among laity, and not because of his First Vision, but because of his later assertion to have discovered the golden plates in a hill near his home;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} the statement was widely publicized and ridiculed in local newspapers beginning around 1827.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Years later, one non-Mormon neighbor summed up views of Smith and his family by their Palmyra neighbors by saying, "To tell the truth, there was something about him they could not understand; some way he knew more than they did, and it made them mad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cobb|1881}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treasure hunting ==
{{see also|Joseph Smith and the criminal justice system}}
From about 1819, Smith regularly practiced [[scrying]], a form of [[divination]] in which a "seer" looked into a [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] to receive supernatural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;"When Joseph Smith first began to use his seer or "peep" stone he employed the folklore familiar to rural America. The details of his rituals and incantations are unimportant because they were commonplace, and Joseph gave up money-digging when he was twenty-one for a profession far more exciting." {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith usually practiced crystal gazing by putting a stone at the bottom of a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, then divining information from the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}; {{Harvtxt|Mather|1880|p=199}}. According to an account of an interview with Joseph Smith Sr., the 14-year-old Joseph borrowed a stone from a person working as a local crystal gazer {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|pp=305–306}} which reportedly showed him the underground location of another stone near his home, which he located at a depth of about twenty-two feet.  According to another story, in either 1819 {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=19}} or 1822 {{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=240}}, while the older Smith males were digging a well for a Palmyra neighbor, they found an unusual stone {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}}, described as either white and glassy and shaped like a child's foot or "chocolate-colored, somewhat egg-shaped." {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1930|loc=1:129}}. Smith then used this stone as a seer stone.{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and his father achieved "something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1825, Josiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]], [[Chenango County, New York]], who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] with another seer, traveled to Manchester to hire Smith "on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith agreed to take the job of assisting Stowell and Hale, and he and his father worked with the Stowell-Hale team for approximately one month, attempting, according to their contract, to locate "a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Wade|1880}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith boarded with an [[Isaac Hale]] (a relative of William Hale), and fell in love with Isaac Hale's daughter [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]], a schoolteacher he would later marry in 1827. Isaac Hale, however, disapproved of their relationship and of Smith in general. According to an unsupported account by Hale, Smith attempted to locate the mine by burying his face in a hat containing the [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]]; however, as the [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunter]]s got close to their objective, Smith said that an enchantment became so strong that Smith could no longer see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|pp=262–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failed project disbanded on November 17, 1825;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Smith continued to work for Stowell on other matters until 1826.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:EmmaSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|Emma Hale Smith]]
In 1826 Smith was arrested and brought to court in [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]], on the complaint of Stowell's nephew who accused Smith of being "a disorderly person and an imposter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Court records show that Smith, identified as "The Glass Looker," stood before the court on March 20, 1826, on a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] for an unspecified [[misdemeanor]] charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1972|p=2}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the judge issued a ''[[mittimus]]'' for Smith to be held, either during or after the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Hill 1972 5"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1972|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Smith's associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] later stated that Smith was "honorably acquitted,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the result of the proceeding is unclear, with some claiming he was found guilty, others claiming he was "condemned" but "designedly allowed to escape," and yet others (including the trial note taker) claiming he was "discharged" for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="Hill 1972 5"/&gt;

By November 1826, Josiah Stowell could no longer afford to continue searching for buried treasure; Smith traveled to [[Colesville, New York]], for a few months to work for [[Joseph Knight Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Jessee|1984|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Stowell's friends. There are reports that Smith directed further excavations on Knight's property and at other locations around Colesville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|1994|pp=227, 229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith later commented on his working as a treasure hunter: "'Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?'  Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1976|p=120}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=20&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Because Smith had been unable to gain Isaac Hale's approval, he and [[Emma Hale Smith]] [[elope]]d to [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]] on January 18, 1827, after which Joseph and Emma went to live with Smith's parents in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moroni and the golden plates==
{{main|Golden plates|Angel Moroni}}
While Smith was working as a treasure hunter, he was also frequently occupied with another more religious matter: acquiring a set of golden plates he said were deposited, along with other artifacts, in a [[Cumorah|prominent hill]] near his home.

In Smith's own account dated 1838, he stated that an [[angel]] visited him on the night of September 21, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;The date of Moroni's first visits is generally taken as 1823. However, Smith's 1832 history (his first written account) dates the visit of [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]] to September 22, 1822, a year earlier, although he also states he was seventeen years old {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}, and his seventeenth birthday would not have been until December 23, 1822. Further possible ambiguity arises because in an 1830 interview, [[Joseph Smith Sr.]] reportedly claimed that he was not told about Moroni's visit until a year after the fact, during which Smith Jr. had been collecting items in preparation for receiving the plates {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}. [[Lucy Mack Smith]] asserts that Smith Sr. was told about Moroni's visit in 1823, the day after Moroni's first visit ({{Harvtxt|Smith|1838|p=7}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=82}}); however, Lucy's history also indicates that after the appearance of the angel, Joseph had made two annual visits to the hill [[Cumorah]] before the 1823 death of her son Alvin {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=85}}, which Lucy incorrectly dated to 1824 {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the visit, Smith dictated the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]];&lt;ref&gt;As originally taken down in dictation and published, the story stated that the angel was [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]] {{Harv|Smith|1838–1840|p=4}}. Long after Smith's death, however, this reference to Nephi in the official history was changed to [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]] {{Harv|Roberts|1902}} to conform to Smith's other statements from as early as 1835 that refer to the latter {{Harv|Smith|1835|loc=sec. 50:2, p. 180}}. Generally, modern historians refer to this angel as ''Moroni''.&lt;/ref&gt; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.

He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness[sic] of the everlasting [[Gospel]] was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants; also that there were two stones in silver bows&amp;mdash;and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the [[Urim and Thummim]]&amp;mdash;deposited with the plates".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838|p=4}}. (Punctuation has been modernized.)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words ''[[Urim and Thummim]]'' derive from passages in the [[Old Testament]] which describe the use of "the Urim and the Thummim" as a means for [[divination]] by [[Israelite]] [[priest]]s (see, e.g., [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 28:30).

After the messenger departed, Smith said he had two more encounters with him that night and an additional one the next morning, after which he told [[Joseph Smith Sr.|his father]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon thereafter the rest of his family, who believed his story, but generally kept it within the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=83–84}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1883|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mormon Hill engraving (1841).gif|thumb|An 1841 engraving of [[Cumorah|"Mormon Hill"]] (looking south), where Smith said he found the golden plates on the west side, near the peak.]]
Thus, on September 22, 1823, a day listed in local [[almanac]]s as the [[autumn equinox]], Smith said that he went to a [[Cumorah|prominent hill]] near his home, and found the location of the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are varying accounts as to how Smith reportedly found the precise location of the golden plates. In 1838, Smith stated that this location was shown to him in a vision while he conversed with Moroni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conforms to an account by Smith's friend [[Joseph Knight Sr.]], though he refers to Smith's guide only as "the personage."&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a Palmyra resident Henry Harris, who said Smith told him he located the plates using his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In yet another account, the angel required Smith to follow a sequence of landmarks until he arrived at the correct location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plates, according to Smith, were inside a covered stone box. However, Smith stated he was unable to obtain the plates at his first visit. According to an account by [[Willard Chase]], the angel gave Smith a strict set of "commandments" which he was to follow in order to obtain the plates. Among these requirements, according to Chase, was that Smith must approach the site "dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's close friend [[Joseph Knight Sr.]] corroborates the requirement that Smith was to "take the Book and go right away".&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"/&gt; According to [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith's mother]], the angel forbade him to put the plates on the ground until they were under lock and key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=85–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, according to a retelling of an account by Smith Sr., allowed to put down the plates on a napkin he was to bring with him for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870| pp=305–306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Smith arrived at the place where the plates were supposed to be, he reportedly took the plates from the stone box they were in and set them down on the ground nearby, looking to see if there were other items in the box that would "be of some pecuniary advantage to him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When he turned around, however, the plates were said to have disappeared into the box, which was then closed.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"/&gt; When Smith attempted to get the plates back out of the box, the angel hurled him back to the ground with a violent force (''id.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=86}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After three failed attempts to retrieve the plates, the angel told him that he could not have them then, because he "had been tempted of the advisary {{sic}} and saught {{sic}} the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have".&lt;ref name="Smith 1832 3" /&gt;

Thus, Smith said the angel directed him to return the next year on September 22, 1824, with the "right person", whom the angel reportedly said was his brother Alvin.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"/&gt; However, Alvin died within a few months, and when Smith returned to the hill in 1824, he did not return with the plates. Once again, the angel reportedly told Smith that he must return the next year with the "right person", the identity of whom the angel would not say.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"/&gt; According to Smith's associate Willard Chase, Smith originally thought this person was to be [[Samuel Tyler Lawrence]], a "[[wikt:seer|seer]]" himself who worked in Smith's treasure-seeking company in Palmyra,&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 164"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore Smith reportedly took Lawrence to the hill in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At Lawrence's prompting, Smith reportedly ascertained through his [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]] that there was an additional item together with the plates in the box, which Smith later called the ''[[Urim and Thummim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=243}}. In addition to the [[Urim and Thummim]], Smith also reportedly discovered at some point that the box, or the ground nearby, contained several other artifacts, including the [[Liahona (Book of Mormon)|Liahona]], the [[sword of Laban]] {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=306}}, the vessel in which the gold was melted, a rolling machine for gold plates, and three balls of gold as large as a fist {{Harv|Howe|1834|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lawrence was apparently not the "right person", because Smith did not obtain the plates in his 1825 visit.

Later, Smith reportedly determined by looking into his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] that the "right person" was [[Emma Hale Smith]], his future wife.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 2"/&gt; There is no specific record of Smith seeing the angel in 1826, however, after Joseph and Emma were married on January 18, 1827, Smith returned to Manchester, and as he passed by [[Cumorah]], he said he was chastised by the angel for not being "engaged enough in the work of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly told that the next annual meeting was his last chance to get the plates and the [[Urim and Thummim]].&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 3"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|thumb|An 1893 engraving of Joseph Smith receiving the [[golden plates]] and the [[Urim and Thummim]] from [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]].]]
Just days prior to the day Smith said he was to meet with the angel on September 22, 1827, Smith's treasure-seeking associate, Josiah Stowell, and [[Joseph Knight Sr.]] arranged to be in Palmyra for the attempt to retrieve the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kight|1833|p=3}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Smith was concerned that Samuel Lawrence, his earlier confidant, might interfere, Smith sent [[Joseph Smith Sr.|his father]] to spy on Lawrence's house the night of September 21 until dark.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 3"/&gt; Late that night, Smith took the horse and carriage of [[Joseph Knight Sr.]] to [[Cumorah]] with his wife Emma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving Emma in the wagon, where she knelt in prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1853|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he reportedly walked to the site of the golden plates, retrieved them, and hid them in a fallen tree-top on or near the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1976|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also reportedly retrieved the Urim and Thummim, which he showed to [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]] the next morning.&lt;ref name="Smith 1853 101"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Knight, Smith was more fascinated by this artifact than he was the plates.&lt;ref name="Knight 1833 3"/&gt;

Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby [[Macedon (town), New York|Macedon]] to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates.&lt;ref name="Smith 1853 101"/&gt; By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith was successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their cut of the profits from what they saw as part of their joint venture.&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 167"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith Sr. determined that a group of ten&amp;ndash;twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from sixty miles away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Emma heard of this, she went to Macedon and informed Smith Jr., who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe, but nevertheless he hurriedly traveled home by horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=103–104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once home in Palmyra, he then walked to [[Cumorah]] and said he removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked back home with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm, suffering a dislocated thumb as he fended off attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=104–06}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith, the plates "had the appearance of gold", and were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings, in Ancient Egyptian characters and bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates directly. Some people, however, were allowed to heft them or feel them through a cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|169–70}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he reportedly kept the plates in a chest under the hearth in his parents' home.&lt;ref name="Smith 1853"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing it might be discovered, however, Smith hid the chest under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby.&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 167"/&gt; Later, he said he took the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax, not long before the location of the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find that location by looking in her [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=107–09}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Harmony Township, Pennsylvania==
Joseph Smith's intention was to keep the box reportedly containing the golden plates safe from his Palmyra neighbors while he dictated a translation of the book's reputed contents, which he would then publish. To do so, however, he needed an investment of money, and at the time he was penniless.&lt;ref name="Smith 1853"/&gt; Therefore, Smith sent [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the home of [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], a local landowner said at the time to be worth about $8,000 to $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris had apparently been a close confidant of the Smith family since at least 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|pp=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he may have heard about Smith's attempts to obtain the plates from the angel even earlier from Smith Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a believer in Smith's powers with his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 164"/&gt; When Lucy visited Harris, he had heard about Smith's report to have found golden plates through the [[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]] in Palmyra, and was interested in finding out more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=167–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, at Lucy Smith's request, Harris went to the Smith home, heard the story from Smith, and hefted a glass box that Smith said contained the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=168–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith convinced Harris that he had the plates, and that the angel had told him to "quit the company of the money-diggers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced, Harris immediately gave Smith $50, and committed to sponsor the translation of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The money provided by Harris was enough to pay all of Smith's debts in Palmyra, and for him to travel with Emma and all of their belongings to [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]], where they would be able to avoid the public commotion in Palmyra over the plates.&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 170"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in early October 1827, they moved to Harmony, with the glass box reportedly holding the plates hidden during the trip in a barrel of beans.&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 170"/&gt;

'''Einar Hjörleifsson Kvaran''' (6 December 1859 in [[Vallanes]], Iceland as '''Einar Hjörleifsson''' &amp;ndash; 21 May 1938 in [[Reykjavík]]) was an Icelandic [[editor]], [[novelist]], [[poet]], [[playwright]] and prominent [[spiritualist]].

==Life==
Einar Kvaran was the son of Rev. Hjörleifur Einarsson and Guðlaug Eyjólfsdóttir. His name was originally Einar Hjorleifsson but he adopted the family name Kvaran in 1916 along with his brothers Sigurdur and Trygvi and the sons of his deceased brother Joseph. (The name is taken from ''[[Laxdæla saga]]''. In 1913, the [[Althing]] passed a law, since rescinded, which permitted Icelanders to adopt [[family name]]s. Einar Hjörleifsson was on a committee that proposed to allow certain categories of names, including those with ancient origins.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Swatos and Loftur Reimar Gissurarson, ''Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 1997, {{ISBN|1-56000-273-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 77, note 23].&lt;/ref&gt;)

Einar graduated in 1881 from the College of Iceland, known as the Latin School.&lt;ref name=SE262&gt;[[Stefán Einarsson]], ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, OCLC 264046441, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beck, ed., ''Icelandic Lyrics: Originals and Translations'', Thorhallur Bjarnarson, Reykjavík: Bjarnarson, 1930, OCLC 2067368, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in [[economics]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1882, he was one of four students to publish the single issue of the literary periodical ''Verðandi'', which introduced to Iceland the [[Modern Breakthrough]] expounded by [[Georg Brandes]].&lt;ref&gt;Þorleifur Hauksson, "Nordic language history and literary history IV: Iceland" in ''The Nordic Languages: an International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages'', ed. Oskar Bandle ''et al''., Volume 1 Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2002, {{ISBN|3110148765}}, 470-82, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V4KKN_oByKMC&amp;pg=PA476&amp;dq=Einar+Kvaran&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JJANTKikPIncNbqxuLYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Einar%20Kvaran&amp;f=false pp. 475&amp;ndash;76].&lt;/ref&gt; Einar was one of the pioneers of realism in Icelandic writing; his stories and novels represent a break with past admiration of the sagas: they are written in educated contemporary language and deal with ordinary people and problems.&lt;ref&gt;Þorleifur Hauksson, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885 to 1895 Einar emigrated to [[New Iceland|Icelandic Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature'', ed. Jean Albert Bédé, William Benbow Edgerton, 2nd ed. New York: Columbia, 1980, {{ISBN|0-231-03717-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JLL32RzrkC&amp;pg=PA380 p. 454].&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived in [[Winnipeg]] and helped found two Icelandic-language weekly publications, ''Heimskringla'' ("Globe") and ''Lögberg'' ("Tribune").&lt;ref name=SE262/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neijmann321&gt;Daisy L. Neijmann, ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', Histories of Scandinavian Literature 5, Lincoln: University of Nebraska with the American-Scandinavian Foundation, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8032-3346-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_3jxYe5nTMC&amp;pg=PA322 p. 321].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 57].&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Iceland he was a journalist and editor in both Reykjavík and [[Akureyri]]; he participated in the struggle for independence and also wrote about education, [[wikt:temperance|temperance]] and theatre.&lt;ref name=SE262/&gt; He was co-editor of ''Ísafold'', then Iceland's leading newspaper, and editor of ''Fjallkonan''.&lt;ref name=Spiritualism58&gt;Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; He edited ''Skírnir'', the journal of the [[Icelandic Literary Society]], from 1892 to 1895 and from 1908 to 1909. 

Einar wrote numerous short stories, novels, plays, and a volume of early poems. His breakthrough work was the story "Vonir" ("Hopes"), which he wrote in 1890 while in Canada and which deals with the emigrant experience.&lt;ref name=Neijmann321/&gt; In 1906 the Government of Iceland granted him a stipend to enable him to devote himself entirely to writing.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature'', p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- A poll taken in 1923 voted him the most popular writer in Iceland. - no evidence found of this, but rather of a rumor that he had been voted the Nobel Prize that year. --&gt;

Einar was also a prominent [[Spiritualist]], author of the first positive assessment of spiritualism in Icelandic&lt;ref&gt;Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82].&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder and President of the Experimental Society which gave rise to the Icelandic Society for Psychical Research (''Sálarrannsóknarfélag Íslands''), of which he was the first president.&lt;ref&gt;Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 pp. 84&amp;ndash;85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Einar+Kvaran+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IsENTOS-GZWmNp31oaAF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=became%20its%20first%20president&amp;f=false 223].&lt;/ref&gt; He played a major part in the investigation and publicising of many Icelandic [[Mediumship|medium]]s, notably [[Indriði Indriðason]] and Hafstein Björnsson.&lt;ref&gt;Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 83]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 154], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 219]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=QLk0gqFi_1EC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 214]: "Einar Kvaran had sittings in his home with [Miss Björg Hafsteen], as with other mediums in this period [the early 1930s]".&lt;/ref&gt;  His later writings were dominated by spiritualism,&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JLL32RzrkC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=Einar+Kvaran+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0qYNTMfMOYHYNbC-wLUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=overriding%20interest%20in%20spiritualism&amp;f=false p. 380].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Stefán Einarsson, p. 263, beginning with the novel ''Sálin vaknar'' ("The Soul Awakens," 1916).&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the novel ''Sögur Rannveigar'' ("Rannveig's Tales", parts I and II 1919 and 1922),&lt;ref&gt;Neijmann,[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_3jxYe5nTMC&amp;pg=PA322 p. 323].&lt;/ref&gt; but also by Christian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Neijmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_3jxYe5nTMC&amp;pg=PA322 p. 322].&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced Icelanders to be less rigidly orthodox and to be less harsh in rearing their children.&lt;ref&gt;Neijmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_3jxYe5nTMC&amp;pg=PA322 p. 322], quoting Steingrímur J. Þorsteinsson.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1920s, there was a rumour that Kvaran was considered for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, but in response [[Sigurður Nordal]] disparaged him as overly focused on forgiveness and thus tolerant of things that should rather be opposed; in the spirit of Icelandic nationalism and contemporary interpretations of [[Nietzsche]], he considered the blood feud a better ethical model.&lt;ref&gt;Nijmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_3jxYe5nTMC&amp;pg=PA322 pp. 366&amp;ndash;67].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s [[Halldór Laxness]] criticised him more sharply yet for his spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Stefán Einarsson, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Einar was married twice. His first wife, Mathilde Petersen, was Danish; she died in Canada, and their two children both died in infancy. In 1888 he married Gíslína Gísladóttir. They had five children; the eldest, Sigurður, died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was 15.&lt;ref name=Spiritualism58/&gt;

'''Frank Lewis O'Bannon''' (January 30, 1930 – September 13, 2003) was an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Indiana|47th Governor]] of [[Indiana]] from 1997 until his death in 2003.

O'Bannon was a native of [[Corydon, Indiana]]. He attended [[Corydon Central High School]] and then [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], where he met his wife Judy. In Corydon he served as a practicing attorney and a newspaper publisher for ''The Corydon Democrat'' before his entrance into the political arena.

Originally elected to the state senate in 1969, O'Bannon worked his way up in leadership, becoming one of the body's most prominent members. He was briefly a candidate for Governor of Indiana in 1988, however, instead of facing a hotly competitive primary, O'Bannon dropped out of the race and accepted the position of running mate under [[Evan Bayh]]. The Bayh/O'Bannon ticket was successful, and O'Bannon served in the role as lieutenant governor for 8 years. In this position he served as President of the state senate, and directed the state's agriculture and commerce programs.

In 1996, O'Bannon made a bid for governor. He was initially considered a heavy underdog, but emerged a narrow victor over Indianapolis Mayor [[Stephen Goldsmith]]. He was heavily re-elected in 2000 over Congressman [[David M. McIntosh]]. As governor, O'Bannon was known for advocating for education-related issues and helped create the state's AMBER Alert System. He presided over a period of economic prosperity for the state in the 1990s and served as a term as Chairman of [[Midwestern Governors Association]].

In 2003, O'Bannon suffered a massive stroke in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], while attending a trade conference. He died days later and was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor [[Joe E. Kernan]]. Several memorials were dedicated to his memory and his wife still remains active in community and political issues.

==Background==
O'Bannon was a native of [[Corydon, Indiana]] (the first [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] of Indiana), where his family owned the ''Corydon Democrat'', the town's newspaper. He attended [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], where he played one season of basketball for the Hoosiers.  At IU, he was president of the Zeta Chapter of the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] Fraternity. He earned a B.A. in government in 1952, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1957 from the [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law|Indiana University School of Law – Bloomington]].

He also spent two years in the [[United States Air Force]]. While at IU, he met his wife, [[Judy O'Bannon|Judith Asmus]], and they married in 1958. Following law school, he opened a law office in Corydon, was chairman of the board of the family newspaper publishing firm (a position he held until the time of his death), and was a member of the board of the Corydon Savings and Loan.

==Politics before Governor==
First elected to the state senate in 1969-70 to a seat occupied by his father, Robert P. O'Bannon from 1950 to 1970, he was the primary sponsor of legislation reintroducing the [[death penalty]]. He rose to the rank of Senate Minority Leader among Democrats during his tenure in the legislative body. He served one two-year stint as chair of the Senate Finance Committee following a short-lived Democratic majority. He launched his first campaign for governor in May 1987 from Corydon, Indiana and initially faced off against then-Secretary of State [[Evan Bayh]] and Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily. O'Bannon abandoned his own bid for governor in January 1988 and joined forces with Bayh and won election as the [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana|46th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana]] in November 1988. His candidacy for lieutenant governor matched that of his grandfather, Lew M. O'Bannon, who was the 1924 Democratic nominee for the state's second highest office. As lieutenant governor, he presided as President of the State Senate, served as the state's Director of Commerce and Commissioner of Agriculture.

==Governor==
In 1996 O'Bannon was the Democratic nominee for governor. He overcame an early deficit in the polls against his Republican opponent, [[Indianapolis]] mayor [[Stephen Goldsmith]] and won in a close race, 52% to 47%. He was re-elected by a larger margin, 57% to 42%, in 2000 against second district [[U.S. House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[David M. McIntosh]].

During the boom years of the 1990s, when Indiana amassed a record $2&amp;nbsp;billion surplus, O'Bannon was able to cut taxes by $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, hire 500 more police officers in the state and win increased funding for schools and extended health insurance for poor families. He also signed landmark legislation creating the [[AMBER Alert]] program in Indiana, as well as legislation requiring drivers to slow or change lanes for emergency vehicles stopped along Hoosier roadways.

In the years of 1998 and 1999 O'Bannon served as the Chairman of [[Midwestern Governors Association]].  In 1999, O'Bannon created the Public Access Counselor Office by executive order after a statewide collaboration of seven newspapers found great obstacles in obtaining government information in Indiana.  In 1999, the Indiana General Assembly established it by statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/pac/2342.htm Indiana Public Access Counselor - What We Do]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he won an easy re-election bid under the theme of Keeping Indiana Moving in the Right Direction. His campaign featured memorable advertisements with O'Bannon reprising his basketball past by shooting a perfect jump shot.

After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] disaster and subsequent market downturn, Indiana lost 120,000 jobs, tax revenues dropped, and O'Bannon had to cut social services and other services in order to spare education. In 2001 he worked with the state legislature to formulate a major restructuring of the state tax system. His opponents blamed him for various problems arising in the second term, including a slow response by his environmental agency to a big [[fish kill]], and problems at two state centers for the [[developmentally disabled]].

His record, however, was firmly established as an educational leader for the state. He helped lead development of Indiana's first community college system, pushed for early-childhood learning opportunities, development of alternative high schools, and charter schools. His work as chair of the state's landmark Education Roundtable ensured that Indiana was one of only five states whose schools immediately qualified as meeting all standards set by the federal [[No Child Left Behind]] act upon enactment.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Statehouse 002.jpg|thumb|Statue of O'Bannon]]
[[File:Frank O'Bannon (grave).jpg|thumb|Frank O'Bannon's grave.]]
O'Bannon suffered a massive stroke on September 8, 2003, while he was in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], attending the U.S. Midwest–Japan trade conference. He was taken to [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] where he remained unconscious.

On September 10, 2003, the Speaker of the [[Indiana House of Representatives]], [[B. Patrick Bauer]] (D-South Bend), and the President Pro Tempore of the [[Indiana Senate]], [[Robert D. Garton]] (R-Columbus), sent official notice to the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] noting that Governor O'Bannon was incapacitated and unable to fulfill the duties of his office. As such, the court approved naming Lieutenant Governor [[Joe E. Kernan]] as acting governor.

Days later, O'Bannon's condition worsened and based on his [[living will]], his family decided to use no further means of support and care. He died on September 13, 2003, aged 73, leaving behind his wife Judy (Asmus), three children (Polly, Jennifer and Jonathan) and five grandchildren. O'Bannon [[organ donor|donated organs]] (after having signed legislation making organ donation easier in Indiana), including his cornea which helped an Illinois woman regain her sight. He was cremated and buried in the O'Bannon family plot at Cedar Hill Cemetery in his hometown of [[Corydon, Indiana]].

He was succeeded in office by Lieutenant Governor [[Joe E. Kernan]] of South Bend, who was sworn into office just hours after O'Bannon's death in an emotional ceremony.

O'Bannon is the subject of the 2006 biography ''Legacy of a Governor: The Life of Indiana's Frank O'Bannon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Legacy of a Governor: The Life of Indiana's Frank O'Bannon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Governor-Indianas-Frank-OBannon/dp/160008012X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1291396642&amp;sr=8-1 |title=Legacy of a Governor: The Life of Indiana's Frank O'Bannon (9781600080128): Andrew E. Stoner: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, written by former O'Bannon staffer Andrew E. Stoner, contains a foreword by his wife, Judy O'Bannon. The book was published by Rooftop Publishing, Inc. of Bloomington, Indiana.

In February 2006, a [[Frank O'Bannon (Ryden)|memorial bust of O'Bannon]] was placed outside the [[Indiana Statehouse]] Senate chambers.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite web | author=| date=June 16, 2004 | title=Commission to Recommend a State House Memorial for Governor O'Bannon| work=| publisher= Legislative Services Agency | url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/interim/committee/2004/committees/minutes/SHMB76G.pdf
|accessdate= November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frank O'Bannon Public Service Award is given annually by Ivy Tech Community College. The 2007 winner was former State Senator [[Wayne Townsend]] of [[Hartford City, Indiana|Hartford City]], the Democratic candidate for governor in 1984.

In June 2008 a memorial was created in honor of Frank O'Bannon next to the state's original capitol building in his hometown of Corydon. The memorial was built at a cost of $200,000, collected from private donations, and features a life-size statue of O'Bannon sitting on a park bench. Frank O'Bannon Elementary School located in Hammond, Indiana is named after him, as was a section of highway in southern Indiana. The O'Bannon Woods State Park in Harrison County is also named for the O'Bannon family.

Judy O'Bannon resides in her husband's hometown of Corydon, Indiana, and remains active in Corydon Democratic politics and in her husband's newspaper ''The Corydon Democrat''. She endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 2008 presidential race, and often toured with [[Bill Clinton]] throughout the state during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign. During the general election she backed [[Barack Obama]] for president. She was the vice chair for [[Jim Schellinger]]'s unsuccessful campaign for governor. She has hosted a statewide public television program, ''Communities Building Community.''&lt;ref&gt;http://media.wfyi.org/CommunitiesBuildingCommunity/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, she married Donald Willsey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2013/11/21/former-first-lady-judy-obannon-78-to-marry-/3664937/ Former First Lady Judy O'Bannon, 78, to marry (IndyStar article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick T. Melges''' (2 December 1935 &amp;ndash; 29 July 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[professor]] of [[psychiatry]] at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], notable for his interest in [[time]] and for his pioneering work on the role of distortions of time in various [[psychiatric disorder]]s.

== Career ==
Melges led research work at [[Stanford University]] in the 1970s on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] users. Melges and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Melges FT, [[Jared Tinklenberg|Tinklenberg JR]], Hollister LE, Gillespie HK|date=|year=1970|title=Marihuana and temporal disintegration|url=|journal=Science|volume=168|issue=3935|pages=1118–20|doi=10.1126/science.168.3935.1118|pmid=4909766|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to report that cannabis induced "temporal disintegration" or a disorganization of sequential thought and impaired goal-directedness. This phenomenon stems partly from impaired [[immediate memory]]. Melges and colleagues&lt;ref name="Melges"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Melges FT, Tinklenberg JR, Hollister LE, Gillespie HK |title=Temporal disintegration and depersonalization during marihuana intoxication |journal=Arch. Gen.

This work led Melges to conclude that the [[Cannabis and time perception|disorientation in the sense of time]] might represent a key action of the drug from which many other effects followed.&lt;ref name="Melges"/&gt;

Melges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melges, F. T.| year = 1972| title = Future-oriented psychotherapy | journal = American Journal of Psychotherapy | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 | pmid = 5060589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite book|title= Time and the Inner Future: A Temporal Approach to Psychiatric Disorders |author= Melges, F. T|publisher= John Wiley and Sons |year= 1982|isbn= 0-471-86075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to propose a [[future oriented therapy]]. Melges (1982, p.&amp;nbsp;35) argued that: "Many forms of mental illness are characterized by a bleak, foreshortened or fragmented future time perspective."&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; He proposed that time distortions are prevalent in psychiatric illnesses and that they can cloud the personal future of an individual distorting their view of their future and thereby disrupting goal-directed behavior. Melges's emphasis on the importance of the future in understanding mental illness provided a framework for focusing psychiatric treatment on time and the future. The most significant work to document his findings on the essential value of time and his ideas on future oriented therapy are found in his only book, ''Time and the Inner Future'' (1982).

Melges suffered from Type I [[diabetes]] and at times wondered whether he would live to see his life's work completed. In his book's epilogue, Melges explains:&lt;ref name="int"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While I was writing this book, my own future was under almost constant threat. The specter of death made time ever so precious.
Since I had been conducting studies on time and the mind for 18 years, and since I had come to realize the importance of time and the personal future in clinical work with my patients, I had a great desire to complete this book before I died.
The year that I started the first draft was the very year that the long-term complications of my juvenile diabetes began to take their greatest toll. (p. 289)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his battle with diabetes, Melges's kidneys failed, and required a transplant, which at the age of 43 was donated to him by his mother. Melges died years later, in 1988.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Havigannada''' or '''Havyaka Bhaashe''' or '''Havyaka Kannada''' is the [[native language]] of [[Havyaka]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://windyskies.blogspot.com/2008/03/sacred-confluence-and-serpents-in-stone.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[dialect]] of [[Kannada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languageinindia.com/sep2005/kannadadictionary1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Havigannada is used only by [[Havyaka]]s. It uses similar verbs and words as mainstream Kannada. However, it has more in common with [[Halegannada]] (which is not in use today). This might be the reason why even native [[Kannadiga]]s find it difficult to comprehend it for the first time.

It is spoken in the taluks of [[Mangalore]], [[Sringeri]], [[Mudigere]], [[Udupi]], [[Thirthahalli]], [[Karkala]], [[Sagara, Karnataka|Sagara]], [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]], [[Yellapur]], [[Siddapura, Uttara Kannada|Siddapur]], [[Honnavar]], [[Kumta]], [[Puttur, Karnataka|Puttur]], [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]], [[Hosanagara]], etc. where there is a higher density of Havyakas in relation to other places.

In some parts of [[Uttara Kannada]] District like Kumta, Honnavara, [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]] and [[Siddapura, Uttara Kannada|Siddapur]], often [[Grammatical gender|Neuter]] gender is used instead of [[Feminine]] gender.

Havigannada was partly used in [[Sandalwood|Sandalwood films]]: [[Bettada Jeeva]], [[Nammoora Mandara Hoove]] and [[Naayi Neralu]] which was shot in and around [[Yana, India|Yana]].

'''Hiram Pendleton Caton III''' (16 August 1936 – 13 December 2010) was a Professor of politics and history at [[Griffith University]], [[Brisbane]], Australia, until his retirement. He was an [[ethics|ethicist]], a [[Fellow]] of the [[Australian Institute of Biology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibiol.org.au/ Australian Institute of Biology]&lt;/ref&gt; (since 1994),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/index/hcatton.htm HIV &amp; AIDS – Hiram Caton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding member of the [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]].&lt;ref name="evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at"&gt;[http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/ International Society for Human Ethology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216101842/http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/ |date=16 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an officer of the [[International Society for Human Ethology]].&lt;ref name="evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at"/&gt; Caton held a National Humanities Fellowship at the [[National Humanities Center]] in 1982–83.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/fellowships/ffellows1.htm Fellows of the National Humanities Center, A-G&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216051725/http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/fellowships/ffellows1.htm |date=16 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the inaugural Professor of Humanities at [[Griffith University]] in [[Brisbane]], and later the Professor of Politics and History&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/author/C/Hiram_-_Caton.aspx Hiram Caton — www.greenwood.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Head of the School of Applied Ethics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duesberg.com/media/nhconspiracy.html Duesberg on AIDS- Conspiracy of Silence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; there.

==Education==
Caton studied at the [[University of Chicago]] and received a PhD degree from [[Yale]], with an (earned) [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt]] degree from Griffith University for his work in modern history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/about%20us/officers/caton.html Hiram Caton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610004732/http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/about%20us/officers/caton.html |date=10 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Caton's work has been concerned with ethics in the sciences (particularly in life sciences and medicine), the history of ideas, and on biological bases for individual, social, and political behaviour. He has published some 175 articles, across six or seven fields—medical ethics and bioethics, human ethology, modern political and economic history, anthropology (with special attention to the Freeman-Mead controversy), philosophy (with emphasis on rationalism and positivism), crowd studies, identity psychology, and problems of the integration of biological/[[evolutionary factor]]s into the social sciences, especially political science.

He achieved notoriety as an [[AIDS denialist]] in the mid-1990s for his book ''The AIDS Mirage'' (1994), in which he charged [[Donald Francis]] with "inventing a viral epidemic" in 1982 at the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. He also wrote ''The Politics of Progress: The Origins and Development of the Commercial Republic, 1600–1835'' in which he explores what he considers to be the political forces surrounding the application of technology to subduing nature. Modern science, he argues, was born more from these political forces than from the ideological ones (such as the Protestant Reformation) that he feels are more usually credited with it.

The book was reviewed in more than 20 professional journals. Some reviewers stressed that it set forth a new interpretation of what drove the creation of capitalism, partly by tapping little-known historical sources. In it, Caton attributes the key phase&lt;!-- key phase of...? --&gt; to events and leaders in France, the Netherlands, and England in the 1650–1700 period. It offers interpretations of the French Revolution, of the founding of the United States of America, of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', and of the origin of the legend of wicked capitalism.  Caton argues that Smith's conception of economics was pre-industrial (it failed to recognise that industrial technology had become a commodity) and states that the wicked capitalism legend was created in the 1820–1840 period by a clique of factory owners.  In the book, Caton rejects the belief that the human species is evolving to a higher type.

In ''The Origin of Subjectivity: An Essay on Descartes'', Caton argues that [[Descartes]] based his epistemology on optics ('optical epistemology'); and that he used his metaphysics 'as a flag to cover the goods'-- a rationalist philosophy dedicated to 'the mastery and possession of nature'.

Caton's publications on [[Margaret Mead]], [[Derek Freeman]], and [[Coming of Age in Samoa|the Samoa controversy]] are part of the standard literature.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  His edited volume, ''The Samoa Reader: Anthropologists Take Stock'', remains the one comprehensive reader on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among his contributions to the volume are two studies on Freeman's psychology. They were featured in 2005 in a lead article in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Also in 2005, Caton was a consultant to the [[BBC]] for its documentary on the Freeman-Mead controversy, ''Tales from the Jungle''.

His last work focused on [[Charles Darwin]]. As a former officer of the International Society of Human Ethology, he worked to integrate the Society into the web of activities celebrating the bicentenary of Darwin's birth (2009).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Caton also published a reinterpretation of Darwin's contribution to the establishment of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} He has also devised a new interpretation of Darwin's famous illness, which he presented at the ISHE conference in Detroit, August 2006. This research was to be included in ''The Darwin Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;See also Hiram Caton, The Darwin Legend, ''[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant'' Magazine '''51'''(10):28–32, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Caton was an evolutionist skeptical of Darwinian mechanisms, and was also a [[catastrophist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiram-caton.com/pages/copernicus.php Copernicus, the Big Bang, and Halton Arp], Whither Progress (website of Hiram Caton), 2008–2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Caton contributed a paper to a [[young earth creationist]] journal on the evolutionary basis for [[eugenics]], the [[Holocaust]], and [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiram Caton, [https://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j03_1/j03_1_011-015.pdf The assault on the family: Its aims and basis], ''[[Journal of Creation]]'' [then ''Ex Nihilo Technical Journal''] '''3'''(1):11–15, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that Caton was a creationist.

'''Howard J. Hunter Jr.''' (December 19, 1946 – January 7, 2007) was a  [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] member of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] representing the state's fifth House district, including constituents in [[Bertie County, North Carolina|Bertie]], [[Gates County, North Carolina|Gates]], [[Hertford County, North Carolina|Hertford]] and [[Perquimans County, North Carolina|Perquimans]] (and formerly [[Northampton County, North Carolina|Northampton]]) counties.  A funeral director from [[Ahoskie, North Carolina]], Hunter served nine full terms in the state House of Representatives. After being elected to a tenth term in November 2006, Hunter died on January 7, 2007, before the new legislature convened.[http://www.newsobserver.com/114/story/530051.html]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} He was born in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/northcarolinaman20012002nort#page/546/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[Howard J. Hunter III]], sought to replace his father in the seat, but local Democratic Party leaders instead nominated retired court clerk [[Annie Mobley]].[http://www.dailyadvance.com/news/content/news/stories/2007/01/011907_news_dems_pick.html]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The younger Hunter was eventually elected to the House, in 2014.

'''Ian Mikardo''' (9 July 1908 – 6 May 1993), commonly known as '''Mik''', was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Co-operative Party|Co-operative]] Member of Parliament.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52289 |title=Tam Dalyell: ''Mikardo, Ian (1908–1993)''|publisher = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006|accessdate = 21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/obituaries/ian-mikardo-84-dies-led-british-labor-party.html The New York Times: ''Ian Mikardo, 84, Dies - Led British Labor Party'' 11 May 1993 Accessed 21 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; An ardent socialist and a [[Zionism|Zionist]], he remained a [[backbencher]] throughout his four decades in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He was a member of [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party]] in 1950–59 and 1960–78, and [[Chairman of the Labour Party]] in 1970–1971. He was also Chairman of the International Committee of the Labour Party in 1973–78,&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt; Vice-President of the [[Socialist International]] (1978–1983) and Honorary President (1983–1993).&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

Mikardo was a Labour Member of Parliament for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] 1945–50, [[Reading South (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading South]] 1950–55, [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] 1955–59, [[Poplar (UK Parliament constituency)|Poplar]] 1964–74, [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] 1974–83 and [[Bow and Poplar (UK Parliament constituency)|Bow and Poplar]] 1983–87. He was Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, 1966–70. He issued many pamphlets, the most famous were ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (1947) and ''Keeping Left'' with [[Richard Crossman|Dick Crossman]], [[Michael Foot]] and [[Jo Richardson]], 1950. He was also a [[Fabian Society|Fabian essayist]], staunch friend of Israel, as well as friend and mentor to many in the Labour movement, where he made a great impact.

==Early life and family==
His parents were [[Jew]]ish refugees from the [[Tsarist]] Empire. His mother, Bluma 'Bloomah' (died 1961 in [[Hampshire]]) came from a town called [[Yampil, Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] in the [[Volyn]] region, of the [[Western Ukraine]]. His father, [[Moshe]] 'Morris' (died 1940 in Hampshire) came from [[Kutno]], a textile-manufacturing town west of [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt; They came to East End of London separately around 1900, and married some years later. They worked as tailors and in 1907 moved to [[Portsmouth]] where they were employed repairing uniforms for the [[Royal Navy]]. Mikardo was born there in 1908. He had two brothers, Sidney Mikardo (1915-1999) and Norman Mikardo. His brother (Neville) Norman  Mikardo (1924–2004), a mechanical engineer, was a Labour Party councillor for [[Tokyngton]] Ward of [[Brent South]], from 1978–82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/Data/Council/20040628/Agenda/cm28jne.pdf Brent Council Meeting noting the death of Norman Mikado, 2004, Accessed 22 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; His niece Barbara Tayler (1931–2012) was a publisher, writer and political activist. Mikardo became a surrogate father to her after her father died when she was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/31/barbara-tayler Barbara Tayler obituary in the Guardian 31 January 2012 Accessed 22 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

When he began school aged three, his lack of English words made him the butt of jokes. His parents spoke [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref name="eastlondonhistory1"&gt;[http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/ian-mikardo-east-end-mp/  Ian Mikardo, East End MP, obituary at East London History Site, c2012 Accessed 22 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended The Old Beneficiary School&lt;ref&gt;

At this time he followed [[Portsmouth FC]] and he had an encyclopedic knowledge of all their matches.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eastlondonhistory1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1116,00.html Has anybody actually seen a person with a sandwich board proclaiming: 'The end of the world is nigh'? The Guardian - undated Accessed 22 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned by injustice and inequality from boyhood, Mikardo was influenced by the works of [[R. H. Tawney]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] in his teens. He attended political lectures at various clubs and societies in London in the 1920s, principally amongst the Jewish community. He joined both the Labour Party and [[Poale Zion (Great Britain)|Poale Zion]], the Zionist workers' movement affiliated to the Labour Party. He was already a Zionist, and had given his first public speech at a meeting of the Portsmouth Zionist Society in 1922, aged 13.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

After leaving school, Mikardo settled in [[Stepney]], where he had a variety of jobs. In 1930 he met Mary (b. 1907), the daughter of Benjamin Rosetsky. They married at Mile End and Bow District synagogue on 3 January 1932,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/london/EE_mile-end-bow_utd/index.htm Mile End &amp; Bow District Synagogue Records, Accessed 23 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary joined the Labour Party and Poale Zion. They had two daughters by 1936. Mary suffered a heart attack in 1959 which was progressively disabling.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;  She died in [[Cheshire]] in 1994, a few months after him.

He studied [[scientific management]], but was sceptical and developed his own theories. He became a freelance management consultant and during the [[Second World War]], worked on increasing efficiency in aircraft and armaments manufacturing, principally at [[Museum of Berkshire Aviation|Woodley Aerodrome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalnoisephotography.co.uk/2013/05/15/former-miles-aircraft-factory-woodley/ Former Miles Aircraft Factory, Woodley Accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. He was treasurer of the World Airways Joint Committee of [[National Air Communications]].

==Parliament and the Labour Party==
After settling in Reading at the end of the war he was selected by the local [[Constituency Labour Party]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], beating [[James Callaghan]] and [[Austen Albu]]. On every topic, the National Health Service, education, social deprivation, nationalisation or socialism, he was seen as an inspiration to others. Mik, as he introduced himself, showed he had planned where he was going and the constituency members wanted to go with him. His integrity was obvious and beguiling, quite rare amongst professional politicians.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

He was elected Member of Parliament for Reading constituency overturning a large [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority. Labour's effective [[get out the vote]] campaign used in this election was universally adopted and came to be known as the [[Get out the vote#Reading system|Reading system]]. He held Reading, which became a highly marginal seat, until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]] when he was ousted by [[Peter Emery]] of the  [[Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians]], later the [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs]] and [[Manufacturing Science and Finance]] [[trade union]]. Ian Mikardo Way, a road in [[Lower Caversham]], Reading, commemorates his role as the town's MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/street/IAN_MIKARDO_WAY_in_CAVERSHAM_in_READING_in_RG4_583010_285944.htm Ian Mikardo Way in Caversham, Reading, Accessed 24 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikardo was a member of the left wing of the Labour Party throughout his political career, writing for ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. In the post-war period the [[Fabian Society]] was at the heart of Labour and social democratic thinking, and Mikardo contributed to the New Fabian Essays of 1952, edited by [[Anthony Crosland]]. These helped to reinvigorate debate on the left after the fall of the Attlee government. Other contributors included [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Richard Crossman]] and [[Denis Healey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/aug/13/thinktanks.uk The Fabian Society: a brief history, The Guardian, Accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikardo's secretary at the time was [[Jo Richardson]] (1923–94) who began her political career working for him and later became a Member of Parliament herself. She co-ordinated the 'Keep Left Group' and went on to become the secretary of the [[Tribune Group]]. In 1951 Richardson was elected to [[Hornsey]] [[Borough Council]] and became the full-time secretary and working partner of Mikardo in his business, which involved trade with eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jo-richardson-1391377.html Jo Richardson Obituary, The Independent 2 February 1994, accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1958 Mikardo joined [[Stephen Swingler]], Richardson, [[Harold Davies, Baron Davies of Leek|Harold Davies]], [[Konni Zilliacus]], [[Walter Monslow]] and [[Sydney Silverman]], to form Victory for Socialism (VFS), which was co-ordinated by Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20141008043847/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/jorich.html Jo Richardson – Archives Hub, accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikardo was defeated in his Reading seat in 1959 but won Poplar in the General Election of 1964, representing the area of London where his parents had first settled. As the constituencies were reorganised over time, he went on to represent [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] from 1974 until 1983 and the [[Bow and Poplar (UK Parliament constituency)|Bow and Poplar]] from 1983 until his retirement from Parliament in 1987. Mikardo served as member of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the Labour Party from 1950–59 and 1960–78. He was also chairman of the [[Select Committee]] on Nationalised Industries 1966–70 and Chairman of the Labour Party 1970–71.

In February 1973 Mikardo joined [[James Callaghan]], Shadow Foreign Secretary, and [[Tom McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]], Secretary, International Department in an official Labour Party delegation visiting the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/3378301-7th-february-1973-a-british-labour-party-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=Fmcgg%2BDW9I5P1Wlo38MMeyi5u0mHXlfklordVdH9ToCr2ia2Xzq7ufxK5B6YYBke Far East Delegation 1973, accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 March 1974 Mikardo, having already served as Chairman of the Labour Party, was elected chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, defeating a candidate from the right of the party, [[Arthur Bottomley]], by 99–85 votes. A necessarily anonymous and discerning experienced clerk of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] remarked 'Ian Mikardo was simply the most skillful operator in committee that any of us ever saw.'&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; Within Parliament, he was known as the Commons' [[bookmaker]], willing to take bets on all manner of political events.

==Keep Left and Keeping Left==
In early 1947 a small number of the 'King's Speech dissenters' in the Labour Party formed the 'Keep Left' group and met on a regular basis during that year. Along with [[Richard Crossman]], [[Michael Foot]] and [[Konni Zilliacus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUzilliacus.htm Konni Zilliacus Biography Accessed 23 August 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614194318/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUzilliacus.htm |date=14 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikardo published [[Keep Left (pamphlet)|a pamphlet of the same name]] in May 1947 in which the authors criticized the United States [[cold war]] policies and urged a closer relationship with Europe in order to create a "Third Force" in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bus.lsbu.ac.uk/resources/CIBS/european-institute-papers/papers2/498.PDF 1947 pamphlet, accessed 23 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; This included the idea of [[nuclear disarmament]] and the formation of a [[European Security Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUmikardo.htm Ian Mikardo Biography, Accessed 24 August 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020163138/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUmikardo.htm |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of office of [[Clement Attlee]]'s Labour government, the Keep Left group attempted, through discussion and pamphlets, to produce practical proposals informed by socialist values. The group survived until April 1951. After that month's ministerial resignations it became one element within the much larger [[Bevanite]] faction.

Keep Left's concern was with modernisation and socialist ethics. This was evident in [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] governments in the 1960s. Such sentiments contributed to ministerial conflicts with the trade unions over [[incomes policy]] and most thoroughly over [[Barbara Castle|Barbara Castle's]] proposals for trade union reform. The vision of a more rational and ethical society discussed by a group of talented young politicians two decades earlier was at odds with sentiments deeply rooted in their party.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb1"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/theme-print.jsp?articleid=92511 Oxford DNB article: Keep Left 2013-05, accessed 23 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mikardo Committee on the Docks==

The Mikardo Committee on the docks was  set up by the Labour Party. Mikardo served on it, along with [[Andrew Cunningham (politician)|Andrew Cunningham]], leader of the [[General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union]] (GMB) in north-east England, [[John Hughes (Coventry North East MP)|John Hughes]], of [[Ruskin College, Oxford]], [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], later general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] then directly responsible for [[docker]]s, [[Michael Montague, Baron Montague of Oxford|Michael Montague]], later of the [[English Tourist Board]], and [[Peter Shore]] MP.

A report in March 1965 exposed the problems of the docks industry. It recommended total restructuring of the docks under public ownership and with a system of decentralisation and workers' participation in management wider than for any other industry. The 1966 Labour Cabinet accepted the report. [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] fought hard for it against ministerial resistance. However, the Labour government was unable to produce the Ports Bill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pla.co.uk/Port-of-London-Act-1968 Port of London Act 1968, accessed 24 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; until the last session of that parliament. The Bill when it came was a disappointment it was a long way short of implementing the proposals.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; Had the committee's proposals been put into practice, the seamen's strike and [[National_Union_of_Seamen#The_Growth_of_Dissent_and_the_Seamen.27s_Strike_of_1966|its crippling effect on the economy]] might have been avoided. Sourness was created in the Labour movement by suggestions of 'Reds under the bed'. It created the conditions for [[UK general election 1970|Labour's defeat in 1970]].

==The Belgrano Enquiry - Parliamentary Select Committee==
Mikardo outlined in the House of Commons attempts by some members of the [[Parliamentary Select Committee]], of which he was a member, to find the truth about the [[sinking of the Belgrano]] during the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://belgranoinquiry.com/sound-archive/ian-mikado-mp-foiled-attempts-to-find-the-truth Ian Mikardo - ''Foiled attempts to find the truth'' Accessed 20 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hansard"/&gt;

The [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]]'s minority report was published in 1984. Mikardo complained that dogmatic views were being expressed. He stated that he had spent months going through all the evidence, but   still could not make up his mind about the truth. He complained that other members who had not looked at all the evidence could not be so sure and dogmatic. He complained that information was being withheld and this would devalue its work and its report. Mikardo accused the Government of lying to the House, to the Select Committee and to the country. This followed revelations from the trial of [[Clive Ponting]]. He also stated that a civil servant had advised Ministers to deceive the Select Committee by withholding information. Mikardo quoted one of the reasons given for withholding, namely that the rules of engagement would have to be paraphrased considerably or they would be almost incomprehensible to the layman. Mikardo stated that the rules had been given to the War Cabinet whose members were all laymen and the rules had been fully understood by them. The Secretary of State subsequently agreed that it was nonsense and he had now given the rules to the Select Committee.&lt;ref name = "Hansard"/&gt;

Mikardo stated that a number of people had said that they could not understand why the Government had prosecuted Clive Ponting (who had been acquitted). Mikardo stated that the Government's lying to the House of Commons was in the national interest. He stated that they wanted to protect themselves against criticism from the Select Committee, and others, and to be able to say that, however reprehensible, it was done in the national interest. Mikardo stated that the acquittal of Ponting got rid of that. Twelve British citizens had dismissed the judge's opinion, shared by the Prime Minister and some of her Ministers, that the national interest is whatever the Government of the day want to do. Mikardo stated: "''That is a monstrous doctrine, because if confers on a Government a cachet of [[papal infallibility]]. I do not doubt that all Governments do what they judge to be in the national interest, but no Government have the right to assume that their judgment can never be wrong. No Government should assume that they can never be wrong and that what they do cannot sometimes therefore vary from the national interest. As has been said, that is the cherished doctrine of [[General Pinochet]] and of [[General Jaruzelski]]. It is the codex of all courts in police states. Before the time of our present Prime Minister and Mr Justice McCowan, that doctrine was unheard of in our country.''"&lt;ref name = "Hansard"/&gt;

John Browne (MP for Winchester) asked: "What greater test can any Government face than to fight a military campaign and have a disloyal adviser in a key area of defence? I am reminded of the betrayal of the Spartans at Thermopylae to the Persians. In what other country would the Government have to balance disclosure against national security in such a blaze of examination, comment and publicity?"

Mikardo responded: "The United States."

Browne: "No, not the President."

Mikardo: "Yes." (Sinking of the General Belgrano, Hansard, 18 February 1985)&lt;ref name = "Hansard"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1985/feb/18/sinking-of-the-general-belgrano#column_795 Hansard, accessed 24 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[ARA General Belgrano#Controversy over the sinking|ARA General Belgrano: Controversy over the sinking]]

==Poale Zion of Britain and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland==

Mikardo and his wife were immersed in Jewish causes and help for Israel, which they often visited. He worked with [[Mapam]], the Israeli United Workers' Party, and abhorred gratuitous provocation of the Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt; Instances include:

* 7 March 1948: At the opening of the annual conference of the [[Poale Zion]] of Great Britain, Mikardo revealed that a vote of "no-confidence" would be sought against the government by some members of the British Labour Party when the bill to terminate the Palestine Mandate had its second reading in the House of Commons.
* 21 July 1950: Mikardo asked in Parliament that the British Government's policy on providing arms to Egypt be revised. Mikardo pointed out that arms shipments to Egypt were premised on their use in collective defence and that Egypt had made it very clear that it would not join the collective effort on Korea. [[Kenneth Younger]], government spokesman on foreign affairs, declared that the government was not contemplating changing its policy of supplying arms to Egypt.
* 16 January 1951: Mikardo commented on an article he had written which included a suggestion for Britain to have a military base in Israel.
* 11 July 1952: Labour Party leaders praised the courage and enthusiasm of the new State of Israel and said that it would overcome the great odds which it faces. They were speaking at a reception given by Labour MPs in honour of a [[Histadrut]] delegation of 62 American and Canadian Jews en route to Israel. They stressed the close relations between the Israeli and British Labour movements. Speakers included [[Arthur Greenwood]], Treasurer of the British Labour Party, Glenville Hall, Chairman of its Parliamentary caucus, [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]], former party chair and Ian Mikardo.
* 1953: Mikardo questioned Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill on anti-Jewish discrimination at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1953/06/25/archive/churchill-exonerates-bermuda-club-says-it-doesnt-bar-jews Club says it doesn't bar Jews, accessed 24 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1953/06/18/archive/president-of-bermuda-club-denies-barring-jews-from-member-ship Club President denies excluding Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inşirah Hanım''' ({{lang-ota|انشراح خانم}}; 10 July 1887 &amp;ndash; 10 June 1930) was the second wife of Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}

==Early life==
Inşirah Hanım was born on 10 July 1887{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}} in Maşukiye, [[İzmit]]. Born as Seniye Voçibe, she was a member of [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] noble family, Voçibe. Her father was Aziz Bey Voçibe. She had an elder brother named Zeki Bey (1885 – 1932). She was the paternal neice of [[Dürrüaden Kadın]], wife of Sultan [[Mehmed V]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=188, n. 88}}

She was taken into palace by her aunt Dürrüaden. At the age of sixteen, she became a lady-in-waiting to [[Şayeste Hanım]], wife of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]]. She was tall, had slender figure, long chestnut hair, and faint blue eyes. She was interested in painting.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=188}}

==Marriage==
One day, when Mehmed was in his forties, he visited his adoptive mother Şayeste Hanım at her palace. Here he saw Inşirah, then seventeen years old, and fell in love with her. He asked Şayeste to give him Inşirah in marriage.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=70}} Inşirah refused to this proposal. However, at her brother's insistence, she agreed. The marriage took place on 8 July 1905{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=188-9}} in the Çengelköy Palace.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=706}} No issue came of this marriage.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=70}} After her marrige, her brother, Zeki Bey became aide-de-camp to Mehmed.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=87}}

Inşirah was said to be a jealous lady. One day, she caught Mehmed in the bedroom with a servant girl named Periru. She immediately abandoned him, and went back to her family.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=71-2}} Mehmed divorced her on 17 November 1909.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=189}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=706}}

==Later years and death==
After her divorce, she moved in her aunt's Validebağı Palace. When the imperial family went into exile in 1924, she went to Cairo.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=189}} Her brother remained with Mehmed, even after her divorce, and followed him into exile.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=87}}

Inşirah committed suicide on 10 June 1930,{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=706}} by tossing herself into the river [[Nile]]. Her body was brought to Istanbul by the Naaşi family. She was buried in Eyüp Sultan Cemetery.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=190}}

'''Iqbal Ahmed''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ({{lang-bn|ইকবাল আহমেদ}}; born 4 August 1956) is a [[Bangladesh]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. Based in [[Manchester]], he made his fortune importing [[shrimp]]. The success of his two companies, Seamark and Ibco, have extensive interests in shipping, hotel and real estate development, hospitality, and food. Both companies turned him into one of the United Kingdom's richest men. He is also the highest ranked [[British Bangladeshi]] to be featured on the [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]].

==Early life==
Ahmed was born in [[Balaganj Upazila|Balaganj]], [[Sylhet District]], [[Sylhet Division]], [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foster|first=Peter|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1535827/Britains-Bengalis-stage-great-curry-takeaway.html|title=Britain's Bengalis stage great curry takeaway|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=2 December 2006|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, at the age of 15, he moved to the [[United Kingdom]]. He attended the City College in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], and a few years later he joined his family's business located in [[Oldham]], which his brothers Kamal and Bilal joined later after the business expanded.

[[Image:Matthys.jpg|thumb|Jan Matthys]]

'''Jan Matthys''' (also known as ''Jan Matthias'', ''Johann Mathyszoon'', ''Jan Mattijs'', ''Jan Matthijszoon''; c. 1500, [[Haarlem]] – 5 April 1534, [[Münster]]) was a charismatic [[Anabaptist]] leader of the [[Münster Rebellion]], regarded by his followers as a prophet.

Matthys was a baker in Haarlem, in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[County of Holland]], and was converted to Anabaptism through the ministry of [[Melchior Hoffman]] in the 1520s. Matthys baptized thousands of converts, and after Hoffman's imprisonment, rose to prominent leadership among the Anabaptists. Matthys rejected the pacifism and non-violence theology of Hoffman, adopting a view that oppression must be met with resistance.

In 1534, an Anabaptist [[insurrection]] took control of Münster, the capital city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster]]. [[John of Leiden]], a Dutch Anabaptist disciple of Matthys, and a group of local merchants, summoned Matthys to come. Matthys identified Münster as the "New Jerusalem", and on January 5, 1534, a number of his disciples entered the city and introduced adult baptism. Reformer [[Bernhard Rothmann]] apparently accepted "rebaptism" that day, and well over 1000 adults were soon baptized.

They declared war on [[Franz von Waldeck]], its expelled [[prince-bishop]], who [[besieged]] the [[fortified town]]. In April 1534 on [[Easter]] Sunday, Matthys, who had prophesied God's judgment to come on the wicked on that day, made a sally forth with twelve followers, under the idea that he was a second [[Gideon]], and was cut off with his entire band. He was killed, dismembered and his head stuck on a pike. Later that evening, his genitals were nailed to the city door.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18813">[[Image:Jeanne Barret.jpg|thumb|Imagined portrait of Jeanne Baré dressed as a sailor, dating from 1817, after her death.]]
'''Jeanne Baret''' (sometimes spelled '''Baré''' or '''Barret''') (July 27, 1740&amp;nbsp;– August 5, 1807) was a member of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]'s expedition on the ships ''[[French frigate La Boudeuse (1766)|La Boudeuse]]'' and ''[[French fluyt Étoile (1767)|Étoile]]'' in 1766–1769. Baret is recognized as the first woman to have completed a voyage of [[circumnavigation]] of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Monsieur Baret: First Woman Around the World |first=John |last=Dunmore |publisher=Heritage Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-908708-54-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Discovery of Jeanne Baret |first=Glynis |last=Ridley |publisher=Crown Publisher New York |year=2010 |isbn=0-307-46352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeanne Baret joined the expedition [[Passing (gender)|disguised as a man]], calling herself '''Jean Baret'''. She enlisted as [[valet]] and assistant to the expedition's [[natural history|naturalist]], [[Philibert Commerçon]] (anglicized as Commerson), shortly before Bougainville's ships sailed from France. According to Bougainville's account, Baret was herself an expert botanist.

== Early life ==
Jeanne Baret was born on July 27, 1740, in the village of [[La Comelle]] in the [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy region]] of France.  Her record of baptism survives and identifies her as the legitimate issue of Jean Baret and Jeanne Pochard. Her father is identified as a day laborer and seems likely to have been illiterate, as he did not sign the parish register.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing definitive is known of Baret's childhood or young adulthood. She later told Bougainville that she had been orphaned and lost her fortune in a lawsuit before taking to disguising herself as a man. While she might well have been an orphan given the low life expectancies of the time,&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; historians agree that other details of the story she gave Bougainville were a fabrication to shield Commerson from complicity in her disguise.&lt;ref name="Dunmore, p 15"&gt;Dunmore, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  Burgundy was at this time one of the more backward provinces of France in terms of the condition of the peasant classes, and it is likely that Baret's family was quite impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the mysteries of Baret's life is how she obtained at least the rudiments of an education, as her signature on later legal documents provides evidence that she was not illiterate. One of her biographers, Glynis Ridley, suggests that her mother might have been of [[Huguenot]] extraction, a group that had a higher tradition of literacy than was otherwise typical of the peasant classes of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Another biographer, John Dunmore, suggests that she was taught by the parish priest or taken on as a charity case by a member of the local gentry.&lt;ref name="Dunmore, p 15"/&gt;

== Relationship with Commerson ==
At some point between 1760 and 1764, Baret became employed as housekeeper to Commerson, who had settled in [[Toulon-sur-Arroux]], some 20&amp;nbsp;km to the south of La Comelle, upon his marriage in 1760. Commerson's wife, who was the sister of the parish priest, died shortly after giving birth to a son in April 1762, and it seems most likely that Baret took over management of Commerson's household at that time, if not before.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 38–389&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also evident that Baret and Commerson shared a more personal relationship, as Baret became pregnant in 1764. French law at that time required women who became pregnant out of wedlock to obtain a "certificate of pregnancy" in which they could name the father of their unborn child. Baret's certificate, from August 1764, survives; it was filed in a town 30&amp;nbsp;km away and witnessed by two men of substance who likewise had travelled a considerable distance from their homes. She refused to name the father of her child, but historians do not doubt that it was Commerson and that it was Commerson who had also made the arrangements with the lawyer and witnesses on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, Baret and Commerson moved together to [[Paris]], where she continued in the role of his housekeeper.
Baret apparently changed her name to "Jeanne de Bonnefoy" during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Her child, born in December 1764, was given the name Jean-Pierre Baret. Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died in the summer of 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 51–56&lt;/ref&gt; (Commerson had left his legitimate son from his marriage in the care of his brother-in-law in Toulon-sur-Arroux and never saw him again in his lifetime.)

In 1765, Commerson was invited to join Bougainville's expedition. He hesitated in accepting because he was often in poor health; he required Baret's assistance as a nurse as well as in running his household and managing his collections and papers.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 32, 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived. To avoid scrutiny, she was to join the expedition immediately before the ship sailed, pretending to be a stranger to Commerson.

Before leaving Paris, Commerson drew up a will in which he left to "Jeanne Baret, known as de Bonnefoi, my housekeeper", a lump sum of 600 livres along with back wages owed and the furnishings of their Paris apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the story Baret concocted for Bougainville's benefit to explain her presence on board ship was carefully designed to shield Commerson from involvement, there is clear documentary evidence of their previous relationship, and it is highly improbable that Commerson was not complicit in the plan himself.

== With Bougainville ==
Baret and Commerson joined the Bougainville expedition at the port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the ''Étoile''. Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship's captain, François Chesnard de la Giraudais, gave up his own large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his "assistant".&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; This gave Baret significantly more privacy than she would have had otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain's cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared [[Head (watercraft)|head]] with other members of the crew.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}
 
In addition to Bougainville's published account, Baret's story figures in three other surviving memoirs of the expedition: a journal kept jointly by Commerson and Pierre Duclos-Guyot; a journal by the [[Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen|Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], a paying passenger on the ''Boudeuse''; and a memoir by François Vivès, surgeon on the ''Étoile''.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Vivès has the most to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 53, 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Commerson suffered badly from both seasickness and a recurring ulcer on his leg in the early part of the voyage, and Baret probably spent most of her time attending to him. Aside from the [[Line-crossing ceremony|ceremony of "crossing the line"]], which Commerson described in some detail in his memoir, there was little for the botanists to do until the ''Étoile'' reached [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 55–67&lt;/ref&gt; There they set out on expeditions to the surrounding plains and mountains. Commerson's leg was still troubling him, and Baret seems to have done much of the actual labor, carrying supplies and specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rio de Janeiro]] – a much more dangerous place, where the ''Étoile''{{'}}s chaplain was murdered ashore soon after their arrival – Commerson was officially confined to the ship while his leg healed, but he and Baret nonetheless collected specimens of a flowering vine, which he named ''[[Bougainvillea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 72–78&lt;/ref&gt;

After a second visit to Montevideo, their next opportunity to collect plants was in [[Patagonia]] while the ships of the expedition were waiting for favorable winds to carry them through the [[Strait of Magellan]]. Here Baret accompanied Commerson on the most troublesome excursions over rugged terrain and gained a reputation for courage and strength.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{citation |title=Voyaging Through Strange Seas: Four Women Travellers in the Pacific |first=Honore |last=Forster |accessdate=2007-08-21 |date=January 2000 |periodical=[[NLA News]] |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2000/jan00/story-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 84–87&lt;/ref&gt; Commerson, still hampered by his leg injury, referred to Baret as his "beast of burden" on these expeditions. In addition to the manual labor she performed in collecting plants, stones, and shells, Baret also helped Commerson organize and catalog their specimens and notes in the weeks that followed, as the ships entered the Pacific.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Surviving accounts of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached [[Tahiti]] in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried out that she was a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the ''Étoile'' to interview Baret personally.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=92,103,113,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his account, Vivès reports much speculation about Baret's gender early in the voyage and asserts that Baret claimed to be a [[eunuch]] when confronted directly by La Giraudais (whose own official log has not survived).&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt; Bougainville's account of Baret's unmasking on Tahiti is not corroborated by the other journal accounts of the expedition, although Vivès describes a similar incident in which Baret was immediately pointed out as a woman by the Tahitian [[Ahu-toru]] on board the ship. Vivès also describes a different incident on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] in mid-July in which Baret was caught off-guard, stripped, and "examined" by a group of other servants on the expedition. Duclos-Guyot and Nassau-Siegen also recorded that Baret had been discovered to be a woman on New Ireland, but without mentioning details.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahu-toru travelled back to France with the expedition and was subsequently questioned at some length about Baret. Modern scholars now believe that Ahu-toru actually thought that Baret was a [[transvestite]], or ''[[Mahu (person)|mahu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 96–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 165–169&lt;/ref&gt; However, other Tahitian natives reported the presence of a woman in Bougainville's expedition to later visitors to the island, including [[James Cook]] in 1769 and [[Domingo de Bonechea]] in 1772,&lt;ref name="Salmond"&gt;[[Anne Salmond]], ''Aphrodite's Island'', pp. 164, 255–256&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates that her gender was known to the Tahitians if not to her shipmates at the time she visited the island.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}

After crossing the Pacific, the expedition was desperately short of food. After a brief stop for supplies in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia), the ships made a longer stop at the island of [[Mauritius]] in the Indian Ocean. This island, known as [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]], was then an important French trading station. Commerson was delighted to find that his old friend and fellow botanist [[Pierre Poivre]] was serving as governor on the island, and Commerson and Baret remained behind as Poivre's guests. Probably Bougainville also actively encouraged this arrangement, as it allowed him to rid himself of the problem of a woman illegally on board his expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 102, 158–164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 205–210&lt;/ref&gt;

On Mauritius, Baret continued in her role as Commerson's assistant and housekeeper. It is likely that she accompanied him in plant-collecting on [[Madagascar]] and [[Bourbon Island]] in 1770–1772. Commerson continued to have serious health problems, and he died in Mauritius in February 1773. His financial resources on the island had dwindled, his patron Poivre had been recalled to Paris, and Baret was left without the means to immediately return to France to claim the money due her from Commerson's will.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 164–179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After Commerson's death, Baret seems to have found work running a tavern in [[Port Louis]] for a time. Then, on May 17, 1774, she married Jean Dubernat, a non-commissioned officer in the French Army who was most likely on the island on his way home to France.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 180–182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of exactly when Baret and her husband arrived in France, thus completing her voyage of circumnavigation. Most likely it was sometime in 1775. In April 1776, she received the money that was due to her under Commerson's will after applying directly to the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; With this money, she settled with Dubernat in his native village of [[Saint-Aulaye]] where he possibly became the blacksmith.

In 1785, Baret was granted a pension of 200 livres a year by the Ministry of Marine. The document granting her this pension makes clear the high regard with which she was held by this point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jeanne Barré, by means of a disguise, circumnavigated the globe on one of the vessels commanded by Mr de Bougainville. She devoted herself in particular to assisting Mr de Commerson, doctor and botanist, and shared with great courage the labours and dangers of this savant. Her behaviour was exemplary and Mr de Bougainville refers to it with all due credit....  His Lordship has been gracious enough to grant to this extraordinary woman a pension of two hundred livres a year to be drawn from the fund for invalid servicemen and this pension shall be payable from 1 January 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She died in Saint-Aulaye on August 5, 1807, at the age of 67.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and controversy ==
Commerson named many of the plants he collected after friends and acquaintances. One of them, a tall shrub with dark green leaves and white flowers that he found on Madagascar, he named ''Baretia bonafidia''. But Commerson's name for this genus did not survive, as it had already been named by the time his reports reached Paris;&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; it is currently known as [[Turraea]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; While over seventy species are named in honor of Commerson, only one, ''[[Solanum]] [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_baretiae|baretiae]]'', honors Baret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tepe|first=Eric J. |last2=Ridley|first2=Glynis|last3=Bohs|first3=Lynn|title=A new species of Solanum named for Jeanne Baret, an overlooked contributor to the history of botany|pmc=3254248|publisher=PhytoKeys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Botanical Garden]] includes a plant specimen, attributed to Comerson but believed to be collected by Baret with him, in their [[herbarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiernan |first1=Elizabeth |title=The Amazing Feat of Jeanne Baret |url=https://www.nybg.org/blogs/science-talk/2014/03/the-amazing-feat-of-jeanne-baret/ |website=Science Talk--NYBG blog |publisher=New York Botanical Garden |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For many years, Bougainville's published journal – a popular bestseller in its day, in English translation as well as the original French – was the only widely available source of information about Baret. More recent scholarship has uncovered additional facts and documentation about her life, but much of the new information remained little-known and inaccessible to the general public, particularly outside France. The first English-language biography of Baret, by John Dunmore, was not published until 2002, and then only in New Zealand. Other articles appeared only in scholarly journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Jeanne Baret: the first woman to circumnavigate the globe|first=Londa|last=Schiebinger|journal=Endeavour|volume=27|issue=1|year=2003|pages=22–25|doi=10.1016/S0160-9327(03)00018-8|pmid=12642142|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 biography of Baret by Glynis Ridley, ''The Discovery of Jeanne Baret'', brought Baret to the attention of a wider audience and helped to overturn some of the old misconceptions about her life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/12/26/132265308/a-female-explorer-discovered-on-the-high-seas "A Female Explorer Discovered On The High Seas", NPR, December 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ridley's biography has also been highly criticized by some reviewers for its reliance on improbable chains of speculation that are not corroborated by any other primary or secondary sources.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;Sandra Knapp, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7332/full/470036a.html The plantswoman who dressed as a boy], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''470''', 36–37 (3 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704034804576025743375892716 "Incredible Voyage", [[The Wall Street Journal]], January 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joanna Russ''' (February 22, 1937 – April 29, 2011) was an American writer, academic and [[radical feminist]]. She is the author of a number of works of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[feminist literary criticism]] such as ''[[How to Suppress Women's Writing]]'', as well as a contemporary novel, ''On Strike Against God'', and one children's book, ''Kittatinny''. She is best known for ''[[The Female Man]]'', a novel combining [[utopian novel|utopian fiction]] and satire, and the story "[[When It Changed]]".

==Background==

Joanna Russ was born in [[The Bronx]], New York City,{{sfnp|Russ|1989|p=236}} to Evarett I. and Bertha (née Zinner) Russ, both teachers. She began creating works of fiction at a very early age. Over the following years she filled countless notebooks with stories, poems, comics and illustrations, often hand-binding the material with thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PCL MS-7: Joanna Russ Collection|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/pcl/pclms7.html|work=Browne Popular Culture Library|accessdate=March 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113050534/http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/pcl/pclms7.html|archivedate=January 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senior at [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]], Russ was selected as one of the top ten [[Intel Science Talent Search|Westinghouse Science Talent Search]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/553/000029466/ |title=Joanna Russ |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/science-talent-search-1953 |title=Science Talent Search 1953 |publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public |accessdate=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Cornell University]], where she studied with [[Vladimir Nabokov]],{{sfnp|Delany|2005|p=vi}} in 1957, and received her [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the Yale Drama School in 1960. After teaching at several universities, including Cornell, she became a full professor at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Joanna Russ Papers, 1968–1989|url=http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv52000|work=Northwest Digital Archives|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science fiction and other writing ==
Russ came to be noticed in the science fiction world in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name="scificulture"&gt;{{harvp|Bacon-Smith|2000|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular for her award-nominated novel ''Picnic on Paradise.''&lt;ref name=sfadb/&gt; At the time, SF was a field dominated by male authors, writing for a predominantly male audience, but women were starting to enter the field in larger numbers.&lt;ref name="scificulture" /&gt; Russ, an out lesbian,{{sfnp|Griffin|2002|p=172}} was one of the most outspoken authors to challenge male dominance of the field, and is generally regarded as one of the leading [[feminist science fiction]] scholars and writers.&lt;ref name="scificulture" /&gt; She was also one of the first major science fiction writers to take [[slash fiction]] and its cultural and literary implications seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Popular Romance Studies |url=http://jprstudies.org/2011/03/interview-joanna-russ/ |author1=Francis, Conseula  |author2=Piepmeier, Alison |title=Interview: Joanna Russ |issue=1.2 |date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of her life, she published over fifty short stories. Russ was associated with the [[New Wave science fiction|American New Wave]] of science fiction.&lt;ref name="scholes-rabkin"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Robert | last1=Scholes| authorlink1= Robert Scholes| first2 = Eric S.| last2 = Rabkin|title=Science Fiction: History, Science, Vision| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=London|date=1977|page=93 | chapter = A Brief Literary History of Science Fiction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with her work as a writer of prose fiction, Russ was also a playwright, essayist, and author of nonfiction works, generally literary criticism and feminist theory, including the essay collection ''Magic Mommas, Trembling Sisters, Puritans &amp; Perverts''; ''[[How to Suppress Women's Writing]]''; and the book-length study of modern feminism, ''[[What Are We Fighting For?]]''. Her essays and articles have been published in ''[[Women's Studies Quarterly]]'', ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', ''[[Science Fiction Studies]]'', and ''[[College English]]''. Russ was a self-described [[socialist feminism|socialist feminist]], expressing particular admiration for the work and theories of [[Clara Fraser]] and her [[Freedom Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redletterpress.org/Joanna_Russ_introduction.pdf |title=Revolution, She Wrote: Introduction |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both fiction and nonfiction, for Russ, were modes of engaging theory with the real world; in particular, ''[[The Female Man]]'' can be read as a theoretical or narrative text.  The short story, "When It Changed," which became a part of the novel, explores the constraints of gender and asks if gender is necessary in a society.

Russ's writing is characterized by anger interspersed with humor and irony. [[Alice Sheldon|James Tiptree Jr]], in a letter to her, wrote, "Do you imagine that anyone with half a functional neuron can read your work and not have his fingers smoked by the bitter, multi-layered anger in it? It smells and smoulders like a volcano buried so long and deadly it is just beginning to wonder if it can explode."&lt;ref name="nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu"/&gt; In a letter to Susan Koppelman, Russ asks of a young feminist critic "where is her anger?" and adds "I think from now on, I will not trust anyone who isn't angry."{{sfnp|Russ|1995|p=175}}

For nearly 15 years she was an influential (if intermittent) review columnist for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"/&gt; Though by then she was no longer an active member of [[science fiction fandom]], she was interviewed by phone during [[Wiscon]] (the feminist [[science fiction convention]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]) in 2006 by her friend and member of the same cohort{{vague|date=October 2017}}, [[Samuel R. Delany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broaduniverse.org/broadsheet-archive/the-legendary-joanna-russ-interviewed-by-samuel-r-delany-february-2007-bs-t-0702jrsrd |title=The Legendary Joanna Russ Interviewed by Samuel R.

Her first SF story was "Nor Custom Stale" in F&amp;SF (1959). Notable short works include Hugo winner and Nebula Award finalist "Souls" (1982), Nebula Award and Tiptree Award winner "[[When It Changed]]" (1972), Nebula Award finalists "The Second Inquisition" (1970), "Poor Man, Beggar Man" (1971), "The Extraordinary Voyages of Amélie Bertrand" (1979), and "The Mystery of the Young Gentlemen" (1982).&lt;ref name=locus&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Locus Publications]] |url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2011/04/joanna-russ-1937-2011/ |title=Joanna Russ (1937–2011) |work=Locus Online News |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fiction has been nominated for nine Nebula and three Hugo Awards, and her genre-related scholarly work was recognized with a [[Pilgrim Award]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=sfadb/&gt; Her story "The Autobiography of My Mother" was one of the 1977 [[O.

[[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]. April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote several contributions to feminist thinking about [[pornography]] and sexuality including "Pornography by Women, for Women, with Love" (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pornography by Women, For Women, With Love – Fanlore|url = http://fanlore.org/wiki/Pornography_by_Women,_For_Women,_With_Love|publisher= [[Fanlore]] |accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pornography and the Doubleness of Sex for Women",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pornography and the doubleness of sex for women by Joanna Russ|url = http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC32folder/JoannaRussDoubSex.html|website = www.ejumpcut.org|accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Being Against Pornography",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv52000/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=russ|title = Being Against Pornography|last = Russ|first = Joanna|date = n.d.|journal = University of Oregon Special Collections|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = Box 13, Folder 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be found in her archival pieces located in the University of Oregon's Special Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Archives West: Joanna Russ papers, 1968–1989|url = http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv52000/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=russ|website = archiveswest.orbiscascade.org|accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These essays include very detailed descriptions of her views on pornography and how influential it was to feminist thought in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Specifically, in "Being Against Pornography", she calls pornography a feminist issue. She sees pornography to be the essence of evil in society, calling it "a monolithic, easily recognizable, uniquely evil essence; and at the same time, commercially available, explicit, sexual fantasy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her issues with pornography range from feminist issues, to women's sexuality in general and how porn prevents women from freely express their sexual selves, like men can.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Russ believed that [[anti-pornography]] [[ACTivists|activists]] were not addressing how women experienced pornography created by men, a topic that she addressed in "Being Against Pornography",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; she directly addresses the issue in her multiple published and unpublished essays.

==Reputation and legacy==
Her work is widely taught in courses on science fiction and feminism throughout the English speaking world.  Russ is the subject of [[Farah Mendlesohn]]'s book ''On Joanna Russ'' and Jeanne Cortiel's ''Demand My Writing: Joanna Russ, Feminism, Science Fiction''.&lt;ref name="sfwa" /&gt; Russ and her work are prominently featured in Sarah LeFanu's'' Chinks in the World Machine: Feminism and Science Fiction'' (1988). She was named to the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=sfadb/&gt;&lt;ref name=sffhof2013/&gt;

Her papers are part of the University of Oregon's Special Collections and University Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://around.uoregon.edu/story/academics/celebrating-csws-40th-le-guin-feminist-science-fiction-fellowship|title=Celebrating CSWS 40th with the Le Guin Feminist Science Fiction Fellowship|publisher=University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The late 1960s and 1970s marked the beginnings of feminist SF scholarship—a field of inquiry that was all but created single-handedly by Russ, who contributed many essays on feminism and science fiction that appeared in journals such as ''[[College English]]'' and ''[[Science Fiction Studies]]''.&lt;ref name="Yaszek, Lisa 2009"&gt;Yaszek, Lisa. "A History of One's Own: Joanna Russ and the Creation of a Feminist SF Tradition". In {{harvp|Mendlesohn|2009|pages=31–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also contributed 25 reviews to the ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', covering more than 100 books of all genres.&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"&gt;James, Edward. "Russ on Writing Science Fiction and Reviewing It". In {{harvp|Mendlesohn|2009|pages=19–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In their article "Learning the 'Prophet Business': The Merril-Russ Intersection," Newell and Tallentire described Russ as an "intelligent, tough-minded reviewer who routinely tempered harsh criticism with just the sort of faint praise she handed out to [[Judith Merril]]", who in turn was among the foremost editors and critics in American science fiction in the late 1960s. Russ was also described as a fearless, incisive, and radical person, whose writing was often characterized as acerbic and angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=Carl Howard |title=Critical Theory and Science Fiction |location=Hanover |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0819563996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russ was acclaimed as one of science fiction's most revolutionary and accomplished writers. [[Helen Merrick]] went so far as to claim that Russ was an inescapable figure in science fiction history. [[James Tiptree, Jr.]] once commented on how Russ could be an "absolute delight" one minute, but then she "rushes out and bites my ankles with one sentence".&lt;ref&gt;Merrick, Helen. "The Female 'Atlas' of Science Fiction? Russ, Feminism and the SF Community".  In {{harvp|Mendlesohn|2009|pages=48–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Russ criticized [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s 1969 ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', which won both the 1969 [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]] and 1970 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo]] awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women. According to Russ, Le Guin's novel represented these stereotypes.

However, Russ was well aware of the pressures of writing for a living since she was also an author herself. Russ also felt that science fiction gives something to its readers that cannot be easily acquired anywhere else. She maintained that science should be accurate, and seriousness is a virtue.&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"/&gt; She insisted on the unique qualities of her chosen genre, maintaining that science fiction shared certain qualities with art and its flexibility compared to other forms writing. Russ was also interested in demonstrating the unique potentials of women science fiction writers.&lt;ref name="Yaszek, Lisa 2009"/&gt; As her career moved into its second decade in the 1980s, she started to worry about reviewing standards. She once said, "The reviewer's hardest task is to define standards."&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"/&gt;

Russ's reviewing style was characterized by anger. She was attacked by readers because of her harsh reviews of [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[Lord Foul's Bane]]'' (1977) and [[Joy Chant]]'s ''[[The Grey Mane of Morning]]'' (1977). She organized attacks into these seven categories, taken directly from the cited article:&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"/&gt;
*Don't shove your politics into your reviews. Just review the books. "I will," Russ said, "when authors keep politics out of their books."
*You don't prove what you say; you just assert it. "There is no way to "prove" anything in aesthetic or moral matters."
*Then your opinion is purely subjective. "I might be subjective, but not arbitrary. It is based on a critic's whole education."
*Everyone's entitled to his [sic] own opinion. "Writing is a craft too, and it can be judged. And some opinions are worth a good deal more than others."
*I knew it. You're a snob. "Science fiction is a small world that often doesn't look outside of its own bounds."
*You're vitriolic too. "The only way to relieve oneself of the pain that has to be endured by reading every line is to express one's opinions vividly, precisely, and compactly."
*Never mind all that stuff. Just tell me what I'd enjoy reading. "Bless you, what makes you think I know?"

However, she felt guilty about dire and frank criticism. She apologized for her harsh words on [[Lloyd Biggle]]'s ''[[The Light That Never Was]]'' (1972) by saying, "It's narsty to beat up on authors who are probably starving to death on turnip soup (ghoti soup) but critics ought to be honest."&lt;ref name="James, Edward 2009"/&gt;

==Health problems==
In her later life she published little, largely due to [[chronic pain]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref name=cfs&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews: Joanna Russ |url=http://feministsf.org/reviews/russ.j.html|work=Feminist Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Utopia|accessdate=September 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2011, it was reported that Russ had been admitted to a [[hospice]] after suffering a series of strokes. [[Samuel R. Delany]] was quoted as saying that Russ was "slipping away" and had long had a "[[do not resuscitate]]" order on file.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven H Silver|Silver, Steven H.]] (April 27, 2011).

==Creation and conception==
[[File:Sting 21111985 06 700.jpg|thumb|left|The singer-songwriter [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was the visual inspiration of the character.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;]]
John Constantine first appeared in 1985 as a recurring character in the [[horror comics|horror]] series ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', in which he acted as a "supernatural advisor" to [[Swamp Thing|the main character]].&lt;ref name=toonopedia1&gt;{{cite web| last = Markstein| first = Don| title = Don Markstein's Toonopedia: John Constantine| url=http://www.toonopedia.com/helblazr.htm| accessdate = May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these early appearances, Constantine was depicted as a sorcerer of questionable morality, whose appearance was based on that of the musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (specifically, as Sting appeared in the films ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' and ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]''). [[Alan Moore]] created the character after artists [[Steve Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]], who were fans of [[The Police]], expressed a desire to draw a character who looked like Sting.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web| last = Christensen| first = William A.| title = The Unexplored Medium (Wizard Magazine November 1993)
| url=http://www.qusoor.com/hellblazer/Sting.htm| accessdate = May 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Alan Moore On (Just About) Everything", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #106 (March 1986), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; They had already drawn at least one character in Sting's likeness, a briefly glimpsed background figure wearing a black-and-red-striped T-shirt in ''Swamp Thing'' #25 (1984), who was later retroactively declared to be John Constantine. In his earliest Swamp Thing appearances, the character is drawn with a marked resemblance to Sting, and in ''Swamp Thing'' #51, Constantine appears on a boat with the name ''The Honourable Gordon Sumner'' on the bow.

John Constantine's official debut was not until ''Swamp Thing'' #37, when he was drawn by [[Rick Veitch]]. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #4, his second official appearance in a cameo role, shipped two weeks prior to the release of Swamp Thing #37. In ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #4, written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[George Perez]], Constantine is wearing a green suit as opposed to his more traditional black suit and tan trenchcoat ensemble.  Moore describes Constantine as being drawn from a number of "really good ideas... about serial killers, the [[Winchester Mystery House|Winchester House]], and... want[ing] to draw Sting in a story."&lt;ref name="TCJ-42"&gt;"Alan Moore On (Just About) Everything", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #106 (March 1986), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Calling these disparate strands a "big intellectual puzzle", Constantine was the result of "fit[ting] it all together."&lt;ref name="TCJ-42"/&gt; Initially created "purely to get Sting into the story", by the time of the 1985 [[San Diego ComicCon]], Moore stated that "It's turning into something more than that now."&lt;ref name="TCJ-42"/&gt; Veitch's contribution was to give Constantine an earring, something he considered risque for 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050228/NEWS/502280387&amp;SearchID=73201566900517 |title=Vermont-Hollywood 'Synchronicity' : Rutland Herald Online |publisher=Rutlandherald.com |date=February 28, 2005 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 1985 about the similarities between John Constantine and the character [[Baron Winters]] (from Marv Wolfman and [[Gene Colan]]'s ''[[Night Force]]''), Moore revealed that he was a "big fan" of Wolfman and ''Night Force'', but that there was "no intention to rip off Baron Winters".&lt;ref name="TCJ-42"/&gt; He said:

{{quote|With Constantine, I don't know who I was thinking of. I just wanted this character who knows everything, and knows everybody—really charismatic. Who knows nuns, politicians and bikers, and who is never at a loss for what to do. I suppose there is a similarity with Baron Winters in that he is another manipulative character who has a bunch of agents working with him.&lt;ref name="TCJ-42"/&gt;}}

Constantine and Winters met each other during Moore's run on ''Swamp Thing'' and again in Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Books of Magic]]''.

Speaking to comics magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' in 1993, Moore elaborated:

{{quote|One of those early notes was they both wanted to do a character that looked like Sting. I think DC is terrified that Sting will sue them, although Sting has seen the character and commented in ''Rolling Stone'' that he thought it was great. He was very flattered to have a comic character who looked like him, but DC gets nervous about these things. They started to eradicate all traces of references in the introduction of the early Swamp Thing books to John Constantine's resemblance to Sting. But I can state categorically that the character only existed because Steve and John wanted to do a character that looked like Sting. Having been given that challenge, how could I fit Sting into ''Swamp Thing''? I have an idea that most of the mystics in comics are generally older people, very austere, very proper, very middle class in a lot of ways. They are not at all functional on the street. It struck me that it might be interesting for once to do an almost blue-collar [[warlock]]. Somebody who was streetwise, working class, and from a different background than the standard run of comic book mystics. Constantine started to grow out of that.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;}}

In 1988, Constantine was given his own title, ''[[Hellblazer]]''. In 1993, at the launch of DC's [[Vertigo Comics]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], ''Hellblazer'' was made an official Vertigo publication.  It was the longest continuously published Vertigo title.&lt;ref name="vert-hell"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

In an interview, Milligan told [[Newsarama]]:

{{quote|Yeah. Sorry about that. I felt pretty bad and it was quite strange, sitting on a few panels and then having a few interviews where I couldn't actually say that I'd be writing Constantine for DCU. I have to say, though, that that didn't change what I said, which I still stand by. Namely that as far as I'm concerned, it's important that the Vertigo Constantine and the DCU Constantine are kept separate, with no cross-over things going on. The DCU Constantine has to be the guy we know and love, with his same failings—otherwise what's the point of using him? But as I'm writing him he's younger and has perhaps been through a bit less than the battered aging old sod we meet in Vertigo. Unlike my Vertigo Constantine, the guy we see in ''JLA Dark'' is definitely not married! I also said and believe that the average DC reader—Vertigo and DCU—is sophisticated enough to be able to read both versions without getting confused.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html |title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=9 June 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beginning in ''Justice League Dark'' #9, [[Jeff Lemire]] assumed writing duties on the series, replacing Milligan who had remained on the Vertigo title. Lemire said he considers ''Justice League Dark'' his dream gig at DC Comics because Constantine is one of his all-time favourite characters not just in comics, but in all fiction. Lemire also teased that while Constantine, [[Zatanna]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] would remain on the roster, the team would change in his opening arc and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2012/01/31/jeff-lemire-takes-on-justice-league-dark |title=Jeff Lemire takes on Justice League Dark|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
Although a compassionate [[humanism|humanist]] who struggles to overcome the influence of both [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] over humanity, and despite his [[Antihero|occasional forays into heroism]], Constantine is a foul-mouthed, disillusioned, [[British people|British]] [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]] who pursues a life of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and danger. His motivation has been attributed to an [[adrenaline]] addiction that only the strange and mysterious can sate. He also seems to be something of a "Weirdness Magnet" (a term also used to describe [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]).
[[Image:Hellblazer51.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|John Constantine discusses his previous girlfriends and boyfriends.]]

Constantine is shown to be someone with a wide and international circle of contacts and allies, and is adept at making friends. At the same time, his close friends inevitably suffer or are outright killed simply by being in his life; this has left a severe mark on him. In #69, when the King of Vampires killed the man sleeping beside him and casually asked if he'd been a friend, John replied "Must be. He's dead."

Constantine is [[bisexuality|bisexual]], which was first established in a 1992 comic which referred offhandedly to his having ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends. Early stories exclusively showed him dating women, although Brian Azzarello's ''Ashes &amp; Dust in the City of Angels'' showed him as having relationships with men as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article1289712.ece |title=Hellblazer's sassy controller|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=February 15, 2009 |date=January 7, 2007  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith |first=John| title=Hellblazer: Counting to Ten| issue=51| date=March 1992| publisher= Vertigo / DC Comics|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The relaunch ''Constantine the Hellblazer'' #1 (2015) reaffirmed Constantine's bisexuality through his interactions with male and female characters in the issue.&lt;ref name="io9bi"/&gt;

Constantine also has a reputation as being one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world.&lt;ref name="Hellblazer #239"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laughing Magician|author=Andy Diggle|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40121-853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Constantine rarely uses magic, instead choosing to use his wits to trick his opponents. Constantine is also referred to as "The Constant One"&lt;ref name="Hellblazer #239"/&gt; because of his whole family tree being somewhat connected to the occult. Many of his ancestors are sorcerers from different eras of history, and have taken part in many known historical events. Some of his ancestors have roles in other works outside Hellblazer, such as ''Batman: The Order of Beasts'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' and ''[[Books of Magic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qusoor.com/hellblazer/familytree.htm|title=The Constantine Family Tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Constantine has worn many clothes over the years, he was originally portrayed as often wearing a blue pin-stripe suit, tan trench coat, and occasionally gloves. As the series progressed, his trademark attire became a grungier (or perhaps the same, just older) [[trench coat]], white shirt, and black tie, but eventually{{issue|date=November 2015}} returned more to his earlier fashion. Constantine smokes [[Silk Cut]] cigarettes, consuming thirty or so a day.&lt;ref name=Habits&gt;{{Cite book| last=Ennis | first=Garth | title=[[Dangerous Habits|Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits]] | publisher=Vertigo| date=March 1, 1994 | isbn=1-56389-150-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine also occasionally breaks the [[fourth wall]], where he talks to the reader and narrates the story himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer: Son of Man|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40120-202-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real time aging===
Constantine is unusual among comic book characters in that he has aged in real time since his creation.&lt;ref name=toonopedia2&gt;{{cite web|last=DelGrosso |first=David |title=ComicsGeekSpeak.com Aging with John Constantine |url=http://www.comicgeekspeak.com/articles/hellblazerPart1_1.php |accessdate=May 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426132033/http://www.comicgeekspeak.com/articles/hellblazerPart1_1.php |archivedate=April 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first year of his solo series, Constantine celebrated his 35th birthday.

In a 2011 interview, DC co-publisher [[Dan DiDio]] said that "Constantine in the Vertigo universe is in his 60s, and what you have in the DC Universe is a character who is markedly younger".&lt;ref name="didio" /&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Youth===
In Constantine's early appearances in ''Swamp Thing'', his past was a mystery; his life as a child and young adult was not developed until [[Jamie Delano]]'s ''Hellblazer'' stories. John Constantine was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]] (now [[Merseyside]]) on May 10, 1953. His mother, Mary Anne, died giving birth to John and his stillborn twin brother because an earlier abortion—forced on her by John's father, Thomas—had weakened her womb. Because he was unable to accept responsibility for his wife's death, Thomas blamed John and the pair grew up with a deep dislike for one another.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer vol.4: The Family Man|author=Jamie Delano|publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-40121-964-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in the womb, John strangled his twin brother with his own umbilical cord; in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], the twin survives to become the well-loved and well-adjusted magician that John never was.&lt;ref name=Bogeyman&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer vol.5: The Bogeyman|author1=Jamie Delano |author2=Garth Ennis |publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-40123-802-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their childhood, John and his older sister Cheryl lived briefly with their aunt and uncle in [[Northampton]] to escape from their father's [[alcoholism]] and subsequent imprisonment for stealing a female neighbour's underwear. They moved back to Liverpool when their father was released. John's bloodline and ancestry were known as the Laughing Magicians, legendary mages who have the power over [[synchronicity]] and were infamous for bluffing and tricking gods.&lt;ref name="Hellblazer #239" /&gt; This ancestry later drives John Constantine to partake in his lineage and practice magic. One of John's first acts of magic, as a child, was to hide all of his childhood innocence and vulnerability in a box to rid himself of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Jenkins | first =Paul | title =Hellblazer/[[The Books of Magic]] Book One: Ascent  | publisher =Vertigo | date = December 1997 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 1960s, a teenage John ran away from home, but not before a botched curse caused his father to become withered and frail. John eventually made his permanent home in London in 1969, rooming with [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Francis "Chas" Chandler]], a young man who has since gone on to become John's closest—and longest surviving—friend.

During the 1970s, John became involved in [[occult]] circles in London. He travelled other countries and visited San Francisco, where he met, and subsequently began a relationship with, the female magician [[Zatanna|Zatanna Zatara]] (in DC's [[The New 52]], however, the two met in New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Justice League Dark 0|author=Jeff Lemire|publisher=DC comics|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He also became enamoured of [[punk rock]]; after seeing the [[Sex Pistols]] at the Roxy Club in London in 1977, John cut his long hair, called himself Johnny Con-Job, and formed his own band, Mucous Membrane, whose members included Chandler (as a roadie), a drummer named Beano and fellow Liverpudlian Gary Lester. They later released an album called ''[[Venus of the Hardsell]]''. John also performed as a famous [[stage magician]] in the 1980s, where he became famous for predicting the assassination attempt on U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellblazer No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

John's first venture into occult "heroism" was a disaster. On tour with Mucous Membrane at the Casanova Club in Newcastle, he found the aftermath of a magical orgy gone horribly wrong: an abused child, Astra Logue, had conjured a hideous monster that took revenge on her father, the club's debauched owner, and the other adults who were tormenting her, and the monster refused to leave. With typical recklessness, John convinced some members of the band, along with several occultist friends, to try destroying the creature by summoning a demon of their own. Unfortunately, this demon was not under their control and after it had destroyed the child's monster, it tormented Constantine's friends and took the child to [[Hell]]. John had summoned the demon by one of its names, but not its true name - [[Nergal]] - which would have been required to bind and control the demon. Nergal would go on to be a regular antagonist throughout the series. John suffered a nervous breakdown after this incident, and was committed to Ravenscar Psychiatric Hospital, which he drifted in and out of over the years.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Constantine, John | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 87 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guilt of Astra hung over him for many years until, in his mid-forties, he used some magic and con-artistry to free not only her, but also the souls of all the other children trapped in Hell. As for the rest of the "Newcastle Crew", the incident left the group both physically and psychologically scarred. After helping [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] retrieve his sands, Dream in turn relieves Constantine of the nightmares that had plagued him since the incident.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (vol. 1) No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occult "hero"===
John is later freed from Ravenscar by London gangsters, threatening to torture and kill his sister and her family unless he helps to resurrect a mob boss's dead son. Knowing that resurrection is impossible even by magical means, John instead summons a demon to take the boy's place; a desperate act that has bloody consequences many years later. Years later, John was able to reconvene the surviving members of the "Newcastle Crew" to help with his investigation of the Brujería cult, as seen in ''Swamp Thing'' Nos. 37–49. The [[cult]] murdered most of them, including John's then-lover, Emma. These people, and others who have died due to John's carelessness, have continued to appear to him as silent, reproachful [[ghost]]s. Chas is the most prominent one of very few human friends to have survived a long-term association with John.

John first met [[Swamp Thing]] in 1985 after being interested in the creature. John later acts as the Swamp Thing's protector, guide, and voice of omen, even teaching the Thing to amplify his powers. Both would have further adventure with each other, such as John introducing the Thing to the [[Parliament of Trees]], Thing using John's body to make love to his wife and father a child named Tefe, and fighting off the Damnation Army from summoning the [[Anti-Christ]]. Both carry a dull, but nevertheless fruitful friendship with each other. Constantine even invites Swamp Thing to his 40th birthday and assures the Thing he'll try not to bother him again. In 1991 while in his late thirties, John contracted terminal [[lung cancer]]. During this time, he sought the help of a dying friend, Brendan, who had sold his soul to the [[First of the Fallen]], the most powerful lord of Hell. When the First came to collect the soul, John tricked him into drinking [[holy water]], which rendered him helpless and prevented him from collecting the friend's soul at the appointed time.&lt;ref name="Habits" /&gt;

For this, the First promised to make John suffer unprecedented torment in Hell when he dies. Slowly dying from cancer, John hatched a plan to save himself from eternal torment. He secretly sold his soul to the other two Lords of Hell. When they discovered Constantine's actions they realized that they could not allow him to die, or else they would be forced to go to all-out war over his soul, a war whose only winner would be "the Lord of the Hosts," i.e., [[God]] and his [[angel]]s. They were also far too stubborn and proud, however, to enter anything resembling an alliance. As a result, they were forced to cure John of his cancer.&lt;ref name="Habits" /&gt; This led to the First plotting a grand revenge on Constantine, who manipulated the demon via his ally Ellie, a [[succubus]], into coming into a trap; the plan only barely succeeded, and while the First was temporarily defeated many of John's friends were killed.

Constantine then went on to have a series of adventures and misadventures playing the role of puppet and puppeteer with his signature style and profane sarcasm. He managed to free Astra and every other child in Hell, but at the cost of the First returning to power; also, as part of the scheme, John's worst attributes were given separate existence as "Demon Constantine" which meant he himself could not go to Hell. As part of an attempt to regain his nastier edge, he used [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], and this led to her taking out a revenge scheme in 1998 that forced him to turn to the First for help; Ellie ended up in Hell and several of John's oldest friends left him. John, being tired of all this, contacted [[God]].&lt;ref name="God#1"/&gt; God appears and the two converse in a campfire. John then tells him his reason for contacting Him. He warns God that if his soul is ever sent to Hell, he would easily take over, and do nasty things such as unleashing the demons and locking away Hell so that the damned cannot enter and have no resting place. John blackmails God to do his bidding, and that's to keep his soul away from Hell. God, knowing of John's abilities, does so. But warns him of what will come next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/comics/ongoing/hb128.html|title=Straight To Hell : A Hellblazer Site|first=John|last=McMahon|website=www.insanerantings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 21st century===
[[File:HellblazerCVR189.jpg|thumb|right|Constantine's appearance in late 2003. Cover art to ''Hellblazer'' #189. Art by [[Tim Bradstreet]].]]
On return to Britain in 2003 and after reconciling with his sister (who believed he was dead), he went on to be involved in a magic war in London and was horrified to find his niece Gemma, whom he'd wanted to keep out of this life, had become a [[witch]]. He soon ended up organising a counterstrike against a creature known as the Shadow Dog, having been warned of its coming and believing it was an entity that brought death and madness; instead, it was a guardian against the true enemy, the Beast, who was manipulating John into giving it free access to humanity. In the process, he was rendered an amnesiac, leaving him vulnerable to the schemes of the demon Rosacarnis. To get his memories back, he had to spend a day in her service, in which she had him father three demonic children, who went on to massacre anyone who knew Constantine, from friends to enemies to people who'd only briefly met him. Among them was his sister Cheryl; one of his sons had exploited her husband's [[religious fanaticism]] to make him see his wife as a witch&amp;nbsp;— and thus a person to be killed. This forced Constantine to go on journey to Hell in the hopes to return his sister's soul. Accompanying him was Nergal, the demon he thought he had killed by sending him to the border of Heaven.

While in Hell, John and Nergal met the demon Constantine, who tried to kill the original one. John was forced to let Nergal enter his body in order to finish him. Later they also encountered Ellie, who seemed to have quite pardoned John for him selling her out to the First. She was not subject to any torture or punishment, either. The couple finally arrived at Rosacarnis' hall, where there was a feast with all three of Constantine's children, the First, and many demons from all [[Hell]]. Because of Nergal's earlier possession of his body, any damage done to John would be mirrored on Nergal. Nergal, however, calls the bluff, showing that the effect goes both ways by clawing at his chest slightly. John begs Rosacarnis to kill him to save his sister, but just as she's about to, the First of the Fallen intervenes and immediately kills Rosacarnis, since Constantine's soul is his by "right of insult" and will only be taken when he deems fit. The First also kills Rosacarnis' two sons, but spares the daughter, who had been dealing with issues of identity and had doubts about whether she wanted to continue to exist.

Following this, the First commands Nergal to release the soul he's holding. Cheryl's soul is pure and innocent and does not belong in Hell, but the First offers her a truly devilish deal. Informing her that her husband, Constantine's brother-in-law Tony, has killed himself with her blood still staining his hands, thus making him twice damned, and offering to fairly divide her husband's punishment between the two of them if she stays of her own free will. Constantine attempts in vain to argue that Tony murdered her and does not deserve that mercy. Despite all that has happened, Cheryl still loves her husband enough to accept the First's deal and decides to stay. Constantine can do nothing as the First gloats over his victory and then sends him back home. Unable to look at his niece Gemma's tear-filled eyes because of his failure, Constantine runs barefoot down the stairs and into the [[Liverpool]] night.

===Lost brother===
John later revisits Ravenscar Asylum, the place where he was thrown after being framed for Astra's murder. John remembers all the maltreatment he suffered, and remembers every suffering and guilt he had for the past years. At first it appears as though it is too much for him and that he will be overtaken by the images of the ones he has hurt, but the being turns into the form of a baby. This baby, who is the sum of all his guilt and self-hatred, is then promptly thrown off a cliff near the asylum and into the sea. After killing the creature, Constantine is now free, and becomes even a bit more cocky and picks back up his earlier style from the beginning of his book and his appearances from Swamp Thing: a double-breasted blue suit underneath his trench coat, and slicked-back gelled hair.

Later on, a [[Sudan]]ese [[shaman]] who had first bound the hunger demon Mnemoth&lt;ref name=origin /&gt; has been having dreams of Constantine and a war-mage named Mako who is coming to kill him and devour his being. The reason that Constantine is a specific target of the war-mage is because he is "The Laughing Magician" who is also known as "The Constant One." Mako wants to devour him so he can absorb that power and have his being made a fixture of the universe. To counter this attack to come, the African magus puts a dream of his into a tree root, with Constantine's true nature in those dreams. After doing this a young man is sent as a messenger to find John and deliver the message. Constantine later notices that something is wrong on the synchronicity lines and it seems that he is going head first against the traffic. Remembering that Mako mentioned Ravenscar when he found out about Constantine, he tries to summon his unborn brother, but instead is summoned to his brother. The soul of Constantine's brother tells John that he was not to be born and that it should have been he who had been born instead, as he is the Laughing Magician, he requests that he and John merge their souls so that they become one and can fix the world, they had previously attempted this but John was apparently too strong willed. John then makes the link that it was the soul of his unborn brother that caused him to get [[cancer]] and for his relationships to fail, and that anytime he tried to take control of his life, something bad would happen to make John weaker, so that the souls might be able to merge. After realizing this, John cuts the soul of his brother out of his own soul, so that he can control his life and live his way.

===Later life===
In the 2010s, John entangles himself in further adventures. He goes to India and fights a ghost of a British soldier of the Sepoy rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;Hellblazer: India&lt;/ref&gt; fights a Babylonian shape shifter named Julian, gets his thumb cut off to contact [[Shade: The Changing Man]], marrying a young girl named Epiphany Greaves who was also the daughter of an infamous gangster,&lt;ref&gt;Hellblazer: Bloody Carnations&lt;/ref&gt; looking for his lost trench coat that his niece sold, finding his sister's long lost son named Finn, and finally getting his sister's soul from Hell.

By 2013, John was contacted by the [[Moirai|Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally die in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, John happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the 5th day came, John Constantine was murdered in his own home when he was ambushed and killed by a gangster. His funeral was attended by many of his friends and family. But it later turns out that he had faked his death yet again. Constantine decides he should keep a low profile, because he doesn't want to hurt the people around him again. He bids farewell with Finn and Epiphany, and finally visits Gemma. In the meanwhile, Gemma, hearing about her uncle's return from the Fates, tries to kill herself with a poisonous revolver, but Constantine sneaks the last remaining dart from his niece. Gemma says her life will be better without him, because he takes up too much of it and she is either hating him or loving him too much. John suggests he leave her be, but Gemma fears he will return and put her life to misery. John tells Gemma to make her own decision, and she reluctantly points the revolver at him. Gemma closes her eyes before muttering, "Damn you, John Constantine." and pulls the trigger, but when she opened her eyes again, Constantine had vanished. The last scene shows Constantine in the Long Journey's End bar, holding a glass of liquor with a vacant look.

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]], Constantine appears as one of the lead characters in ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.&lt;ref name="ewtucker"&gt;{{cite news |title=A new Swamp Thing, a new Frankenstein, and more: DC Comics will roll out more new #1s |first=Ken |last=Tucker |authorlink=Ken Tucker |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-swamp-thing-frankenstein/ |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His history is slightly altered, such as meeting [[Zatanna]] in New York instead of San Francisco, and the origins of how he got his trademark trench coat. During the gap where he travels the world to learn magic, the New 52 added the history of him meeting Nick Necro, who was implied to be John's mentor and original owner of the trench coat. The ''[[Forever Evil: Blight]]'' storyline would establish that the three characters were all involved in a magical pact and a love triangle, which fell apart due to Zatanna ending her relationship with Nick to pursue John. Nick states "We were '''all''' in love, and you two shut me out!"&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'' No. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The character also stars in the ongoing series ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'', which replaces ''Hellblazer''.
He is still an unsavory trickster in the New 52 universe, as, while during the Trinity War between the three Justice Leagues, he tries to trick Shazam (15-year-old Billy Batson) so that he can steal his magic. He fails, causing Billy to become even more distrustful of other people than he already was.

In ''Constantine'' #14, it was revealed that John Constantine, as a boy, was taught and cast his first magical spell&amp;mdash;at the cost of the lives of his parents and his house burning down (it was implied that his mother, unlike in [[Hellblazer]], survived the childbirth). It was also revealed that he spent his childhood in the '80s in Liverpool, England (it is not shown if he had any sibling, like Cheryl Constantine in Hellblazer). The one who taught John his first spell was Tannarak from the Cult of the Cold Flame (''Constantine'' #15).

His primary enemies in ''Constantine'' are [[Mister E]], Sargon the Sorceress (the original [[Sargon the Sorcerer|Sargon]]'s daughter), and Tannarak: all are members of the Cult of the Cold Flame. Together with his allies [[Papa Midnite]], the psychic mage Spellbinder, and a witch called Julia Everheart, Constantine attempts to destroy the Cult by conspiring a scam to take Sargon and Tannarak by surprise. However, prior to the planned battle, Constantine is thrown into the battlefield in [[Dar es Salaam]] in [[World War I]] because of a ritual going wrong, making his plan ultimately fail. An encounter with [[Doctor Occult]] there results in Constantine being transported to Earth-2 - a world dying under siege from Darkseid and his army of Parademons.

In Earth-2, he is assaulted by the Parademons, but [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]] comes and rescues him, before trapping him to open a gateway to escape the dying Earth. Constantine manages to convince Wotan to spare his life, then works with the ancient sorcerer to open a door through his body to Earth-0. As Wotan enters the doorway, he is split into two halves, because there are two John Constantines in this world: the original Constantine and the native one of Earth-2, who is surrounded by his friends and even gets married. After the death of Wotan, Constantine resolves to find his Earth-2 counterpart. He travels to Liverpool and witnesses all the horror and despair of the dying world. As soon as John reached the destination, he is shocked to find his "parents" (actually the Earth-2 John's parents), his friends Gary Lester, Chas Chandler and his former love interest Maureen still alive.

The Earth-2 John quickly attacks him by grabbing him in the neck, but they are engulfed in visions of their lives in parallel right after: a dangerous life marred with sorcery, adventures and regrets of Earth-0 John and a much quieter, much happier life of Earth-2 John. Constantine quickly earns the trust of the Earth-2 family, who consider him to be a wonder. Together, they escape to a warehouse where John instructs them to draw sigils to cast a complex spell. As John is lecturing about the unpredictability and the price of magic, [[Doctor Fate]] appears in front of his eyes, claims to have foreseen his arrival and offers to help him.

Doctor Fate reminds John of an incoming horde of Parademons and tells him to quickly cast the spell to escape from the dying world, himself hoping to flee with John and the family too. John discovers that the spell requires one Constantine dies: either himself or the Earth-2 John. As the Parademons storm in and take each family member down one by one, John is torn over between saving his own life and let the good, honest Earth-2 John live by sacrificing himself. Finally, he chooses to save his own skin: as he is kissing the other John, he holds his hand and drives the knife into his heart, ultimately kills the "other John". As the spells start working, John casts an additional spell to trick Doctor Fate, which masks his presence from the ancient sorcerer, then departs, brings along the family members and many other people.

By killing the "proper" Constantine, he earns the wrath and hatred of the Earth-2 family. Being called "Devil", John corrects the family when they reach Heaven while peeling through the layers of the dying world: Heaven itself, also under assault from Darkseid's force, has closed its door and started departing, deems this world beyond salvation. Later, John and his entourage are attacked by Doctor Fate, who manages to detect Constantine's whereabout. Despite succeeding in countering the assault, John loses his "mother" Mary-Anne, who is dragged back by Fate's chain. This greatly traumatizes Thomas Constantine, John's father, who even attempts to commit suicide, but is talked out of it by John.

After a long and hard trip, Constantine finally makes it back home, but Darkseid has sensed him and is in hot pursuit. As the menacing hand of the Apokolips God is reaching to him, Constantine enacts his "last trick": by sacrificing some souls of his entourage, John manages to get enough power to cast the "Ring of Dolus" spell, which uses every happy memories, every pleasant thought, every piece of hope in John Constantine to swirl a magical "web" made of lies. This powerful spell helps John projecting an illusion of an already dead universe to fool Darkseid, while John manages to bring himself, the family and the Earth-2 civilians to safety - he even ''pickpockets'' some survivors back from Darkseid's clutch.

As Constantine lands in the Jurassic Coast, England, he is confronted by Thomas, who points a gun at his head. Tired of everything, John yells at his father, begs him to kill him off for good. Unable to do it, Thomas drops his gun, but Maureen quickly puts it up and prepares to shoot John while questioning his actions. John contemplates and sees that he is no hero, but he is the only one willing to sacrifice "proper John" to save his family, or trade a hundred people for the safety of six billion. He magically teleports away, leaves the family and the survivors behind. Later, John goes back to New York and visits his old friend Lloyd at his bar to tell him about his latest adventures.

The New 52 ''Constantine'' series ends at issue #23 and was relaunched as ''Constantine: The Hellblazer'' written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV in June 2015.

The ''Constantine'' [[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]] tie-in tells the story of John Constantine five years into a possible future of the New 52 universe. He somehow obtains the ultimate occult artifact, the Helmet of Fate, and manages to trick and kill the ancient magician Nabu with the help of an old [[ifrit]].

John Constantine's origin in the New 52 universe is seemingly retconned in the Secret Origins series. In the story, a group of kids in Liverpool manages to get their hands on an occult book and uses it to summon a magical creature called ''Legendbreaker'' to discover Constantine's true origin. Instead, the creature tells three conflicting stories: one featuring John's mother dead in childbirth, leaving him to his abusive father; another have John Constantine being born in a loving family with proud and doting parents; the last one is a John born in an unremarkable family, but his older sister is mad and (probably) possessed by a dark force. They all lead to the death of his entire family and set the path for John Constantine into the world of magic, to the fateful incident in Newcastle, albeit the actions and consequences are different. The creature tries to claim the souls of the young "mystics", but the real John Constantine shows up and chases it away. He tells the kids to go back home, forget what has just happened, and his true origins will forever remain unknown - but it does not matter.

John Constantine stars in the DC You title ''Constantine: The Hellblazer'' written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV. The title introduces John in a new outfit and new hairstyle, in his own adventures, unrelated to superheroes business.

Constantine uses magic to trick a cashier in a clothes store and gets himself a new suit. He pickpockets a passengers, uses the money to buy a meal in a small restaurant and gets acquainted to its owner Oliver, a single father of two daughters. As John is busy chatting and flirting with Oliver, an old "friend", the demon Blythe, pulls John away and convinces him to help them solve their problems in their latest business place, a soul farm. They want John to eliminate their business partner, which John completes, and he also cons Blythe to banish herself back to Hell. Suddenly, John sees his entire ghost entourage, and Gary Lester's ghost - who has tried to warn him since the beginning - tells him that Frank North's spirit had vanished completely, and something had been after John's ghosts. John tries to set up a scheme to lure and trap the entity which had been after his ghosts, by ramping up quite a number of ghosts from 'haunted sites'. The plan fails and Gary Lester's ghost is also taken by the being. After a few flashbacks and meeting with an old acquaintance named Georgie, John begins to unravel the true identity of the ghost-hunting entity, as his (and Georgie's) old time lover, Veronica. After releasing Veronica's soul, Constantine starts to notice (and is also warned by other beings whom he deems as 'friends') the increasing number of supernatural activities in New York city. Being part of Neron's grand scheme, John manages to con (after quite a bit of struggle) Neron into thinking the souls he had claim to be worthless, and leaves New York city for good. Albeit the cost of Oliver's soul which Blythe had claimed by previously blackmailing the latter and John with the souls of his daughters.

===Rebirth===

In "The Hellblazer: Rebirth", John gets back to London to remove the curse placed upon him (originally shown in ''Constantine'' #3, which makes him physically sick whenever he sets foot on London soil) and resumes his adventures in the new DC rebirth-initiative ''The Hellblazer''. The series restores many of the traditional aspects of the original ''Hellblazer'' run while still remaining firmly in the larger DC Universe, restoring his original backstory and featuring old allies such as Chas, Mercury and Swamp Thing.

John Constantine returns to England and is greeted by his old time friend, Chas Chandler, at the airport. He resolves to dispel the curse, set on him by a demon called "Laughing Boy" whom he once crossed in the past, by using a ritual that deflect the curse from him to 8 million souls in London. Shazam and Wonder Woman make an appearance - they notice the ravens in London dying and prepare to intervene, while Swamp Thing appears before them and tells them that they should trust Constantine on this one.  The "Laughing Boy" demon tells John that he will return Astra's soul if John agrees to cancel his spell. However, it turns out that John is buying time for the psychic Mercury, who is now a young woman, to arrive and tell him the real name of "Laughing Boy" (Nybbas). John takes control of the demon, cancels the curse and London returns to normal.

In the past, the djinn have tried to hide away the secret of their existence from human. One djinn, named Marid, was stopped by his brother when he tried to prevent the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered World War I. In South London, present day, John Constantine is staying in Chas's house when he is contacted by Swamp Thing. Abigail Arcane, the Avatar of the Rot and Swamp Thing's lover, is missing. John enlists Mercury's help, who is eager to help Swamp Thing despite disliking John. Meanwhile, in Paris, Marid resurfaces and attacks his brother.

John tells Chas which horse to bet on and makes the cabbie drive him to the Tate Club. Clarice Sackville offers him a deal with "someone", but John flatly refuses.  That "someone" turns out to be Marid, who is shown working with Clarice and Constantine seems to be an obstacle. John is tracked down by two djinns but manages to escape to the London Underground. He meets Map, who behaves oddly and warns John of an upcoming danger in town: the djinn, and that Clarice actually wants John to stop the djinn from finding Swamp Thing. John returns home only to find Chas being tied and gagged by a gang of white supremacists, who manage to deduce Chas's winning bet was due to John, and force the con man to tell them how to win bets. While John is "doing magick", Marid and his djinns arrive and kill off the gang. John and Chas manage to escape.

Mercury and Swamp Thing travel in the Rot to find Abigail Arcane. Mercury jumps into a "wormhole" while Swamp Thing stays behind and battles the forces of the Rot. Mercury returns and rescues Swamp Thing. When asked what she found, Constantine arrives and answer "djinn".

==Appearances and mentions==
* John Constantine appears in an early issue of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''. There in 1989, he helps [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]] recover a pouch of sand which had served as one of Dream's totems of power. John had purchased the pouch during Dream's imprisonment and it had then been stolen from him by an ex-girlfriend. John and Dream find the woman using the sand as a drug and driven mad by it. Dream recovers the pouch, granting the woman a peaceful death at John's request and promising to end the nightmares John had been having "ever since Newcastle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] |title=The Sandman |issue=3 |date=March 1989 |penciller=[[Sam Kieth|Kieth, Sam]] |inker=[[Mike Dringenberg|Dringenberg, Mike]] |colorist=Robbie Busch|letterer=[[Todd Klein|Klein, Todd]] |editor=[[Karen Berger|Berger, Karen]] |story=Dream a Little Dream of Me |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; John's ancestor [[Characters of The Sandman#Johanna Constantine|Lady Johanna Constantine]] also plays a significant role in storylines of ''The Sandman'' and an [[Elizabethan]]-era "Jack Constantine" is mentioned.
* In another of Gaiman's comics, ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', John is at hand to show the hero [[Timothy Hunter]] around the then-present day [[DC Comics]] Universe, along with [[Mister E]], [[Doctor Occult]] and the [[Phantom Stranger]].

* During a crossover, Constantine met [[Shade, The Changing Man]] during the Hotel Shade era, by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Chris Bachalo]]. Constantine also makes a small cameo in Vertigo's [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|''Lucifer'']]. In issue No. 5 he is seen drinking at Lucifer Morningstar's bar Lux, among guests that seek an audience with Lucifer about the gateway to the void outside of creation. According to himself he's not there to propose a trade with Lucifer, only to take "a quick look at the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carey, Mike.

* Constantine is one of the few people aware of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and one of the few to have foreseen it. Although longtime allies [[Zatanna]], the [[Phantom Stranger]] and [[Swamp Thing]] are still either active or frequently referred to in the [[DC Universe|DCU's]] world of superheroics, the world of ''Hellblazer'' became more realistic and no mention was made of John's interactions with superheroes, which included attending the funeral of [[Hal Jordan]] uninvited, drinking with [[Doom Patrol]] member [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], meeting [[Batman]], attending the opening of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner's]] Green Lantern theme bar, helping an incarnation of the [[Challengers of the Unknown]] save London from one of the Millennium Giants and, in his own comic, playing host to a [[marijuana|stoned]] [[Zatanna]] at his fortieth birthday party. He does complain about superheroes not getting in trouble for collateral damage as he does at the beginning of ''The Fear Machine'' story arc.&lt;ref name=machine&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer Vol.3: The Fear Machine|author=Jamie Delano|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40121-810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was slated to be a main character of the aborted company-wide crossover ''[[Twilight of the Superheroes]]'', however the project was ultimately shelved.
* John Constantine can be seen in a panel in Neil Gaiman's Batman: Secret Origins story "When is a Door". In it, a film crew is asking people on the street what they think of Gotham's super-villain problem, John is shown smoking a cigarette, responding "Sorry squire, I'm not from 'round here' make that "no comment."" Though it is not stated that this is Constantine, he has the same appearance, speaks in a decidedly British fashion, and this would not be the first cameo Gaiman has given him in a comic. The story was later reprinted as an extra in Gaiman's "[[Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader]]". He briefly met [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] in a London pub, telling him to mention his name to the dark forces in [[Sherwood Forest]], although Queen ignored the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Green Arrow (vol. 2) #25|author=Mike Grell|date=October 1989|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Unlike most comic book magicians, Constantine rarely uses magical spells, unless he has to, especially in combat. Constantine faces most of his challenges relying primarily on his cunning, quick-thinking during fights, vast knowledge of the occult, manipulation of opponents and allies, and an extensive list of contacts. These skills are often more useful than his magical ones. He is known to have deceived many of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, such as [[First of the Fallen|The First of the Fallen]] and [[Presence (DC Comics)|The Presence]],&lt;ref name="God#1"/&gt; as well as manipulating [[Batman]] and [[Superman]].&lt;ref name="vankin" /&gt; He is considered by many as being the world's greatest con man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Justice League Dark Annual No. 1|author=[[Jeff Lemire]]|publisher=DC Comics| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine is one of a few people knowing all the routes to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife, which he uses to escape and teleport without the danger of being chased by enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devil You Know|author=[[Jamie Delano]]|publisher=DC Comics| isbn=1-40121-269-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the graphic novel ''[[Hellblazer: Pandemonium|Pandemonium]]'', he once allowed himself to be killed, but later resurrects himself by exiting the afterlife.

As a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]], Constantine is armed with the knowledge of many magical [[Magic spell|spells]], [[Ritual magic|rituals]], and [[curse]]s, such as [[evocation]], [[necromancy]], [[illusion]]s, [[invisibility]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hellblazer'' No. 258&lt;/ref&gt; and can even use magic to [[time travel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hellblazer'' No. 273&lt;/ref&gt; He has a wide range of protection magic such as [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] and [[magic circle]]s that can protect him from both physical&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day Aftermath'' No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and supernatural attacks. John's most signature ability is [[synchronicity]] wave travelling, which is an instinctual supernatural ability for Constantine to make his own luck. This has led John to uncanny luck at games of chance, the ability to avoid and escape harm, meet the right kind of ally to help prevent or stop an apocalyptic event from happening, and reshape the battle he's fighting to his own accord.&lt;ref name=origin /&gt; Constantine is highly resistant to many psychic attacks such as [[telepathy]], [[Demonic possession|possessions]], and mind control. He can even use magic to block off [[omnipresence]], seen where he once used sigils to hide himself from the First of the Fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rake at the Gates of Hell|author=[[Garth Ennis]]|publisher=DC Comics| isbn= 1-40120-002-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the New 52, other magical powers such as teleportation,&lt;ref&gt;Justice League Dark No. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantine No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; counter spells, elemental magic,&lt;ref&gt;Justice League Dark No. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine #16&lt;/ref&gt; [[telekinesis]],&lt;ref name="I Vampire No. 17"&gt;I Vampire No. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and immobilisation&lt;ref name="I Vampire No. 17"/&gt; have been added. He can use magic to reflect damages done to him onto his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellblazer: Ashes and Dust in the City of Angels''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sorcery, Constantine has exhibited considerable mastery in "stage magic skills"—[[hypnosis]], [[sleight of hand]], [[pick pocketing]] and [[escapology]]. John carries with him an arsenal of powerful magical artifacts to aid him in battle, such as [[The House of Mystery]], which also serves as his transport to different realms of the universe, and his trademark trench coat that possesses powerful [[demon|demonic powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer: The Devil's Trenchcoat|author=Peter Milligan|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1401237207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since tricking the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer, he was perpetually in good health and physicality. Constantine's blood is demonically tainted, initially by a blood transfusion from the demon Nergal, and later by sex with a [[succubus]]. His blood has been shown to have healing properties, and is noted to have an age-managing effect.&lt;ref name="Hellblazer #236" /&gt;  It also acted as a defence mechanism when attacked by the King of the Vampires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer: Tainted Love|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-56389-456-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is highly corrosive and poisonous. Constantine's skill at unarmed combat varies depending on the writer. Some portray him as a poor physical fighter, others as a capable hand-to-hand combatant. Over time he has won occasional fights using magical weapons, by fighting dirty,&lt;ref&gt;Hellblazer issues No. 42, No. 57 and the graphic novel [[All His Engines]] published by [[DC Comics|DC]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint&lt;/ref&gt; or by quick-thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellblazer: Scab|author=Peter Milligan|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40122-501-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine sold his soul to two lords of Hell, Beelzebub and Azazel, both of whom accepted the deal. This was a trick to make sure that neither they nor Satan himself, who also had a claim, could take possession of his soul without destroying hell and its denizens. Thus until Satan quit and Azazel was sealed away by Dream of the Endless he was protected by the three like guardian angels.

==In real life==
Alan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he told [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]]:&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

{{quote|One day, I was in [[Westminster]] in [[London]]—this was after we had introduced the character—and I was sitting in a sandwich bar. All of a sudden, up the stairs came John Constantine. He was wearing the trenchcoat, a short cut—he looked—no, he didn't even look exactly like Sting. He looked exactly like John Constantine. He looked at me, stared me straight in the eyes, smiled, nodded almost conspiratorially, and then just walked off around the corner to the other part of the snack bar.

I sat there and thought, should I go around that corner and see if he is really there, or should I just eat my sandwich and leave? I opted for the latter; I thought it was the safest. I'm not making any claims to anything. I'm just saying that it happened. Strange little story.}}

His second meeting with his creation was illustrated in 2001's ''Snakes and Ladders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/03/the-return-of-john-constantine |title=The Return of John Constantine |publisher=IGN |date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adaptation by Eddie Campbell of one of Moore's performance art pieces:

{{quote|Years later, in another place, he steps out of the dark and speaks to me. He whispers: "I'll tell you the ultimate secret of magic. Any [[cunt]] could do it."}}

They met a third time in fiction, when Moore was written into issue No. 120 of ''Hellblazer'' by then-author [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]]. Moore is seen sitting in silhouette at the back of a bar as John Constantine (who is on a pub crawl with the reader) raises a drink to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perida |first=Jonas |url=http://whirledpieces.blogspot.com/2011/08/john-constantine-meets-his-creator.html |title=Whirled Peace!: John Constantine Meets His Creator |publisher=Whirledpieces.blogspot.com |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers who had their run on the ''Hellblazer'' series have also admitted meeting the character in real life. Original ''Hellblazer'' writer [[Jamie Delano]] also claims to have encountered Constantine, during his run on the character, outside the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Tabula-rasa.info|title=Hellblazers|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamie Delnao Interview|date=2009|url=http://cultofghoul.blogspot.com.au/2009/10/jamie-delano-interview-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Milligan saw Constantine at a party around 2009 and rushed after him, only to find he'd disappeared. Brian Azzarello once saw him in a Chicago bar but avoided him, saying that "the thing about John is, the last thing you'd want to be is his friend."&lt;ref name="Vulture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/secret-history-of-john-constantine.html|title=The Secret History and Uncertain Future of Comics Character John Constantine |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |publisher=''Vulture''|date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The character won the 1986 "Favourite Supporting Character" by [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Award]], followed by winning it again in the same category a year later.&lt;ref&gt;1986: Won "Favourite Supporting Character" [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Award]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being ranked third in ''[[Empire(magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 50 Greatest Comic Characters and being ranked No. 10 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine's]]'' Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, he is also listed in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes as No. 29, stating that "John Constantine is pretty low on the totem pole as far as DC's magical players go. But through a combination of guile, trickery, and plain old ornery charm, Constantine battles the worst Hell has to offer and lives to tell the tale. Constantine is a byproduct of both the punk rock era and [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain. He isn't very nice, he drinks and smokes like they're both going out of style, and his friends always seem to pay for his own magical misdeeds. And yet we can't help but love this crusty old magician all the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/29|title=John Constantine - #29 Top Comic Book Heroes - IGN|website=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[WatchMojo.com]]'' listed Constantine in its Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes.&lt;ref name="Watchmojo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/id/13599/|title=Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes |publisher=''[[Watchmojo]]''|first=Matthew|last=Thomas|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} January 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Constantine as #30 on their list of the "50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=February 14, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character also garnered some negative reception, where [[UGO.com]] listed both Constantine and Zatanna in UGO's the Dirtiest Comic Book Sex Scenes, where they comment that, "One DC heroine who often finds herself unlucky in love is the backwards magician Zatanna, who can never seem to find a quality dude. One of the most fulfilling relationships she's had to date is with that reprobate {{sic|sorceror|nolink=y}} John Constantine, who is the very definition of a "love 'em and leave 'em" kind of dude.

Fandomania.com ranked the film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' in No. 13 of their Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptations, stating that [[Keanu Reeves]]'s performance "was good", although saying it might have been better if "played by the person the character was originally modelled after: Sting of the Police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fandomania.com/ultimate-20-comic-book-film-adaptations/|title=Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptations - Fandomania|date=September 9, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''TopTenz.net'' ranked him No. 5 in Top 10 Comic Book [[Anti-hero|Anti-Heroes]], saying that "Just knowing John Constantine is likely to get you killed: during his comic's run just about every member of his supporting cast has either been killed, maimed, mutilated, tortured and coerced into making deals with fiends from the Pit. And yet Constantine goes on, a supernatural warrior willing to pay almost any price to keep the darkest evil at bay. In recent times Constantine has got rid of the guilt and self-loathing plaguing him by magically giving it the physical form of a baby and throwing it off a cliff. What a magnificent bastard..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-anti-heroes.php|title=Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes (Marvel &amp; DC) - Toptenz.net|date=May 11, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonia Harris from ''[[Comics Should Be Good]]'' praised ''Hellblazer'', saying that "watching John delve into his past in order to exorcise his (and the worlds) literal and metaphorical demons is a delight. Simon Bisley does an incredible job of visually contrasting the pretty young version of Constantine with the imposing man he has become. Time and misadventure have scarred and hardened John, and the man he has become has the strength and will to transform his environment by channelling the anger that pained him so much as a young, fresh-faced, suicidal punk kid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/28/committed-why-you-wish-you-read-hellblazer/ |title=WHY YOU WISH YOU READ HELLBLAZER |publisher=[[Comics Should Be Good]] |date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Constantine ranked 30th on ComicsAlliance's 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics list that even though almost all of his relationships end badly, they can't warn others against his wily charms.

* Constantine appeared in the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' portrayed by [[Keanu Reeves]]. The film used some elements from Garth Ennis' "[[Dangerous Habits]]" story arc (issues No. 41–46)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rotten| first = Ryan| title = Update: Francis Lawrence Would Do Constantine 2 | date=November 2007 | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=3842 | accessdate=December 17, 2008  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences to the comic were made, for example giving him a psychic ability to see "half breeds" as they truly are—a curse that caused him to attempt suicide which in turn damned him to Hell. He was also given the ability to render invisible beings in his proximity visible by using the incantation "Into the light I command thee" and two magical glyphs (called "The Perfect Red King" from [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Eugenius Philalethes]]'s "The Speculum Veritatis") on his arms to combine, which he uses to uncloak the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] directly after he attacked his friend Chas. Unlike the comic version, Constantine's exorcism tools are primarily based on Christian relics rather than generic supernatural items; the novelisation expanded on this by explaining that, as Constantine comes from a Christian culture, he has a greater natural understanding of the power of Christian relics that makes it easier for him to use them. Constantine's exorcisms are motivated by a desire to redeem himself for his past suicide, yet they are constantly doomed to fail as everything he has done has fundamentally been for his own benefit rather than for the selfless betterment of others. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended, with Lucifer saving the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at failing after Constantine willingly sacrificed a chance to save his own life to ask Satan to send the innocent Isabel Dodson to Heaven (Isabel having committed suicide to prevent herself being used as a host for a demonic incursion).&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Goldstein| first=Hilary| title = Constantine Vs.

===Television===
====Animated====
* Constantine appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[Damian O'Hare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/justice-league-action-is-a-dc-explosion-for-younger-viewers/|title=JUSTICE LEAGUE ACTION Is a DC Explosion for Younger Viewers - Nerdist|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his child form is voiced by [[Paula Rhodes]]. Unlike his comic book incarnation, Constantine is a full-fledged member of the [[Justice League]]. He appears in "Abate and Switch" where he helps Batman save Superman and Wonder Woman after their powers were temporarily disabled by the remaining Brothers Djinn [[Demons Three|Abnegazar, Rath]], and Nyorlath. During this time, John Constantine had accidentally cast a British accent spell on himself causing Batman to translate it. Batman can understand it, thanks to his genius-level intellect and his life as Bruce Wayne with [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]. He later joins in the battle with the three Brothers Djinn members and Black Adam. After the four villains were defeated by Shazam and the Justice League, John Constantine sent the four villains through a portal to an unknown location that Batman couldn't get the translation from John Constantine from. In the episode "Zombie King," John Constantine is shown fighting Brother Night at the time when Zatanna heads out to help Batman and Swamp Thing fight Solomon Grundy. In the episode "Trick or Threat," John Constantine, Batman, Doctor Fate, and Zatanna are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy in order to lure them into the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In the episode "Supernatural Adventures in Babysitting," John Constantine is called in by Batman to help him and Stargirl fight Klarion the Witch Boy when he gets his hands on the Magdalene Grimore at the time when Stargirl (who mistakes him for a homeless person) was babysitting Professor Anderson's son Timmy. When the Magdalene Grimore is reclaimed and Klarion the Witch Boy is defeated, John Constantine takes possession of the Magdalene Grimore.

Along the way, he solves supernatural mysteries, vanquishes demons, and clashes with officious angels sent to watch over him. Despite a positive reaction from fans, poor ratings led to the show not being renewed. A decision not to explore Constantine's bisexuality in the show caused some consternation with fans, although the character continued to be portrayed as bisexual in the comics.&lt;ref name="io9bi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/the-new-constantine-comic-is-way-more-comfortable-with-1710643002|work=io9|last=Whitbrook|first=James|title=The New Constantine Comic Is Way More Comfortable With His Bisexuality|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In flashbacks, he first meets [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] on the island Lian Yu where he introduces Oliver to magic and gives him a tattoo for magical protection after Oliver saves his life. In the present-day narrative, set five years later, Oliver calls in a favor from John, who helps him restore the soul of his friend [[Sara Lance]] after she is resurrected by the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Constantine's off-screen adventures are subsequently referred to in the episodes "[[List of Arrow episodes#ep84|Taken]]" and "[[List of Arrow episodes#ep89|Genesis]]" including Oliver's announcement that Constantine is in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/11/arrow-matt-ryan-constantine?ewarw&amp;hootPostID=096cebe2d90541b8d380d1d950faf714Arrow:|title='Arrow': Matt Ryan's Constantine heads to Starling City|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboard the ''Waverider'', John Constantine requests Sara Lance's help in performing an exorcism on a young girl possessed by what turns out to be Mallus, the Legends' current demonic adversary, and offers the Legends advice on how they might be able to overcome their enemy. Constantine's bisexuality is acknowledged in the episode "[[List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes#ep43|Daddy Darhkest]]" when he flirts with [[Captain Cold#Other versions|Leo Snart / Captain Cold]] and sleeps with Sara Lance. The episode "[[List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes#ep48|Necromancing the Stone]]" sees Constantine spontaneously kiss Time Agent Gary Green.

===Web series===
* On January 8, 2017, The CW announced an animated series titled ''[[Constantine: City of Demons]]'' for [[CW Seed]]. The series debuted on March 24, 2018 with Matt Ryan reprising his role.

===Miscellaneous===
* While not seen in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic books he was mentioned. He also rates a mention along with Swamp Thing as unavailable in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) No. 11 (a crossover with ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'', to which he alluded in ''Swamp Thing'', trying to get the latter to assist). Constantine appeared in the pages of ''Justice League of America: Wedding Special'', during the bachelor party of Green Arrow. He was walking behind [[Metamorpho]] during a conversation between Hal Jordan and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]].
* Constantine is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]]. When Zatanna was attacked by a man, John interferes and knocked the man out. He then introduces himself and offers her a cigarette. John and Zatanna investigate the Church of Blood. Zatanna and Constantine arrive at his place of business, which appears to be a black market for cursed items. He informs her that the Book of Magick she's looking for, which used to be in her father's possession, was stolen from him by a group of occultists just like the one they encountered, the Church of Blood. Zatanna says that the acolyte she fought with was already very powerful and John says that they must be planning something big. John also says that he wants the book because he intends to sell it to collectors but Zatanna says that the book belonged to her father, from which he got all his spells, so she won't let him have it. She reveals to him that she needs to find the Book of Magick and destroy it like she did with all the other items he had cursed. Constantine then says that she can't battle with all these men from the cult on her own and that she needs help to do so. The two form an uneasy partnership, even though they still disagree about who will take the book in the end. John faces Brother Blood and his cult. Following an abduction of a teenage girl by the cult, Zatanna and John Constantine are closing in on the Church of Blood, who is preparing a final sacrifice at Stonehenge to bring the demon Trigon to Earth. They arrive moments before the cult appears ready to kill the girl. Just as Brother Blood, the leader, raises his ceremonial dagger, John and Zatanna descend from the sky. They succeed in preventing the girl's sacrifice while Constantine attacks the cult members but suddenly Brother Blood reveals that he was the true sacrifice all along and then stabs himself in the heart. While demons claw their way out of Brother Blood's body, Constantine grabs the Book of Magick and makes off with it, abandoning Zatanna and the girl to deal with the demons on their own. With no other options, the two run from the attacking demons. Constantine retreats to a nearby truck as Zatanna is left alone with the girl at Stonehenge to face the demons. The ghosts of those he's let die in the past watch him accusingly, but he insists he doesn't care about leaving her and the girl behind. Constantine eventually has a change of heart and hurries back to Brother Blood's body. He reaches inside the slain man's opened chest to extract one of his organs. Then he recites an exorcism spell that banishes the demons back to the pits of Hell from whence they came, saving both their lives. Later, Zatanna meets Constantine at one of the bars and her thanks to him for not letting her die. She also tells him that she considers D.E.O.'s offer to become a consultant and John says that now that she doesn't have to search for any other cursed objects of her father's she is free to do what she wants. He then gives her back the Book of Magick, deciding not to sell it, and takes his leave through a closet. When Constantine returns to his flat in London, two D.E.A. agents meet him at the door saying they'd like a word with him. Constantine promptly turns them into frogs and collects their badges in a bucket already containing quite a few other police badges.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Heleluhe was taken by the government officers, stripped of all clothing, placed in a dark cell without light, food, air, or water, and was kept there for hours in hopes that the discomfort of his position would induce him to disclose something of my affairs. After this was found to be fruitless, he was imprisoned for about six weeks; when, finding their efforts in vain, his tormentors released him. No charge was ever brought against him in any way, which is true of about two hundred persons who were similarly confined.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=NLM4DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT185 270–271]}}&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1896 and 1900, Heleluhe accompanied Queen Liliʻuokalani on her many trips abroad to the United States and [[Washington, DC]] to campaign against the American [[annexation of Hawaii]] and then assisted her in her attempts to reclaim the crown land after 1898. Initially, Elizabeth Kia Nahaolelua was chosen to be her lady-in-waiting but after the trips were extended, Heleluhe's wife Wakeke replaced her in the royal party as lady-in-waiting to the queen.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mellen|1958|page=331}}: {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=355–356, 359}}: {{harvnb|Silva|2004|page=193}}; {{cite news|title=E Huli Hoi Mai Ana|newspaper=Ka Makaainana|location=Honolulu|date=May 3, 1897|volume=VII|issue=18|page=8|url=https://nupepa-hawaii.com/2014/01/14/wakeke-heleluhe-to-take-the-place-of-kia-kahele-nahaolelua-1897/|accessdate=November 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112150045/https://nupepa-hawaii.com/2014/01/14/wakeke-heleluhe-to-take-the-place-of-kia-kahele-nahaolelua-1897/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}; {{cite news|title=Mrs. Heleluhe No Amerika|newspaper=Ke Aloha Aina|location=Honolulu|date=May 1, 1897|volume=III|issue=18|page=6|url=https://nupepa-hawaii.com/2014/01/26/more-on-mrs-heleluhe-going-to-take-the-place-of-kahele-nahaolelua-and-name-variations-1897/|accessdate=November 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112145735/https://nupepa-hawaii.com/2014/01/26/more-on-mrs-heleluhe-going-to-take-the-place-of-kahele-nahaolelua-and-name-variations-1897/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1898, Heleluke was also actively involved in rallying Hawaiians in signing the [[Kūʻē Petitions]] and petitioning against annexation.

Following Liliʻuokalani's return to Hawaii in 1900, the 45-year-old Heleluhe succumbed to [[tuberculosis]], on July 8, 1900. When it became evident his death was near, his final request was to die at [[Washington Place]]. Although he expired before arrival at the queen's residence, his funeral was held there. He was buried at the [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]] cemetery.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

[[File:Prince Jack Heleluhe, 1914.jpg|thumb|right|"Prince" Jack Heleluhe, 1914]]

Heleluhe married Wakeke Ululani Heleluhe, from [[Maui]], who served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Liliʻuokalani. They had two children: Jack Heleluhe and Myra Kailipanio Heleluhe Iona.&lt;ref name="Wakeke"/&gt; Jack, also known as "Prince Jack Heleluhe", worked as a musician and member of the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]]; he became one of the first musicians to play [[Hawaiian music]] in the United States and was featured on N.

In 1906, Wakeke lost favor with the queen after an attempt to discredit [[Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo]], the queen's ''[[hānai]]'' daughter, backfired, and she was evicted from the houses she occupied at Washington Place and the queen's residence in [[Waikiki]] by the queen and her financial agent [[Joseph O. Carter]]. The reasons given for the queen's anger was Wakeke's "disloyalty to me and dishonesty"; she had lied to Aholo that the queen never wished to see her again.{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=123–126}} She may have later reconciled with the queen because Wakeke and Onalaa were listed as two of her old retainers at the deathbed of the queen.

'''Khubaib ibn Adiy''' (خبيب بن عدي) or '''Khubyab bin Adi''' was a [[Sahaba]] (companion) of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Mubarakpuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r_80rJHIaOMC&amp;pg=PA351 The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350–351}} He was killed during the [[Expedition of Al Raji]].

==Background to death==
In 625  some men requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam,&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;{{rp|187}} but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the [[Expedition of Abdullah Ibn Unais|assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan]] by Muhammad's followers and they killed the Muslims.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite book|author=Watt, W. Montgomery|author-link=Montgomery Watt|title=[[Muhammad at Medina (book)|Muhammad at Medina]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0195773071|page=33|quote=The common version, however, is that B. Lihyan wanted to avenge the assassination of their chief at Muhammad's instigation, and bribed two clans of the tribe of Khuzaymah to say they wanted to become Muslims and ask Muhammad to send instructors.}} ([https://archive.org/details/muhammadatmedina029655mbp online])&lt;/ref&gt; After killing [[Asim ibn Thabit]], Hudhayl wanted to sell his head.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;{{rp|350–351}}

According to [[William Montgomery Watt]], the most common version of the event states that the motives of the Banu Lahyan for attacking Muslims, was that the Banu Lahyan wanted to get revenge for the [[Expedition of Abdullah Ibn Unais|assassination of their chief]] at Muhammad's instigation. So they bribed the two tribes of Khuzaymah to say they wanted to convert to Islam. Watt also said that the seven men Muhammad sent may have been spies for Muhammad and instructors for Arab tribes. He also said that the it is difficult to verify the exact date the assassination of their chief took place.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

According to the Muslim scholar [[Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri]], the Quraysh ordered Khubyab bin Adi to be crucified by [[Uqba bin al-Harith]] because he had killed [[Uqba bin al-Harith]]'s father.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

Muhammad ordered [[The Mission of Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri]] to assassinate [[Abu Sufyan]] to avenge Khubyab bin Adi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The foundation of the community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctvk-fdtklYC&amp;pg=PA147|first=Al|last=Tabari |year=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-344-2|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{see|Battle of Badr}}
Khubaib ibn Adiy was taken captive and escorted in a procession of thousands which was led by men like [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], and [[Safwan ibn Umayah]], and which included [[Said ibn Amir]].

The women and children pushed him to the place set for his death. Khubaib's death was to be in revenge for [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] losses in the [[battle of Badr]]. When the assembled throng arrived at the appointed place with him, the prisoner, Khubaib said in a firm but quiet voice amid the shouting of women and children:
:''"If you would, leave me to pray two rakaats before my death."

This the Quraysh allowed. Khubaib faced the Ka'bah and prayed two [[rakaat]]s. Then Khubaib faced the Quraysh leaders.
:''"By God, if you thought that I asked to pray out of fear of death, I would think the prayer not worth the trouble," he said.

Then the Meccans set about dismembering Khubayb's body while he was yet alive and taunting him in the process.
:''"Would you like Muhammad to be in your place while you go free?"
With his blood flowing, he replied, ''"By God, I would not want to be safe and secure among my family while even a thorn hurts Muhammad."''
People shook their fists in the air and the shouting increased.
:''"Kill him. Kill him!"
Khubaib lifted his eyes to the heavens above the wooden cross.
:''"Count them all, O Lord,"'' he said. ''"Destroy them and let not a single one escape."''
Thereafter it could not be counted the number of swords and spears which cut through Khubaib's body.

'''Lara Roxx''' is the  [[Pseudonym|stage name]] of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[pornographic film actor|pornographic actress]] who, in March 2004, became the first of three known individuals in four years to contract [[HIV]] while making a U.S. [[pornographic film|pornographic video]].

==Career==
Roxx became famous in 2004 at age 21, after being exposed to [[HIV]] while doing a [[Pornography|pornographic]] scene with [[Darren James]]. She allegedly contracted the disease just two months after doing her first scene, a [[double anal]].&lt;ref name=burnett&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.montrealgazette.com/2013/01/25/inside-lara-roxx-former-montreal-adult-film-star-on-the-deadly-price-of-porn-fame/ | title=Inside Lara Roxx: former Montreal adult-film star on the deadly price of porn fame | work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]] | date=January 25, 2013 | accessdate=January 26, 2013 | author=Burnett, Richard | authorlink=Richard Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roxx said previously that she relied on the industry's HIV standards to ensure her safety.&lt;ref name=cleanest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/15762.html |title=Lara Roxx: "I thought porn people were the cleanest people in the world." |work=[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]] |date=2004-04-17 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510090658/http://business.avn.com/articles/15762.html |archivedate=2009-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Roxx have been banned from any further porn production in the US. At the end of April 2004, it was confirmed that Jessica Dee and Miss Arroyo, after having worked with James, also tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/15987.html|title=Another First-Gen Woman Diagnosed as HIV-Positive|work=[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]|date=2004-05-05|accessdate=2009-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821144824/http://business.avn.com/articles/15987.html|archivedate=2009-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roxx, upon learning about James' being HIV-positive, said, "It totally made me realize how I trusted this system that wasn't to be trusted at all, because it obviously doesn't work," and "I thought porn people were the cleanest people in the world."&lt;ref name=cleanest/&gt;

She is the subject of the Canadian documentary film ''[[Inside Lara Roxx]]'', directed by Canadian filmmaker and photographer [[Mia Donovan]], which explores Roxx's 2004 [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]] and her life since the media coverage of this incident subsided.&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2011 |title=Inside Lara Roxx |url=http://www.hotdocs.ca/film/title/inside_lara_roxx |website=hotdocs.ca |publisher=Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207162454/http://www.hotdocs.ca/film/title/inside_lara_roxx |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Larry John Bissonnette''' (born 1957 in [[Winooski, Vermont]]) is an American [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] artist and activist for [[Autism|autism]] and general disabilities. Bissonnette was diagnosed with multiple other disorders including an [[Intellectual Disability|intellectual disability]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenia]]. Bissonnette's art is found at the [[Collection de l'art brut|Musée de l'Art Brut]] in [[Switzerland]] and multiple private collections.

==Early life==
At age two, Bissonnette suffered from a high fever, which might have caused some kind of damage to his nervous system. By the time he was eight, he was sent to the [[Brandon Training School]], which was Vermont's only institute for the mentally handicapped at the time. During his 10-year confinement at Brandon, he was diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, mentally retarded and clinically insane.

During this time, he used concepts of art such as drawing and painting to help himself through self-expression. To him, it's a form of therapy as he was non-verbal since the age of three or four. By the time he was 18, he was then transferred to Vermont Psychiatric Hospital in [[Waterbury, Vermont]], but was soon released by his sister, Sally, who learned about how Larry was physically abused at the institutes, and even receive scars. Bissonnette was then enrolled with an residential program for the developmentally disabled.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECrXMfHffM|title=Autistic Artist Taboo: Strange Behavior|last=|first=|date=2012-06-15|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRACE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graceart.org/collections/larry-bissonette/|title=Larry Bissonette|last=Jameslov|first=|date=2016-08-24|website=GraceArt.org|publisher=Grass Roots Art and Community Effort (GRACE)|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Larry began communicating for the first time after more than 30 years by typing with an assistive device. Apart from his art, this was another option to express his feelings and thoughts.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/larry-bissonnette/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his years wandering around in public, Larry displayed a threatening appearance which led to some treating him like an outcast, according to Pascal Cheng who is Larry's aid. But, Larry is aware of this after releasing his thoughts through typing.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Cheng (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/pascal-cheng/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2013)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku5rYjgbbPg|title=Taboo: Extreme Lives Strange Behaviours - Autism|last=|first=|date=2013-01-21|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning as an public speaker==
In 1998, Larry began his journey as a public speaker at several National Educational Conferences in which he spoken about autism, communication, and art.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; Despite being nonverbal, Larry uses his assistive-device typing skills to describe what he wishes to say. He says he is aware that everyone viewed and treated him like an outcast which made everyone realize he is the same as everyone else.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"/&gt;

In 2010, Larry and another autism-rights speaker, Tracy Thresher, described others treating them as outcasts, and revealed that they are actually capable despite others' beliefs. With assistive devices and encouraging others on the autism spectrum about what they can do, others can learn that they are not freaks, but can reach out not only with words, but with courage to work with others including those who are non-autistic. The two men traveled the world and visited several nations such as Japan and Finland.&lt;ref name="WretchesAndJabberers.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Larry's success in public speaking brought him to the attention of various media. In 2005, Larry starred in his biographical film, ''My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette'', which earned an award.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; In 2011, Larry and his ally, Tracy, was in a documentary called ''Wretches and Jabberers'', and in 2012, they were both featured in an episode of the National Geographic ''[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]]'' television series which was titled "Strange Behavior".

Amanda gave them a yes, and Cowell, although he felt they were not given a good enough dance routine, decided to give them a second chance. They made it through to the next round and then the semi-finals.

In their semi-final appearance on 27 May 2008, they performed to "[[Lollipop (Mika song)|Lollipop]]" by [[Mika]] and received much larger praise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">'''Many Horses''' was a [[medicine man|holy man]] of the [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe. He was a friend of [[Sitting Bull]] and a believer in the [[Ghost Dance]]. In the spring of 1890, he organized a Ghost Dance ritual at [[Standing Rock Reservation]] to drive away the white soldiers camped nearby, but was distressed to see that they were still there at dawn the next day. He then said to the assembled people:

''"I will follow the white man's trail.  I will make him my friend, but I will not bend my back to his burdens.  I will be cunning as a coyote.  I will ask him to help me understand his ways, then I will prepare the way for my children, and their children.  The Great Spirit has shown me - a day will come when they will outrun the white man in his own shoes."''

Many Horses should not be confused with the daughter of [[Sitting Bull]], who has the same name.

'''Maria Grigor'evna  Nikiforova''' ({{lang-ua|Марія (Маруся) Григорівна Нікіфорова}}; {{lang-ru|Мария Григорьевна Никифорова}}; 1885–1919), was an [[anarchist]] [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leader. A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, '''Marusya'''. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918–1919 in Ukraine during [[Russian Civil War]].

==Biography==

===Early life and exile===
Born in Alexandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]), [[Ukraine]], in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]]. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]].
[[File:Aleksandrovsk.jpg|thumb|left|Aleksandrvsk at the end of the nineteenth century.  Nikiforova was a teenager during this period.]]
She adopted a strategy of ''motiveless terrorism'' (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a [[death sentence]], later commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. She served part of her sentence in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress|Petropavlovsk]] prison in [[St. Petersburg]], before being exiled to [[Siberia]] in 1910. From there she escaped to [[Japan]]. She went from there to the [[United States]], then [[Spain]], and finally arrived in [[Paris]]. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Slavic diminutive form of "Maria", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married [[Witold Brzostek]], a Polish [[anarchist]] and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], she sided with [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s anti-German position, in favor of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]].

===Return to Alexandrovsk===
With the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], she abandoned [[France]] and returned to [[Petrograd]]. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in [[Kronstadt]]. In the summer of 1917, with [[anti-anarchist]] activity within the [[Russian Provisional Government]] on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, [[Ukraine]].{{Ref label|A|I|none}} Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist [[Black Guards]] under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the [[Central Council of Ukraine|Central Rada]] and redistribute private property.

===Enter Nestor Makhno===
[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nestor Makhno]] (1918), future leader of the [[Free Territory]], was still a minor militia leader when he first encountered Nikiforova]]
When the [[October Revolution]] took place in [[Russian Empire]], leftist-dominated cities such as [[Huliaipole]] were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the [[Red Army]], the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under [[Nestor Makhno]] and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing [[Red Army]] forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under [[Bolshevik]] control.&lt;ref name="Palij 83"/&gt; Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor.

With Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|Revolutionary committee]]. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. ''She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Савченко|first=В.А.|title=Махно|year=2005|publisher=Фолио|location=Харьков|isbn=966-03-3053-7|pages=401}}, page 30, [http://www.makhno.ru/lit/Savchenko.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova "exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance".&lt;ref name="Palij 73"/&gt;

In the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city &lt;ref name="Palij 86"/&gt;
In August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at [[Orikhiv]], subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle.

She later established a new Black Guard [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] in the other cities, including [[Kirovohrad|Elisavetgrad]].&lt;ref name="Palij 74"/&gt;

===The Free Combat Druzhina===
In December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the "Free Combat [[Druzhina]]". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today [[Kropyvnytskyi]]) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from  [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]] for her revolutionary activities.

The Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading "The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves", "Long Live Anarchy", "Power Breeds Parasites", and "Anarchy is the Mother of Order."

The soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine.

With their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada.

[[File:Antonov-Ovseenko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] was a longtime ally of Nikiforova's, having met her in Paris years earlier. He provided her with needed political and material support from within the Bolshevik party.]]

Nikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov-Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the [[Free Territory]]. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events.

Antonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). "Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova."&lt;ref name="Skirda 97"/&gt; Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. [[Lev Kamenev]] and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, [[Boris Veretelnikov]] and [[Mikhalev-Pavlenko]], offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to [[Dnipropetrovsk|Ekaterinoslav]], he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to "six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts." However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by [[Jukums Vācietis]].&lt;ref name="Skirda 100"/&gt;

===Capture and death===
{{Rquote|right|Recognition can be fatal for a terrorist and so it was for Nikiforova in the end. |Malcolm Archibald, 2007.&lt;ref name="Archibald 1"/&gt;}}
In June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the [[White movement]] in the city of [[Sevastopol]]. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot.

==Political positions==

===Anarchism and revolution===
In her youth, Nikiforova entered [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communist]] politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}: "Around the same time she became a factory worker, Nikiforova also joined a local group of anarcho-communists. ... Maria became a full-fledged militant ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views.&lt;ref name="Archibald 10"/&gt; Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy.&lt;ref name="Skirda 318"/&gt;

During times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete [[Redistribution of wealth|redistribution of property]] owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, "The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests."&lt;ref name="Archibald 10"/&gt;

However, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against [[vanguardism]] and [[elitism]], insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. "The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone." She cautioned, "The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves."&lt;ref name="Archibald 10"/&gt;

===World War I enlistment===

While living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from [[French Army in World War I|French military school]] at the officer rank and served in the army.{{sfn|Archibald|2007}}

===Conflicts with Soviet authority===
Upon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by [[Apollon Karelin]], a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of "Soviet anarchism." Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}. See paragraph "On a tactical level ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|revkom]]. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda.&lt;ref name="Archibald 9"/&gt; Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. "The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment," she declared "but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want."&lt;ref name="Archibald 24"/&gt;

===Reputation as a commander===

What we do know for certain is that Marusya was a charismatic individual who made a strong impression on people she met and was capable of influencing them purely on the strength of her personality. Her comrades-in-arms were fiercely loyal to her and she returned their loyalty in kind.&lt;ref name="Archibald 10"/&gt;

Then Marusya stepped to the podium and began to speak. Now the Cossacks were paying attention. "Cossacks, I must tell you that you are the butchers of the Russian workers. Will you continue to be so in the future, or will you acknowledge your own wickedness and join the ranks of the oppressed? Up to now you have shown no respect for the poor workers. For one of the tsar's roubles or a glass of wine, you have nailed them living to the cross."

As Marusya continued in this vein many of the Cossacks removed their caps and bowed their heads. Soon some of them were weeping like children.

A knot of Aleksandrovsk intellectuals was standing in the crowd. They told each other: "The speeches of the Left Bloc representatives seem so pale in comparison with the speeches of the anarchists and, in particular, with the speech of M. Nikiforova." One upshot of the meetings, which went on for days, was that a number of Cossacks maintained contact with the Gulyai-Pole anarchists even after they went home to the Kuban and other regions.&lt;ref name="Archibald 19"/&gt;

With their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere.&lt;ref name="Archibald 22"/&gt;

Summer 1918: "A carriage flew down the street at a mad speed. Carelessly sprawled in it was a young brunette wearing a [[Papakhi|kubanka]] at a rakish angle. Standing on the footboard was a broad-shouldered chap wearing red cavalry britches. The brunette and her bodyguard had all sorts of weapons hanging from them."&lt;ref name="Archibald 9"/&gt;

===Criminal accusations===
 In order to inflame the population, a story was spread that Marusya looted icons from churches. She was depicted as the leader of a gang of thieves.&lt;ref name="Archibald 27"/&gt;
--&gt;

===Physical descriptions===
Following Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former [[Makhnovism|Makhnovist]], wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: "This was a woman of 32 – 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle."&lt;ref name="Archibald 8"/&gt; Years after meeting her in 1919, [[Aleksei Semyonovich Kiselyov|Aleksei Kiselyov]] described her in his memoirs: "Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt." Kiselev also alleged that she was a [[cocaine]] addict. Nikiforova biographer, [[Malcolm Archibald]], noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with [[ad hominem]] attacks. "One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well."&lt;ref name="Archibald 9"/&gt;

Descriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: "I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic."&lt;ref name="Archibald 9"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Postmortem mythology===
Throughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive.

'''Marusya copycats'''

Following her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycats{{mdash}}faux Marusyas{{mdash}}to appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]] who adopted her name for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref name="Archibald 43"/&gt;

In 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, ''Black Maria'' (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the [[Tambov Rebellion]] in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared.&lt;ref name="Archibald 43-44"/&gt;

'''International espionage rumors'''

Nikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of [[Symon Petliura]], an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by [[Sholom Schwartzbard]]. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of [[Grigori Kotovsky]]'s anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, "The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them."&lt;ref name="Archibald 44"/&gt;

===Treatment by historians===
Nikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life.&lt;ref name="Archibald 1"/&gt; This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, [[Viktor Belash]], also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police.&lt;ref name="Archibald 2"/&gt; Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life.&lt;ref name="Archibald 3"/&gt;
{{Rquote|left|Gradually a clearer picture of her life is coming to light and it is possible to establish a reasonably reliable narrative although many ambiguities remain.|Malcolm Archibald , 2007.&lt;ref name="Archibald 3"/&gt;}}
Nikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as "repulsive and evil," with little exception.&lt;ref name="Archibald 1"/&gt;

Nikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative.&lt;ref name="Archibald 2"/&gt;

There is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: "...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater." Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only [[Alexandre Skirda]]'s work, ''Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack'', mentions her{{mdash}}a single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her.&lt;ref name="Archibald 2"/&gt;

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists.&lt;ref name="Archibald 2"/&gt; Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, ''Atamansha'', published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Archibald 3"/&gt;

Nikiforova appears in the French novel "Clarisse", by [[Cecil Saint-Laurent]]. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova.

'''{{Small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as "Oleksandrivsk".&lt;ref name="Palij 74"/&gt; This should not be confused with contemporary [[Oleksandrivsk]], as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk. However, the two cities are located in entirely different regions of the Ukraine.

'''Meskhians''' ({{Lang-ka|მესხები}}, ''Meskhebi'') are an ethnographic subgroup of [[Georgians]] who speak [[Georgian dialects#Central dialects|Meskhetian dialect]] of [[Georgian language]], which among Georgia's regional dialects is relatively close to official Georgian. Meskhetians are indigenous population of [[Meskheti]], historical region in southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eastofcenter.tol.org/2011/03/1196/|title=''East of Center » Archive » Meskhetian Turks Bouncing From Exile to Exile''|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/publications/detail/the-meskhetian-turks-at-a-crossroads-20/|title=''ECMI - European Centre for Minority Issues: Publications''|website=www.ecmi.de|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are mainly followers of [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], while part of them are [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].

== History ==
Several authors have connected Meskhetians or Meskhians to [[Mushki]] tribe or [[Moschia|Moschoi]] (Μόσχοι) in Greek sources, who were an [[Iron Age]] people of [[Anatolia]]. Meskhian tribes came to the fore, gradually moving northeast and forming their settlements in the very heart of [[Kartli]]. Mtskheta, the ancient capital of Iberia (literarily means "town of Meskhs") was one such settlements, deriving its name from the ethnonym "Meskhians". According to the [[Cyril Toumanoff]], Moschians were the early proto-[[Georgians|Georgian]] tribes which played a leading role in the consolidation of [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian tribes]] largely inhabiting eastern and southern Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Toumanoff, Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p 80&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 9th-11th centuries Mesketi, also known as [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]], was governed by the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] and the region played a crucial role in the unification of the Georgian principalities into a single [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian state]] in 1008. Meskheti gave many prominent people to the Georgia: such as [[Shota Rustaveli]], who is considered to be the preeminent poet of the [[Georgian Golden Age]] and one of the greatest contributors to [[Culture of Georgia (country)|Georgian literature]]. Rustaveli is the author of ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'', which is considered to be a Georgian national [[Epic poetry|epic poem]].

Thereafter, the kingdom of Georgia declined and eventually [[Kingdom of Georgia#Final disintegration|disintegrated]] under hegemony of various regional powers, including the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], [[Kara Koyunlu|Black]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu|White Sheeps]]. After the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasion of Georgia]], Meskhetian princes gained virtual independence from the Georgian crown and established [[Samtskhe atabegate|Principality of Samtskhe]] under the mongol patronage.

By the [[Peace of Amasya]] (1555), Principality of Samtskhe was divided into two, with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] keeping the eastern part and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] gaining the western part.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=xxxi}} In 1578, the Ottomans performed [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign|a successful invasion]] into the Safavid possessions in Georgia, initiating the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590]], and by 1582 they were in possession of the eastern (Safavid) part of [[Meskheti]] as well.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=85}}  

The Georgian population of Meskheti was displaced to inner regions of Georgia such as [[Imereti]] and [[Kartli]]. Those who remained gradually became [[Islam|Muslim]], the process is also known as [[Turkification]] of Meskhetians (then [[Meskhetian Turks|Meskehtian Turks]]).&lt;ref name="Khazanov 1995 loc=195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Khazanov|1995|loc=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative differences==
In October 2017, Michael Caton-Jones revealed that he had chosen [[Sophie Okonedo]], to star in ''[[B. Monkey]]''. However, the producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]], decided the actress wasn’t "fuckable". Caton-Jones and Weinstein discussed the matter heatedly, and Caton-Jones said, "'Don’t screw up the casting of this film because you want to get laid', whereupon he went mental." Weinstein then leaked to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that Caton-Jones had walked off the movie due to "creative differences". [[Asia Argento]], who replaced Okonedo, was one of three women who in 2017 were reported in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' to have been [[rape]]d by Weinstein; she said that she submitted to Weinstein because, "I felt I had to, because I had the movie coming out and I didn’t want to anger him."&lt;ref name="2017-10-17"&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/director-says-weinstein-recast-actress-who-wasnt-f-ckable.html?wpsrc=nymag Director Says Harvey Weinstein Recast the Lead in His Film Because the Actress Wasn’t 'F*ckable'], Jackson McHenry, Vulture.com, 2017-10-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Osama bin Laden]]''', a [[militant Islamist]] and reported founder [[al-Qaeda]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scheuer, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders,  issued two [[fatwa|fatawa]] — [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|in 1996 and then again in 1998]]—that [[Muslim combatant|military personnel]] from the [[United States]] and allied countries until they withdraw support for [[Israel]] and withdraw military forces from [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html BIN LADEN'S FATWA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Indictment|indicted]] in [[United States federal court]] for his alleged involvement in the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and was on the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list until his death.

==Jihad in Afghanistan==
{{see also|Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Jihad}}
Bin Laden's wealth and connections assisted his interest in supporting the [[mujahideen]], Muslim [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] fighting the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979. His old teacher from the university in [[Jeddah]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], had relocated to [[Peshawar]], a major border city in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] of [[Pakistan]]. From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Khyber Pass]], through the [[Safed Koh]] mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the [[Hindu Kush]] range. This route became the major avenue{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} of inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern [[Afghanistan]] for the resistance against the Soviets.

After leaving college in 1979 bin Laden joined Azzam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/osamabinladen.html|title=Osama bin Laden: "Wealthy Saudi exile is a terrorist mastermind"|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051212fa_fact|title=YOUNG OSAMA|publisher=New Yorker|accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fight the Soviet Invasion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/155236.stm|title=Who is Osama Bin Laden?|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2006-05-15 | date=2001-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lived for a time in Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  According to  [[Rahimullah Yousufzai]], "Azzam prevailed on him to come and use his money" for training recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of the English-language daily [http://www.thenews.com.pk/ The News International], in a statement to [[Reuters]] in Peshawar on 29 December 2001. Yusufzai met bin Laden twice in Afghanistan in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, bin Laden lived at several addresses in and around Arbab Road, a narrow street in the [[University of Peshawar|University Town]] neighborhood in western Peshawar, Yusufzai said. Nearby in Gulshan Iqbal Road is the Arab mosque that Abdullah Azzam used as the jihad center, according to a [[Reuters]] inquiry in the neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

By 1984, with Azzam, bin Laden established a Saudi Arabian funded organization named [[Maktab al-Khadamat]] (MAK, ''Office of Order'' in English), which funneled money, arms and [[Afghan arabs|Muslim fighters]] from around the Arabic world into the Afghan war. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Wright estimates his "share of the Saudi Binladin Group" in about fall 1989 as "amounted to 27 million Saudi riyals - a little more than [US]$ 7 million." Wright, (2006), p.145)&lt;/ref&gt; paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. In running al-Khadamat, bin Laden set up a network of couriers traveling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which remained active after 2001, according to Rahimullah  Yusufzai. It was during this time that Bin Laden met his future al-Qaeda collaborator, Dr. [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], a member and later head of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].

==Alleged CIA involvement==
{{Main|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}}
Whether Osama bin Laden and his group are "[[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]" from [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Operation Cyclone]] to help the Afghan mujahideen is a matter of some debate.

[[Robin Cook]], UK [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1997–2001 and [[Leader of the House of Commons]] from 2001-2003, has written that bin Laden was, "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies" and that the mujahideen that formed Al-Qaeda were "originally ... recruited and trained with help from the CIA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html|title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|author=Cook, Robin|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=2005-07-08 | location=London | date=2005-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, calls the idea "that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ... a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|title= Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash|author=Bergen, Peter|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break with Azzam==
{{further|Abdullah Yusuf Azzam}}
Osama bin Laden was recruited to be part of Azzam's [[Maktab al-Khadimat]] (Services Bureau), the support network of Arab fighters in Pakistan that was helping resist the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Islamic State: A Comparative History of Jihadist Warfare|last=Celso|first=Anthony|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2018|isbn=9781498569781|location=Lanham, MD|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while, bin Laden worked at the Services Bureau working with Abdullah Azzam on Jihad Magazine, a magazine that gave information about the war with the Soviets and interviewed mujahideen. Although bin Laden and the other [[Afghan Arabs]] were considered a minor "sideshow" in the war, bin Laden did establish a camp in Afghanistan and, with other volunteers, fought the Soviets and Marxist Afghan troops. One of his most significant battles was the [[battle of Jaji]], which was not a major fight, but it earned him a reputation as a fighter.

As time passed, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] encouraged bin Laden to split away from Abdullah Azzam. This stemmed from al-Zawahiri's differences with Azzam such as their conflicting interpretations of the jihad. Some believe that al-Zawahiri's motive was driven by his desire to exploit bin Laden's finances as well as the ambition to control the fractured Egyptian jihadist movement&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and so al-Zawahiri favored an aggressive view. On the other hand, Azzam pushed for a limited and defensive conception of jihad, where it becomes obligatory only when the enemy enters the land of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breaking Al-Qaeda: Psychological and Operational Techniques, Second Edition|last=Mastors|first=Elena|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781482230116|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine, however, proved ambiguous and invited several interpretations. Bin Laden began gravitating towards Zawahiri's position as he pursued a more expansive warfare strategy that allowed "insurrections against [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]] Muslim regimes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Azzam rejected this because he eschewed intra-Muslim conflict and the dispute finally led to a power struggle, which bin Laden won. By 1988, he finally broke away from his mentor, establishing al-Qaeda with the most extremist of the Muslim militants from Azzam's network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years of Terrorism|last=Ressa|first=Maria|publisher=World Scientific|year=2013|isbn=9781908979537|location=Singapore|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began a radical form of jihad that pursued the violent overthrow of governments in the Muslim world deemed apostate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of Al Qaeda's Leader|last=Bergen|first=Peter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2006|isbn=9780743278928|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, in 1989, Azzam was blown up in a massive car bombing outside the mosque. Bin Laden is thought by some to be behind the assassination due to the rift about the direction of the jihad at that time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Rohan Gunaratna, ''Inside Al Qaeda'' (NY: Berkley Books, 2003) 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however, doubt this claim; Ahmad Zaidan, for instance, author of the Arabic-language book ''Bin Laden Unmasked'', told Peter L. Bergen in an interview, "I rule out totally that bin Laden would indulge himself in such things, after all, Osama bin Laden, he's not type of person to kill Abdullah Azzam. Otherwise, if he be exposed, he would be finished, totally." Bergen also cites Saudi journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]], who speculates that there were more likely candidates than bin Laden: "It could be [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar|Hekmatyar]], it could be [[KHAD]], it could be the [[Mossad]], the Egyptians [around Ayman al Zawahiri] … I met with Hekmatyar, an arrogant, self-centered person. I think Hekmatyar had a secret organization to eliminate his enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Bergen, ''[[The Osama bin Laden I Know]]'' (New York: Free Press, 2006) 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of Al-Qaeda==
{{further|al-Qaeda}}
&lt;!--- BBC news suggests al-Qaeda was formed prior to the Afghan Jihad—see
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1551100.stm.--&gt;
By 1988, bin Laden had split from [[Maktab al-Khidamat]] because of strategic differences. While Azzam and his MAK organization acted as support for the Afghan fighters and provided relief to [[Afghan refugees|refugees]] and injured, bin Laden wanted a more military role in which the Arab fighters would not only be trained and equipped by the organization but also led on the battlefield by Arabic commanders. One of the main leading points to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was the insistence of Azzam that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming their separate fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Osama bin Laden I Know'' by Peter L. Bergen, pp. 74–88. {{ISBN|0-7432-7892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Bin Laden returned to [[Saudi Arabia]] a hero of jihad, celebrated in the Saudi press as a pious, courageous warrior who, along with his Arab legion, "had brought down the mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' by Lawrence Wright, NY, Knopf, 2006 p.146&lt;/ref&gt; However, at about the same time [[Iraq]] invaded neighbor [[Kuwait]] and bin Laden was alarmed at the prospect that foreign non-Muslim troops would enter the kingdom to fight Iraq. He met Saudi Prince [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Sultan]], the Minister of Defense, and offered to help defend Saudi Arabia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bin Laden:] I am ready to prepare 100,000 fighters with good combat capability within three months. You don't need Americans. You don't need any other non-Muslim troops. We will be enough.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Prince Sultan:] There are no caves in Kuwait. What will you do when he lobs missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bin Laden:] We will fight him with faith.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Jehl, "Holy War lured Saudis as Rulers Looked Away", ''New York Times'' December 27, 2001 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DD1031F934A15751C1A9679C8B63]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bin Laden was rebuffed and publicly denounced Saudi Arabia's dependence on the U.S. military, demanding an end to the presence of foreign military bases in the country. Other Saudi Muslims were also greatly upset that non-Muslim troops would be on the same peninsula as the two holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Anti-government Islamist militants in Saudi Arabia were even more inflamed when the foreign bases remained after the Gulf War was over.

Bin Laden's increasingly strident criticisms of the Saudi monarchy led the government to attempt to silence him. According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], "with help from a dissident member of the royal family, he managed to get out of the country under the pretext of attending an Islamic gathering in Pakistan in April 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch2.htm National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;" Another report has bin Laden retrieving his passport from the Saudi government to go to Peshawar in March 1992 to mediate the Afghan Civil War. In any case [[Hassan al-Turabi]], leader of the [[National Islamic Front]], had invited bin Laden to "transplant his whole organization to Sudan" in 1989. Bin Laden's agents had begun purchasing property in Sudan in 1990. Bin Laden moved to Sudan in 1992.

==Yugoslav wars (1991–1999)==
{{further|Yugoslav wars}}
One of the former State Department officials described Bosnia and Herzegovina of that time as a safe haven for terrorists, after it was revealed that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists include hard-core terrorists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20011015&amp;slug=bosnia15|title=Bosnia – base for terrorism|publisher=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]], one of the largest Polish daily newspapers, reported that intelligence services of the Nordic-Polish [[SFOR]] Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located in the Bocina Donja village near [[Maglaj]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In 1992, thousands of volunteers joined an "all-mujahedeen unit" called El Moujahed, which was headquartered in [[Zenica]] in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall. According to Middle East intelligence reports. Bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in [[Sudan]]. Among them was [[Karim Said Atmani]] who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeffrey. [[Washington Post]], "A Bosnian Village's Terrorist Ties", March 11, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former roommate of [[Ahmed Ressam]], the man arrested at the Canadian-U.S. border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials.&lt;ref name="csisAlmrei"&gt;[[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Hassan Almrei, February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baravalle, Giorgio. "Rethink: Cause and Consequences of September 11",  2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of colluding with Osama bin Laden by a French court.&lt;ref&gt;Assyrian International News Agency, "[http://www.aina.org/news/20050817121245.htm Jihadists find convenient base in Bosnia]", August 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former mujahideen who are linked to the same Algerian group or to other suspected terrorist groups and who have lived in this area 60 miles north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. [[Khalil al-Deek]], was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites; a second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama Bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997 Report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces. Further, the terrorists also admitted to ties with Osama Bin Laden. In 1999 it was revealed that Osama bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and [[Bosnian passport]] in 1993 by the Government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by Bosnian government following the 9/11 attacks but it was later found out that Aodouni was arrested in [[Turkey]] and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation new explanation was given that bin Laden "did not personally collect his Bosnian passport" and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.&lt;ref&gt;BIN LADEN WAS GRANTED BOSNIAN PASSPORT, Agence France Presse September 24, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E0DA103DF930A1575AC0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all  Outsiders Bring Islamic Fervor To the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosnian daily [[Oslobođenje]] published in 2001 that three men, believed linked to be linked to Osama Bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were [[Egypt]]ian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.

In 1998 it was reported that bin Laden is operating his terrorist network out of [[Albania]]. [[The Charleston Gazette]] quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of the [[SHISH|Albanian intelligence service]], as saying a network run by Saudi exile Osama Bin Laden sent units to fight in the Serbian province of [[Kosovo]]. Confirmation of these activities came from Claude Kader, a French national who said he was a member of Bin Laden's Albanian network. He claimed he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;'The Charleston Gazette.' November 30, 1998 - Page 2A&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 bin Laden was operating from Kosovo planning the terrorist activities during the [[Insurgency in the Preševo Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Canberra Times'. April 28, 2000 - Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections between bin Laden and [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]], an insurgent, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization that operated in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in 2001 were also drawn. According to the [[Washington Times]] the NLA was fighting to keep control over the region’s drug trafficking, which had grown into a large, lucrative enterprise since the [[Kosovo war]] and that in addition to drug money, the NLA also had another prominent venture capitalist, Osama Bin Laden. According to a document written by the chief commander of the Macedonian Security Forces, bin Laden was financing the rebel group through a representative in Macedonia. Osama Bin Laden, paid $6 to $7 million for the needs of the National Liberation Army through his representative. Osama Bin Laden was planning to gain control over Macedonia so that he could control the distribution of oil to the United States through the pipeline that was planned to stretch from Bulgaria to Albania ports.&lt;ref&gt;['Washington Times' June 22, 2001, "Bin Laden´s new special envoys"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assisted by donations funneled through business and charitable fronts such as [[Benevolence International]], established by his brother-in-law, [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], and especially by his stipend from the Bin Laden family business empire, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in [[Khartoum]], Sudan to disseminate Islamist philosophy and recruit operatives in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Bin Laden also invested in business ventures, such as al-Hajira, a construction company that built roads throughout Sudan, and [[Wadi al-Aqiq]], an agricultural corporation that farmed hundreds of thousands of acres of [[sorghum]], [[gum Arabic]], [[sesame]] and [[sunflower]]s in Sudan's central [[Al Jazirah, Sudan|Gezira]] province. Bin Laden's operations in Sudan were protected by the powerful Sudanese [[National Islamist Front|NIF]] government figure [[Hassan al Turabi]], but were not profitable.&lt;ref&gt;"His business career was a terrible failure" Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p.196&lt;/ref&gt; While in Sudan, bin Laden married one of Turabi's nieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DB23Ag02.html Bin Laden uses Iraq to plot new attacks], Asia Times Online, By Syed Saleem Shahzad, 23 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden continued his verbal assault on Saudi King Fahd, for example by financing an Advice and Reformation Committee in London that "sent faxes by the hundreds to prominent Saudis" denouncing the king and corruption in the kingdom. On 5 March 1994, the King retaliated by personally revoking his citizenship and sending an embassary to Sudan to demand bin Laden's passport so that he no longer travel. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend equivalent of about $7 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

By now Bin Laden was strongly associated with [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ) who made up the core of al-Qaeda by this time. In 1995 EIJ [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad#Mubarak assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate Egyptian president]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] with the help of [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiya]] and the Sudanese intelligence service. The attempt failed and disastrous backlash ensued. The EIJ was abruptly expelled from Sudan and bin Laden pressured to go as well. He took a chartered flight to [[Jalalabad]], [[Afghanistan]] and began building a network of contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Angeles Times]], [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224 Fighters hunt former ally], December 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge in Afghanistan==
Sudanese officials, whose government was under international sanctions, offered to expel Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1990s provided that the Saudis pardon him. The Saudis refused because they had already revoked his citizenship and would not accept him in their country.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"&gt;{{cite web

Consequently, in May 1996, under increasing pressure from Saudi Arabia, [[Egypt]] and the United States, Sudan asked bin Laden to leave.  Bin Laden was forced to make a distress sale of his assets in Sudan that left with almost nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.213-222&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Afghanistan on a chartered plane and flew to [[Kabul]] before settling in the [[Nazim Jihad]] compound in Jalalabad after being invited by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], leader of the [[Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan]], a member of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]]. After spending a few months with these three leaders in the border region hosted by them, bin Laden forged a close relationship with selected leaders of Afghanistan's new [[Taliban]] government, notably Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden supported the Taliban regime with financial and paramilitary assistance and, in 1997, he moved to [[Kandahar]], the Taliban stronghold.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"/&gt;

In Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were able to raise some money from "donors from the days of the Soviet jihad," and from the Pakistan [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] which paid them to train militants for the fight against [[India]] in [[Kashmir]]. This was done at the old al-Qaeda camps in [[Khost]] which the ISI had persuaded the Taliban to return to al-Qaeda control.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early aid for attacks==
{{further|Luxor massacre}}
Several years before bin Laden was well known outside of Saudi and Islamist circles, he assisted and/or funded what he believed to be physical [[jihad]] against impiety involving attacks on civilians.

While still in Saudi Arabia in 1989, he angered the Saudi royal family by preaching for and financing assassinations of socialist leaders in the neighboring country of [[Yemen]], his father's homeland, where the country was in the process of [[Yemenite reunification|re-uniting]] under a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 or 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, [[Qari el-Said]], with $40,000 to [[Algeria]] to aid the Islamists there and warn them against compromise with the impious government. Making jihad merely "for politics, not for God" would be a sin, they were told; total war was the only solution. [[Algerian Civil War#Massacres and reconciliation|Total war]] did follow involving many massacres of civilians and a declaration of [[takfir]] of Algerians by one of the Islamist factions (the GIA).&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), p. 272–73&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 150,000–200,000 Algerians were killed by the end of the war, but the government prevailed over the Islamists. Abdullah Anas, an Algerian Islamist witness to the Al-Qaeda advice, later lamented, `This simple argument destroyed us.`&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Another unsuccessful effort by bin Laden was the [[November 1997 Luxor massacre|Luxor massacre of November 17, 1997]], which Swiss federal police are reported to have found was funded by  Bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;Jailan Halawi, `bin Laden behind Luxor Massacre?` ''Al-Ahram Weekly'', May 20–26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The attack by six [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] militants dressed as policemen slaughtered 58 foreign tourists and four [[Egyptians]] at Luxor Temple. Its goal was to derail the nonviolence initiative between the Egyptian government and Egyptian-based al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the major Egyptian militant Islamist group, but the attack horrified the Egyptian public and turned it completely against Islamist terror.

A later attack that did succeed, at least temporarily, was that on the northern Afghan city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]]. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden helped cement his alliance with his hosts, the ruling [[Taliban]], by sending several hundred of his [[Afghan Arabs|Afghan Arab]] fighters along to help the Taliban [[Taliban#Ethnic massacres and persecution|overrun]] Mazar-e-Sharif.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The city fell, but journalists report it as a particularly gruesome conquest.

==Attacks on United States targets==
It is believed that the first terrorist attack involving bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]]. The attack was intended to kill American troops on the way to Somalia, but the soldiers were staying in a different hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', 2006, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs killed a Yemeni hotel employee and an Austrian national and also seriously injured the Austrian's wife.&lt;ref name="pbschronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html|title=who is bin laden?: chronology PBS|accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justificiation for the killing of innocent people, such as the two bystanders at the hotel. According to a fatwa issued by [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]] (aka, Abu Hajer al Iraqi), the most Islamically knowledgeable of Al-Qaeda's members, the killing of someone merely standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander, like the Yemini hotel worker, will find their proper reward in death, going to Paradise if they were good Muslims and to hell if they were bad or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, U.S. v. Usama bin Laden, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the public.

In 1998, Osama bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], (a leader of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]]), co-signed a ''[[fatwa]]'' (religious edict) in the name of the [[World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders]], declaring:
{{cquote|[t]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] (in [[Jerusalem]]) and the holy mosque (in [[Makka]]) from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty [[Allah]], 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In response to the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] following the fatwa, President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered a freeze on assets that could be linked to bin Laden. Clinton also signed an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]], authorizing bin Laden's arrest or [[assassination]].

On 4 November 1998, Osama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal [[Grand Jury]], and the [[United States Department of State]] offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to bin Laden's apprehension or conviction.&lt;ref name="CNN-20010912"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/12/binladen.profile/ |title=Bin Laden, millionaire with a dangerous grudge |publisher=CNN |date=September 12, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'', 11 January 1999, Osama bin Laden is quoted as saying:

{{cquote|"The International Islamic Front for Jihad against the U.S. and [[Israel]] has issued a crystal-clear [[fatwa]] calling on the [[Islam]]ic nation to carry on [[jihad]] aimed at liberating holy sites. The nation of [[Muhammad]] has responded to this appeal.

Following the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing]], [[Mohammed Atef]] was moved to Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks]], [[9/11 Commission]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==September 11 attacks==
{{Main|Responsibility for the September 11 attacks|Videos of Osama bin Laden}}
[[Image:September 17 2001 Ground Zero 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]

The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government of the United Kingdom]] stated that evidence linking Al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks of September 11 is clear and irrefutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page3682.asp |title=Responsibility for the Terrorist Atrocities in the United States, 11 September 2001 |publisher=10 Downing Street, Office of the Prime Minister of the UK |date=November 14, 2001 |accessdate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908232129/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page3682.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a "White Paper" by the U.S. government, documenting the case against bin Laden and the Al Qaeda organization concerning the September 11 attacks, publicly promised by Secretary of State Colin Powell, was never published. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has not sought formal criminal charges against bin Laden (or anyone but [[Zacarias Moussaoui]]) for the 9/11 attacks. This has provided what some call "fodder for conspiracy theorists who think the U.S. government or another power was behind the Sept. 11 hijackings."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700687_pf.html  Bin Laden, Most Wanted For Embassy Bombings? By Dan Eggen]&lt;/ref&gt; Two separate indictments were made against bin Laden by two separate grand juries in 1998 for two separate terrorist acts, though no indictments have been filed against him for the events of 9/11.

Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] while praising them effusely, explaining their motivation, and dismissing American accusations of his involvement as an example of its hatred for Islam. On 16 September 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast by [[Qatar]]'s [[Al Jazeera]] satellite channel saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox News]]. "Pakistan to Demand Taliban Give Up Bin Laden as Iran Seals Afghan Border." 16 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;because of their religion, not just because of the presence of Osama bin Laden … It is a known fact that America is against the establishment of any Islamic state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Bin laden 12 27a.jpg|thumb|Osama bin Laden on [[27 December]] 2001.]] --&gt;

In early November 2001, the [[Taliban]] government announced they were bestowing official Afghan [[citizenship]] on him, as well as Zawahiri, [[Mohammed Atef]], and Shaykh [[Asim Abdulrahman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hindu]], [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/11/10/stories/03100007.htm Taliban grants Osama citizenship], November 9, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan]]. In it Osama bin Laden discusses the attack with an old mujahideen friend [[Khaled al-Harbi]] in a way indicating foreknowledge of the attack. "We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy;" and "We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event [the 9/11 attack] would take place that day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bin Laden on tape: Attacks 'benefited Islam greatly' |publisher=CNN |date=December 14, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/ret.bin.laden.videotape/ |accessdate=2006-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227125232/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/ret.bin.laden.videotape/ |archivedate=December 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. Some have disputed this translation however. On 20 December 2001, German TV channel "Das Erste" broadcast its analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the show Monitor, two independent translators and an expert on oriental studies found the White House's translation to be not only inaccurate, but also "manipulative". Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini, one of the translators, stated: "I have carefully examined the Pentagon's translation. This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdr.de/tv/monitor/beitraege.phtml?id=379 |title=Bin-Laden-Video: Falschübersetzung als Beweismittel? |publisher=WDR, Das Erste, MONITOR Nr. 485 am 20.12.2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218105636/http://www.wdr.de/tv/monitor/beitraege.phtml?id=379 |archivedate=December 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another bin Laden video was released on 27 December 2001, with much the same message as his first. America had accused him of organizing the attacks because of "Crusader hatred for the Islamic World.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to … the continuous injustice inflicted upon our sons in Palestine, Iraq, Somalia, southern Sudan, and … Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Transcript: Bin Laden video excerpts

Shortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2004, another [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|taped statement]] was released and aired on Al Jazeera in which bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he told viewers he had personally directed the 19 hijackers,&lt;ref name="cbc-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Al-Jazeera: Bin Laden tape obtained in Pakistan| publisher = MSNBC |date=30 October 2004 | url = http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6363306/| accessdate = 2006-09-07}}—''"In the tape, bin Laden—wearing traditional white robes, a turban and a tan cloak—reads from papers at a lectern against a plain brown background. Speaking quietly in an even voice, he tells the American people that he ordered the September 11 attacks because “we are a free people” who wanted to "regain the freedom" of their nation."''&lt;/ref&gt; and gave what he claimed was his motivation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3966817.stm |title=Excerpts: Bin Laden video |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-11-02 | date=2004-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3966817.stm Excerpts: Bin Laden video].

Her paternal aunt Habibe Hanım, who had been a hazinedar in Mehmed's harem, took her for service in the Dolmabahçe Palace.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=192}} She was then placed in the service of Şayeste Hanım in the Çengelköy Palace.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=72, 74}}

==First marriage==
Müveddet married Mehmed on 25 April 1911 in the mansion of Çengelköy.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=192}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=706}} A year after the marriage, on 5 October 1912, she gave birth to the couple's only son, Şehzade Mehmed Ertuğrul.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}} After Mehmed's accession to the throne on 4 July 1918, she was given the title of "Ikinci Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=73}}

He was deposed on 1 November 1922, and went to exile with their son Ertuğrul on 17 November 1922. She, together with other members of his family, was kept in house arrest at the Feriye Palace by order of the new parliament until 10 March 1924,{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=192}} when they were sent into exile. Müveddet joined Mehmed in [[Sanremo|San Remo]].{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=707}}

==Second marriage==
After Mehmed's death in 1926, Müveddet went to Paris with his daughter Ulviye Sultan. She stayed with her in her villa for some time, and later moved to the villa of Sami Bey, the son of [[Mediha Sultan]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=193}}

In 1929, Müveddet went to Alexandria, and married Şakir Bey, son of Emin Pasha on 2 May 1932.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=193}} Prince Ertuğrul always refused to accept his mother's second marriage, and never saw her again.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}} She divorced him on 28 February 1936.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=193}}

==Last years and death==
She then took advantage of the law allowing the widows of the sultans allowing to return to Turkey,{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}} moved back to Istanbul in 1948,{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=193}} and settled in the mansion in Çengelköy, which she jointly owned.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}}

She died in 1951, in her mansion in Çengelköy, and was buried in the property's private cemetery.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=94}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=707}}{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

== First study ==
In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

=== Discussion ===
Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

His friends named him after [[Wilson Pickett]] as he was an accomplished dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peuplesawa.com/fr/bnnews.php?nid=200&amp;kat=3&amp;vip=0|title=Interview|date=12 February 2006|publisher=peuplesawa.com|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, sports manufacturer [[Puma SE]] used his image in a high-profile advertising campaign without his permission. Pickett is now contemplating legal action against Puma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalducameroun.com/article.php?aid=5166|title=Journal Du Cameroun.com: Le Camerounais Ngando Picket menace de poursuivre l'équipementier Puma|date=7 May 2010|publisher=journalducameroun.com|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the incident he said "I am extremely embarrassed as my image is everywhere, I have rights to my image on my person. I have nothing with Puma. Puma has no right to use my picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroun-online.com/actualite,actu-14084.html|title=Ngando Pickett rêve de fortune|date=May 11, 2010|publisher=Cameroun Online|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dancer and teacher of [[nuevo tango|tango nuevo]], he was known as ''El Pulpo'' or ''[[octopus]]'' for his fluid and intricate leg moves. Esbrez created and named several tango movements including: ocho loco, sentada girada, elevador, or el elástico. He explored the concept of trap sacadas (sacadas con agarre) and enganches into innovative variations.

His style was so well known that when the dancer starts combining several leg moves that look like Pulpo's it is being called ''pulpeadas''. He developed the concept of suspension as a tool to generate the control and fluidity that is part of his dance.

He worked for theaters and show-places in [[Buenos Aires]], such as: Teatro San Martin, Teatro Astral, Teatro Opera, Cafe Tortoni, El Viejo Almacen, La Ventana, Casablanca.  He taught in [[Brazil]] as a member of the ''Academia Argentina de Tango''.  One of Esbrez's partners was [[Luiza Paes]] - they were part of the ''International Congress of Argentine Tango'' in Buenos Aires.

He died on July 16, 2014 in Buenos Aires of complications of a liver disease. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2xtango.com/hasta-siempre-norberto-%E2%80%9Cel-pulpo%E2%80%9D-esbrez/ Hasta siempre Norberto “El Pulpo” Esbrez…] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229002814/http://www.2xtango.com/hasta-siempre-norberto-%E2%80%9Cel-pulpo%E2%80%9D-esbrez/ |date=2014-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sahrawi refugees''' refers to the refugees of the [[Western Sahara War]] (1975–1991) and their descendants, who are still mostly populating the [[Sahrawi refugee camps]] in Tindouf, Algeria. 

==History==
{{Sahara conflict}}
{{main|Western Sahara conflict}}
The biggest concentration of Sahrawi refugees was created in 1975–76, when [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees were fleeing from [[Royal Moroccan Armed Forces|Moroccan forces]], who advanced through [[Western Sahara]] during the [[Western Sahara War]] between Morocco and Sahrawi [[Polisario Front]]. Those refugees ended up in [[Sahrawi refugee camps]] in the [[Tindouf Province]], [[Algeria]]. With most refugees still living in the camps, the refugee situation is among the most protracted ones worldwide.&lt;ref name="unhcr_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw_2008"&gt;{{Cite book
 |title = Human Rights in Western Sahara and in the Tindouf Refugee Camps
 |year = 2008
 |page = 216
 |publisher = Human Rights Watch
 |editor = Eric Goldstein; Bill Van Esveld
 |isbn = 1-56432-420-6
 |url = https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/19/human-rights-western-sahara-and-tindouf-refugee-camps-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of ethnic Sahrawi refugees from Western Sahara also fled to Mauritania to escape the war, which began when Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1976. Uncertainty about the political future of Western Sahara deterred the ethnic Sahrawi refugees from returning home. 

Since the creation of the Sahrawi refugee problem in the 1970s, a significant number of Sahrawi refugees have tried to upgrade their status, by leaving the [[Sahrawi refugee camps|refugee camps in Tindouf]] and the northern villages in Mauritania. Some chose to immigrate to Europe, as part of the general [[African immigration to Europe|migration wave from Africa]], while others dispersed in Mauritania.

==Demographics==
===Tinduf refugees camps===
The number of Sahrawi refugees in Tinduf camps is disputed and politically sensitive. [[Morocco]] argues that Polisario and Algeria overestimate the numbers to attract political attention and foreign aid, while Polisario accuses Morocco of attempting to restrict human aid as a means of pressure on civilian refugee populations. The refugees' numbers will also be important in determining their political weight in the possible event of a [[referendum]] to determine Western Sahara's future status.

Algerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000. This has been supported by Polisario, although the movement recognizes that some refugees have rebased to Mauritania, a country that houses about 26,000 Sahrawis refugees.&lt;ref name="uscri_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unhcr_2009_mauritania"/&gt; [[UNCHR]] referred to Algeria's figure for many years, but in 2005 concern about it being inflated led the organization to reduce its working figure to 90,000 based on satellite imagery analysis.&lt;ref name="unhcr_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ussd_2007"/&gt; UNHCR is in dialogue with the Algerian Government and the Sahrawi refugee leadership, seeking to conduct a [[census]] to determine the exact number of refugees in the camps.&lt;ref name="unhcr_2010"/&gt;

In 1998, UN's [[Minurso]] mission identified 42,378 voting-age adults in the camps, counting only those who had contacted the mission's registration offices and subsequently been able to prove their descent from pre-1975 Western Sahara. No attempt was made to estimate the total population number in the camps.

The Moroccan government contends that the total number of refugees is around 45,000 to 50,000, and also that these people are kept in the camps by Polisario against their will.&lt;ref name="ecoi_2008"/&gt;

===Mauritania===
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian assistance agencies had virtually no contact with those refugees. Most lived in the northern town of Zouérat and the coastal town of Nouadhibou on Mauritania's northern border.

By the end of 2003, there were more than 26,000 registered Sahrawi refugees in Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/publisher,USCRI,,MRT,40b4594014,0.html|title=Refworld - U.S. Committee for Refugees World Refugee Survey 2004 - Mauritania|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a majority of people with refugee status in the whole Mauritania.

===Western Sahara===
The Sahrawis who did not flee have been given Moroccan citizenship. Following the 1975 [[Green March]], the Moroccan state has sponsored [[:Category:Settlement schemes|settlement schemes]] enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into [[Southern Provinces|the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara]] (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the [[Demographics of Western Sahara|500,000 inhabitants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/06/morocco-western-sahara-referendum-delay|title=Western Sahara’s stranded refugees consider renewal of Morocco conflict|first=Whitney|last=Shefte|date=6 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===In Europe===

==Humanitarian aid==
The ECHO (European Commission – Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection) allocated in 2013 some 10 million Euro for the purposes of improving living conditions of Sahrawi refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/sahrawi_en_0.pdf |title=Resources |website=reliefweb.int |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECHO has so far donated nearly 200 million Euro for that purpose, beginning from 1993. The [[European Commission]] refers to the Sahrawi refugees as the "forgotten refugees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/algeria-western-sahara_en# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426075720/http://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/algeria-western-sahara_en# |archive-date=2018-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic''' are women who were born in, who live in, or are from the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR) in the region of the [[Western Sahara]]. In [[Sahrawi society]], the women share responsibilities at every level of its community and social organization.&lt;ref name=TP&gt;Donati, Simone. [http://www.terraproject.net/en/photographers/simone-donati/saharawi Saharawi], Terra Project Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 41 of the [[Constitution of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] ensures that the state will pursue "the promotion of [[women]] and [their] [[Politics of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|political]], social and cultural participation, in the construction of society and the country's development".

== Clothing ==
Clothing worn by the Sahrawis include the robe called as the [[Daraa (robe)|Daraa]]. Women wear the headscarf known as the [[mefhla]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine, december 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://w-sahara.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html Mentioning of Daraa robe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in refugee camps==
The [[Polisario Front]], a national [[liberation movement]] that is recognized by the [[United Nations]] as the representative of the people of Western Sahara since 1979, has attempted to [[modernization|modernize]] the society of the [[Sahrawi refugee camps]] that was set up in [[Tindouf Province]], [[Algeria]] from 1975 to 1976, through emphasis on education, eradication of [[tribalism]] and [[feminism|emancipation]] of women. The role of Sahrawi women was central already in pre-colonial and colonial life, but was strengthened further during the war years (1975–1991), when Sahrawi women ran most of the camps' administration, while the men were fighting at the front.&lt;ref name="fmo_2005_b"&gt;{{Cite web

 |date=December 2005
 
 |url = http://www.forcedmigration.org/guides/llreport3/llreport3-5.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This together with literacy- and professional education classes produced major advances in the role of women in Sahrawi society. The return of large numbers of Sahrawi men since the cease fire in 1991 may have slowed this development according to some observers, but women still run a majority of the camps' administration,&lt;ref name="unhcr_2006"&gt;{{Cite web

 |title = Country Operations Plan: Algeria. Planning year: 2007
 |publisher = [[UNHCR]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sahrawi women's union [[UNMS]] is very active in promoting their role. The role of women in camps was enhanced by their shouldering of the main responsibility for the camps and government [[bureaucracy]] during the war years, as virtually the entire male population was enrolled in the Polisario army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taming the Sahara: Tunisia Shows a Way While Others Falter|author=Andrew Borowiec|year= 2003|publisher=Praeger/Greenwood|isbn=0-275-97647-5|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In the 2012 election for seats in the [[Sahrawi National Council]], 35% of the parliamentarians were women. In the [[Sahrawi legislative election, 2008|legislative election in 2008]] women gained 34.61% of seats, thanks in part to a quota system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Renewal of the Saharawi Parliament reached 61,53% | publisher = [[Sahara Press Service]] | date = 2008-02-25 | url = http://www.spsrasd.info/en/detail.php?id=872 | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3065">'''Yasa'ur''' (died 1320) was a [[Chagatai Khans|Chagatai]] prince who launched a revolt against the [[Ilkhan]] [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]]. He was the son of Chübei, and a great-great-grandson of [[Chagatai Khan]].

Yasa'ur had originally resided within the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai ''ulus'']]. In 1314 he participated in a campaign against the Ilkhanate, together with the Chagatai Khan's brother [[Kebek]] and a [[Neguderi]] prince [[Daud Khwaja]](a son of [[Qutlugh Khwaja]]) who had been expelled from his territories by the Ilkhan the previous year. Their forces defeated the Ilkhan army near the banks of the [[Murgab River (Afghanistan)|Murgab River]]; they then marched to [[Herat]]. The Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]] then set off with an army for the east, while the Chagataiid forces were recalled by the khan [[Esen Buqa I|Esen Buqa]]. 

Around this time Yasa'ur, who had been accused by Kebek of cooperated with the Ilkhanid forces during the invasion, defected to Öljeitü. His forces engaged in battle with the Chagataiid troops; an Ilkhanid army that had crossed the [[Oxus]] joined the fighting and secured victory for Yasa'ur. He, escorted by the Ilkhanid force, entered [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]; Öljeitü then allowed him to take control of the pasture lands of the [[Badghis]].

Öljeitü died in 1316 and was succeeded as Ilkhan by his son Abu Sa'id. Yasa'ur initially pledged loyalty to the new Ilkhan, but was apparently uncooperative with Ilkhanid authorities. In early 1319 he openly revolted against Abu Sa'id, invading the province of [[Mazandaran]]. This revolt coincided with an invasion by [[Uzbeg Khan]], forcing the Ilkhanids to defend against two attacks simultaneously. Amir Husain (the father of [[Hasan Buzurg]], who founded the [[Jalayirid]] dynasty in [[Baghdad]]) was sent to deal with Yasa'ur. The Amir [[Coban (Chobanids)|Coban]], overestimating the strength of Yasa'ur, also planned to march against the Chagataiid prince at the head of a 20,000-strong army, but eventually decided to defend against Uzbeg's forces.  

Amir Husain's approach caused Yasa'ur to retreat from Mazandaran. From [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] he then sent a force to take [[Herat]], whose ruler, the [[Kartids|Kartid]] Giyath al-Din, had declared his loyalty to the Ilkhanids. The siege of Herat was unsuccessful, however, as Yasa'ur decided to withdraw upon hearing of the approach of the Ilkhanid army and withdrew into southern [[Afghanistan]]. In the following year, he was killed by Kebek, who had recently become Chagatai Khan and who deemed Yasa'ur to still be a threat.

Yasa'ur's personal troops eventually formed the basis of the [[Yasa'uri]], a group that gained influence within the Chagatai ''ulus'' in the mid-fourteenth century.
