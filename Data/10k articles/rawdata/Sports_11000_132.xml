[[SC Bissau]] won their eleventh title and finished with 39 points and to financial reasons did not qualified and competed in the [[2005 CAF Champions League]] the following season.  [[Mavegro Futebol Clube|Mavegro]] won the 2004 [[Guinea-Bissau Cup]] and did not participate in the [[2005 CAF Confederation Cup]] the following season also to financial concerns.

Originally a 22 match season and would be 232 matches, instead as FC Bijagos and [[UDI Bissau]] withdrew and were excluded, an 18 match season took place and thus relegated to the second division in the following season.  [[Flamengo Futebol Clube|Flamengo Bissau]] was last place with 13 points and the only club who competed relegated.

[[UDI Bissau]] was the defending team of the title. SC Bissau finished with 39 points.  Atlético Bissorã scored the most goals numbering 28.

The '''baggy green''' is a [[cricket cap]] of dark [[Shades of green#Myrtle green|myrtle green]] colour, which has been worn by [[List of Australia Test cricketers|Australian Test cricketers]] since around the turn of the twentieth century. The cap was not originally baggy as evidenced by photographs of early players. The cap has long been a symbol of national pride in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3058717.stm Salute the Baggy Green giants]&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by the chief executive of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] as the "most famous cricket cap in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-albion-historic-commercial-joint-venture,259,NS.html MCC / Albion: historic commercial joint venture]&lt;/ref&gt;

While respect for the baggy green cap has always been high, it has grown in stature since the 1990s, chiefly due to the efforts of captains [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]] and [[Steve Waugh]]. Waugh regularly expressed his belief that the honouring of the traditions of the game was critical to the success of a team: "''To be able to partake of these rituals and traditions has meant you have been awarded the highest honour in Australian cricket &amp;mdash; you have been selected to play for your country.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss2445/24450340.htm The importance of rituals]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:BaggyGreen1928.jpg|125px|left|thumb|The cap illustrated (with an enlargement of the device it bears) on a [[cigarette card]] from 1928]]
The baggy green cap was originally supplied to the player as part of a kit of equipment, and a new one was routinely issued for each tour, with the year number on it. In fact, a few former Australian players have been known to use the cap for 'non-cricketing' purposes. [[Bill Lawry]] used the cap while cleaning his pigeon's nest, while [[Bill Ponsford]] was known to wear the cap to protect his hair while painting the fence in front of his house. [[Ian Chappell]] never kept any of his baggy green caps. In the early 1990s an unofficial practice emerged amongst test players never to replace a baggy green cap, most notably by Steve Waugh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/specials/australia_v_south_africa/1753199.stm Capping Waugh's career]&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no official rule against a player obtaining a replacement cap from [[Cricket Australia]], this almost never occurs, and the increasingly dilapidated state of an aging baggy green cap is a ''de facto'' symbol of seniority amongst the players in the team.

During his captaincy Taylor instituted a pre-match ceremony for the awarding of a cap. This continued under Waugh, who introduced a refinement whereby new players would receive their "baggy green" from a past player of a similar discipline (batsman, spin bowler, etc.). [[Ricky Ponting|Ponting]] changed it again, making the presentation himself rather than using a former player. Another tradition instituted by Taylor (but suggested by Steve Waugh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Baggy Green: The Pride, Passion and History of Australia's Sporting Icon |last1=Fahey |first1=Michael |last2=Coward |first2=Mike |publisher=The Cricket Publishing Co. |date=August 2008 |isbn=978-0977563111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one that has also continued) is the practice of all players wearing the cap during the first session in the field of a Test match, as a symbol of solidarity. Even [[Shane Warne]], known for his preference for a floppy [[sun hat]], observed this tradition without question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/07/12/d30712040427.htm The timeless great]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern players seldom wear the baggy green cap while batting, choosing a protective helmet instead, especially when facing faster bowlers.

Baggy green caps can in some cases be prized as valuable sporting memorabilia. The cap worn by [[Sir Donald Bradman]] during his final season in 1948 sold in 2003 for A$425,000, and the 1953 cap of [[Keith Miller]] sold at auction for A$35,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leski.com.au/news/20050323/index.php Steve Waugh Baggy Green] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110223406/http://www.leski.com.au/news/20050323/index.php |date=10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the caps of lesser-known players have fetched figures above A$10,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Waughs-other-cap-may-end-up-as-moth-food-after-sale-stalls/2005/05/16/1116095907390.html Waugh's other cap may end up as moth food after sale stalls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Australia Cricket Cap Insignia.svg|right|125px|thumb|Men's baggy green coat of arms]]Sometimes incorrectly called a "crest", the "achievement" or coat of arms on the Baggy Green cap is a pre-federation symbol representing Australian commercial endeavours of the time: wool-growing, shipping, mining and  agriculture.

It consists of: a crest (being a rising sun); over a torse (or wreath) of red and gold; over a shield (bearing images of a [[golden fleece]], a sailing ship, a pick-axe and shovel and a garb of wheat, all quartered by a southern cross); supporters (being a kangaroo and an emu); all over a motto ("Australia") on a scroll.

The baggy green worn by male players has the motto in gold on a red background; on the women's baggy green, the motto and background colours are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Annesha |title=The stands of Alex Blackwell |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/24453149/alex-blackwell-speaks-role-agent-change-cricket |website=ESPNCricinfo |accessdate=27 August 2018 |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a common belief, with the exception of the supporters and the motto, this coat of arms is entirely different to the present and any former national coat of arms. Since 1912 the [[Coat of Arms of Australia]] has borne the badges of the six  [[Australian states]], enclosed and unified on a shield under a wreath of blue and gold bearing a [[Commonwealth Star]].

The device on the cap is sometimes referred to as Australia's Cricket Coat of Arms, although it has otherwise been abandoned by Cricket Australia. It is replicated on the protective helmet, but not on any other badged item of clothing worn by the Australian team. These now feature the current [[logogram]] of Cricket Australia, being a modern distorted shield with the ubiquitous Southern Cross on a green and gold field of a rising sun and a wicket casting a shadow on a pitch.

The '''Baguio Athletic Bowl''' is a sporting venue within the grounds of [[Burnham Park (Philippines)|Burnham Park]] in [[Baguio]], [[Philippines]]. Completed in 1945, it is currently undergoing renovation work.&lt;ref name=sept0715&gt;{{cite news|title=DPWH wants oval rehab finished soon|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2015/09/07/dpwh-wants-oval-rehab-finished-soon-428988|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=Sun Star Baguio|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Baguio Athletic Bowl was built in 1945.&lt;ref name=sept0715/&gt; The venue is under the ownership of the [[Philippine Tourism Authority]] (PTA). Through Executive Order 224 issued by President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] on February 10, 1995 transferring the management, administration, and maintenance responsibilities from the PTA to the Baguio City Government. Further powers were given to the city government when it is given rights to “control and further development" of Burnham Park in pursuant to Executive Order 695 issued by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] issued in January 10, 2008.&lt;ref name=gmanews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corsino|first1=Nikka|title=Baguio OKs ‘irregular’ Athletic Bowl deal|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/181203/news/regions/baguio-oks-irregular-athletic-bowl-deal|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 proposal===
The Baguio City Government leased the park to an undisclosed company to develop the Athletic Bowl and Burnham Park for P1.43 per square meter. The deal between the investors and the city government was reached in December 10, 2009 and was later approved by the city council in December 11 of the same year. The property would have been leased for 25 years with a monthly lease of P100,000 per month, with a 10 percent increased after five years. The plan involved building a hotel, a driving range, and a bus terminal. The planned development was a subject of controversy among Baguio residents. On January 8, 2010, Baguio City Mayor Reinaldo Bautista, Jr. said that the plan is not yet final and is still a proposal.&lt;ref name=gmanews/&gt; The proposal was later scrapped by the city government.&lt;ref name=2012controv&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dumlao|first1=Artemio|title=Baguio Athletic Bowl dev't project stirs controversy|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2012/09/01/844093/baguio-athletic-bowl-devt-project-stirs-controversy|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014-2016 renovations===
In 2012, Mayor [[Mauricio Domogan]] announced new plans to development of the Baguio Athletic Bowl and Burnham Park. The plan generated concerns with Councilor Edison Bilog calling Baguio residents to remain vigilant against commercialization of the park and cutting of trees for the development particular those at the World Park at the back of the Athletic Bowl. Domogan responded that the trees mentioned by Bilog will not be affected by the development and that he has sent the terms of reference of the project to the city council.&lt;ref name=2012controv/&gt;

At least three phases of renovation work are planned for the Athletic Bowl. Phase 1 involved the construction of a multipurpose office, a grandstand and the 75 percent completion of the venue's bleachers. The bleachers were installed by [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Department of Public Works and Highways-Cordillera]]. Phase 1 was completed in January 2015 and Phase 2 of the renovation work started. Phase 2 was suspended in early February 2015 due to Baguio's hosting of the 2015 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association Meet and the annual Panagbenga Festival celebrations. Phase 2 resumed after the conclusion of Panagbenga celebrations in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasagoy|first1=Mark Victor|title=Athletic Bowl rehab resumes|url=http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2015/03/05/athletic-bowl-rehab-resumes-395869|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=Sun Star Baguio|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasagoy|first1=Mark Victor|title=Council approves Athletic Bowl rehab fund|url=http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2014/11/04/council-approves-athletic-bowl-rehab-fund-374735|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=Sun Star Baguio|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 2, was planned to be completed by February 2016, in time for the 2016 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association (Caraa) meet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2016/01/24/baguio-athletic-bowl-ready-caraa-453421|title=Baguio Athletic Bowl ready for Caraa|publisher=Sun.Star Baguio|date=January 24, 2016|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involved the installing of rubber tracks from [[Switzerland]], continuation of unfinished bleachers and repair of the venue's old drainage system. Spurway Enterprises and R.U. Aquino Construction were involved in this phase.&lt;ref name=sept0715/&gt;&lt;ref name=masterplan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasagoy|first1=Mark Victor|title=Master plan needed for Athletic Bowl|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2015/07/31/master-plan-needed-athletic-bowl-422022|accessdate=7 September 2015|publisher=Sun Star Baguio|date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baguio Athletic Bowl was reopened to the public on January 29, 2016 following about two years of renovations. A 5,000 meter fun run activity was organized as part of the reopening ceremonies.&lt;ref name="reopens2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasagoy|first1=Mark Victor|title=City reopens newly improved Athletic Bowl|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/sports/2016/01/29/city-reopens-newly-improved-athletic-bowl-454458|accessdate=31 January 2016|publisher=Sun Star Baguio|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 3 is planned to commence in March 2016 which includes the reconstruction of the second bleachers.&lt;ref name="reopens2016"/&gt;

The '''British Tenpin Bowling Coaching Association''' (BTBCA) is a sub-section of the [[British Tenpin Bowling Association]] (BTBA) - the UK's only and leading [[Ten-pin bowling]] governing body.

==Formation==

Although associated under the umbrella group of the BTBA, the BTBCA is run solely by a committee, elected by the members annually at the [[Annual General Meeting]], subject to their good standing with the BTBA. 

The BTBCA Chairman reports annually to the BTBA, through the BTBCA President (the BTBA Director of National Coaching currently Arthur J McDonnell MSc).

==BTBA Coaching Qualification==
Within the BTBCA there are 4 levels to the BTBA Coaching Qualification. These include:

*Phase I: Instructor: - approved to teach beginners.
*Phase II Instructor: - approved to teach beginners and bowlers with a limited amount of experience in the Sport.
*Phase III Coach: - approved to coach advanced bowlers including County and National levels.
*Phase IV Coach: - approved to coach at all levels, coach education, Instructor mentoring and development, setting of standards for coaching.

==BTBCA Aim==
According to the BTBCA website, the main aim of the BTBCA is to provide a contact point for all BTBA qualified Instructors and Coaches. 

There is a two-day BTBA coaching course. The passing of this course gives a basis of knowledge from which to work, however, the only way in which people can develop their skills in coaching, is through practical experience. In gaining this experience, questions often arise, for which the answers are not immediately clear.

The [[British Virgin Islands]] have attended all seven [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1990 Commonwealth Games|1990]].

Having first competed at Auckland in [[1990 Commonwealth Games|1990]], the British Virgin Islands had never won a medal of any colour at a Commonwealth Games until [[Kyron McMaster]] won the men's 400m hurdles at the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chris Scott |title=A year after Hurricane Irma, Kyron McMaster wins BVI's first Commonwealth medal |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/12/sport/kyron-mcmaster-wins-british-virgin-islands-first-commonwealth-medal/index.html |work=CNN |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kyron McMaster wins the British Virgins Islands’ first ever medal in perfect tribute to late coach |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/athletics/kyron-mcmaster-wins-the-british-virgins-islands-first-ever-medal-in-perfect-tribute-to-late-coach/news-story/b7ed98ce1326b89d80dcb22761c26977 |work=Herald Sun |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kyron McMaster overcomes adversity to create British Virgin Islands history |url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/commonwealth/kyron-mcmaster-overcomes-adversity-to-create-british-virgin-islands-history-95287 |work=Athletics Weekly |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was McMaster's first global title, having been disqualified from the 400m hurdles at the [[2017 IAAF World Championships|2017 IAAF World Athletics Championships]], though did go on to win the [[2017 IAAF Diamond League]] title the following month. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''bullet''' is a [[kinetic projectile]] and the component of [[firearm]] [[ammunition]] that is expelled from the [[gun barrel]] during [[shooting]].  The term is from [[Middle French]] and originated as the [[diminutive]] of the word ''boulle'' (''boullet''), which means "small ball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|date=1994|publisher=Merriam-Webster Incorporated|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87779-911-3|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bullets are made of a variety of materials such as [[copper]], [[lead]], [[steel]], [[polymer]], [[rubber]] and even [[wax]].  They are available either singly as in [[muzzleloading]] and [[cap and ball]] firearms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hornady Lead Round Ball Black Powder Bullets|url=http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/sportsmans/Hornady-Lead-Round-Ball-Black-Powder-Bullets/productDetail/Bullets-and-Sabots/prod9999002186/cat100013#gridContainer|website=www.sportsmanswarehouse.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a component of [[paper cartridge]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper Cartridge Kit, .58cal rounds, 20 Count (with Minie Balls)|url=http://www.regtqm.com/58cal-Cartridge-Kit-p/diy-018.htm|website=regtqm.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but much more commonly in the form of [[metallic cartridge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Self Contained Cartridge|url=https://www.nrablog.com/articles/2016/5/a-brief-history-of-firearms-the-self-contained-cartridge/|website=nrablog.com|publisher=The National Rifle Association|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bullets are made in a large number of shapes and constructions depending on the intended applications, including specialized functions such as [[hunting]], [[target shooting]], [[training]] and [[combat]].

Though the word "bullet" is often used incorrectly in [[colloquial language]] to refer to a [[cartridge (firearm)|cartridge]] round, a bullet is ''not'' a cartridge but rather a component of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullet Types: A Reference Guide|url=http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/bullet-types/|website=cheaperthandirt.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A round of ammunition cartridge is a combination package of the bullet (which is the projectile),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Edmund G. |authorlink =Jerry Brown |title =Handgun Safety Certificate |publisher =[[California Department of Justice]] |volume = |edition = |date =2009 |location =[[West Sacramento, California]] |page =52 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cartridge (firearms)|case]] (which holds everything together), the [[propellant]] (which provide majority of the energy to launch the projectile) and the [[primer (firearm)|primer]] (which ignites the propellant).  This use of the term "bullet" when intending to describe a cartridge often leads to confusion when the components of a cartridge are specifically referred to.

Bullet sizes are expressed by their weights and diameters (referred to as "[[caliber]]s") in both [[Imperial units|imperial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Caliber? Bullet Sizes Explained|url=http://www.thefirearms.guide/ammo/what-is-caliber|website=thefirearms.guide.|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[metric system|metric]] measurement systems. For example: 55 grain .223 caliber bullets are of the same weight and caliber as 3.56 gram 5.56mm caliber bullets.

The bullets used in many cartridges are fired at [[muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]] faster than the [[speed of sound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handgun Ballistics|url=http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/ballistics/2012CatalogCenterSpread.pdf|website=hornady.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballistics – Rifle Ammunition Product Lines|url=http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/ballistics/2017-Standard-Ballistics.pdf|website=hornady.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; — about {{convert|343|m/s}} in dry air at {{convert|20|C}} — and thus can travel a substantial distance to a target before a nearby observer hears the sound of the shot. The sound of gunfire (i.e. the muzzle report) is often accompanied with a loud [[bullwhip]]-like crack as the [[supersonic]] bullet pierces through the air creating a [[sonic boom]]. Bullet speeds at various stages of flight depend on intrinsic factors such as its [[sectional density]], [[aerodynamic]] profile and [[ballistic coefficient]], and extrinsic factors such as [[barometric pressure]], [[humidity]], [[air temperature]] and [[wind speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eneaN4h-qBs|title=HOW fast bullet travels|first=|last=INSPIREME|date=2 January 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythbusterstheexhibition.com/science-content/dodge-a-bullet/|title=Mythbusters Museum|website=Mythbusters Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[subsonic ammunition|Subsonic cartridge]]s fire bullets slower than the speed of sound so there is no sonic boom. This means that a subsonic cartridge, such as [[.45 ACP]], can be substantially quieter than a supersonic cartridge such as the [[.223 Remington]], even without the use of a [[suppressor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can You Suppress Supersonic Ammo?|url=http://blog.silencershop.com/shooting-supersonic-suppressed/|website=silencershop.com|publisher=silencershop.com|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullets do not normally contain [[explosive]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1770159 | pmid=14693853 | volume=57 | title=The exploding bullet | journal=J Clin Pathol | pages=108 | last1 = Swift | first1 = B | last2 = Rutty | first2 = GN | doi=10.1136/jcp.57.1.108}}&lt;/ref&gt; but damage the intended target by transferring [[kinetic energy]] upon impact and [[Penetration (weapons)|penetration]] (see [[terminal ballistics]]).

==History==
[[File:MaryRose-round shot.JPG|thumb|left|Round shot from the ''Mary Rose'' showing both stone and iron ball shot]]

The first use of gunpowder in [[Europe]] was recorded in 1247. It had been used in China for hundreds of years. The cannon appeared in 1327. Later in 1364, the hand cannon appeared. Early projectiles were made of stone. Stone was used in cannon and hand cannon. In cannon it was eventually found that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications which gave rise to the use of heavier metals for the round projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar fashion following the failure of stone from siege cannon. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor occurred in 1425.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Dates in Gun History|url=http://armscollectors.com/gunhistorydates.htm|website=armscollectors.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this photograph of shot retrieved from the wreck of the ''Mary Rose'' which was sunk in 1545 and raised in 1982. The round shot are clearly of different sizes and some are stone while others are cast iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Cannon from the Mary Rose|url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/a_cannon_from_the_mary_rose|website=teachinghistory100.com|publisher=The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naseby musket balls.jpg|thumb|Matchlock musket balls, alleged to have been discovered at Naseby battlefield]]
The development of the hand [[culverin]] and [[matchlock]] [[arquebus]] brought about the use of [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] lead balls as projectiles. "Bullet" is derived from the French word ''boulette'', which roughly means "little ball". The original round [[musket]] ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. It was loaded into the barrel first, just resting upon the powder, and later using some sort of material as a wadding, between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trackofthewolf.com/list/Item.aspx/163/1|title=Precision Shooting Patches for round ball – Track of the Wolf|website=www.trackofthewolf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a "short start".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to load a musket|url=https://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/the_battle/the_weapons/load.html|website=tamu.edu|publisher=The Second Flying Company of Alamo de Parras|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loading of muskets was, therefore, easy with the old smooth-bore [[Brown Bess]] and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading [[rifle]], however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel.  Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for a bayonet, early rifles were not generally used for military purposes.

The first half of the nineteenth century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826, [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.

Square bullets have origins that almost pre-date civilization and were used by slingers in slings. They were typically made out of copper or lead. The most notable use of square bullet designs was done by, [[James Puckle]] and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the [[Puckle gun]]. The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued due to irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.

===Pointed bullets===
[[File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg#/media/File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg|thumb|left|Delvigne further developed cylindro-spherical (left) and cylindro-conical bullets (middle), which received the bullet grooves developed by [[Tamisier]] for stability]]

Delvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets. His bullet designs were improved by [[Tamisier|Francois Tamisier]] with the addition of "ball grooves" which are known as "[[cannelure]]s",  these moved the resistance of air behind the center of gravity of the bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gibbon, John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FEkwTZd9FMC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Gibbon+rifles#PPA125,M1 |title=The Artillerist's Manual|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tamisier also developed progressive rifling. The rifle grooves were deeper toward the breech, becoming shallower as they progressed toward the muzzle. This causes the bullet to be progressively molded into the grooves which increased range and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;''Deanes' Manual of the History and Science of Fire-arms'' by John Deane p.237-238 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lIBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Captain+Tamisier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GZTmKbpqzcC&amp;pg=PA515&amp;dq=Captain+Tamisier#PPA508,M1|title=The United Service Magazine|first=Arthur William Alsager|last=Pollock|date=16 May 2017|publisher=H.

[[Image:Eratic bullet trajectory.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Before Tamisier's invention, the orientation of a cylindro-conical bullet would tend to remain along its inertial axis, progressively setting it against its trajectory and increasingly meeting air resistance, which would render the bullet's movement erratic.]]

The [[Louis-Étienne de Thouvenin|Thouvenin]] rifle barrel had a forcing plug in the breech of the barrel to mold the bullet into the rifling with the use of a special ramrod. While successful in increasing accuracy it was extremely hard to clean. These improvements were the basis for the development of the Minié Ball.

Among the first pointed or "conical" bullets were those designed by Captain John Norton of the [[British Army]] in 1832. Norton's bullet had a hollow base made of lotus pith that, on firing, expanded under pressure to engage with a barrel's rifling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rifling: Expanding Bullets and the Minié Rifle|url=http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/05/rifling-expanding-bullets-and-minie.html|website=firearmshistory.blogspot.com|publisher=Firearms History, Technology &amp; Development|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Board of Ordnance rejected it because spherical bullets had been in use for the previous 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howey|first1=Allan W.|title=Facts, information and articles about the Minié Ball, a Civil War bullet|url=http://www.historynet.com/minie-ball?PageSpeed=noscript|website=historynet.com|publisher=Civil War Times Magazine|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned English gunsmith [[William Greener]] invented the Greener bullet in 1836. Greener fitted the [[Hollow-base bullet|hollow base]] of an oval bullet with a wooden plug that more reliably forced the base of the bullet to expand and catch the rifling. Tests proved that Greener's bullet was extremely effective, but the military rejected it too because, being two parts, they judged it as too complicated to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rifling: Expanding Bullets and the Minié Rifle|url=http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/05/rifling-expanding-bullets-and-minie.html|website=firearmshistory.blogspot.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minie Balls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Minié ball ammunition]]
The soft lead [[Minié ball]] was first introduced in 1847 by [[Claude-Étienne Minié]], a captain in the French Army. It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. As designed by Minié, the bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap would force itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1855, the British adopted the Minié ball for their [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfield rifles]]. In 1855 James Burton, a machinist at the US Armory at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia improved the Minié Ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Park Service Museum Collections|url=http://npscollections.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-drawings-of-james-burton-machinist.html|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Rare and Endangered Artifacts|url=https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/top-10-rare-and-endangered-artifacts.htm|website=nps.gov|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minié ball first saw widespread use in the [[American Civil War]].

A similar bullet called the [[Nessler ball]] was also developed for smoothbore muskets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nessler Ball &amp; Ribbed Slug|url=http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?272850-Nessler-Ball-amp-Ribbed-Slug|website=castboolits.gunloads.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1854 and 1857, Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]] conducted a long series of rifle experiments, and proved, among other points, the advantages of a smaller bore and, in particular, of an elongated bullet. The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually superseded by Metford's.

[[File:MHS bullet mold.jpg|thumb|This bullet mold was designed for use with the .44 caliber [[Colt Army Model 1860]] revolver.

In 1861 W.B. Chace approached President Abraham Lincoln with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the Potomac river where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing it never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilby|first1=Joe|title=Pedersoli musket, Nessler Balls and RCBS Dies|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9910b.html|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=civilwarguns.com|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1862 and later, [[W. E. Metford]] carried out an exhaustive series of experiments on bullets and rifling, and invented the important system of light rifling with increasing spiral, and a hardened bullet. The combined result was that in December 1888 the [[Lee–Metford]] small-bore (0[[.303 British|.303]]", 7.70&amp;nbsp;mm) rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted for the British army. The Lee–Metford was the predecessor of the [[Lee–Enfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Metford (Magazine Lee Metford / MLM) Bolt-Action Service Rifle (1888)|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=533|website=militaryfactory.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern bullets===
[[Image:100G115G130G150G.jpg|thumb|left|[[.270]] ammunition. Left to right: &lt;br&gt;{{convert|100|gr|sing=on}} – [[hollow-point bullet|hollow point]] &lt;br&gt;{{convert|115|gr|sing=on}} – FMJBT &lt;br&gt;{{convert|130|gr|sing=on}} – [[soft point]] &lt;br&gt;{{convert|150|gr|sing=on}} – round nose]]

The next important change in the history of the rifle bullet occurred in 1882, when Lt. Colonel [[Eduard Rubin]], director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the copper-jacketed bullet — an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5mm and 8mm) and it is the precursor of the 8mm ''Lebel bullet'' adopted for the smokeless powder ammunition of the Mle 1886 [[Lebel rifle]].

The surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt due to hot gases behind and friction with the bore. Because copper has a higher melting point, and greater [[specific heat capacity]] and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.

[[Image:.303ammunition.jpeg|thumb|[[.303 British|.303 inch]] (7.7 mm) centrefire, [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] rimmed ammunition]]
European advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]]. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most world armies had begun to transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and carried more energy with them. Spitzer bullets combined with [[machine gun]]s greatly increased the lethality of the battlefield.

The latest advancement in bullet shape was the [[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]], a streamlined base for spitzer bullets. The vacuum created as air moving at high speed passes over the end of a bullet slows the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this [[form drag]] by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named Balle "D" from its inventor (a lieutenant-colonel Desaleux), was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]].

A [[ballistic tip]] bullet is a hollow-point rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet itself. This improves [[external ballistics]] by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves [[terminal ballistics]] by allowing the bullet to act as a JHP on impact.

As a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not FMJ rounds.

==Design==

[[Image:Bullet coming from S&amp;W.jpg|thumb|A bullet in mid flight]]

Bullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun's bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, [[gas]] from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun's bore, and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed [[internal ballistics]]. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.

The physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed [[external ballistics]]. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet exploding midway in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a uniform front. These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and terminal ballistics requirements. Another method of stabilization is to place the center of mass of the bullet as far forward as is practical, which is how the Minié ball and the shuttlecock are designed. This makes the bullet fly front-forward by means of aerodynamics.

See the articles on [[terminal ballistics]] and/or [[stopping power]] for an overview of how bullet design affects what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet itself. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.

Bullet shapes are many and varied, and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds. Mould manufacturers such as RCBS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&amp;s1=4&amp;s2=9&amp;s3=83 |title=RCBS |publisher=RCBS |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326090103/http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&amp;s1=4&amp;s2=9&amp;s3=83 |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Jones Moulds, and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs. With a mould, bullets can be made at home for reloading one's own ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead.

==Propulsion==

Propulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:
* by using only gunpowder (i.e. as in [[flintlock]] weapons)
* by using a [[percussion cap]] and gunpowder (i.e. as in [[percussion]] weapons)
* by using a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] (which contains [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer]], gunpowder and bullet in a single package)

==Materials==
[[Image:Halvmantlad.jpg|thumb|Expanding bullet loaded in a [[6.5×55mm]] before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on large game. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a [[moose]] before coming to rest, performing as designed.]]

Bullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure [[lead]]. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450&amp;nbsp;m/s (1475&amp;nbsp;ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder [[alloy]] of lead and tin or [[typesetter]]'s lead (used to mold [[Linotype (alloy)|Linotype]]) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed coated lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass—and thus, [[kinetic energy]]—for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.

* '''Lead:''' Simple [[Cast bullet|cast]], extruded, [[swaging|swaged]], or otherwise fabricated lead slugs are the simplest form of bullets. At speeds of greater than 300 [[Meter per second|m/s]] (1000&amp;nbsp;ft/s) (common in most handguns), lead is deposited in rifled bores at an ever-increasing rate. Alloying the lead with a small percentage of [[tin]] and/or [[antimony]] serves to reduce this effect, but grows less effective as velocities are increased. A cup made of harder metal, such as copper, placed at the base of the bullet and called a [[gas check]], is often used to decrease lead deposits by protecting the rear of the bullet against melting when fired at higher pressures, but this too does not solve the problem at higher velocities.
* '''Jacketed lead:''' Bullets intended for even higher-velocity applications generally have a lead core that is jacketed or plated with [[gilding metal]], [[cupronickel]], [[copper]] alloys, or [[steel]]; a thin layer of harder metal protects the softer lead core when the bullet is passing through the barrel and during flight, which allows delivering the bullet intact to the target. There, the heavy lead core delivers its kinetic energy to the target. [[Full metal jacket bullet|Full metal jacket]] or "ball" bullets (cartridges with ball bullets (which despite the name are not spherical) are called ball ammunition) are completely encased in the harder metal jacket, except for the base. Some bullet jackets do not extend to the front of the bullet, to aid expansion and increase lethality; these are called soft point (if the exposed lead tip is solid) or [[hollow point bullet]]s (if a cavity or hole is present). Steel bullets are often plated with copper or other metals for corrosion resistance during long periods of storage. Synthetic jacket materials such as [[nylon]] and [[Teflon]] have been used, with limited success, especially in rifles; however, hollow point bullets with plastic aerodynamic tips have been very successful at both improving accuracy and enhancing expansion. Newer plastic coatings for handgun bullets, such as [[Teflon-coated bullet]]s, are making their way into the market.
[[File:3CastBullets.png|thumb|Hard cast solid bullet (left), with gas check (center) and lubrication (right).]]
* '''Solid''' or Monolithic Solid: mono-metal bullets intended for deep penetration in big game animals and slender shaped very-low-drag projectiles for long range shooting are produced out of metals like oxygen free copper and alloys like [[copper]] [[nickel]], [[tellurium]] copper and [[brass]], for example highly machinable UNS C36000 Free-Cutting Brass. Often these projectiles are turned on precision [[Lathe (metal)#CNC lathe / CNC turning center|CNC lathes]]. In the case of solids, and the ruggedness of the game animals on which they are used, e.g., the African buffalo or elephant, expansion is almost entirely relinquished for the necessary penetration. In shotgunning, "slug" loads are often solid large single lead projectiles, sometimes with a hollow point, used for deer or wild pig hunting in jurisdictions that do not allow rifles (because a missed slug shot will travel considerably less far than a rifle bullet).
**'''Fluted:''' In appearance, these are solid bullets with scalloped sides (missing material). The theory is that the flutes produce hydraulic jetting when passing through tissues, creating a wound channel larger than that made by conventional expanding ammunition such as hollowpoints.
**'''Hard Cast:''' A hard lead alloy intended to reduce fouling of rifling grooves (especially of the [[polygonal rifling]] used in some popular pistols). Benefits include simpler manufacture than jacketed bullets and good performance against hard targets; limitations are an inability to [[Hollow-point bullet#Expansion|mushroom]] and subsequent over-penetration of soft targets.
* '''[[Blank (cartridge)|Blanks]]:''' Wax, paper, plastic, and other materials are used to simulate live gunfire and are intended only to hold the powder in a blank cartridge and to produce noise, flame and smoke. The "bullet" may be captured in a purpose-designed device or it may be allowed to expend what little energy it has in the air. Some blank cartridges are crimped or closed at the end and do not contain any bullet; some are fully loaded cartridges (without bullets) designed to propel rifle grenades. Note that blank cartridges, at short ranges, can be lethal due to the force of the expanding gas – numerous tragic accidents have occurred with blank cartridges (e.g., the death of actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum]]).
* '''Practice:''' Made from lightweight materials like rubber, [[Wax bullets|wax]], wood, plastic, or lightweight metal, practice bullets are intended for short-range target work, only. Because of their weight and low velocity, they have limited range.
* '''Polymer:''' These are metal-polymer composites, generally lighter and higher velocity than a pure metal bullet of the same dimensions. They permit unusual designs that are difficult with conventional casting or lathing.
* '''Less lethal''', or Less than Lethal: [[Rubber bullet]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, and [[Flexible baton round|beanbags]] are designed to be [[non-lethal]], for example for use in [[riot]] control. They are generally low velocity and are fired from shotguns, grenade launchers, paint ball guns, or specially designed firearms and air gun devices.
* '''[[Incendiary ammunition|Incendiary]]:''' These bullets are made with an explosive or flammable mixture in the tip that is designed to ignite on contact with a target. The intent is to ignite fuel or munitions in the target area, thereby adding to the destructive power of the bullet itself.
* '''[[Exploding bullet|Exploding]]:''' Similar to the incendiary bullet, this type of projectile is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target. Not to be mistaken for cannon shells or grenades with fuse devices, these bullets have only a cavity filled with a small amount of low explosive depending on the velocity and deformation upon impact to detonate. Exploding bullets have been used on various aircraft machine guns and on anti materiel rifles.
* '''[[Tracer ammunition|Tracer]]:''' These have a hollow back, filled with a flare material. Usually this is a mixture of [[magnesium]] metal, a [[perchlorate]], and [[strontium]] salts to yield a bright red color, although other materials providing other colors have also sometimes been used. Tracer material burns out after a certain amount of time. Such ammunition is useful to the shooter as a means of learning how to point shoot moving targets with rifles. This type of round is also used by all branches of the United States military in combat environments as a signaling device to friendly forces. Normally it is loaded at a four to one ratio with ball ammunition and is intended to show where the shooter are firing so friendly forces can engage the target as well. The flight characteristics of tracer rounds differ from normal bullets due to their lighter weight.
* '''[[armor-piercing bullet|Armor-piercing]]:''' Jacketed designs where the core material is a very hard, high-density metal such as [[tungsten]], [[tungsten carbide]], [[depleted uranium]], or [[steel]]. A pointed tip is often used, but a flat tip on the penetrator portion is generally more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | title = The History and Development of the M16 Rifle and Its Cartridge | publisher = Armory Pub | location = Oceanside | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-9626096-0-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nontoxic shot:''' Steel, [[bismuth]], [[tungsten]], and other exotic bullet alloys prevent release of toxic lead into the environment. Regulations in several countries mandate the use of nontoxic projectiles especially when hunting waterfowl. It has been found that birds swallow small lead shot for their gizzards to grind food (as they would swallow pebbles of similar size), and the effects of lead poisoning by constant grinding of lead pellets against food means lead poisoning effects are magnified. Such concerns apply primarily to shotguns, firing pellets (shot) and not bullets, but there is evidence suggesting that consumption of spent rifle and pistol ammunition is also hazardous to wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research—Eagles and Lead.|url=http://www.soarraptors.org/leadresearch.html|publisher=SOAR Raptor Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of hazardous substances (RoHS) legislation has also been applied to bullets on occasion to reduce the impact of lead on the environment at [[shooting range]]s. United States Environmental Protection Agency announced that the agency does not have the legal authority to regulate this type of product (lead bullets) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), nor is the agency seeking such authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|title=NRA-ILA :: EPA Denies Ammo Ban Petition|date=11 January 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111073923/http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|archivedate=11 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With some nontoxic shot, e.g., steel shot, care must be taken to shoot only in shotguns (and with chokes) specifically designed and designated for steel shot; for other, particularly older, shotguns, serious damage to the barrel and chokes can occur. And, because steel is lighter and less dense than lead, larger sized pellets must be used, thus reducing the number of pellets in a given charge of shot and possibly limiting patterns on the target; other formulations, e.g. [[bismuth]], do not present this disability.
* '''[[Blended-metal bullets|Blended-metal]]:''' Bullets made using cores from powdered metals other than lead with binder or sometimes [[sintering|sintered]].
* '''[[Frangible bullet|Frangible]]:''' Designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the shoot-through danger behind the intended target. An example is the [[Glaser Safety Slug]], usually a pistol caliber bullet made from an amalgam of lead shot and a hard (and thus frangible) plastic binder designed to penetrate a human target and release its component shot pellets without exiting the target.
* '''Multiple impact bullet:''' Bullets that are made of separate slugs that fit together inside the cartridge, and act as a single projectile inside the barrel as they are fired. The projectiles part in flight, but are held in formation by tethers that keep the individual parts of the "bullet" from flying too far away from each other. The intention of such ammo is to increase hit chance by giving a shot-like spread to rifled slug firing guns, while maintaining a consistency in shot groupings. Multiple impact bullets may be less stable in flight than conventional solid bullets because of the added aerodynamic drag from the tether line holding the pieces in formation, and each projectile affects the flight of all the others. This may limit the benefit provided by the spread of each bullet at longer ranges.

==Treaties and prohibitions==
Poisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the [[Strasbourg Agreement (1675)]].

The [[St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868]] prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use by uniformed military personnel against the uniformed military personnel of opposing forces. These include projectiles that explode within an individual, poisoned and [[Hollow point bullet|expanding]] bullets.

Protocol III of the 1983 [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]], an annexe to the [[Geneva Conventions]], prohibits the use of incendiary ammunitions against civilians.

These treaties apply even to [[.22 LR]] bullets used in pistols, rifles and machine guns. Hence, the [[High Standard HDM]] pistol, a .22 LR suppressed pistol, had special bullets developed for it during World War II that were full metal jacketed, in place of the soft-point and hollow-point bullets that are otherwise ubiquitous for .22 LR rounds.

Some jurisdictions acting on environmental concerns have banned hunting with lead bullets and shotgun pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonlead Ammunition |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/hunting/lead-free/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental groups that the [[EPA]] must use the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] to regulate lead in shells and cartridges. The groups sought to regulate "spent lead", yet EPA could not regulate spent lead without also regulating cartridges and shells, per the court.&lt;ref name=we1214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Zack Colman|title=EPA can't regulate lead bullets, says federal court|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/epa-cant-regulate-lead-bullets-says-federal-court/article/2557789|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Washington Examiner|date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[political status of Taiwan]], the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) competed as '''[[Chinese Taipei]]''' at the '''[[1998 Winter Olympics]]''' in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], [[Japan]].  The [[International Olympic Committee]] mandates that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag is used, and not the [[flag of the Republic of China]].
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the team is known as ''Zhongguo Taibei'' (中国台北队) or, ''Taipei, China'', where ''China'' implies the PRC.

It is also known popularly as the '''Estadio Único''' (''One-of-a kind Stadium'') and is owned by the Province of Buenos Aires, administered jointly by the provincial government, the Municipality of La Plata, and the football clubs [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima de la Plata]].

== History ==
Opened on June 7, 2003, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata is one of the most modern of Latin America, even without having completed all of the planned construction. Its tenants include Estudiantes LP and Gimnasia y Esgrima LP. Gimnasia returned to their original stadium in mid-2008.

It is located between 32nd and 526th avenues, 25 Street and 21. These fields also contain a small rugby stadium and a center for Physical Education, which tend to be intercollegiate events with schools in the area, such as the school No. 31, better known as the Saint Martin Commercial.

Besides the planned placement of the cover to the third stage, which will begin in 2009, by virtue of being made the first two stages.

=== Beginnings ===
The idea of the project began in 1947 when Governor [[Domingo Mercante]] expropriated the property located at the junction of Roads 32 and 25 and formed the La Plata Sports Complex.

In 1972, La Plata was to be a candidate to host matches in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].

In 1989, after a meeting between the Buenos Aires Province Government and the Municipality of La Plata's, Estudiantes and Gimnasia, created a committee to build and manage a complex dedicated entirely to the practice of football and other sports.

Thus, after reviewing several alternatives, the construction of the stadium was proposed to take place in the area of the Center for Physical Education No. 2. This determined as the most accessible area for a stadium in La Plata. In January 1992 it was signed into law 11118, which established the construction site.

== Present ==
=== Construction ===
On April 21, 1992, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata Foundation was established, which was an institution composed equally of representatives from Estudiantes and Gimnasia. The College of Architects and Engineers held a meeting in April 1993 to choose an architectural proposal. It was awarded to Roberto Ferreira &amp; Associates.

In 1996 a permit was given by the Executive Branch that awarded the provincial administration the right to begin construction the following year. The Executive Unit called for public tenders for the job.

A year later they began building the supports for the roof. And in 1998, the governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]] and the Mayor of La Plata, [[Julio Alak]], laid the first stone to begin the construction of the stadium.

The works also detained foir trade union and economic problems in 2000, so ad with Eduardo Duhalde as President of the Nation, called for a new tender for the allocation of investment with a view to its installation in May 2003.

=== Opening and events===
The stadium opened on June 7, 2003. The stadium was temporarily closed to convert it into an [[all-seater stadium]], and to install a new roof intended to cover all seats. Work had gone ahead of schedule and the roof was finished before the end of February. The stadium was officially reopened on February 17, 2011, and its first match was played six days later between [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] and [[Deportes Tolima]] for the [[2011 Copa Libertadores Second Stage#Group 7|Group 7]] of the [[2011 Copa Libertadores]].

The stadium has since become a significant venue for musicians on tour. Over 300,000 tickets to such events at the stadium were sold in 2011, ranking the La Plata Stadium fifth worldwide in performing events tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieco.clarin.com/economia/Plata-catedral-rock_0_674332850.html|title=La Plata: la otra catedral del rock|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fake IPL Player''' is a cricket blog started by Anupam Mukerjee on 18 April 2009. The blog's appearance coincided with the start of the 2009 edition of the [[Indian Premier League]] (IPL) [[cricket]] tournament.

==History==
Originally, the blogger wrote anonymously, widely believed to be a member of the [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] team, [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] (KKR).&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/24/stories/2009042455521900.htm|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=2 May 2011|title=Sensational blog creates a buzz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamesbegin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fakeiplplayer.blogspot.com/2009/04/let-games-begin.html|title=Let the games begin|date=18 April 2009|work=Fake IPL Player Blog|publisher=[[Blogspot]]|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog was controversial from the start, giving unflattering nicknames to players, coaches, and owners of KKR and other teams, telling sordid stories, and showing most of them in a very negative light.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/22/ipl-indian-premier-league-fake-player|date=22 April 2009|title=Fake IPL player spins web of intrigue|accessdate=2 May 2011|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starboxoffice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starboxoffice.com/newsDetails.aspx?xfile=2009/April/News_20090423_127 |title=IPL blogger rattles SRK's team |date=13 April 2009 |publisher=Star Box Office |accessdate=29 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531035336/http://www.starboxoffice.com/newsDetails.aspx?xfile=2009%2FApril%2FNews_20090423_127 |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the blog rapidly became popular, it was believed to be of a fringe KKR player who was upset at not being part of the core team.&lt;ref name="Hindu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The blog worsened an already bad season for KKR, which lost most of their games, had controversies surrounding their coach, [[John Buchanan (cricketer, born 1953)|John Buchanan]], and frequently changed captains, including [[Sourav Ganguly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/sports/in-a-hell-called-kolkata-knight-riders|title=In a hell called Kolkata Knight Riders|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=8 April 2011|publisher=Open magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2009 Indian Premier League|2009 IPL season]] took place in South Africa, and two KKR players, Aakash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar, were sent home to India midway through the tournament. This fuelled speculation that they were suspected of being the person behind the blog.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/twenty20/ipl/5262552/Fake-IPL-player-lights-up-Kolkata-Knight-Riders-camp-in-South-Africa.html|date=2 May 2009|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|title=Fake IPL player lights up Kolkata Knight Riders camp in South Africa|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was also rumoured to have banned use of laptops by players. The management of the team termed the blog as "poison pen writing of the dirtiest variety", while denying it could have been written by an actual player.&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=17&amp;art_id=vn20090502061250969C679189|title= 'We went in, we got f****d, and we came out' |last=Naik|first=Sameer|date=2 May 2009|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blogger posted a disclaimer saying "All characters appearing in this work (blog) are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and unintentional."

==Unmasking==
In August 2010, [[Bangalore]] based marketing specialist Anupam Mukerji revealed himself on television and newspapers as the person writing the blog. He said he had "never met a cricketer in his life", and was just making up stories. He never expected it to become this big, he remarked, adding that the Fake Player ended up getting legitimised by the media frenzy. He said he was inspired by the popularity of a similar blog by [[Fake Steve Jobs]], and the [[Richard Gere]] movie ''[[The Hoax]]''.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrint_TOINEW&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=TOIM/2010/08/29&amp;ID=Ar00105|date=29 August 2010|publisher=[[Times of India]]|title=Not KKR insider, Fake IPL Player is a B’lore executive|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indibloggies.org/fip-interview|title=My book tells everything that the blog didn’t: Fake IPL Player|date=15 January 2010|work=indibloggies.org|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/cricketnews/And-the-Fake-IPL-Player-is/Article1-593020.aspx |title=And the 'Fake IPL Player' is... |author=Siddhanth Aney |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901174339/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/cricketnews/And-the-Fake-IPL-Player-is/Article1-593020.aspx |archivedate=1 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to write a weekly column as the Fake IPL Player for ''Mirror'', a ''Times of India'' tabloid in Mumbai and Bangalore.

In 2011, Anupam started Pitch Invasion, an online radio station that claims to provide live cricket commentary with a twist.

==Popularity==

During the IPL season, the blog was very popular in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and among major cricketing nations, most of whose players and coaches were involved in the league.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} {{Note|Citation unnecessary}} According to Mumbai-based digital marketing firm, [[Pinstorm]], the Fake IPL Player blog had at its peak, on 26 April, 150,000 visitors, who each spent 15 minutes on the site, adding up to about 37,000 hours spent on the blog in one day, putting it up there with popular individual-led blogs such as [[Aamir Khan]]’s blog at its peak with about 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="livemint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2009/05/12221337/Fake-IPL-player-highlights-som.html?pg=1|title=Fake IPL player highlights some real challenges|last=Shah|first=Gouri|date=13 May 2009|publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blogger said in an email interview to a newspaper that the key reason behind such wild popularity was the blog's "audacity", and that "the mainstream media needs to realise that getting ex-cricketers to write about a match that happened the previous day, which has already been dissected to death on TV and the internet, isn’t of interest to sports readers anymore."&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/extra-innings/590287/2|date=13 March 2010|accessdate=2 May 2011|title=Extra Innings|publisher=[[Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==
===The Gamechangers===
In March 2010 Fake IPL Player released a book called 'The Gamechangers' in India, coinciding with the third season of IPL, and loosely based on the contents of his blogs. This was before he had revealed his identity in August 2010. The book, which has been positioned as fiction written anonymously, covers 35 days of the Indian Bollywood League (IBL). The book describes the powerplays and machinations that go on behind the scenes of "megabucks" cricket. The central plot of the book is the chase to unmask a treacherous anonymous blogger who is upsetting the IPL. And through this story, FIP supposedly exposes cricket's dark underbelly. Critical reviews of the book were polarised with some praising it and some others criticising the book and its purpose. The 7 June 2010 issue of India Today put The Gamechangers at No. 9 in the list of Top 10 national best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;[[India Today]], 1 June 2010 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch Invasion===
In April 2011, Anupam Mukerji started an online radio station called [http://www.pitch-invasion.in Pitch Invasion]. Pitch Invasion claims to provide irreverent, wacky and interactive live cricket commentary on the web. Anupam also acts as the main station host.

In April 2013, Anupam launched [http://www.scoryboard.com Scoryboard], a live cricket web app, under the Pitch Invasion banner as reported here by [http://www.afaqs.com/media/story/37296_Scoryboard-opens-a-new-window-of-cricket-on-web Agency FAQs]. In October, they launched [http://www.scoryboard.com/f1 Scoryboard's F1 version] as reported [http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-fake-ipl-player-anupam-mukerji-creates-app-for-f1-lovers-1907945 here by daily newspaper DNA].

'''Fraser Field''' is a [[baseball]] park in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] that was built in 1940 by the [[Works Progress Administration]] as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]. Fraser Field has played host to many [[minor-league baseball]] teams over the years.

Beyond centerfield is the adjacent Manning Field, which replaced the old [[Manning Bowl]].

==Recent use==
The [[North Shore Navigators]] of the [[Futures Collegiate Baseball League]] call Fraser Field home. [[2008 NECBL season|2008]] was the Navigators' inaugural season at Fraser, having moved from [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], and the organization won its first NECBL title since the move to Lynn in [[2010 NECBL season|2010]].

Fraser Field has also hosted minor league professional baseball in the past. The stadium was home to the [[Massachusetts Mad Dogs]] of the independent [[North Atlantic League|North Atlantic]] and [[Northeast League|Northeast]] leagues from 1995 until 1999 and the [[North Shore Spirit]] of the independent [[Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball]] from 2003-2007.

In 2006 and 2007, the opening round of the Beanpot, a college baseball tournament featuring [[Boston College]], [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|The University of Massachusetts]], and [[Harvard University]], were played at Fraser Field.

==Field structure==
[[Image:RainbowOverFraser.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Fraser Field Grandstand.]]
The infield of Fraser Field is [[artificial turf]] manufactured and installed by Pro Grass LLC, while the outfield is [[grass|natural grass]].

In 2003, Nicholas Lopardo invested about $2.5 million to revitalize the park.  Lopardo's renovations included new scoreboards, seating, concessions, and clubhouses, along with a remodeled roof covering a section of the park's grandstand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalballparks.com/CanAm/Lynn21.html Fraser Field slideshow, URL accessed December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Spirit folded, Lopardo removed the portable clubhouses and graphic scoreboard, but other improvements remained in place.

The artificial turf was redone for the 2015 baseball season, finally omitting the Spirit logo denoting the previous franchise.

[[Image:Jersey green.svg|100px|right]]
The '''green jersey''' is a term used in [[road bicycle racing]] and  [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] stage races in particular. The green jersey is a [[Cycling jersey|distinctive racing jersey]] worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/0709/Tour-de-France-101-What-do-different-color-jerseys-mean|title=Tour de France 101: What do different color jerseys mean?|date=9 July 2010|author=David Clark Scott|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=15 October 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

While the overall race leader in the [[Tour de France]] will wear the [[yellow jersey]], or "maillot jaune", the green jersey ("maillot vert") will be worn by the leader in the points competition. Since 2009, the [[Vuelta a España]] has also used the green jersey to signify the leader of the points competition. In the [[Giro d'Italia]], the green jersey was, from 1974 to 2011, worn by the [[King of the Mountains]], the leader in the competition for [[climbing specialist]]s.

'''Herbert Harvey Pollack''' (March 9, 1922{{spaced ndash}}June 23, 2015) was an [[United States|American]] sports [[statistician]], a [[journalist]] of [[sports]] and [[entertainment]], a [[publicist]], and long term director of statistical information for the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. At the time of his death, Pollack held the distinction of being the only individual still working for the NBA since its inaugural 1946–47 season.  Because of his proclivity to [[Basketball statistics|statistics]], then ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' writer George Kiseda pinned the moniker of ''Super Stat'' on him in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/sixers/news/harvey_hof_020718.html John Bunn Award Recipient]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pollack played basketball for [[Simon Gratz High School]] and graduated in 1943 from Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;

==Career==
He took his first job as a sportswriter for the Philadelphia Bulletin after serving as a soldier in the United States Army during World War II. In 1946–47 he started as the assistant publicity director for the Philadelphia Warriors of the Basketball Association of America, which later merged with the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] to form the [[National Basketball Association]]. Midway through the 1952–53 season, he became head of media relations for the Warriors. The Warriors were sold by owner [[Ed Gottlieb]] (a founder of the NBA) and the team moved to San Francisco in 1962 (renamed [[Golden State Warriors]]), but Pollack remained in Philadelphia, where he worked for the NBA in various capacities until the 76ers were formed in 1963.  Pollack then served as the media relations director of the Philadelphia 76ers until the 1987–88 season, when he assumed the duties of director of statistical information for the team.

Pollack holds the distinction of keeping score during [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]], on March 2, 1962. According to Pollack,it was the "Busiest night of my career" as there was no press. Thus, he was the statistician and sole reporter for the game. Pollack made Chamberlain the sign which he holds in his famous post-game photo.  Pollack was responsible for many stats that are now officially recorded by the NBA, such as [[Block (basketball)|blocked shots]], and he was the first statistician to separate rebounds into [[Offensive rebound|offensive]] and [[Defensive rebound|defensive]].  Some believe he coined the term "triple-double,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Springer |coauthors= |title=Magical Statistic Reborn; Triple-double that Johnson made famous serves Bryant well |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=D.1 |date=November 11, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Gelston |coauthors= |title=Philly's Pollack has kept track of NBA from the start |work=[[USA Today]] |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 28, 2010 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2008-04-18-1580180897_x.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; although others claim that it was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers public relations director, Bruce Jolesch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J.A. |last=Adande |coauthors= |title=They're Vintage Triple-Doubles |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=D.4 |date=April 20, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Weir |coauthors= |title=20th Century This Day in Sports |work=[[USA Today]] |page=3.C |date=December 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Wilt Chamberlain 100-point.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Wilt Chamberlain, holding up a '100 sign', created by Pollack.]] --&gt;

During the Sixers’ offseason, Pollack analyzed all 1,230 play-by-play sheets from the previous season (every game of the regular season) to produce the '''Harvey Pollack's NBA Statistical Yearbook''', a book of rare basketball information that took statistical analysis to a new level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/pollack_hof.html NBA.com: The Original Superstat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes stats such as the shot distance of every field goal, who gets their shot blocked the most, and other creative categories like "working-man," which a player has to contribute to every category but no fouls or turnovers, and "trillionaire club" which is when player plays in a game and has all zeros across their name. This NBA publication evolved from developing the first of its kind media guides for the Philadelphia 76ers in 1966–67 and then separated later into a new NBA publication to become among the most distinguished compilations in the sports business.

Pollack claimed that Wilt Chamberlain had not only a quadruple-double, but also a game where he recorded at least double digits in all five primary statistical categories. However, this has not been recorded in the books because the NBA had not officially adopted the statistics yet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''Jon M. Huntsman Center''' is a 15,000-seat indoor [[arena]] in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], on the campus of the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]].  It is the home of the [[Utah Utes]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]], the primary venue for [[Utah Utes men's basketball|basketball]] and [[Utah Red Rocks|gymnastics]].

==History==
Opened {{Time ago|1970}} in late 1969 as the '''Special Events Center''',&lt;ref name=dustnoi/&gt; it succeeded Nielsen Fieldhouse as the campus' primary indoor arena.&lt;ref name=dustnoi/&gt; It was renamed in 1987 in honor of [[chemicals]] entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Jon Huntsman, Sr.|Jon M. Huntsman]] {{nowrap|(1937–2018),}} father of Utah's former [[List of Governors of Utah|governor]] [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]]

From its opening until the completion of the [[Vivint Smart Home Arena]] in 1991 (as "Delta Center"), the Huntsman Center was one of Salt Lake City's premier sports and entertainment venues (along with the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] {{nowrap|(1969–1993),}} the home of the [[Utah Stars]] ([[American Basketball Association|ABA]]) and [[Utah Jazz]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]])).

Architecturally, it was once known for its steel cloud, which hung from the arena's silver dome interior.  The steel cloud held the arena's center court scoreboard, sound and lighting systems.  The scoreboard was upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of state-of-the-art rear projection video screens.  The rear projection system was upgraded in 1995, and replaced in 2006 by four LED video screens. In 2014, the arena was renovated again. The $6 million project removed the steel cloud, as well as added a new floor, LED lights, sound system, drapes, and two grand entrances to house a Hall of Fame and Legacy Hall.

The facility hosted the 1989 [[Western Athletic Conference]] men's basketball tournament.

The facility hosted two games of the [[NBA Summer League|Utah Jazz Summer League]] in 2016 due to a concert at Vivint Smart Home Arena. In 2017, the Utah Jazz Summer League moved to the Huntsman Center for all six games &amp; four teams due to the Vivint Smart Home Arena undergoing renovations. 

The 15,000-seat multi-purpose arena is home to the University of Utah's [[Utah Utes|"Runnin' Utes"]]  basketball teams ([[Utah Utes men's basketball|men's]] and [[Utah Utes women's basketball|women's]]), [[Utah Red Rocks|"Red Rocks"]] women's gymnastics team and women's volleyball team. It also hosts concerts, mostly second-tier acts; most premier concerts have been hosted at Vivint Smart Home Arena (Delta Center).

Utah joined the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] in 2011 and the Huntsman Center became the largest arena in the conference.

The [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|4780|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]], second-highest in the Pac-12.
==NCAA tournament==
The Huntsman Center hosted the first and second rounds of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] twelve times ([[1984 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1984]], [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]], [[1987 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1987]], [[1988 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1988]], [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1990]], [[1991 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1991]], [[1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1993]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]], [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1997]], [[2000 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2000]], [[2003 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2003]], and [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2006]]). It hosted the West Regional Final twice ([[1971 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1971]], [[1981 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1981]]) and one [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]] ([[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]]). Due to the frequency of hosting first and second round games, the Huntsman Center is third all-time in NCAA Tournament games hosted, with 81.

Since [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2010]], NCAA tournament games in the city have been played at Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the NBA's Utah Jazz.  Other venues for past NCAA games in the state include the [[Marriott Center]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] and the [[Dee Events Center]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. 

===1979 Final Four===
The arena hosted the [[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]] [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]], featuring the start  of the rivalry between all-time greats [[Magic Johnson]] and {{nowrap|[[Larry Bird]].&lt;ref name=tcgedthb&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1979/04/02/823505/they-caged-the-bird-while-earvin-johnson-directed-a-balanced-offense-and-the-defense-deterred-larry-bird-michigan-state-won-the-ncaas |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Keith |first=Ron |title=They caged the Bird |date=April 2, 1979 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Magic's [[1978–79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] team defeated Bird's previously unbeaten [[1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|Indiana State]] in the {{nowrap|[[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game|final]],&lt;ref name=fffrpg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QoxLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IoADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6160%2C3179305 |newspaper=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |last= |first= |title='Magic act' gives MSU NCAA title |date=March 27, 1979 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kpsprom&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QoxLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IoADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6652%2C3241335|newspaper=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah)|title=Magic keeps a promise and MSU reaches NCAA title goal |last=Ewer |first=Bill |date=March 27, 1979 |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grbwt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-j1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ke4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6827%2C6297764 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Michigan State grounds Bird - wins title |date=March 27, 1979 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which remains the most-watched [[college basketball]] game in history. Many observers consider the Magic-Bird rivalry established here and carried into the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] when both entered the league that fall to be a major factor in the league's 1980s renaissance.

'''''Kill the Umpire''''' is a 1950 [[baseball]] comedy film starring [[William Bendix]] and [[Una Merkel]], directed by [[Lloyd Bacon]] and written by [[Frank Tashlin]].

Bendix two years earlier had portrayed baseball player [[Babe Ruth]] in the biographical film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]''. One of the ballplayers in this picture is played by [[Jeff Richards (baseball player/actor)|Jeff Richards]], billed as Richard Taylor, a minor-league ballplayer before becoming an actor.

==Plot==
Bill Johnson is a former baseball player whose fanatical devotion to the game has cost him several jobs. He remains steadfast in one thing: he hates [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]]s.  Matters are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law Evans ([[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]) is a retired umpire.

During a period of [[unemployment]], needing a job to support his loyal wife Betty ([[Una Merkel]]) and two daughters, Johnson is forced by his father-in-law to matriculate in an umpire school.  Johnson initially tries to get himself expelled by school director Jimmy O'Brien ([[William Frawley]]), but eventually comes to enjoy his new job. He becomes an ump in the minor leagues, where blurred vision, caused by using the wrong eyedrops, causes him to see everything twice, earning him a nickname as "Two-Call" Johnson.

When he calls a visiting team’s player safe at home plate, the crowd accuses him of dishonesty, not aware that the catcher actually dropped the ball when the runner slid into home plate, leading to a near-riot during which the home team’s catcher is knocked out cold.  Johnson must disguise himself as a woman, and engage in several madcap subterfuges, to get to an important game on time, but his reputation is restored when the injured catcher recovers and praises him for his honesty as an umpire.  The crowd accepts this, although quickly reversing its opinion again after Johnson, inevitably, makes another call they do not like.

The film's climax is a manic chase scene, scripted by animator and future [[Jerry Lewis]] director [[Frank Tashlin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">'''List A cricket''' is a classification of the [[Limited overs cricket|limited-overs]] (one-day) form of the sport of [[cricket]]. List A cricket includes [[One Day International]] (ODI) matches and various domestic competitions in which the number of overs in an [[innings]] per team ranges from forty to sixty, as well as some international matches involving nations who have not achieved official ODI status. Together with [[First-class cricket|first-class]] and [[Twenty20]] cricket, List A is one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).

{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}
==Status==
Most [[Test cricket|Test cricketing]] nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The scheduled number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side.

The categorisation of cricket matches as "List A" was not officially endorsed by the [[International Cricket Council]] until 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/255055.html |title=ICC clarifies what counts and what doesn't |date=30 July 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the ICC announced that it and its member associations would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first-class matches. The [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The list was the work of Philip Bailey and the name is derived simply from there being a list A and a list B.

=== Matches that qualify as List A===
* One Day Internationals (ODIs)
* Other international matches
* Premier one-day tournaments in each country
* Official matches of a touring Test team against main first-class teams
* Matches played in [[World Cricket League|ICC World Cricket League]] Division 2 and above

=== Matches that do not qualify as List A===
* [[Twenty20 cricket]] including internationals&lt;ref&gt;CricketArchive treats List A and Twenty20 separately.  When searching on a player, they are separate categories, while a search for List A matches excludes Twenty20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* World Cup warm-up matches
* Other Tourist matches (for example, against first-class teams that are not part of the main domestic first-class competition, such as universities)
* Festival and friendly matches
* Matches played between international sides at lower levels of the World Cricket League

==First List A match==
The first match retrospectively designated as a 'List A' game was played between [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] in May 1963, in the preliminary round of the [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25997.html Lancashire v Leicestershire 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Each side batted for 65 overs, and bowlers were restricted to 15 overs each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/630566.html|title=Opening Pandora's one-day box|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Parkstadion''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], that is no longer used to host any major events. The stadium was built in 1973 and hosted five matches of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Parkstadion"&gt;[http://www.schalke04.de/verein/stadion/parkstadion.html Parkstadion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207151629/http://www.schalke04.de/verein/stadion/parkstadion.html |date=2009-12-07 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a capacity of 62,109 with seats for 45,067.

During the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] set the record for the biggest win ever at a [[FIFA World Cup]] with a 9–0 (6–0) hammering of [[DR Congo national football team|Zaire]].

[[Michael Jackson]] performed at the stadium during his [[Bad World Tour]] on September 4, 1988 and during his [[HIStory World Tour]] on June 15, 1997. He also scheduled to perform at the stadium on September 6, 1992 on his [[Dangerous World Tour]], but was cancelled due to ill health.

[[The Rolling Stones]] performed at the stadium during their [[Urban Jungle Tour]] on August 16, 1990 and during their [[Bridges To Babylon Tour]] on July 27, 1998.

[[Pink Floyd]] performed at the stadium during [[The Division Bell Tour]] on August 23, 1994.

It was the home ground of [[Association football|football]] club [[FC Schalke 04]] until May 2001, before the newly built and adjacent [[Veltins-Arena]] opened in July of the same year.

The stadium also played host to two [[1988 UEFA European Championship|Euro 88]] fixtures ([[Germany national football team|Germany]] v [[Denmark]], and [[Netherlands national football team|The Netherlands]] v the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]), as well as the first leg of the 1997 [[UEFA Cup]] final between Schalke and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadiumguide.com/parkstadion/ Parkstadion]. The Stadium Guide. Accessed March 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last competitive football match played in the stadium was a [[Bundesliga]] fixture between Schalke and [[SpVgg Unterhaching]] on May 19, 2001. The match was attended by approximately 65,000 people. At the end of the match, after a difficult win against [[SpVgg Unterhaching]] (5–3), and thanks to a last minute goal scored by [[Hamburg SV]] against [[Bayern Munich]] (1–0), the crowd celebrated Schalke 04's first Bundesliga title. But [[Patrik Andersson]] equalized in the additional time for Bayern (90+4), who retained the title and instantly killed the joy of the fans celebrating in Parkstadion.

The stadium is now partly demolished and the [[Jumbotron]] that was placed atop of the northern stand was donated to [[Erzgebirgsstadion]] in [[Aue]], where it was installed during the renovations of the stadium in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The '''Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium''' ({{Lang-ko|평창 올림픽 스타디움}}) was a temporary venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] and [[2018 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County]], [[Gangwon Province, South Korea|Gangwon Province]], [[South Korea]]. The stadium was demolished after the Games.

==Background==
It was located in [[Daegwallyeong-myeon]], in the precinct of the Pyeongchang Olympic Plaza, about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Alpensia Resort]].

To limit its costs, the stadium had no roof or a central heating system. It cost [[South Korean won|₩]]116 billion ([[United States dollar|$]]109 million).&lt;ref name="archd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Badalge|first1=Keshia|title=The 2018 Winter Olympics Stadium That Cost $100 Million to Build, Will Only Be Used 4 Times, and Is Roofless|url=https://www.archdaily.com/888383/the-2018-winter-olympics-stadium-that-cost-100-dollars-million-to-build-will-only-be-used-4-times-and-is-roofless|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Arch Daily|date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 35,000-seat stadium had seven floors above ground, a single floor underground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PyeongChang Olympic Stadium|url=https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/venues/pyeongchang-olympic-stadium|website=The PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Parlaympic Winter Games|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pentagonal design.&lt;ref name=designweek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawood|first1=Sarah|title=How the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics was designed|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/5-11-february-2018/pyeongchang-winter-olympics-2018-designed/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Design Week|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a floor area of {{convert|58790|sqm|sp=us}} and its circular stage had a diameter of {{convert|72|m|adj=on|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=koreanet&gt;{{cite news|last1=JiAe|first1=Sohn|title=PyeongChang stadium ready for Games|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Sports/view?articleId=149884|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Korea.net|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built on an {{convert|80,000|sqm|sp=us}} site in Hoenggye, it was the final major structure built for these Games. The approximate [[elevation]] was {{convert|740|m|round=5|sp=us}} above [[sea level]].

Adjacent to the stadium was an Olympic exhibition hall, traditional food markets, and other attractions, which would remain as heritage facilities, and the medal plaza which hosted medal ceremonies.

==History==
In the candidacy file of Pyeongchang 2018, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies were foreseen to take place in [[Alpensia Ski Jumping Stadium]]. This was a plan similar to the one of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. However, in July 2012, the [[PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games|POCOG]] announced some changes in the venue plan and the ceremonies were moved to Hoenggye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2018/17597-pyeongchang-2018-move-venues-for-opening-and-closing-ceremonies Pyeongchang 2018 move venue for Opening and Closing Ceremonies] - ''Inside the Games'' - 6 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasons were organisational, with possible interference between the preparation of the ceremonies and the ski jumping training, and the weather conditions for the spectators.

The construction of the stadium which took one year and ten months was completed on 30 September 2017.&lt;ref name=koreanet/&gt;

The Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium had been used 5 times before being demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/06/heres-what-pyeongchang-looks-like-now/561959/|title=Here’s What Pyeongchang Looks Like Now|last=Weber|first=Sam|date=5 June 2018|work=CityLab|access-date=15 June 2018|quote=Like the snow, other signs of the Olympic effort, such as Pyeongchang’s disposable Olympic stadium, have simply vanished in the spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a [[Korean pop music|K-pop]] concert venue of the 2017 Dream Concert in PyeongChang &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=081&amp;aid=0002857294|title=평창 드림콘서트, 엑소+워너원 출연 ‘화려한 라인업 공개’|access-date=2018-07-15|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;, marking the 100 Days before the Olympics, the [[2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], plus the [[2018 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2018 Winter Paralympics closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies of the [[2018 Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref name="archd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwitz|first1=Josh|title=South Korea’s $100 million Winter Olympics stadium will be used exactly four times|url=https://qz.com/1188832/south-koreas-100-million-winter-olympics-stadium-will-be-used-exactly-four-times/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Quartz|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rogers Centre''', originally named '''SkyDome''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, situated just southwest of the [[CN Tower]] near the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. Opened in 1989 on the former [[Railway Lands]], it is home to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Previously, the stadium was home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the [[Bills Toronto Series]] from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large events such as [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[trade fair]]s, [[concert]]s, [[traveling carnival|travelling carnivals]], and [[monster truck]] shows.

The stadium was renamed "Rogers Centre" following the purchase of the stadium by [[Rogers Communications]], which also owned the Toronto Blue Jays, in 2005.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers Purchases SkyDome"&gt;{{cite web |title = Goodbye SkyDome, hello Rogers Centre|url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/goodbye-skydome-hello-rogers-centre-1.549230|website = CBC Sports|date = February 2, 2005|accessdate = May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a [[retractable roof|fully retractable motorized roof]], as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it, with 70 rooms overlooking the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums#articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums/page/21|title=Power Ranking All 30 MLB Stadiums|author=John  Ewen|website=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both [[Canadian football|football]] and [[baseball]]. The stadium served as the site of both the [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2015 Pan American Games closing ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers Centre Among Venues Proposed for 2015 Pan Am Games|url=http://www.bizbash.com/toronto/content/editorial/14569_rogers_centre_ontario_place_among_venues_proposed_for_2015_pan_am_games.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731003215/http://www.bizbash.com/toronto/content/editorial/14569_rogers_centre_ontario_place_among_venues_proposed_for_2015_pan_am_games.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 31, 2012|website=Biz Bash Toronto|date=November 7, 2009|accessdate=November 7, 2009|quote=Rogers Centre, Ontario Place Among Venues Proposed for 2015 Pan Am Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the ceremonies, the site was referred to as the "'''Pan Am Dome'''" (officially as the "Pan Am Ceremonies Venue") instead of its official name; Rogers Communications did not have sponsorship rights to the games.

== History ==
SkyDome, called Rogers Centre since 2005, was designed by architect [[Rod Robbie]] and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed by the [[EllisDon]] Construction company of [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium's construction lasted about two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt; (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) which was paid for by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], [[Ontario]] [[Government of Ontario|provincial government]], the City of Toronto, and a large [[consortium]] of corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Romell, Rick. "Tax money for stadium site backed". Milwaukee Sentinel May 16, 1989: 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
The main impetus for building an enclosed sports venue in Toronto came following the [[70th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] game in November 1982, held at the outdoor [[Exhibition Stadium]]. The game (in which the hometown [[Toronto Argonauts]] were making their first Grey Cup appearance since [[59th Grey Cup|1971]]) was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, leading the media to call it "the Rain Bowl". As many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was [[Bill Davis]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], and the poor conditions were seen by the largest TV audience ever in Canada (over 7,862,000 viewers) to that point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=33 Canadian Football League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016233646/http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=33 |date=October 16, 2015 }}, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, at a rally for the Argos at [[Toronto City Hall]], tens of thousands of people who attended the game began to chant, "We want a [[dome]]! We want a dome!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=K1JsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT785&amp;lpg=PT785&amp;dq=toronto+rally+1982+we+want+a+dome#v=onepage&amp;q=toronto%20rally%201982%20we%20want%20a%20dome&amp;f=false | title=Paikin on Ontario's Premiers 2-Book Bundle: Bill Davis / Paikin and the Premiers| isbn=9781459738331| last1=Paikin| first1=Steve| date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months later, in June 1983, Premier Davis formally announced a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at [[Exhibition Place]]. The committee consisted of [[Paul Godfrey]], [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]] and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David (October 7, 1984). Battle Is On for Right to Build Our Domed Stadium. [[Toronto Star]]. pg A1, A13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee examined various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to [[BC Place]] in Vancouver. In 1985, an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, [[Downsview Airport]], and [[York University]]. The final site was at the base of the [[CN Tower]] not far from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], a major railway and transit hub. The [[Railway Lands]] were a major [[Canadian National Railway]] rail switching yard encompassing the [[CNR Spadina Roundhouse]] (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.

=== Naming ===
The name "SkyDome" was chosen as part of a province-wide "name the stadium" contest in 1987. Sponsored by the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', ballots were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: "Towerdome", "Harbourdome", "SkyDome", and simply "the Dome". The judges' final selection was SkyDome. Premier [[David Peterson]] drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that proposed "SkyDome". At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the crown corporation created to run SkyDome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309210650/https://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |archivedate=March 9, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; commented: "The sky is a huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite and that's what this is all about."

=== Financing ===
The stadium was funded by a public/private partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the tab. The initial cost of $150&amp;nbsp;million was greatly underestimated,&lt;ref name=deMause&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demause.net/skydome.html|title=DOME TO NOWHERE|author=[[Neil deMause]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the final tab coming in at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt; Two levels of government ([[Metropolitan Toronto|Metro Toronto]] and Provincial) each initially contributed $30&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|30000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt;&lt;ref name=deMause /&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/ballpark/reference/index.jsp?content=history|title=ROGERS CENTRE HISTORY|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[Toronto Blue Jays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include the actual value of the land the stadium sits on (as it was part of a deal with the Crown agency&amp;nbsp;– CN Rail). Canada's three main breweries ([[Labatt Brewing Company|Labatt's]], [[Molson]], and [[Carling O'Keefe]]) and the Toronto Blue Jays each paid $5&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|5000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) to help fund the stadium.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected by invitation only) also contributed $5&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=history /&gt; for which they received one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an opportunity for renewal) and a 99-year exclusive option on stadium advertising. Skyboxes initially leased for $150,000 up to $225,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|150000|1989}}}} to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|225000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) a year in 1989&amp;nbsp;– plus the cost of tickets for all events.

The then unusual financing structure created controversy. First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, companies that paid the $5&amp;nbsp;million fee, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]], received 100% stadium exclusivity,&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt; including advertising rights, for the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99&amp;nbsp;years. Third, the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning there was some doubt the contracts were made at a market rate: Pepsi stated at the time that had they known the terms of the contract they would have paid far more than $5&amp;nbsp;million for the rights. Local media like [[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']] called the amount charged to the companies "scandalously low".&lt;ref&gt;[[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']], December 3–9, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===

[[File:Suspension bridge over railway tracks SkyDomeRogersCentre.JPG|thumb|right|A [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built over the [[Union Station Rail Corridor]] next to the stadium.]]

Construction was done by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the John Street pumping station across the street to its new home south of the stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility (in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on its new location had yet to be completed.

Because the stadium was the first of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move the roof. It was important the design would work and be reliable as to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. The 31-storey high roof consists of four panels; one (on the North end) is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven 'train' engines, that run on high strength railway rails. The roof, which takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane.

Because of its location south of major railway corridor, new pedestrian connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason for the high cost of the stadium. The [[SkyWalk]] is an approximately 500-metre enclosed walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects to Union Station (and is part of the [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] network). The John Street [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built to provide north–south passage over the rail tracks, linking Front Street with the stadium.

The stadium was completed two months late, having been planned to open for the first regular season Toronto Blue Jays game in 1989; the team played the first two months of their home schedule at Exhibition Stadium that year.

=== Opening ===
[[File:The audience.JPG|thumb|right|''The Audience'' by [[Michael Snow]] on the northwest corner façade]]

The stadium officially opened on June 3, 1989, and hosted an official grand opening show: "The Opening of SkyDome: A Celebration", broadcast on CBC television the following evening hosted by [[Brian Williams (sportscaster)|Brian Williams]]. With a crowd of over 50,000 in attendance, the event included appearances by [[Alan Thicke]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Andrea Martin]] of [[Second City Television|''SCTV'']], impersonator [[André-Philippe Gagnon]] and rock band [[Glass Tiger]]. The roof was ceremonially "opened" by Ontario Premier [[David Peterson]] with a laser pen. The roof's opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants of "close the roof", Magwood insisted the roof remain fully open.

=== Financial problems and fallout ===
[[File:SkyDomeLogo.png|thumb|right|SkyDome logo (1989–2005)]]

The stadium became a thorn in the side of [[David Peterson]]'s [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberal]] government for repeated cost overruns. After the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]] were defeated by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] in the [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990 Ontario election]], a review by the new [[Bob Rae]] government in October 1990 revealed Stadco's debt meant the Dome would have to be booked 600&amp;nbsp;days a year to turn a profit, almost twice as many days as there are days in a calendar year. The stadium income was only $17&amp;nbsp;million in its first year of operations, while debt service was $40&amp;nbsp;million. It was determined the abrupt late inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112&amp;nbsp;million to the cost of the building.

As the province slipped into a recession, Rae appointed [[University of Toronto]] professor [[Bruce Kidd]] and [[Canadian Auto Workers]] President [[Bob White (trade unionist)|Bob White]] to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium's growing debt, but the original $165&amp;nbsp;million debt had ballooned to $400&amp;nbsp;million by 1993.&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt;&lt;ref name=deMause /&gt; Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government treasury and sold the stadium for $151&amp;nbsp;million to a private consortium that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays' owner.&lt;ref name=deMause /&gt;&lt;ref name=rogersbuy /&gt;

In November 1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49% of total, filed for bankruptcy protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/skydome-seeks-bankruptcy-protection-1.161002|title=SkyDome seeks bankruptcy protection|date=November 26, 1998|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers. Most of the 161 Skybox tenants had signed on for 10-year leases; a marked decrease in interest in the stadium's teams and the construction of the Air Canada Centre, which hosted the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Toronto Raptors]], resulted in few renewals for Skybox leases. That same month, the Blue Jays re-signed for an additional ten years in the facility.&lt;ref name=deMause /&gt;

In April 1999, Sportsco International LP bought the stadium out of bankruptcy protection for $80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=rogersbuy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=106352|title=Rogers buys SkyDome for $25 million|date=November 29, 2004|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purchase and renaming ===
&lt;!-- Do not replace with commons equivalent, since it is in fact the Detroit waterfront --&gt;
[[File:Rogers Centre. View from Bremner Blvd.jpg|thumb|right|View from Bremner Boulevard]]
In November 2004, [[Rogers Communications]], parent company of the Blue Jays, acquired SkyDome, excluding the attached SkyDome hotel, which had been sold to Renaissance for a reported $31 million in 1999, from Sportsco for about $25&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;– roughly 4% of the cost of construction.&lt;ref name=rogersbuy /&gt;

On February 2, 2005, [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], President and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Rogers Communications, announced a three-year corporate contract to change the name of SkyDome to Rogers Centre. The name change remains controversial and is unpopular with many fans, most of whom continue to refer to it as SkyDome [[Criticism of advertising|in opposition to increased commercialism]] from the purchase of naming rights. One example is a 25,000 name petition started by [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC]] bus driver Randy Rajmoolie.&lt;ref name=petition&gt;{{cite news |title=12,000 people sign petition demanding Jays’ stadium has name restored to ‘SkyDome’|url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/12-000-people-sign-petition-demanding-jays-stadium-has-name-restored-to-skydome-1.2851527|work=[[CTV News]]|date=April 8, 2016|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Please don't mention plans to rename the Rogers Centre, as it isn't verified by reliable sources--&gt;

After the purchase Rogers refurbished the stadium by, among other things, replacing the [[Jumbotron]] with a [[Daktronics]] video display, and erecting other new monitors, including several built into the outfield wall.

In May 2005, the [[Toronto Argonauts]] agreed to three five-year leases at Rogers Centre, which could have seen the Argonauts play out of Rogers Centre up to and including 2019. The team had the option to leave at the end of each of the three lease agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toronto Argonauts May Soon Be Homeless|first=Daniel|last=Girard|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/1128259--toronto-argonauts-may-soon-be-homeless|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purposed plans to permanently lock Rogers Centre into its baseball configuration in order to install a natural grass surface forced the Argonauts to relocate to [[BMO Field]] before the 2016 season.&lt;ref name="Toronto Argonauts"&gt;{{cite news|date=May 20, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015|title=Bell Canada and Kilmer Group to acquire Argonauts|url=http://argonauts.ca/article/bell-canada-and-kilmer-group-to-acquire-argonauts|publisher=Toronto Argonauts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522130512/http://argonauts.ca/article/bell-canada-and-kilmer-group-to-acquire-argonauts|archivedate=May 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-bellargos&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonauts announce sale, move to BMO Field|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/argonauts-announce-sale-move-to-bmo-field-1.3080235|website=CBC News|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell, Larry Tanenbaum to purchase Argonauts|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/2015/05/19/bell-larry-tanenbaum-to-purchase-argonauts.html|accessdate=May 20, 2015|work=Toronto Star|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now unclear whether the planned surface replacement and configuration change will take place, if at all, despite the Argonauts' departure.

In November 2005, Rogers Centre received a complete makeover to "open" the 100 Level concourse to the playing field and convert 43 luxury boxes to "party suites". This required some seats to be removed, which lowered overall capacity.&lt;ref name="Blue Jays continue renovations to Rogers Centre; Changes create a more fan-friendly environment"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Blue Jays Continue Renovations to Rogers Centre; Changes Create a More Fan-Friendly Environment|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060403&amp;content_id=1381328&amp;vkey=pr_tor&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=April 3, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224044119/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060403&amp;content_id=1381328&amp;vkey=pr_tor&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor|archivedate=February 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Rogers Centre became one of the first buildings of its size to adopt a completely smoke-free policy in Canada, anticipating an act of provincial legislature that required all Ontario public places to go smoke-free by June 1, 2006.

Alcohol was not available to patrons of Rogers Centre on April 7, 2009, as the [[Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario]] imposed the first of a three-day alcohol suspension at the stadium for "infractions (that) took place at certain past events", according to the press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Rogers Centre Announces Dates for Alcohol Service Suspension|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2009/03/c7531.html|publisher=Newswire.ca|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improvements ===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
Significant improvements to the facility since opening in 1989 include:
* Exterior roof lighting, which can be programmed for themes and/or events.
* The Blue Jays clubhouse was substantially renovated, including a larger training room, an open concept lounge and personal lockers. In total, the clubhouse expanded from {{convert|12000|to|24000|ft2|m2}}.
* Main level concourse expansion, making the space brighter, more fan-friendly with expanded wheelchair seating.
* The FieldTurf was upgraded to AstroTurf Gameday Grass for 2010.
* The main video board was upgraded in 2005, from a JumboTron to a modern Daktronics video board, measuring {{convert|33|by|110|ft}}.
* Jays Shop – Stadium Edition, was expanded to an {{convert|8000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} retail space along the main concourse (2007).
* Two video boards were built into the outfield fence that each measure {{convert|10|by|65|ft|0}}. These boards provide player stats, out-of-town scores and other information related to the game and league.
* A continuous, ribbon-style video board was installed on the facing of the 300 Level, providing statistics and scores.
* Installation of 150 new {{convert|42|in|m|2|adj=on}} flat-screen video monitors in the main and second level concourses, bringing the number of stadium monitors to around 300.
* Upgrade of the entire field lighting system in a two-month conversion process with all 840 of the 2,000-watt bowl lights replaced.
* A centre-field porch (later named the West Jet Flight Deck) in the 200 level was added following the removal of the windows of the former Windows Restaurant (2013, $2 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/03/30/windows-restaurant-at-rogers-centre-gets-2m-renovation/|title=Windows Restaurant at Rogers Centre gets $2M renovation|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=decade&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/buzz/articles/438322-250-million-renovations-coming-to-rogers-centre|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140107053122/http://www.thescore.com/buzz/articles/438322-250-million-renovations-coming-to-rogers-centre|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 7, 2014|title=$250-Million Renovations Coming To Rogers Centre|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* As of 2017, a major renovation of the stadium is being planned, which is budgeted to cost $250–400 million.

== Stadium features ==
[[File:Windows Restaurant in SkyDomeRogersCentre.JPG|thumb|right|Several restaurants have views of events. The former Windows restaurant looked onto the playing field.]]
The venue was the first major team sports stadium in North America with a functional, fully [[retractable roof]] (Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] also had a retractable roof, but due to operational issues, it was replaced with a permanent roof). The roof is composed of four panels and covers an area of {{convert|345000|sqft|m2}}. The two middle panels slide laterally to stack over the north semi-circular panel, and then the south semi-circular panel rotates around the stadium and nests inside the stack. It takes 20&amp;nbsp;minutes for the roof to open or close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers Centre – Facts|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/about/facts.jsp|website=Rogerscentre.com|publisher=Rogers Stadium Limited Partnership|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not possible to move the roof in cold weather because the mechanism that closes the roof could fail in cooler weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers Centre roof shut for deciding Jays playoff game despite Open the Dome campaign|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bluejays-roof-closed-rogers-centre-1.3270004|website=CBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923143220/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bluejays-roof-closed-rogers-centre-1.3270004 |archivedate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[AstroTurf]] installation was replaced with [[FieldTurf]] from 2005 to 2010. The FieldTurf took about 40 hours to remove for events such as concerts or trade shows, as it used 1,400 trays that needed to be stacked and transported off the field. Prior to the [[2010 Toronto Blue Jays season|2010 baseball season]], to reduce the amount of time required to convert the playing field, a new, roll-based version of AstroTurf was installed. Similar to FieldTurf, the installation uses a sand and rubber-based infill within the synthetic fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blue Jays Hoping to Gain Some Level Footing |first=John |last=Lott |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2515955 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100207014305/http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2515955 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 7, 2010 |newspaper=[[National Post]] |location=Toronto |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rogers Centre is one of two remaining venues in [[Major League Baseball]] using artificial turf (the other one is [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], home of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]), and was the last venue to use "sliding pits" before switching to a full dirt infield for the [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016 baseball season]]. Before the Argonauts moved out, the pitcher's mound could be lowered or raised hydraulically when converting from baseball to football (or vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/2016/02/11/blue-jays-begin-work-on-all-dirt-infield-at-rogers-centre.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of natural grass was long thought unfeasible since the stadium was designed as a closed structure with a roof that opens, and as such, the interior was not intended or built to deal with weather, including low temperatures and drainage. As of the 2016 season, they are one of two teams to have never played a home game on grass at their main stadium (the Tampa Bay Rays played some home games in 2007 and 2008 at [[Champion Stadium]] in [[Walt Disney World]]).&lt;ref name="ESPN-2007-05-16"&gt;{{cite web

However, the Blue Jays have long explored the possibility of converting the Rogers Centre to a natural grass surface, and plans are in place to install a grass field by 2018 to allow enough time for research and growing of the sod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/2014/04/24/blue_jays_pave_way_for_grass_at_the_rogers_centre.html|title=Blue Jays pave way for grass at the Rogers Centre|date=April 24, 2014|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Brendan|last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installing grass would require digging up the floor, adding a drainage system, and installing {{convert|30|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} of dirt.

Over $5&amp;nbsp;million of artwork was commissioned in 1989 (${{#expr:({{inflation|CA|50|1989}}/10)}} million in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars):
*''The Audience''&amp;nbsp;– by [[Michael Snow]] is a collection of larger than life depictions of fans above the northeast and northwest entrances. Painted gold, the sculptures show fans in various acts of celebration.
*''A Tribute to Baseball''&amp;nbsp;– by Lutz Haufschild, above the Southeast and Southwest entrances of Gate 5.
*''The Art of the Possible''&amp;nbsp;– by Mimi Gellman, inside along the north side of the concourse on Level 100. The glass and steel sculpture incorporates the signatures of 2,000 builders of SkyDome, and is a tribute to their work. Some of the artifacts found during excavation such as musket balls and pottery have also been included. The brightly illuminated sculpture became an issue to baseball players when the stadium first opened. The bright lights were considered a distraction to batters.
*''Salmon Run''&amp;nbsp;– by Susan Schelle, outside by the South East entrance in [[Bobbie Rosenfeld Park]]; it is a large fountain with various stainless steel salmon cutouts.

=== Rogers Centre video board ===
[[File:Rogers Centre video board.JPG|thumb|right|Rogers Centre video board.]]
The Rogers Centre video board is {{convert|33|ft|m}} high and {{convert|110|ft|m}} across. The panel is made up of modular [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] units that can be replaced unit by unit, and can be repaired immediately should it be damaged during an event. Originally, this screen was a Sony [[Jumbotron|JumboTron]], which was, at the time the stadium opened, the largest in North America,&lt;ref&gt;http://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/june-5-1989-blue-jays-play-first-game-skydome&lt;/ref&gt; but since has been replaced. There are also two ribbon boards made up of LED that run along the East and West sides of the stadium interior. They are each {{convert|434|ft|m}} long by {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} high. In addition, there are two video boards that make up parts of the left and right outfield walls while in baseball configuration. These are {{convert|65|ft|m}} wide by nearly {{convert|10|ft|m}} high.

The video board and the stadium played host to several [[Series television|serial television]] events, including the series finales for ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', along with live coverage of the funeral of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]].

== Stadium usage ==

=== Baseball ===

The [[1992 World Series]] and [[1993 World Series]] were played at the SkyDome. The stadium also hosted the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. The [[1991 American League Championship Series]] was the first Major League Baseball playoff series played entirely indoors, with the first two games at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] and the final three at the SkyDome.

Games in the first round of the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] were played at the Rogers Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rogers Centre to host WBC games in '09|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2008/07/31/wbc_toronto_groupgames|website=[[Sportsnet]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basketball ===
Besides baseball, Rogers Centre was the original home of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Toronto Raptors]], who played at the venue from November 1995 to February 1999, while the [[Scotiabank Arena|Air Canada Centre]] was being planned and built. It proved to be somewhat problematic as a basketball venue, even considering it was only a temporary facility. For instance, many seats that were theoretically in line with the court were so far away fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. However, the Raptors sometimes opened the upper level when popular opponents came to town, such as the [[Chicago Bulls]] when [[Michael Jordan]] was a member of the team, expanding capacity to 29,000.

=== Football ===
[[File:Toronto Argonauts vs. Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Rogers Centre, October 27 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Argonauts]] vs. [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], October 27, 2005]]

Rogers Centre hosted Canadian football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to [[BMO Field]] in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the [[95th Grey Cup]], its first since 1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of Toronto since the championship's inception in 1909.

From 1989 to 2003, SkyDome hosted the [[Vanier Cup]] championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now [[U Sports]]) football.

In 1994, then-part owner of SkyDome Labatt considered purchasing a [[National Football League]] and a [[Major League Soccer]] team to play at the stadium.&lt;ref name=dreamjob&gt;{{cite book|title=Dream Job|last=Peddie|first=Richard|year=2013|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Rogers Centre played host to the first ever [[International Bowl]], an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football]] game between the Western Michigan University Broncos and the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. In 2008, Rutgers played Ball State in the second International Bowl. The [[Buffalo Bulls football|University at Buffalo Bulls]] and the [[Connecticut Huskies|University of Connecticut Huskies]] played in the third International Bowl on January 3, 2009.

Rogers Centre was also the venue for the [[43rd Vanier Cup]] on Friday November 23, just two days before Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (2004 and 2005) and [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship's inception in 1965.

The [[National Football League]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]] announced its intentions to play five "home" games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 2007, so beginning the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; the first of these regular-season games took place on December 7 of the [[2008 NFL season]] versus the [[Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bills Have Deal in Place for Toronto Games|first1=Mark|last1=Gaughan|first2=Jerry|last2=Sullivan|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/258/story/264441.html|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first time an NFL team has established a "home" stadium outside the United States. The Bills played a preseason game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at Rogers Centre on August 14, 2008; the Toronto Series was played every year through the 2013 season.

=== Soccer ===

From the mid-2000s, soccer matches have been regularly held in SkyDome/Rogers Centre; they had been rarely played at the venue when its [[AstroTurf]] surface had been in place.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web |title=Italy vs. Serbia (highlights)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__w4EbADCFs|author=YouTube|accessdate=June 30, 2015|date=June 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2005 an international soccer friendly between [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] took place, ending in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref name="YouTube" /&gt;

On May 25, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between Italy's [[ACF Fiorentina]] and [[Juventus F.C.]] with Fiorentina winning 1–0.&lt;ref name="cbc-may-2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Molinaro|first=John F.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fiorentina-blanks-juventus-in-toronto-friendly-1.956664|title=Fiorentina blanks Juventus in Toronto friendly|agency=[[CBC.ca]]|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between England's [[Manchester United F.C.]] and Scotland's [[Celtic F.C.]] Manchester United F.C. defeated Celtic F.C. with a score of 3–1. The match was played on a temporary grass surface harvested from [[Burford, Ontario]] and transported via 18 tractor-trailers.&lt;ref name="cbc-jul-2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/man-u-downs-celtic-in-rogers-centre-friendly-1.867762|title=Man U downs Celtic in Rogers Centre friendly|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=16 July 2010|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2012, the stadium hosted the friendly between [[Toronto FC]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]], a match that finished in a 1–1 draw.

Rogers Centre is the site of several major [[High school (North America)|high school]] and [[College athletics|collegiate]] sporting competitions, such as the [[Prentice Cup]] for baseball. Since 2008, the Rogers Centre is the host of the Greater Toronto high schools' [[Metro Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Metro Bowl to Have a U.S. Flavour|first=David|last=Grossman|url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/532394|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 7, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerts ===
&lt;!--Please do not add an indiscriminate list of concerts without reliable references. Wikipedia is not a directory of all concerts.--&gt;
The stadium has several concert configurations, including smaller ''Theatre'' (capacity 5,000 to 7,000) and ''Concert Hall'' (formerly ''SkyTent''; capacity 10,000 to 25,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theatre Concert|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/corporate/venue_theatre.jsp|publisher=Rogers Centre|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the stadium's design and building materials, the acoustics are poor, and the loudness/quality can vary greatly around the stadium. Its popularity with artists and fans has diminished over the years, and the [[Scotiabank Arena]] now hosts most major concerts The SkyTent, a group of acoustical curtain sails hoisted on rigging above the floor, helps reduce sound distortion and improve sound quality by dampening reverberations around the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rogers Centre: One Blue Jay Way, Toronto, Ontario|url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/76.php|publisher=Glass Steel and Stone|accessdate=August 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619050435/http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/76.php|archivedate=June 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after its opening, the stadium became a popular venue for large-scale rock concerts and is the largest indoor concert venue in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deadmau5 Leaves Em’ Raving|first=Ben|last=Rayner|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2011/11/06/deadmau5_leaves_em_raving.html|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 6, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists have included [[Bruce Springsteen]], U2 with two concerts in 2009, as well as their concert in 2011, all part of their [[U2 360° Tour|360° Tour]].&lt;ref name="ChartAttack-DomeOpen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers Centre Dome Opening For U2's Toronto Shows|first=Kate|last=Harper|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/74529/rogers-centre-dome-opening-for-u2s-toronto-shows|publisher=Chart Communications Inc.|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925053929/http://www.chartattack.com/news/74529/rogers-centre-dome-opening-for-u2s-toronto-shows|archivedate=September 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CP24-U2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dome Open for 2nd Concert in History as 60K Fans Rock Out with U2|url=http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090917/090917_u2/20090917/?hub=CP24Entertainment|work=[[Bell Media|CTVglobemedia]]|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U2-360-2ndShow"&gt;{{cite web |title=U2 360° TOUR: 2009: Toronto Thursday, September 17, 2009|url=http://www.u2.com/tour/index/date/id/4467|publisher=U2 A De-Lux Excursion|year=2009|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bon Jovi]] performed two sellout shows on July 20 and 21, 2010 at Rogers Centre as part of [[The Circle Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Events – Bon Jovi Welcomes Fans Into The Circle With 2010–2011 World Tour|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/events/article.jsp?content=20091022_135411_1508|publisher=Rogers Centre|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Rolling Stones]] played two sold out concerts at the stadium: on December 4, 1989 during the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|Steel Wheels Tour]] and on September 26, 2005 during their highest grossing tour [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang Tour]].

One of the more notable concerts, as shown in the documentary ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]'', was [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Rogers Centre and Blue Jays Celebrate Anniversary|url=http://www.newswire.ca/fr/story/431459/rogers-centre-and-blue-jays-celebrate-anniversary|publisher=Newswire.ca|date=June 5, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509005608/http://www.newswire.ca/fr/story/431459/rogers-centre-and-blue-jays-celebrate-anniversary|archivedate=May 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The touring show had become extremely controversial, due to the risqué visuals and performances. When the concert arrived in Toronto, police were alerted the show might violate local obscenity laws. The police were on site for the concert and threatened charges without changes. The show went on as planned, however, without any legal action taken. Later, she performed two concerts at the stadium again during [[The Girlie Show World Tour]] in 1993. [[Bruce Springsteen]] performed on August 24, 2012 during his [[Wrecking Ball World Tour]] in front of 39,000 people.

=== Stadium-related ===
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Skydome seats rotate.jpg|thumb|right|The field level seating rotates on tracks to reconfigure for football and baseball.]]
*The stadium roof has a patent, preventing its design from being easily copied: U.S. Patent #4676033. The patent was officially filed on May 1, 1986 and published June 30, 1987, to dome designers, architect [[Rod Robbie]] and structural engineer Michael Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4676033.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4676033&amp;RS=PN/4676033|title=United States Patent 4,676,033|publisher=USPTO.gov|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The original mascot of the stadium was a turtle by the name of ''Domer''. Domer has not been widely used since the mid-90s, although he did make a return on June 6, 2014, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Rogers Centre.
*When the retractable roof is open, people standing on the observation deck of the nearby [[CN Tower]] can look down on the field.
*Over 50&amp;nbsp;million people have visited SkyDome/Rogers Centre.
*When the roof is open, 91% of the seats and 100% of the field is open to the sky, covering an area of {{convert|3.2|ha|acre|abbr=off}}.
*The roof weighs 11,000 tons, and is held together by 250,000 bolts.
*The stadium's inward-looking hotel rooms have regular two-way windows, yielding instances of what some could consider indecent exposure and leading to nicknames such as "SexDome" and "Exhibitionist Stadium". When SkyDome first opened, a couple engaging in sexual intercourse was televised on the scoreboard Jumbotron during a baseball game; thanks to illumination from stadium lighting despite the room's lights being off. Days later, a man was caught masturbating during a game in full view of the packed stands. The man, later tracked down by a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reporter, calmly said, "I thought they were one-way windows."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/05/18/Fans-distracted-by-sex-during-Blue-Jays-game/7438643003200/]&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons now have to sign contracts stipulating they will not perform any lewd acts within view of the stadium. The last reported such instance occurred in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2012/09/16/skydome_hotel_scandals_over_the_years.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, broadcasts will zoom into humorous instances from these hotel rooms, such as a pillow fight during the 1992 World Series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2012/09/17/birds_eye_view_of_blue_jays_from_comfort_of_instadium_hotel.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the stadium first opened, the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] was worried about the challenge of moving the large crowds. As a way to streamline the entry to the subway and to encourage public transit use to the stadium, all tickets for the first 30&amp;nbsp;days also worked as a [[Toronto Transit Commission fares|Metropass]].
*The stadium corporation has been requested to help in the planning of other venues from the U.S., Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, to Singapore, China and Germany ''(Source: Rogers Centre Press release)''.
*It was the most expensive stadium in both the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] and [[Major League Baseball]], constructed at a price of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=cbcwinlose /&gt; (C${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}). This record was passed by the [[Yankee Stadium|New Yankee Stadium]] at a cost of US$1.5&amp;nbsp;billion. If Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] (which used to be the home field of the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]], only used for CFL playoff games since the late 2000s and [[MLS Cup Playoffs|MLS playoff games]] since the mid-2010s) were counted, it would take the title, with a 1976 cost of C$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion (C${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|1600000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).
*Because of the orientation of the baseball playing field at Rogers Centre, when a player is at bat, the direction he is facing looks farther to the west than at any other Major League Baseball park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robinson | first = Craig | title = Ballpark Orientation: Direction the Batter is Facing at all MLB Parks | website = Flip Flop Fly Ball | publisher = Bloomsbury | date = | url = http://www.flipflopflyin.com/flipflopflyball/info-orientation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rogers Centre has hosted regular season games of five of the six [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] throughout the stadium's history; all but a [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) game, despite the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] being in the NHL.

'''Samoa rules''' is a game derived from [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby union]] that is occasionally played in [[Samoa]].

==Rules==
Generally the rules are taken from Australian rules, but each team consists of 15 players, like rugby union.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;http://www.travelblog.org/Oceania/Samoa/blog-84067.html retrieved 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Australian rules football, player movement is restricted to zones (similarly to [[rec footy]]).  There is a line across the centre that backs and forwards can not cross. [[Australian rules football positions#Followers|Onballers]] are allowed to go anywhere. Forwards can only operate in their attacking half, the backs in their defensive half.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Like [[Gaelic football]], players are permitted to bounce the ball only once while running, in order to encourage kicking.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;

==Pitch==
The game is played on rugby union fields, sometimes a single one, or two side by side.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; This means the pitch is rectangular, rather than oval, like an Australian football field.

==History==
The Vailima Six-Shooters' Championship began in Samoa in 1998 under these rules, becoming known as Samoa rules.  A number of Samoa rules players went on to represent Samoa in the [[Samoan national Australian rules football team]].

'''''This Old Cub''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]].  The film is centered on former [[Chicago Cubs]] third baseman [[Ron Santo]] and both his playing days and his battle against [[diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]]. The film was written, co-produced, and directed by Santo's son Jeff.  It is often mentioned during Cub game broadcasts by [[Pat Hughes (sportscaster)|Pat Hughes]], who was Santo's partner in the [[WGN (AM)|WGN Radio]] booth.  The film was a gift from Jeff to his father as a part of the "Ron Santo Day" celebration that season after Santo had both his legs amputated  and had just missed induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|MLB Hall of Fame]] a few months earlier.  A portion of all proceeds from the release of ''This Old Cub'' are donated to the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]]. The film has raised over a half-million dollars for the JDRF.  Cub [[shortstop]] [[Ernie Banks]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Bill Murray]], former [[Chicago Bears]] [[linebacker]] [[Doug Buffone]], and many others are interviewed in the film, which is narrated by actor [[Joe Mantegna]].

The documentary inspired an Arizona teacher and lifelong Cub fan named [[Bill Holden (schoolteacher)|Bill Holden]] to engage a 2100-mile walk from [[Arizona]] to [[Wrigley Field]] to raise funds for the JDRF.  Holden covered at least 12 miles each day, crossed six states, and battled his [[arthritis]] during the nearly seven-month trek.  Followed by the media, Holden arrived at Wrigley on July 1, 2005 where he threw out the first pitch and joined Santo in singing "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]".  The venture raised over $250,000 for the charity, and caused a dramatic spike in sales of the DVD.  Derek Schaul, the leader of Chicago Cubs Bleacher Bums, wears a shirt to every game stating, "I walk for the cure because Ronnie can't!  Go Cubbies!"

''This Old Cub'' was co-produced by [[Walgreens]] Drug Stores and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', both heavy sponsors of the JDRF.
