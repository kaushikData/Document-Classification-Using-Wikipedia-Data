'''Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''' (also referred to as '''adult ADHD''', '''adult with ADHD''', or simply '''ADHD in adults''', formerly '''AADD''') is the [[clinical neuroscience|neurobiological]] condition of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) in [[adult]]s.

About one-third&lt;ref name="Anas2001"/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0m4MbrnqEWEC&amp;pg=PA44 44]}} to two-thirds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hechtman|first=Lily |chapter=ADHD in Adults|date=8 February 2009|title=ADHD Comorbidities: Handbook for ADHD Complications in Children and Adults|edition=1st|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Thomas E.|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781585628339|oclc=701833161|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cJyvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of children with [[symptom]]s from early childhood continue to demonstrate notable ADHD symptoms throughout life.

Three types of ADHD are identified in the [[DSM-5]] as:
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|Predominantly Inattentive]] Type (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)
* Predominantly Hyperactive or Hyperactive-Impulsive Type (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)
* Combined Type (ADHD-C)
In later life, the hyperactive/impulsive subtype manifests less frequently.&lt;ref name="Anas2001"/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0m4MbrnqEWEC&amp;pg=PA44 44]}} The hyperactivity symptoms tend to turn more into "inner restlessness", starting in [[adolescence]] and carrying on in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;

Adult ADHD is typically marked by inattentiveness, difficulty getting work done, procrastination and organizational problems. Specifically, adults with ADHD present with persistent difficulties in following directions, remembering information, concentrating, organizing tasks, completing work within specified time frames and appearing timely in appointments. These difficulties affect several different areas of an ADHD adult's life, causing emotional, social, vocational, marital, legal, financial and/or academic problems.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isItADHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com" /&gt; As a result, low self-esteem is commonly developed. However, given the right guidance and coaching, these traits of ADHD could also lead to career success, and in some cases, unique advantages in [[critical thinking]] and [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="webmd.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/features/positives |title=Is There a Positive Side to Adult ADHD? |author =Eric Metcalf, MPH |publisher=WebMD, LLC |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of the condition follows after one or several [[psychiatric assessment|assessment]] interviews by a [[clinician]] including:
* examination of personal history
* observational evidence from family members or close friends
* academic reports, often going back to school years&lt;ref name="Faraone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASP"/&gt;
as well as evaluation to diagnose additional possible conditions which [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Associated disorders|often coexist with ADHD]], called [[comorbidities]] or comorbid disorders.

The condition is highly [[heritable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rettew|first1=David C. |last2=Hudziak|first2=James J. |chapter=Genetics of ADHD |date=2009 |title=ADHD Comorbidities: Handbook for ADHD Complications in Children and Adults |edition=1st |editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Thomas E. |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-58562-158-3 |oclc=244601824 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tqfHS0xfF–IC&amp;pg=PA32 32] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and while its exact causes are not fully known, genetic or environmental factors are understood to play a part. [[ADHD]] is a [[Mental disorders diagnosed in childhood|childhood-onset condition]], usually requiring symptoms to have been present before age 12 for a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/adhd%20fact%20sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=DSM-5 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Fact Sheet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811064504/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/ADHD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archive-date=11 August 2015 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |date=15 May 2013 |website=DSM-5 Development |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=Using [[DSM-5]], several of the individual's ADHD symptoms must be present prior to age 12 years, compared to 7 years as the age of onset in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV (1994)|DSM-IV]]. |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children under [[therapy|treatment]] will migrate to adult health services if necessary as they transit into adulthood, however diagnosis of adults involves full examination of their history.

Successful treatment of ADHD is usually based on a combination of [[medication]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], and [[ADHD coaching|coaching]] or skills training.&lt;ref name="skills"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} Medium-to-high intensity [[Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Structural growth|physical exercise]], improved sleep and improved and targeted nutrition&lt;ref name="nutrition"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} are also known to have a positive effect. Within school and work, reasonable [[special education#Accommodations|accommodations]] may be put in place to help the individual work more efficiently and productively.

==Classification==
[[File:Approximate prevalence distribution of the subtypes of adults with ADHD.PNG|thumb|Out of the 4.7% estimated adults with ADHD approximately 19% exhibit predominantly hyperactive symptoms.]]

The [[DSM-5]], or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], 2013 edition, defines three types of ADHD:
# a [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|Predominantly Inattentive]] presentation
# a Predominantly Hyperactive-[[Impulsivity|Impulsive]] presentation
# a Combined Type, that displays symptoms from both presentation

To meet the [[diagnostic criteria]] of ADHD, an individual must display:
* at least six inattentive-type symptoms for the inattentive type
* at least six hyperactive-type symptoms for the hyperactive-impulsive type
* all of the above to have the combined type

The symptoms (see below) were required to have been present since before the individual was seven years old, and must have interfered with at least two spheres of his or her [[wikt:function|functioning]] (at home and at school or work, for example) over the last six months.&lt;ref name="neucur"/&gt; The DSM-IV criteria for ADHD were, however, tailored towards the type of symptoms that children would show, and might therefore have underestimated the prevalence of ADHD in adults.&lt;ref name=Anas2001/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=April 2015}} In 2013, the newer [[DSM-5]] reviewed some of these criteria, with more lenient requirements for the diagnosis, especially in adults, and the age limit for symptoms first arising raised to twelve years.&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Signs and symptoms==
ADHD is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition, beginning in early childhood and persisting throughout a person's lifetime. It is estimated that 33–66% of children with ADHD will continue to have significant ADHD-related symptoms persisting into adulthood, resulting in a significant impact on education, employment, and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="valdizan" /&gt;

Individuals with ADHD exhibit deficiencies in [[Self control|self-regulation]] and [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|self-motivation]] which in turn foster problematic characteristics such as [[distraction|distractibility]], [[procrastination]] and disorganization. They are often perceived by others as chaotic, with a tendency to need high [[stimulation]] to be less distracted and function effectively. The learning potential and overall intelligence of an adult with ADHD, however, are no different from the potential and intelligence of adults who do not have the disorder.

Whereas teachers and caregivers responsible for children are often attuned to the symptoms of ADHD, employers and others who interact with adults are less likely to regard such behaviors as a symptom. In part, this is because symptoms do change with [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]]; adults who have ADHD are less likely to exhibit obvious [[hyperactive]] behaviors. Instead, they may report constant mental activity and inner restlessness as their hyperactivity internalizes.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010" /&gt;

Symptoms of ADHD (see table below) can vary widely between individuals and throughout the lifetime of an individual. As the [[neurobiology]] of ADHD is becoming increasingly understood, it is becoming evident that difficulties exhibited by individuals with ADHD are due to problems with the parts of the brain responsible for [[executive functions]] (see below: [[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]). These result in problems with sustaining [[attention]], [[planning]], [[organization]], [[prioritization]], [[time blindness]], [[impulse control]] and [[decision making]].

The difficulties generated by these deficiencies can range from moderate to extreme, resulting in the inability to effectively structure their lives, plan daily tasks, or think of and act accordingly even when aware of potential consequences. These lead to poor performance in school and work, followed by underachievement in these areas. In young adults, poor driving record with [[traffic violation]]s&lt;ref name="stanfordtannock2012"/&gt; as well as histories of alcoholism or substance abuse may surface. The difficulty is often due to the ADHD person's observed behaviour (e.g. the impulsive types, who may insult their boss for instance, resulting in dismissal), despite genuinely trying to avoid these and knowing that it can get them in trouble. Often, the ADHD person will miss things that an adult of similar age and experience should catch onto or know. These lapses can lead others to label the individuals with ADHD as "lazy" or "stupid" or "inconsiderate".

As problems accumulate, a negativistic self-view becomes established and a [[vicious circle]] of failure is set up. Up to 80% of adults may have [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Associated disorders|some form]] of psychiatric [[comorbidity]]&lt;ref name="Katragadda 2007"/&gt; such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com"/&gt; Many with ADHD also have associated [[learning disabilities]], such as [[dyslexia]], which contributes to their difficulties.&lt;ref name="eden"/&gt;

Studies on adults with ADHD have shown that, more than often, they experience self [[Social stigma|stigma]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] in childhood, commonly resulting from feeling neglected and different from their peers.&lt;ref name=McKeague&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKeague|first1=Lynn|last2=Hennessy|first2=Eilis|last3=O'Driscoll|first3=Claire|last4=Heary|first4=Caroline|title=Retrospective Accounts of Self-Stigma Experienced by Young People With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Depression|journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal|date=2015|volume=38|issue=2|pages=158–163|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=1cd532eb-a5f2-4ec0-91de-b59622e78f4a%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4211|accessdate=15 October 2015|doi=10.1037/prj0000121|pmid=25799297}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may play a role to the high levels of depression, substance abuse, and relationship problems that affect adults with ADHD later in life.&lt;ref name=Derrer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derrer|first1=David|title=Conditions Similar to ADHD|url=http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-conditions-similar|website=WebMD|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Over the last 30 years, research into ADHD has greatly increased.&lt;ref name="pubtrends"/&gt; There is no single, unified theory that explains the cause of ADHD. Genetic factors are presumed important, and it has been suggested that environmental factors may affect how symptoms manifest.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="antadv"/&gt;

It is becoming increasingly accepted that individuals with ADHD have difficulty with "executive functioning". In higher organisms, such as humans, these functions are thought to reside in the frontal lobes. They enable recall of tasks that need accomplishing, organization to accomplish these tasks, assessment of consequences of actions, prioritization of thoughts and actions, keeping track of time, awareness of interactions with surroundings, the ability to focus despite competing stimuli, and adaptation to changing situations.

Several lines of research based on structural and/or functional imaging techniques, stimulant drugs, psychological interventions have identified alterations in the [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] pathways of individuals with ADHD. In particular, areas of the [[prefrontal cortex]] appear to be the most affected. Dopamine and norepinephrine are [[neurotransmitters]] playing an important role in brain function. The uptake transporters for [[dopamine]]&lt;ref name="Madras"/&gt; and [[norepinephrine]]&lt;ref name="Bannon"/&gt; are overly active and clear these neurotransmitters from the synapse a lot faster than in normal individuals. This is thought to increase processing latency and [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]], and diminished [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Schweitzer-2006"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="Kim-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Missonnier-2013"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ADHD in adults requires retrospectively establishing whether the symptoms were also present in childhood, even if not previously recognized. As with other [[mental disorder]]s such as [[schizophrenia]] there is no objective "test" that diagnoses ADHD.&lt;ref name="schlancet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nihcs"/&gt; Rather, it is a combination of a careful history of symptoms up to early childhood, including corroborating evidence from family members, previous report cards, etc. The screening tests also seek to rule out other conditions or [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[substance abuse]]. Other diseases such as [[hyperthyroidism]] may exhibit symptoms similar to those of ADHD, and it is imperative to rule these out as well. [[Asperger syndrome]], a condition on the [[autism spectrum]], is sometimes mistaken for ADHD, due to impairments in [[executive functioning]] found in some people with Asperger syndrome. However, Asperger syndrome also typically involves difficulties in social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests, and problems with [[sensory processing]], including hypersensitivity. Along with this, the quality of diagnosing an adult with ADHD can often be skewed being that the majority of adults with ADHD also have other complications, ranging from anxiety and depression to substance abuse.&lt;ref name=Derrer /&gt;

Assessment of adult patients seeking a possible diagnosis can be better than in children due to the adult's greater ability to provide their own history, input, and insight. However, it has been noted that many individuals, particularly those with high intelligence, develop coping strategies that mask ADHD impairments and therefore they do not seek diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name="neuropsychiatryreviews.com"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=April 2015}}

Formal tests and assessment instruments such as IQ tests, standardized achievement tests, or [[neuropsychological tests]] typically are ''not helpful'' for identifying people with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NASP" /&gt; Furthermore, no currently available physiological or medical measure is definitive diagnostically. However, psycho-educational and medical tests are helpful in [[differential diagnosis|ruling in or out]] other conditions (e.g. learning disabilities, mental retardation, allergies) that may be associated with ADHD-like behaviors.

United States medical and mental health professionals follow the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]; the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is often used by health professionals elsewhere. Periodic updates incorporate changes in knowledge and treatments.&lt;ref name="dsmdev"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} For example, under DSM-IV (published in 1994, with corrections and minor changes in 2000), the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adults broadly follow the same as in children,&lt;ref name="onset"/&gt; but the proposed revision for the DSM-5 differentiates the presentation of ADHD for children and adults for several symptoms.&lt;ref name="apadsm5"/&gt;

It should be noted that every normal individual exhibits ADHD-like symptoms occasionally (when tired or stressed, for example) but for a positive diagnosis to be received, the symptoms should be present from childhood and persistently interfere with functioning in multiple spheres of an individual's life: work, school, and interpersonal relationships. The symptoms that individuals exhibit as children are still present in adulthood, but manifest differently as most adults develop compensatory mechanisms to adapt to their environment.

==Treatment==
{{See also|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management}}
Treatment for adult ADHD may combine medication and behavioral, cognitive, or [[vocational interventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faraone|first=F|date=|title=Efficacy of adderall for attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder: A meta-analysis|url=|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|volume=6|pages=69–75|doi=10.1177/108705470200600203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment often begins with medication selected to address the symptoms of ADHD, along with any [[comorbid]] conditions that may be present. Medication alone, while effective in correcting the physiological symptoms of ADHD, will not address the paucity of skills which many adults will have failed to acquire because of their ADHD (e.g., one might regain ''ability'' to focus with medication, but skills such as organizing, prioritizing and effectively communicating have taken others time to cultivate).&lt;ref name="Searight"/&gt;

===Medications===
Stimulants, the first line medications in adult ADHD, are typically formulated in immediate and long-acting formulations.

[[Methylphenidate]], a stimulant, with short and long-acting formulations, is often the first-line therapy and appears effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=T|last2=Patsopoulos|first2=NA|last3=Weiser|first3=M|title=Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 18, 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD005041|pmid=25230710|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005041.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, methylphenidate is well tolerated. However, long term studies have not been conducted in adults and concerns about increases in blood pressure have not been established.&lt;ref name="Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: a systematic review of the evidence"/&gt; Methylphenidate increases concentrations of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] in the synaptic cleft, promoting increased neurotransmission. It acts to block the [[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters]], thus slowing the removal at which these [[neurotransmitters]] are cleared from the synapses.

[[Amphetamine]] and its derivatives, prototype stimulants, are likewise available in immediate and long-acting formulations. Amphetamines act by multiple mechanisms including reuptake inhibition, displacement of transmitters from vesicles, reversal of uptake transporters and reversible MAO inhibition. Thus amphetamines actively increases the release of these neurotransmitters into the [[synaptic cleft]].&lt;ref name="junginger"/&gt; They may have a better side-effect profile than methylphenidate [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascularly]] and potentially better tolerated.&lt;ref name="kolar"/&gt;

The non-stimulant [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera), is also an effective treatment for adult ADHD. Although atomoxetine has a half life similar to stimulants it exhibits delayed onset of therapeutic effects similar to antidepressants. Unlike the stimulants which are controlled substances, atomoxetine lacks abuse potential. It is particularly effective for those with the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive concentration]] type of attention deficit due to being primarily a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref name="atom"/&gt; It is often prescribed in adults who cannot tolerate the side effects of amphetamines or methylphenidate. It is also approved for [[ADHD]] by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]. A rare but potentially severe side effect includes [[liver damage]] and increased [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="santosh"/&gt;

[[Bupropion]] and [[desipramine]] are two antidepressants that have demonstrated some evidence of effectiveness in the management of ADHD particularly when there is comorbid [[major depression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilens|first1=Timothy E. |last2=Morrison|first2=Nicholas R. |last3=Prince|first3=Jefferson |date=October 2011 |title=An update on the pharmacotherapy of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1443–65 |doi=10.1586/ern.11.137 |pmid=21955201 |pmc=3229037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although antidepressants have lower treatment [[effect size]]s.&lt;ref name="Antidepressants in the treatment of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review."/&gt;

===Psychosocial therapy===
Treatment of adult ADHD may also include forms of [[stress management]] or relaxation training.

Research has shown that, alongside medication, [[psychological intervention]]s in adults can be effective in reducing symptomatic deficiencies.&lt;ref name="rosler"/&gt; Emerging evidence suggests a possible role for [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) alongside medication&lt;ref name="antadv"/&gt; in the treatment of adult ADHD.&lt;ref name="KnouseLE"/&gt;

For most adults, the psychosocial therapy is not effective.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For this reason, medications are the first line of therapies. The medications that are prescribed for adults come in both stimulant and non-stimulant form. Although the drug therapies are effective for adults, the benefits should be discussed with the patient’s physician to ensure the benefits of the medications outweigh the risk. If medication is unwanted or not an option, increasing exercise and changing one’s diet may help alleviate some of the symptoms such as hyperactivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youexplained.com/4-important-habits-for-adhd-patients/|title=4 important habits for adults and children with ADHD {{!}} You Explained|website=You Explained|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise may alleviate some of the symptoms of ADHD for approximately 45 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In North America and Europe, it is estimated that three to five percent of adults have ADHD, but only about ten percent of those have received a formal diagnosis.&lt;ref name="whoprev"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref name="kessler"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}} It has been estimated that 5% of the global population has ADHD (including cases not yet diagnosed).&lt;ref name="The Worldwide prevalance of ADHD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willcutt|first=E|date=|title=The prevalence of DSM-IV attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analytic review|url=|journal=Neurotherapeutics|volume=9|pages=490–499|doi=10.1007/s13311-012-0135-8|pmc=3441936}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the [[World Health Organization]] World Mental Health Survey Initiative, researchers screened more than 11,000 people aged 18 to 44 years in ten countries in [[the Americas]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. On this basis they estimated the adult ADHD proportion of the population to average 3.5 percent with a range of 1.2 to 7.3 percent, with a significantly lower prevalence in low-income countries (1.9%) compared to high-income countries (4.2%). The researchers concluded that adult ADHD often co-occurs with other disorders, and that it is associated with considerable role disability. Although they found that few adults are treated for ADHD itself, in many instances treatment is given for the co-occurring disorders.&lt;ref name="fayyadcross"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}}

== History ==

{{Main|History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}

Early work on disorders of attention was conducted by [[Alexander Crichton]] in 1798 writing about "mental restlessness".&lt;ref name="berrios" /&gt; The underlying condition came to be recognized from the early 1900s by Sir [[George Frederic Still|George Still]].&lt;ref name="lange" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan2009" /&gt; Efficacy of medications on symptoms was discovered during the 1930s and research continued throughout the twentieth century. ADHD in adults began to be studied from the early 1970s and research has increased as worldwide interest in the condition has grown.

In the 1970s researchers began to realize that the condition now known as ADHD did not always disappear in adolescence, as was once thought.&lt;ref name="pubtrends" /&gt; The expansion of the definition for ADHD beyond only being a condition experienced by children was mainly accomplished by refocusing the diagnosis on inattention instead of [[Hyperactivity disorder|hyperactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Medicalization of Society|last = Conrad|first = Peter|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0801885853|location = Baltimore, Maryland|pages = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, some of the symptoms were also noted in many parents of the children under treatment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The condition was formally recognized as affecting adults in 1978, often informally called ''adult ADD'', since symptoms associated with hyperactivity are generally less pronounced.&lt;ref name="doctorlisafairweather_dot_com" /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}}

==Society and culture==
{{see also|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies}}
ADHD in adults, as with children, is recognized as an impairment that may constitute a disability under U.S. federal disability nondiscrimination laws, including such laws as the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] and the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008|Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA, 2008 revision), if the disorder substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities. For adults whose ADHD does constitute a disability, workplaces have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations, and educational institutions have a duty to provide appropriate academic adjustments or modifications, to help the individual work more efficiently and productively.&lt;ref name="eoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="disdis"/&gt;

In a 2004 study it was estimated that the yearly income discrepancy for adults with ADHD was $10,791 less per year than high school graduate counterparts and $4,334 lower for college graduate counterparts. The study estimates a total loss in productivity in the United States of over $77 billion USD.&lt;ref name=AMA_Economics&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: The Social and Economic Impact of ADHD|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12869.html|website=American Medical Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022150521/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12869.html|archivedate=22 October 2004|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} By contrast, loss estimations are $58 billion for drug abuse, $85 billion for alcohol abuse and $43 billion for depression.&lt;ref name="hw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinberg|first1=Steven|title=Adult ADHD Costs Billions in Lost Income|url=http://news.healingwell.com/index.php?p=news1&amp;id=521145|website=HealingWell|date=9 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}}

==Controversy==
{{Main|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies}}
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies|ADHD controversies]] include concerns about its existence as a disorder, its causes, the methods by which ADHD is diagnosed and treated including the use of stimulant medications in children, possible overdiagnosis, misdiagnosis as ADHD leading to undertreatment of the real underlying disease, alleged [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] practices of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and negative stereotypes of children diagnosed with ADHD. These controversies have surrounded the subject since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name=lange/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Cormier E |title=Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a review and update |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=345–57 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18804015 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ann Dancing''''' is an artwork created in 2007 by [[Julian Opie]] (born 1958, London) an English artist and former trustee of the [[Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/governancefunding/boardoftrustees/trusteesretired.htm#opie About Tate | Governance &amp; Funding | Current and Recently Retired Trustees&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907093439/http://www.tate.org.uk/about/governancefunding/boardoftrustees/trusteesretired.htm#opie |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture was removed from its base on August 20, 2008, for repairs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/LOCAL/80828046 Dancing sculpture needs electronic facelift]&lt;/ref&gt; and was returned on October 31 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Rogue Public Art Project Captures Cultural Trail Attention |date=October 31, 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/128.html |work=Indianapolis Cultural Trail |pages= |accessdate=2009-09-23 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318160028/http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/128.html |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The sculpture consists of four rectilinear panels of light-emitting diode ([[LED]]) screens that each display the same animated image in orange of a woman on all four panels.  The woman, "Ann," is wearing a [[sheath dress]] and sways from side to side in a dancing motion.   Ann either has pointed feet or is wearing high-heeled shoes.  She appears to have no clear hairstyle.

It is probable that the animated image of Ann dancing is computer generated from an internally housed computer located in the red brick base of the sculpture.

==History and Location==
The sculpture was installed at the intersection of [[Massachusetts Avenue, Indianapolis|Massachusetts Avenue]], Alabama Street, and  Vermont Street in [[Indianapolis]] from January to February, 2008.   The sculpture is located directly in front of the Old Point Tavern and was the first artwork installed on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail [http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/] at a total expense of $150,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/114.html |title=Indianapolis Cultural Trail : First permanent art installation along Indianapolis Cultural Trail is illuminated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093739/http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/114.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is visible in the Google Maps Street View, but only from the middle of the intersection [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+indianapolis&amp;sll=42.42805,-71.200397&amp;sspn=0.009535,0.02223&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=39.772592,-86.152437&amp;panoid=IR2fF0XWgVjQtGD-ObatlA&amp;cbp=13,78.23,,0,4.67&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+Indianapolis,+Marion,+Indiana+46204&amp;ll=39.772692,-86.152296&amp;spn=0.012452,0.033023&amp;z=16].

'''Authoritarian personality''' is a state of mind or attitude characterized by belief in absolute [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] or submission to someone else’s authority, as well as the administration of that belief through the oppression of one's subordinates. It usually applies to individuals who are known or viewed as having an authoritarian, strict, or oppressive personality towards subordinates.

==Historical origins==
[[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Daniel Levinson]], and [[Nevitt Sanford]] theorized in their 1950 book, ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', about a personality type that involved the "potentially fascistic individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adorno |first1=T. W. |last2=Frenkel-Brunswik |first2=E. |last3=Levinson |first3=D.J. |last4=Sanford |first4=R. N. |date=1950 |title=The Authoritarian Personality |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] |isbn=978-0-06-030150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They labeled it the "authoritarian personality" based on earlier writings by [[Erich Fromm]] that used this term.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, J. &amp; Scheepers, P. (1993). "[http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/14330/3357.pdf?sequence=1 Theoretical and methodological foundations of the authoritarian personality]".  ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 29, pp.&amp;nbsp;345–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the historical influences for their theory included the rise of [[fascism]] in the 1930s, [[World War II]], and [[the Holocaust]], a main component of the "authoritarian personality" is being susceptible to [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] ideology and anti-democratic political beliefs. Their large body of research (known as the Berkeley studies) focused mainly on prejudice within a psychoanalytic/psychosocial theoretical framework (i.e., [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and Frommian).

==Original theory==
Adorno et al. (1950) viewed the authoritarian personality as having a strict [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]] that controls a weak [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] unable to cope with strong [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] impulses.  The resulting intrapsychic conflicts cause personal insecurities, resulting in that person's superego to adhere to externally imposed conventional norms (conventionalism), and to the authorities who impose these norms (authoritarian submission).  The ego-defense mechanism of projection occurs as indicated when that person avoids self-reference of the anxiety-producing id impulse, by displaying them onto "inferior" minority groups in the given culture (projectivity), with associated beliefs that are highly evaluative (power and toughness), and rigid (stereotypy).  Additionally, there is a cynical view of humanity and a need for power and toughness resulting from the anxieties produced by perceived lapses in society's conventional norms (destructiveness and cynicism). Other characteristics of this personality type are a general tendency to focus upon those who violate conventional values and act harshly towards them (authoritarian aggression), a general opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies (anti-intraception), a tendency to believe in mystic determination (superstition), and finally, an exaggerated concern with promiscuity.
 
In regards to child development, the formation of the authoritarian type occurs within the first few years of the person's life, strongly shaped by the parents and family structure.  "Hierarchical, authoritarian, exploitative" parent-child relationships may result in this personality type (Adorno et al., 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;482–484).  Parents who have a need for domination, and who dominate and threaten the child harshly, and demand obedience to conventional behaviors with threats, foster the characteristics of this personality.  In addition, the parents have a preoccupation with social status, and communicate this to the child in terms of rigid and externalized rules.  The child then suffers from suppressed feelings of resentment and aggression towards the parents, who are instead, idealized with reverence.

[[Alfred Adler]] provided another perspective, linking the "will to power over others" as a central [[neurosis|neurotic]] trait, usually emerging as aggressive over-[[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] for felt and dreaded feelings of inferiority and insignificance. According to this view, the authoritarian's need to maintain control and prove superiority over others is rooted in a [[worldview]] populated by enemies and empty of equality, empathy, and mutual benefit.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Early research==
These researchers' most noteworthy measurement for authoritarianism is the "F-scale", designed to tap a set of beliefs thought to be associated with authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated. Kirscht and Dillehay (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Kirscht, JP, &amp; Dillehay, RC. (1967). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6L4fBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dimensions of Authoritarianism: A Review of Research and Theory]''. University of Kentucky Press: Lexington, TN.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies, including response bias. Response bias results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction. Hence, if one tends to respond in agreement with items, regardless of their content, one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test. Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by response bias than the content of the items (Kirscht &amp; Dillehay, 1967).

Actual assessment of 16 Nazi criminals at Nuremberg trials (reported in Zillmer, ''et al.'', 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Zillmer, E. A., Harrower, M., Ritzler, B.A., and Archer, R.P. (1995). ''The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals''. LEA Hillside, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by clinicians using the Rorschach inkblots, and in one study, the F scale for authoritarianism, found that these ex-Nazis score high on three dimensions (anti-intraception, superstition and stereotyping, and projectivity), but not all nine dimensions as the theory predicted.

One of the first applications of the authoritarian scales in academia was by Stern and colleagues, in the early 1950s, at the University of Chicago (as reported in Wiggins, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, J.S. (1980). ''Personality and Prediction: Principles of Personality Assessment''. Addison-Wesley. Reading, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesized prediction was that "authoritarian" students would have difficulty in the sciences and humanities, and use of an attitudinal scale was a successful predictor.

==Validity==
Soon after the publication of ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', the theory became the subject of many criticisms. Theoretical problems involved the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality, and methodological problems focused on the inadequacies of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]. Another criticism is that the theory of the Berkeley group insinuates that authoritarianism exists only on the right of the political spectrum. As a result, some have claimed that the theory is corrupted by political bias. Kreml found that although there were stylistic similarities between authoritarians and anti-authoritarians (dogmatism, rigidity, etc.), construct variables like a) the relative need for order, b) the relative need for power, c) rejection or acceptance of impulse, and d) extroversion versus introversion, differentiated the two types and could underpin a full-spectrum psycho-political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kreml, William P. (1977). ''The Anti-Authoritarian Personality''. Oxford ; New York : Pergamon Press.{{ISBN|978-0-08-021063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiggins provided an insightful explanation of how the authoritarian construct is an example of the synthetic approach to personality assessment. In short, in the synthetic approach, the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation (support of Fascism). Hence, it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction, but rather based on "arm chair" situational analysis of the criteria, and intuited psychological characteristics to be assessed that fit the situation. More recently, Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Jost, JT., Glaser, J., Kruglanski, AW., and Sulloway, FJ. (2003). "Political conservatism as motivated social cognition." ''Psychological Bulletin'', 129. pp&amp;nbsp;339–375.&lt;/ref&gt; have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables (e.g., personality characteristics) with the political criteria (conservative attitudes). Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies.

Although the authoritarian is a personality construct, Adorno et al. (1950) proposed that the social environment influenced the expression of prejudice expressed, based upon the "climate of opinion" that exists at the time. Hence, ideological beliefs created within the culture and other social forces shape the prejudices of the given authoritarian individual. However, as noted by Taylor (1998),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. (1998). "[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-07091-002 The social being in social psychology]." In ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'', 4th, ed. (Eds. Gilbert, D.T., Fiske, S., and Lindzey, G). pp.&amp;nbsp;58–95.&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesized interaction of society and the individual is lost to most of the subsequent research that implemented the F scale in differential psychological studies. Given the science of personality assessment, the variety of methods Adorno, ''et al.'' used are now unsupported, and might explain that lack of empirical studies using the F scale or the other scales developed by Adorno ''et al.'' in subsequent research. An example of the social environment impact is presented by Gibb (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, C. A. (1969). "Leadership." ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'', Vol IV. pp.&amp;nbsp;205–282. Lindzey. G., &amp; Aronson, E. (Eds.). Addison-Wesley: Reading, Mass&lt;/ref&gt; in his critique of personality traits and leadership, where a study by Katz suggested that the social situation can override personality differences. In the study, groups of black and white students were formed. Some mixed racial groups had students scoring high authoritarian F scores, and in other mixed groups, low F score students. Comparisons of high authoritarian white students to those not scoring authoritarian indicated that the former student type were more cooperative and less willing to endorse stereotypes towards blacks. Situational norms against prejudicial perceptions might have influenced authoritarian students to act less prejudicial in order to conform to the prescribed norm.

After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis, Canadian psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]] found in 1981 that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Almeyer added: "The reader familiar with the matter knows that most these criticisms [of the ''Authoritarian Personality''] are over 25 years old, and now they might be considered little more than flaying a dead horse. Unfortunately the flaying is necessary, for the horse is not dead, but still trotting around—in various introductory psychology and developmental psychology textbooks, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Altemeyer|Altemeyer, B.]] (1981). ''Right-Wing Authoritarianism''. University of Manitoba Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88755-124-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current reinterpretations==
[[Bob Altemeyer]] conducted a series of studies on what he labeled [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA), and presents the most recent analysis of this personality type.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1998). The other "authoritarian personality".  Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 30, 47-91.&lt;/ref&gt;   The focus of RWA research is political preferences as measured through surveys, that suggest three tendencies as noted in attitudinal clusters.  These are: 1) submission to legitimate authorities; 2) aggression towards sanctioned targeted  [[minority group]]s; and 3) adherence to values and beliefs perceived as endorsed by followed leadership.  McCrae &amp; Costa (1997)&lt;ref&gt;McCrae and Costa (1997). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121346454500329 Conceptions and correlates of openness to experience]. Handbook of Personality Psychology. (Hogan, R., Johnson, J., &amp; Briggs, S., Eds). pp.&amp;nbsp;835–847. Academic Press: San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; report that the big 5 dimension of openness to experience is negatively correlated to RWA (r=-0.57) as measured by the NEO-PI-R Openness scale.

Later, Jost, Glaser, [[Arie W. Kruglanski|Kruglanski]], and Sulloway (2003) have proposed that authoritarianism, RWA and other similar constructs of [[political conservatism]] are a form of motivated [[social cognition]].  These researchers propose that conservatism has characteristics similar to those of authoritarianism, with resistance to change, and justification for inequality as the core components.  In addition, conservative individuals have needs to manage uncertainty and threat with both situational motives (e.g., striving for security and dominance in social hierarchies) and dispositional motives (e.g., terror management and self-esteem).  Despite its methodological deficiencies, the theory of the authoritarian personality has had a major influence on research in political, personality, and social psychology.

The research on social cognition and motivation is continued by John Duckitt and Chris Sibley. They distinguish two different aspects of [[world view]]s that lead to two different kinds of authoritarianism. A view of the social world as dangerous and threatening leads to [[right wing authoritarianism]], while the view of the world as a ruthlessly competitive jungle in which the strong win and the weak lose leads to [[social dominance orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckitt |first1=John |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |title=A Dual-Process Motivational Model of Ideology, Politics, and Prejudice |journal=Psychological Inquiry |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=98–109|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10478400903028540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent reinterpretation called regality theory is based on [[evolutionary psychology]]. Regality theory sees the authoritarian attitude as a reaction to perceived collective danger. It is argued that this theory adds an evolutionary level of analysis and avoids the political bias that authoritarianism theory is often accused of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automatic Clustering Algorithm''' refers to algorithms that can perform clustering without prior knowledge of the data sets. In contrast with other [[Cluster Analysis]] techniques, automatic clustering algorithms can determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points.

== Centroid-Based Clustering ==
Given a set of ''n'' objects, centroid-based algorithms create ''k'' partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that ''k≤n''. A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.  

Automated selection of ''k'' in a [[K-means clustering|''K''-means clustering algorithm]], one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a big problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the [[Elbow method (clustering)|elbow method]]. It consists of running ''k''-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of ''k'' will be on the "elbow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bl.ocks.org/rpgove/0060ff3b656618e9136b|title=Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering|website=bl.ocks.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another method that modifies the ''k''-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the ''G''-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, ''k'' is increased until each ''k''-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and it does not set limits for the covariance of the data.&lt;ref&gt;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2526-learning-the-k-in-k-means.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connectivity-Based Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering) ==
Connectivity-Based Clustering or [[Hierarchical clustering|Hierarchical Clustering]] is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects. Hierarchical models can either be divisive—where partitions are built from the entire data set available—or agglomerating—where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/introducing-clustering-ii-clustering-algorithms.html|title=Introducing Clustering II: Clustering Algorithms - GameAnalytics|date=2014-05-20|work=GameAnalytics|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it comes with many problems. For instance, it is sensitive to noise, to fluctuations in the data set, and it is more difficult to automate.  

Methods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms&lt;ref&gt;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19123336.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach, followed by the building up of a descriptive function, which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation (an option not found in classical HCA). This method includes the two following steps: outliers are removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allows expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-15|title=Improving hierarchical cluster analysis: A new method with outlier detection and automatic clustering|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169743907000068|journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=208–217|doi=10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.01.005|issn=0169-7439|last1=Almeida|first1=J.A.S.|last2=Barbosa|first2=L.M.S.|last3=Pais|first3=A.A.C.C.|last4=Formosinho|first4=S.J.|hdl=10316/5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[BIRCH]] (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Tian|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=Raghu|last3=Livny|first3=Miron|last4=Zhang|first4=Tian|last5=Ramakrishnan|first5=Raghu|last6=Livny|first6=Miron|date=1996-06-01|title=BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases, BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233269.233324,%20http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=235968.233324|journal=ACM SIGMOD Record|volume=25|issue=2|pages=103, 103–114, 114|doi=10.1145/235968.233324|issn=0163-5808}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it still has limitations because it requires the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserve the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the use had to input the cluster count, and improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces supercluster splitting with relatively high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Variations on the Clustering Algorithm BIRCH|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579617300151|journal=Big Data Research|language=en|volume=11|pages=44–53|doi=10.1016/j.bdr.2017.09.002|issn=2214-5796|last1=Lorbeer|first1=Boris|last2=Kosareva|first2=Ana|last3=Deva|first3=Bersant|last4=Softić|first4=Dženan|last5=Ruppel|first5=Peter|last6=Küpper|first6=Axel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Density-Based Clustering ==
Unlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, [[density-based clustering]] algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres. The Density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/how-density-based-clustering-works.htm|title=How Density-based Clustering works—ArcGIS Pro {{!}} ArcGIS Desktop|website=pro.arcgis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is [[DBSCAN]] and uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method [[OPTICS algorithm|OPTICS]] creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density. 

These methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7978726|title=An algorithm for automatic recognition of cluster centers based on local density clustering - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' 

In the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA’s alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6252874|title=AutoClustering: An estimation of distribution algorithm for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

=== History ===
{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}
The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''Sa''.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''Sa'' ≠ ''Sb''.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers ("''[[Mathematical induction#Axiom of induction|Induction axiom]]''").

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

'''BIFF''', later  sometimes '''B1FF''', was a [[pseudonym]] on, and the prototypical [[newbie]] of, [[Usenet]]. BIFF was created as and taken up as a satire of a partly amusing, partly annoying, mostly unwelcome intrusion into a then fairly rarefied community. BIFF had a Commodore Vic-20 at first and a Commodore 64 later. BIFF posts were limited to 40 character lines to look like they'd come from those machines.

== Origin ==
BIFF was created by Joe Talmadge, who abandoned the character after just two postings. From then on, Richard Sexton took over and was credited by Talmadge as popularising BIFF.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Richard Sexton:'' I make no claim to inventing BIFF. Blame Joe Talmadge. Joe wasn't too busy one year at HP and invented a whole cast of characters such as SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR MAN, Bobby Joe (Dedicated [[A Prairie Home Companion|Wobegon]] listener), Joe Supportive (soc.singles reader for 1.5 years) and of course the big bad BIFFSTER.

''Joe Talmadge:'' Oh. Hey. Don't blame me. It's Webber's fault. Anyway, I may have invented BIFF, but Richard made him famous. Richard is the Roy Crock&lt;ref&gt;Apparently a mis-remembering of [[Ray Kroc]], who came upon a single family-run "restaurant" and turned it into the global phenomenon that is [[McDonald's#History|McDonald's]]&lt;/ref&gt; of BIFF; meanwhile, I fade quietly into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/news.groups/browse_thread/thread/a01025d8dab0f46f/5a8b82cd3ab82959?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=%22joe+talmadge%22+BIFF#5a8b82cd3ab82959 USENET postings, 1990.01.08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Versions have since been posted for the amusement of the Internet at large.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Richard Sexton:'' I posted a few BIFF articles from my account at gryphon, but now there are about 20 people, well connected, posting BIFF forgeries.  You probably don't want to hear that the people doing them had to find something to occupy themselves after they dissolved the [[backbone cabal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/news.groups/browse_thread/thread/a01025d8dab0f46f/5a8b82cd3ab82959?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=%22joe+talmadge%22+BIFF#5a8b82cd3ab82959 USENET posting, 1990.01.08:1711]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Cultural significance and later decline ==
BIFF served as a satire of an exceptional behaviour in a fairly homogeneous environment.&lt;ref&gt;for an example, see [http://www.eyrie.org/~thad/strange/b1ff.html Letter from B1FF] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive growth of the web led to the rapid decline of BIFF, as Biffisms became no longer exceptional and the Internet rapidly became a much larger and much more heterogeneous environment, leading both to newcomers not being aware of BIFF's existence and to BIFF becoming less contrasting as an exception in the increasingly "noisy" Internet.

==B1ff the slang typography as precursor of 1337 (Leet)==
'''B1ff''' also became the name of a type of [[internet slang]] that was created in the early days of the [[Internet]] by groups who felt they were being watched by government officials or corporations. This was a major step towards full [[Leet|1337 (Leet)]]; however, they originally had different purposes. B1ff only changes words only enough so a program looking for certain words doesn't find them, whereas 1337 was created to prevent non-1337 humans from reading text.

During the early days of [[internet gaming]], a new side of b1ff took a significant rise, when scripts edited the content of instant chat conversations. Today, however, most censoring scripts can compensate for the letter-number replacement. Thus, b1ff has mainly evolved into 1337, a more involved language which, although it does include letter-number replacement, also includes letter mixing (e.g. "[[pr0n]]"), similar-sound substitution (e.g. "h4xx" for "hack"), 'building' a letter from multiple characters (e.g. x from &gt;&lt;), and the invention of new words as a substitute for common words.

===Continued existence===
In the sense of caricaturing the prototypical pre-adolescent or over-self-confident [[noob]] on the Internet, b1ff's legacy lives on, in practice if not in name.

Beyond apparently inspiring the naming and style of the precursor to [[leet]], b1ffisms continue to be seen today in many Internet forums and comment threads, both in direct posts and in deliberate ironic imitation. Every Internet user who has used leetspeek ironically ("the ph34r!") or mocked pre-teen gamers or IRCers ("OMG WTF!!!1eleven11 kthxbye") is essentially using a modernised b1ff. b1ff, like [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]], appears to be a specifically created yet immediately classic [[shibboleth]] of some fundamental human behaviour, on the part of both the parodied and the parodying.

{{Italic title}}
In [[France]], the '''''cabinet noir''''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[black room]]") was the office where the letters of suspected persons were opened and read by public officials before being forwarded to their destination. However, this had to be done with some sophistication, as it was considered undesirable that the subjects of the practice know about it, and "that the black chamber not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service."&lt;ref name=everything2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Black%20Chamber |title=Black Chamber |publisher=Everything2 |date=2001-01-14 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice had been in vogue since the establishment of posts, and was frequently used by the ministers of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]; but it was not until the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] that a separate office for this purpose was created. This was called the ''cabinet du secret des postes'', or more popularly the ''cabinet noir''. Although declaimed against at the time of the [[French Revolution]], it was used both by the revolutionary leaders and by [[Napoleon]].

== Outside France ==
By the 1700s, cryptanalysis was becoming industrialized, with teams of government cryptanalysts working together to crack the most complex monoalphabetic ciphers. Each European power had its own so called black chamber, a nerve centre for deciphering messages and gathering intelligence. The most celebrated, disciplined and efficient was the Geheime Kabinettskanzlei in Vienna. It operated according to a strict timetable, because it was vital that its activities should not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service. Letters which were supposed to be delivered to embassies in Vienna were first routed via the black chamber, arriving at 7 am. Secretaries melted seals, and a team of stenographers worked in parallel to make copies of the letters. Within three hours the letters had been resealed and returned to the central post office to be delivered to their intended destination. As well as supplying the emperors of Austria with vital intelligence, the Viennese black chamber sold the information it harvested to other European powers. In 1774, for example, an arrangement was made with Abbot Georgel, the secretary in the French embassy, who had access to a biweekly package on information for 1,000 [[ducat]]s.

Black chambers were also employed by the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Karl|date=1999|title=The Black Chamber in the Dutch Republic during the War of the Spanish Succession and Its Aftermath, 1707-1715|jstor=3020898|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=42|issue=1|pages=133–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' took the view that the ''cabinet noir'' had disappeared{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, but that the right to open letters in cases of emergency still appeared to be retained by the French government; and a similar right was occasionally exercised in [[England]] under the direction of a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]. In England, this power was frequently employed during the eighteenth century{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and was confirmed by the [[Post Office Act 1837]]; its most notorious use was, perhaps, the opening of [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]]'s letters in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cabinet Noir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[postal censorship]] became common during [[World War I]]. Governments claimed that the [[total war]] which was waged required such censorship to preserve the civilian population's [[morale]] from heart-breaking news up from the front. Whatever the justification, this meant that not a single letter sent from a soldier to his family escaped previous reading by a government official, destroying any notion of [[privacy]] or of [[secrecy of correspondence]]. Post censorship was retained during the [[interwar period]] and afterwards, but without being done on such a massive scale.

The '''Carian alphabets''' are a number of regional scripts used to write the [[Carian language]] of western [[Anatolia]]. They consisted of some 30 [[alphabet]]ic letters, with several geographic variants in [[Caria]] and a homogeneous variant attested from the [[Nile]] delta, where [[Carians|Carian]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] fought for the Egyptian pharaohs. They were written left-to-right in Caria (apart from the Carian–Lydian city of [[Tralleis]]) and right-to-left in Egypt. Carian was deciphered primarily through Egyptian–Carian bilingual tomb inscriptions, starting with John Ray in 1981; previously only a few sound values and the alphabetic nature of the script had been demonstrated. The readings of Ray and subsequent scholars were largely confirmed with a Carian–Greek bilingual inscription discovered in [[Kaunos]] in 1996, which for the first time verified personal names, but the identification of many letters remains provisional and debated, and a few are wholly unknown.

==Scripts==
There is a range of graphic variation between cities in Caria, some of which extreme enough to have separate Unicode characters.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the others, such as 𐅝, Λ, 𐤭, 𝈣, 𐅤, ʘ, Ϲ, 𝈋, 𐊑, Ш, Ϸ, have been filled in below with similar characters from other Unicode ranges.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaunos alphabet is thought to be complete. There may be other letters in Egyptian cities outside Memphis, but they need to be confirmed. The letters with identified values in the various cities are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Adiego 2007:207''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Carian scripts, which have a common origin, have long puzzled scholars. Most of the letters resemble letters of the Greek alphabet, but their sound values are generally unrelated to the values of the Greek letters. This is unusual among the [[alphabets of Asia Minor]], which generally approximate the Greek alphabet fairly well, both in sound and shape, apart from sounds which had no equivalent in Greek. However, the Carian sound values are not completely disconnected: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊠&lt;/span&gt; /a/ (Greek Α), &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊫&lt;/span&gt; /o/ (Greek Ο), &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊰&lt;/span&gt; /s/ (Greek Ϻ [[san (letter)|san]]), and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊲&lt;/span&gt; /u/ (Greek Υ) are as close to Greek as any Anatolian alphabet, and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊷&lt;/span&gt;, which resembles Greek Β, has the similar sound /p/, which it shares with Greek-derived [[Lydian alphabet|Lydian]] &lt;span lang="xld"&gt;𐤡&lt;/span&gt;.

Adiego (2007) therefore suggests that the original Carian script was adopted from cursive Greek, and that it was later restructured, perhaps for monumental inscription, by imitating the form of the most graphically similar Greek print letters without considering their phonetic values. Thus a /t/, which in its cursive form may have had a curved top, was modeled after Greek ''qoppa'' (Ϙ) rather than its ancestral ''tau'' (Τ) to become &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊭&lt;/span&gt;. Carian /m/, from archaic Greek 𐌌, would have been simplified and was therefore closer in shape to Greek Ν than Μ when it was remodeled as &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊪&lt;/span&gt;. Indeed, many of the regional variants of Carian letters parallel Greek variants: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊥 𐅝&lt;/span&gt; are common graphic variants of [[digamma]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊨 ʘ&lt;/span&gt; of [[theta]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊬 Λ&lt;/span&gt; of both [[gamma]] and [[lambda]], 𐌓 &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊯 𐌃&lt;/span&gt; of [[rho]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊵 𐊜&lt;/span&gt; of [[phi]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊴 𐊛&lt;/span&gt; of [[Chi (letter)|chi]], &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊲 V&lt;/span&gt; of [[upsilon]], and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐋏 𐊺&lt;/span&gt; parallel Η 𐌇 [[eta]]. This could also explain why one of the rarest letters, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊱&lt;/span&gt;, has the form of one of the most common Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps coincidentally, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊮&lt;/span&gt; /š/ resembles Ϸ ([[sho (letter)|sho]]), which was used for /š/ in the Greek-derived Bactrian alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no such proto-Carian cursive script is attested, so these etymologies are speculative.

Further developments occurred within each script; in Kaunos, for example, it would seem that &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊮&lt;/span&gt; /š/ and &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊭&lt;/span&gt; /t/ both came to resemble a Latin P, and so were distinguished with an extra line in one: &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐌓&lt;/span&gt; /t/, &lt;span lang="xcr"&gt;𐊯&lt;/span&gt; /š/.

==Decipherment==

Numerous attempts at deciphering the Carian inscriptions were made during the 20th century. After World War II, most of the known Carian inscriptions were collected and published, which provided good basis for decipherment.

In the 1960s the Russian researcher [[Vitaly Shevoroshkin]] showed that earlier assumptions that the script was a [[Syllabary|syllabic]] or [[Semi-syllabary|semisyllabic]] writing system was false. He devoted many years to his study, and used proper methodology. He made it clear that Carian was indeed alphabetically written, but made few significant advances in the understanding of the language. He took the values of letters resembling those of the [[Greek alphabet]] for granted, which proved to be unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio-Javier Adiego Lajara, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&amp;pg=PA179 ''The Carian Language''.] Volume 86 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. BRILL, 2006 {{ISBN|9004152814}} p179ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers of Carian were H. Stoltenberg, O. Masson, [[Yuri Otkupshchikov]], P. Meriggi (1966), and R. Gusmani (1975), but their work was not widely accepted.

Stoltenberg, like Shevoroshkin, and most others, generally attributed Greek values to Carian symbols.&lt;ref&gt;
Stoltenberg, H. L. (1958a) “Neue Lesung der karischen Schrift”, Die Sprache 4, 139–151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, an Egyptologist K. Zauzich investigated bilingual texts in Carian and Egyptian (what became known as 'Egyptian approach'). This was an important step in decipherment, that produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio-Javier Adiego Lajara, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&amp;pg=PA187 ''The Carian Language''.] Volume 86 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. BRILL, 2006 {{ISBN|9004152814}} p187ff&lt;/ref&gt;

This method was further developed by T. Kowalski in 1975, which was his only publication on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;THOMAS W. KOWALSKI (1975), [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/kadm.1975.14.issue-1/kadm.1975.14.1.73/kadm.1975.14.1.73.xml LETTRES CARIENNES: ESSAI DE DECHIFFREMENT DE L’ECRITURE CARIENNE] Kadmos. Volume 14, Issue 1, Pages 73–93, DOI 10.1515/kadm.1975.14.1.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Egyptologist [[John D. Ray]] apparently worked independently from Kowalski; nevertheless he produced similar results (1981, 1983). He used Carian–Egyptian [[bilingual inscription]]s that had been neglected until then. His big breakthrough was the reading of the name [[Psammetichus (disambiguation)|Psammetichus]] (Egyptian Pharaoh) in Carian.

The radically different values that Ray assigned to the letters initially met with scepticism. [[Ignasi-Xavier Adiego]], along with [[Diether Schürr]], started to contribute to the project in the early 1990s. In his 1993 book ''Studia Carica'', Adiego offered the decipherment values for letters that are now known as the ‘Ray-Schürr-Adiego system’. This system now gained wider acceptance. The discovery of a new [[bilingual inscription]] in 1996 (the [[Kaunos]] Carian-Greek bilingual inscription) confirmed the essential validity of their decipherment.

Carian was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.
It is encoded in Plane 1 ([[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]).

The Unicode block for Carian is U+102A0&amp;ndash;U+102DF:

'''Chữ khoa đẩu''' is a doubtful{{Dubious|date=December 2017}} obsolete script for the [[Vietnamese language]]. It is supposed to have been used in the [[Hồng Bàng]] period, and it is believed to have disappeared later during the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. However, it is note-worthy  that the term "chữ khoa đẩu" itself comes from "[[tadpole script]]" ({{zh|t=蝌蚪字|p=kēdǒu zì}}) in Chinese texts produced in Vietnam while the ones produced elsewhere refers to ''kēdǒu zì'' as variants of the ancient [[Chinese characters]].{{Clarify|reason=|date=December 2017}}

"Chữ khoa đẩu" is also considered a distinct [[Muong language]] script similar to [[Thai alphabet]] and [[Lao alphabet]]. The script has 30 basic consonant signs.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Rutherford ''Vietnam'' 2003 p230 "Although the lowland Vietnamese, the Kinh, lost their original written script after 1,000 years of Chinese domination, the Muong have nonetheless retained theirs.

A ''''''conceptual schema'''''' is a high-level description of a business's informational needs.  It typically includes only the main concepts and the main relationships among them.  Typically this is a first-cut model, with insufficient detail to build an actual database. This level describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users. The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets on describing entities, datatype, relationships and constraints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Data Modelling Tutorial", Stefano Grazioli, University of Virginia, {{cite web|url=http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702034254/http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}, retrieved 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

A '''conceptual schema''' or '''conceptual [[data model]]''' is a map of [[concept]]s and their [[Relational model|relationships]] used for [[database]]s.  This describes the [[semantics]] of an organization and represents a series of [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s about its nature.  Specifically, it describes the things of significance to an [[organization]] (''entity classes''), about which it is inclined to collect information, and characteristics of (''attributes'') and associations between pairs of those things of significance (''relationships'').

Because a conceptual schema represents the semantics of an organization, and not a [[database design]], it may exist on various levels of abstraction.  The original [[ANSI]] four-schema architecture began with the set of ''external schema'' that each represent one person's view of the world around him or her.  These are consolidated into a single ''conceptual schema'' that is the superset of all of those external views.  A data model can be as concrete as each person's perspective, but this tends to make it inflexible.  If that person's world changes, the model must change.  Conceptual data models take a more abstract perspective, identifying the fundamental things, of which the things an individual deals with are just examples.

The model does allow for what is called [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] in [[object oriented]] terms.  The set of [[Instantiation (computer science)|instance]]s of an entity class may be subdivided into entity classes in their own right.  Thus, each instance of a ''sub-type'' entity class is also an instance of the entity class's ''super-type''. Each instance of the super-type entity class, then is also an instance of one of the sub-type entity classes.

[[supertype|Super-type]]/[[subtype|sub-type]] relationships may be ''[[exclusive relationship (programming)|exclusive]]'' or not. A methodology may require that each instance of a super-type may ''only'' be an instance of ''one'' sub-type. Similarly, a super-type/sub-type relationship may be ''exhaustive'' or not. It is exhaustive if the methodology requires that each instance of a super-type ''must be'' an instance of a sub-type. A sub-type named other is often necessary.

==Example relationships==
* Each PERSON may be ''the vendor in'' one or more ORDERS.
* Each ORDER must be ''from'' one and only one PERSON.
* PERSON is ''a sub-type of'' PARTY.  (Meaning that every instance of PERSON is also an instance of PARTY.)
* Each EMPLOYEE may have a ''supervisor'' who is also an EMPLOYEE.

== Data structure diagram ==

A [[data structure diagram]] (DSD) is a data model or diagram used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them.

A '''control moment gyroscope''' (CMG) is an [[attitude control]] device generally used in [[spacecraft]] attitude control systems. A CMG consists of a spinning rotor and one or more motorized [[gimbal]]s that tilt the rotor’s [[angular momentum]].  As the rotor tilts, the changing angular momentum causes a [[gyroscopic]] torque that rotates the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100021932.pdf|title=Space Station Control Moment Gyroscope Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/space/control-moment-gyroscopes-cmg|title=CONTROL MOMENT GYROSCOPES (CMG)|website=aerospace.honeywell.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
CMGs differ from [[reaction wheel]]s. The latter apply [[torque]] simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's spin axis without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For a few hundred watts and about 100&amp;nbsp;kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of [[newton meter]]s of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require [[Watt|megawatts]] of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=smallsat|title=R Votel, D Sinclair. "Comparison of control moment gyros and reaction wheels for small Earth-observing satellites." 26th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design varieties==

===Single-gimbal===
The most effective CMGs include only a single [[gimbal]].  When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a spacecraft.  Except for effects due to the motion of the spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy).  Single-gimbal CMGs exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little power, with the result that they can apply very large torques for minimal electrical input.

===Dual-gimbal===
Such a CMG includes two gimbals per rotor.  As an actuator, it is more versatile than a single-gimbal CMG because it is capable of pointing the rotor's momentum vector in any direction.  However, the torque generated by one gimbal's motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal on its way to the spacecraft, requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal CMG.  If the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way, as in the case of the [[International Space Station]], dual-gimbal CMGs are a good design choice.  However, if a spacecraft instead requires large output torque while consuming minimal power, single-gimbal CMGs are a better choice.

===Variable-speed===
Most CMGs hold rotor speed constant using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects.  Some academic research has focused on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the CMG gimbals.  Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output torque from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaub|first1=Hanspeter|last2=Junkins|first2=John L.|title=Singularity Avoidance Using Null Motion and Variable-Speed Control Moment Gyros|journal=Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics|date=January 2000|volume=23|issue=1|pages=11–16|doi=10.2514/2.4514|accessdate=|bibcode=2000JGCD...23...11S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also can be used as a [[Flywheel energy storage|mechanical battery]] to store electric energy as [[kinetic energy]] of the flywheels.

==Potential problems==

===Singularities===
At least three single-axis CMGs are necessary for control of spacecraft attitude.  However, no matter how many CMGs a spacecraft uses, gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable output torque along certain directions.  These orientations are known as ''singularities'' and are related to the [[kinematics]] of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments.  Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed.  David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the "divide by zero" error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6154691.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6154691&amp;RS=PN/6154691 |title=Orienting a satellite with controlled momentum gyros - US Patent 6154691 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Saturation===
A cluster of CMGs can become saturated, in the sense that it is holding a maximum amount of angular momentum in a particular direction and can hold no more.

As an example, suppose a spacecraft equipped with two or more dual-gimbal CMGs experiences a transient unwanted torque, perhaps caused by reaction from venting waste gas, tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis. Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs to slant the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque.

When the transient torque ends, the control program will stop the gimbal movement, and the rotors will be left pointing more forward than before. The inflow of unwanted forward angular momentum has been routed through the CMGs and dumped into the rotors; the forward component of their total angular momentum vector is now greater than before.

If these events are repeated, the angular momentum vectors of the individual rotors will bunch more and more closely together round the forward direction. In the limiting case, they will all end up parallel, and the CMG cluster will now be saturated in that direction; it can hold no more angular momentum. If the CMGs were initially holding no angular momentum about any other axes, they will end up saturated exactly along the forward axis. If however (for example) they were already holding a little angular momentum in the "up" (yaw left) direction, they will saturate (end up parallel) along an axis pointing forward and slightly up, and so on. Saturation is possible about any axis.

In the saturated condition attitude control is impossible. Since the gyroscopic torques can now only be created at right angles to the saturation axis, roll control about that axis itself is now non-existent. There will also be major difficulties with control about other axes. For example, an unwanted left yaw can only be countered by storing some "up" angular momentum in the CMG rotors. This can only be done by tilting at least one of their axes up, which will slightly reduce the forward component of their total angular momentum. Since they can now store less "right roll" forward angular momentum, they will have to release some back into the spacecraft, which will be forced to start an unwanted roll to the right.{{efn|In fact control will already be difficult even when the cluster is not quite saturated. For example, roll control needs the gyroscopic torques to have a forward-facing component. Those gyroscopic torques are always at right angles to the rotor spin axes, so near saturation in our example the forward-facing components are quite small compared to the total gyroscopic torques. This means that the total gyroscopic torques will have to be quite large to give usable roll control, and this can only be achieved by making the gimbal motions faster. Eventually these will exceed the capabilities of the gimbal motors.}}

The only remedy for this loss of control is to desaturate the CMGs by removing the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS as long as it is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the [[Angular momentum#Discussion|moment of momentum]] of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.{{efn|It might be asked why the RCS thrusters were not used originally to directly oppose the torque created by the waste gas venting, thus bypassing the CMGs altogether and rendering them unnecessary. One answer is that RCS thrusters usually produce much more thrust than venting waste gas, or the other likely causes of unwanted torque; a few seconds of RCS firing can drain away angular momentum that has taken hours to accumulate in the CMGs. The RCS is used for "coarse" attitude control, with the CMGs providing "fine" adjustments. Another reason for temporarily storing angular momentum in the CMGs is that quite possibly one unwanted torque may be followed some time later by another unwanted torque in the opposite direction. In this case the angular momentum left stored after the first event is used to counter the second event, without expenditure of precious RCS fuel. Cyclic unwanted torques like this are often caused by orbital interactions with a gravity gradient.}}

It is worth noting that "saturation" can only apply to a cluster of two or more CMGs, since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel. It is meaningless to say that a single constant-speed CMG can become saturated; in a sense it is "permanently saturated" in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing. This contrasts with a single [[reaction wheel]], which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster, until it reaches saturation at its maximum design speed.

===Anti-parallel alignment===
There are other undesirable rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments.  For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs gets into a state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost.  This happens for the same reason as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll.  However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.

In the anti-parallel configuration, although roll control is lost, control about other axes still works well (in contrast to the situation with saturation).  An unwanted left yaw can be dealt with by storing some "up" angular momentum, which is easily done by tilting both rotor spin axes slightly up by equal amounts.  Since their fore and aft components will still be equal and opposite, there is no change in fore-and-aft angular momentum (it will still be zero) and therefore no unwanted roll.  In fact the situation will be improved, because the rotor axes are no longer quite anti-parallel and some roll control will be restored.

Anti-parallel alignment is therefore not quite as serious as saturation but must still be avoided. It is theoretically possible with any number of CMGs; as long as some rotors are aligned parallel along a particular axis, and all the others point in exactly the opposite direction, there is no saturation but still no roll control about that axis. With three or more CMGs the situation can be immediately rectified simply by redistributing the existing total angular momentum among the rotors (even if that total is zero).{{efn|For example, suppose there are four CMGs and the starting configuration is two spins facing forward and two facing back.  Then one of the forward-facing rotors can be swung smoothly to "up", while one rear-facing rotor is swung simultaneously to "down".  The resulting gyroscopic torques will cancel each other out exactly while this motion is in progress, and the final "+" shaped configuration is no longer anti-parallel.}}  In practice the CMG control program will continually redistribute the total angular momentum to avoid the situation arising in the first place.

If there are only two CMGs in the cluster, as in our first example, then anti-parallel alignment will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero.  The remedy is to keep it away from zero, possibly by using RCS firings.  This is not very satisfactory, and in practice all spacecraft using CMGs are fitted with at least three.  However it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working CMGs, and the control program must be able to deal with this situation.

===Hitting the gimbal stops===
Older CMG models like the ones launched with Skylab in 1973 had limited gimbal travel between fixed mechanical stops. On the  Skylab CMGs the limits were plus or minus 80 degrees from zero for the inner gimbals, and from plus 220 degrees to minus 130 degrees for the outer ones (so zero was offset by 45 degrees from the centre of travel). Visualising the inner angle as 'latitude' and the outer as 'longitude', it can be seen that for an individual CMG there were 'blind spots' with radius 10 degrees of latitude at the 'North and South poles', and an additional 'blind strip' of width 10 degrees of 'longitude' running from pole to pole, centred on the line of 'longitude' at plus 135 degrees. These 'blind areas' represented directions in which the rotor's spin axis could never be pointed.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Skylab carried three CMGs, mounted with their casings (and therefore their rotor axes when the gimbals were set to zero) facing in three mutually perpendicular directions. This ensured that the six 'polar blind spots' were spaced 90 degrees apart from each other. The 45 degree zero offset then ensured that the three 'blind strips' of the outer gimbals would pass halfway between neighbouring 'polar blind spots' and at a maximum distance from each other. The whole arrangement ensured that the 'blind areas' of the three CMGs never overlapped, and thus that at least two of the three rotor spins could be pointed in any given direction.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The CMG control program was responsible for making sure that the gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], while the control program could change six independent variables (the three pairs of gimbal angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|5}}

One advantage of limited gimbal movement such as Skylab's is that singularities are less of a problem. If Skylab's inner gimbals had been able to reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.

More modern CMGs such as the four units [[Integrated Truss Structure#Z1 truss|installed on the ISS]] in 2000 have unlimited gimbal travel and therefore no 'blind areas'. Thus they do not have to be mounted facing along mutually perpendicular directions; the four units on the ISS all face the same way. The control program need not concern itself with gimbal stops, but on the other hand it must pay more attention to avoiding singularities.

==Applications==

===Skylab===
[[Skylab]], launched in May 1973, was the first spacecraft to be fitted with large CMGs for attitude control.

They were arranged so that the casings (and therefore the rotors when all gimbals were at their zero positions) pointed in three mutually perpendicular directions.  Since the units were dual-gimballed, each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its rotor axis, thus providing some redundancy; if any one of the three failed, the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971&gt;{{cite web

===International Space Station===
[[Image:ISS gyroscope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|NASA personnel handle a single Control Moment Gyroscope for the [[International Space Station]].]]
The ISS employs a total of four CMGs, mounted on Z1 truss&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_098a_Zvezda_Press_Kit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as primary actuating devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative to the surface of the Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of [[gravity gradient]], [[atmospheric drag]], [[solar pressure]], and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred{{cn|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- the cite is old from 1990 - the first ISS module was launched in 1998, it was a theoretical study and proposal, and I can't find a citation to say that it is done that way--&gt; because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.&lt;ref&gt;A.

American experts believe that water vapor jetting from a cooling unit in the backpack of spacewalkers is strong enough to turn the entire two-hundred-ton space station out of alignment. This overloads the American stabilizing gyroscopes and triggers the firing of Russian rocket thrusters. The effect has been noticed on past station spacewalks that use the Russian space suits.  For their part, Russian engineers believe a small air leak from their airlock hatch could be cause. Other Russian experts blame it all on a malfunction in the American gyroscopes (which Russians call “gyrodines”), with no Russian problem at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, CMG-based experiments demonstrated the viability of [[zero-propellant maneuver]]s to adjust attitude of the ISS 90° and 180°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bedrossian |first1=Nazareth |title=International Space Station Zero-Propellant Maneuver (ZPM) Demonstration |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/274.html |website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=31 October 2018 |date=June 20, 2018 |quote=No more million-dollar maneuvers.

===Proposed===
As of 2016, the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the ISS carries no CMGs of its own.  However, the proposed but as yet unbuilt Science and Power Module (NEM-1) would be fitted with several externally-mounted CMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Its twin NEM-2 (if completed) would later be installed symmetrically on the other lateral UM port.

On 24 February 2015, the Scientific and Technical Council of [[Roscosmos]] announced that after decommissioning of the ISS (then planned for 2024) the newer Russian modules would be detached and form the nucleus of a small all-Russian space station to be called [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex|OPSEK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Sverigekarta-Landskap_Småland.svg|thumb|150px|A map of Småland.]]
The '''Dacke War''' ({{lang-sv|Dackefejden}}) was a [[peasant uprising]] led by [[Nils Dacke]] in [[Småland]], [[Sweden]], in 1542 against the rule of [[Gustav Vasa]]. Dacke and his followers were dissatisfied with the heavy tax burden, the introduction of [[Lutheranism]] and the confiscation of Church property (the confiscation and taxes were introduced to pay for the [[Swedish War of Liberation]] that had brought Gustav Vasa to power). In 1543 the uprising was defeated, and Nils Dacke was killed.

[[Image:Gustav Vasa triumphs 4.jpg|thumb|400px|The army of [[Gustav Vasa]] on its way to defeat [[Nils Dacke]].]]

== Background ==
{{See also|Early Vasa era}}

[[Nils Dacke]] and his peasants were dissatisfied with the policies of the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]]. In his effort to modernize Sweden and gain more power, the king had instituted a more efficient system for [[tax]] collection. The heavy tax burden angered many peasants.

Gustav Vasa had also broken relations with [[Rome]] and promoted [[Lutheranism]] instead of [[Catholicism]] in order to confiscate the property of the church (including land), effected by the laws of the [[Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden]]. In 1541 the king's men had confiscated many of the belongings of the churches in [[Småland]], such as the church silver and even the [[church bell]]s, to finance the army. Dacke criticized the new church order and promoted the old faith. He was also supported by many local [[priest]]s.

The rebellion was one of many rebellions during the rule of Gustav Vasa. In contrast with other contemporary rebellions in Sweden, this one was led by peasants, and not supported by the local [[nobility]].

== The uprising ==
The uprising began in the summer of 1542 when the king's [[bailiff]]s were attacked and killed when they came to collect taxes. Gustav Vasa responded by sending a military force led by his own father-in-law [[:sv:Gustaf Olofsson till Torpa|Gustav Olofsson Stenbock the Younger]]. He was defeated by Dacke's constantly growing army of peasants. Other attempts to defeat Dacke militarily also failed.

Next, the Swedish government stopped all supplies of provisions and other necessities to the region. This weakened the rebellions considerably. Defaming propaganda about Dacke was also spread by the government, labeling him a traitor and a heretic.

In March 1543 Gustav Vasa ordered his army of Swedish recruits and German [[landsknecht]] mercenaries to attack Småland. This time larger forces were deployed, and Dacke's forces were attacked from two directions - from [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. The uprising was defeated, and Dacke was wounded but managed to flee.

== Aftermath ==
The king's revenge on the instigators of the rebellion was hard. The leaders that were caught were executed together with the priests who had supported Dacke. Peasants who had supported the rebellion were deported to [[Finland]], where they had to serve in the army, and the counties where the rebellion had taken place had to pay a large fine to the king.

Dacke himself was caught and killed in August 1543 when trying to escape the country. According to legend, his body was taken to [[Kalmar]], where his head was publicly displayed wearing a crown of copper, as a warning to others.

The rebellion was the most serious threat to the rule of Gustav Vasa, but after having defeated it he managed to consolidate his power, concentrating more and more power in the hands of the monarch.

== Idiom ==
In the Swedish language, the [[idiom]] &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;"[something]&lt;/span&gt; hasn't happened since the Dacke War" is used to mean "[something] hasn't happened for a long time". This expression is especially common in the southern parts of Sweden but is also used elsewhere.

'''Data Re-Identification''' is the practice of matching [[data anonymization|anonymous data]] (also known as de-identified data) with publicly available information, or auxiliary data, in order to discover the individual to which the data belongs to. This is a concern because companies with [[privacy (internet)|privacy]] [[Policy|policies]], [[health care]] providers, and [[financial institution]]s may release the data they collect after the data has gone through the de-identification process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Porter, Christine. 2008 "CONSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY: De-Identified Data and Third Party Data Mining: The Risk of Re-Identification of Personal Information." University of Washington Shidler Journal of Law, Commerce &amp; Technology.  Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The de-identification process involves masking, generalizing or deleting both direct and indirect identifiers; the definition of this process is not universal, however.&lt;ref name="Lagos, Yianni 2014"&gt;Lagos, Yianni. 2014. "SYMPOSIUM: TAKING THE PERSONAL OUT OF DATA: MAKING SENSE OF DE-IDENTIFICATION." Indiana Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Information in the [[public domain]], even seemingly anonymized, may thus be re-identified in combination with other pieces of available data and basic [[computer science]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;McGeveran, William. 2011. "PRIVACY, DEMOCRACY, AND ELECTIONS: MRS. MCINTYRE'S PERSONA: BRINGING PRIVACY THEORY TO ELECTION LAW." William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Rule Agencies, a collection of multiple U.S. federal agencies and departments including the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], speculate that re-identification is becoming gradually easier because of "big data" - the abundance and constant collection and analysis of information along the evolution of technologies and the advances of algorithms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Groden, Samantha, Summer Martin, and Rebecca Merrill. 2016. "Proposed Changes to the Common Rule: A Standoff Between Patient Rights and Scientific Advances?" Journal of Health &amp; Life Sciences Law. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have claimed that de-identification is a safe and effective data liberation tool and do not view re-identification as a concern.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Richardson, Victor, Sallie Milam, and Denise Chrylser. 2015. "Is Sharing De-identined Data Legal? The State of Public Health Confidentiality Laws and Their Interplay with Statistical Disclosure Limitation Techniques." Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 study found that 87 percent of the U.S. population can be identified using a combination of their gender, birthdate and zip code.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Others do not think that re-identification is a serious threat, and call it a "myth"; they claim that the combination of zip code, date of birth and gender is rare or partially complete, such as only the year and month birth without the date, or the county name instead of the specific zip code, thus the risk of such re-identification is reduced in many instances.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

== Legal protections of data in the United States ==

Existing privacy regulations typically protect information that has been modified, so that the data is deemed anonymized, or de-identified. For financial information, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] permits its circulation if it is  de-identified and aggregated.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm Leach Bliley Act]] (GLBA), which mandates financial institutions give consumers the opportunity to [[Opt-out|opt out]] of having their information shared with third parties, does not cover de-identified data if the information is aggregate and does not contain personal identifiers, since this data is not treated as [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Educational records ===
{{See also|Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act}}
In terms of university records, authorities both on the state and federal level have shown an awareness about issues of [[privacy in education]] and a distaste for institutions' disclosure of information. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] has provided guidance about data discourse and identification, instructing educational institutions to be sensitive to the risk of re-identification of anonymous data by cross-referencing with auxiliary data, to minimize the amount of data in the public domain by decreasing publication of directory information about students and institutional personnel, and to be consistent in the processes of de-identification.&lt;ref&gt;Peltz, Richard. 2009. "Beyond the Final Frontier: A "Post-Racial" America?: The Responsibilities of Citizens: From the Ivory Tower to the Glass House: Access to "De-Identified" Public University Admission Records to Study Affirmative Action." Harvard Journal on Racial and Ethic Justice. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical records ===
{{See also|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act}}

Medical information of patients are becoming increasingly available on the Internet, on free and publicly accessing platforms such as HealthData.gov and PatientsLikeMe, encouraged by government open data policies and data-sharing initiatives spearheaded by the private sector.  While this level of accessibility yields many benefits, concerns regarding discrimination and privacy have been raised.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Sharona. 2015. "Citizen Science: The Law and Ethics of Public Access to Medical Big Data." Berkeley Technology Law Journal. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Protections on [[medical records]] and consumer data from [[pharmacies]] are stronger compared to those for other kinds of consumer data. The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) protects the privacy of identifiable data about health, but authorize information release to third parties if de-identified. In addition, it mandates that patients receive breach notifications should there be more than a low probability that the patient's information was inappropriately disclosed or utilized without sufficient mitigation of the harm to him or her.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Yelena. 2016. "RECENT CASE DEVELOPMENTS: Increasing Recognition of "Risk of Harm" as an Injury Sufficient to Warrant Standing in Class Action Medical Data Breach Cases." American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of re-identification is a factor in determining the probability that the patient's information has been compromised. Commonly, pharmacies sell de-identified information to [[data mining]] companies that sell to pharmaceutical companies in turn.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;


There have been state laws enacted to ban data mining of medical information, but they were struck down by federal courts in Maine and New Hampshire on First Amendment grounds. Another federal court on another case used "illusive" to describe concerns about privacy of patients and did not recognize the risks of re-identification.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Biospecimen ===
The Notice of Proposed Rule Making, published by the Common Rule Agencies in September 2015, expanded the umbrella term of "human subject" in research to include biospecimens, or materials taken from the human body - blood, urine, tissue etc. This mandates that researchers using biospecimens must follow the stricter requirements of doing researcher with human subjects. The rationale for this is the increased risk of re-identification of biospecimen.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The final revisions affirmed this regulation.&lt;ref&gt;24 C.F.R. § .104 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-identification efforts ==

There have been a sizable amount of successful attempts of re-identification in different fields. Even if it is not easy for a lay person to break anonymity, once the steps to do so are disclosed and learnt, there is no need for higher level knowledge to access information in a [[database]]. Sometimes, technical expertise is not even needed if a population has a unique combination of identifiers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Health records ===

In the mid 1990s, a government agency in [[Massachusetts]] called Group Insurance Commission (GIC), which purchased health insurance for employees of the state, decided to release records of hospital visits to any researcher who requested the data, at no cost. GIC assured that the patient's privacy was not a concern since it had removed identifiers such as name, addresses, social security numbers. However, information such as zip codes, birth date and sex remained untouched. The GIC assurance was reinforced by the then governor of Massachusetts, William Weld. [[Latanya Sweeney]], a graduate student at the time, put her mind to picking out the governor's records in the GIC data. By combining the GIC data with the voter database of the city Cambridge, which she purchased for 20 dollars, Governor Weld's record was discovered with ease.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"&gt;Ohm, Paul. 2010. “Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization.” UCLA Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a researcher successfully de-anonymized medical records using voter databases.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2001, Professor Latanya Sweeney again successfully matched anonymized hospital visit records in the state of Washington to individual persons using the state's voting records 43% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney L. Only You, Your Doctor and Many Others May Know. Technology Science. 2015092903. September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are existing algorithms used to re-identify patient with prescription drug information.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Consumer habits and practices ===

Two researchers at the [[University of Texas]], Arvind Narayanan and Professor Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to re-identity some portion of anonymized [[Netflix]] movie-ranking data with individual consumers on the streaming website.  The data was released by Netflix 2006 after de-identification, which consisted of replacing individual names with random numbers and moving around personal details. The two researchers de-anonymized some of the data by comparing it with non-anonymous IMDb (Internet Movie Database) users’ movie ratings. Very little information from the database, it was found, was needed to identify the subscriber.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the resulting research paper, there were startling revelations of how easy it is to re-identify Netflix users. For example, simply knowing data about only two movies a user has reviewed, including the precise rating and the date of rating give or take three days allows for 68% re-identification success.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"/&gt;

In 2006, after [[AOL]] published its users' search queries, data that was anonymized prior to the public release, [[New York Times]] reporters successfully carried out re-identification of individuals by taking groups of searches made by anonymized users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; AOL had attempted to suppress identifying information, including usernames and IP addresses, but had replaced these with unique identification numbers to preserve the utility of this data for researchers. Bloggers, after the release, pored over the data, either trying to identify specific users with this content, or to point out entertaining, depressing, or shocking search queries, examples of which include "how to kill you wife," "depression and medical leave," "car crash photos." Two reporters, Michael Barbro and Tom Zeller, were able to track down a 62 year old widow named Thelma Arnold from recognizing clues to the identity of User 417729 search histories. Arnold acknowledged that she was the author of the searches, confirming that re-identification is possible.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

The individuals whose data is re-identified is also at risk of having their information, with their identity attached it, sold to organizations they do not want possessing private information about their finances, health or preferences. The release of this data may cause anxiety, shame or embarrassment. Once an individual's privacy has been breached as a result of re-identification, future breaches become much easier: once an link is made between one piece of data and a person's real identity, any association between the data and an anonymous identity breaks anonymity of the person.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Re-identification may expose companies which have pledged to assure anonymity to increased liability to contract or to [[tort]] and cause them to violate their privacy policies by having released information to third parties that can identify users after re-identification. Not only will they violate internal policies, institutions may also violate state and federal laws, such laws concerning financial confidentiality or [[medical privacy]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Remedies ==

To address the drawbacks of re-identification, there have been multiple proposals put forward:
* Higher standards and uniform definition of de-identification while retaining data utility: the definition of de-identification should balance privacy protections to reduce re-identification risk with the refusal of companies to delete data &lt;ref name="Lagos, Yianni 2014"/&gt;
* Heightened privacy protections of anonymized information &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Tighter security for databases that store anonymized information &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Strong ban on malicious re-identification, the passing of broader anti-discrimination and privacy legislation that ensures privacy protections as well as encourage participation in data sharing projects and endeavors, as well as establishment of uniform data protection standards in academic communities, such as in the scientific community, in order to minimize privacy violations &lt;ref&gt;Ahn, Sejin. 2015. “COMMENT: Whose Genome Is It Anyway?: Re-identification and Privacy Protection in Public and Participatory Genomics.” San Diego Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A focus on the process of creating data-release policies: making sure de-identification rhetoric is accurate, drawing up contracts that prohibit re-identification attempts and dissemination of sensitive information, establishing data enclaves, and utilizing data-based strategies to match required protection standards to the level of risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Ira S, and Hartzog, Woodrow. 2016. “Anonymization and Risk” Washington Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Differential privacy|Differential Privacy]]

While a complete ban on re-identification has been urged, the enforcement of this is impossible. However, there are ways for lawmakers to combat and punish re-identification efforts, if and when they are exposed:pair a ban with harsher penalties and stronger enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], grant victims of re-identification a right of action against those who re-identify them, mandate software audit trails for people who utilize and analyze anonymized data. A small-scale re-identification ban may also be imposed on trusted recipients of particular databases, such as government data miners. This ban would be much easier to enforce and may discourage re-identification in other spheres and in the future.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"/&gt;

{{Sikh practices}}
{{SikhBeliefs}}
In [[Sikhism]], the '''Five Virtues''' are fundamental qualities which one should develop in order to reach [[Moksha|Mukti]], or to reunite or merge with God. The [[Sikh Gurus]] taught that these positive human qualities were [[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] (truth), [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]] (compassion), [[Santokh]] (contentment), [[Nimrata]] (humility), and [[Pyaar]] (love).

==Sat==
[[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] is the virtue of truthful living, which means practising "righteousness, honesty, justice, impartiality and fair play."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansukhani |first=Gobind Singh |title=Introduction to Sikhism |url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/mansukh/047.htm |accessdate=2007-02-10 |year=1977 |publisher=Hemkunt Press |location=[[New Delhi]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The Lord's humble servants are True — they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth.|[[Guru Granth Sahib]], page 600}}

==Santokh==
[[Santokh]], or contentment, is freedom "from ambition, envy, greed and jealousy. Without contentment, it is impossible to acquire peace of mind."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 51}}

==Daya==

The exercise of [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]], or compassion, involves "considering another's difficulty or sorrow as one's own and helping to relieve it as far as possible. Compassion also includes the overlooking of imperfections and mistakes of others, for to err is human."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Be kind to all beings-this is more meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage and the giving of charity.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 136}}

==Nimrata==
[[Nimrata]], translated as "humility", "benevolence" or "humbleness", is the fourth virtue.

{{Quotation|The God-conscious being is steeped in humility.|Guru Granth Sahib, page 273}}

==[[Pyaar]]==

[[Pyaar]] requires Sikhs to be filled with the love of God.

{{Quotation|Let the Fear of God be your feet, and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes.|Guru Granth Sahib,ang  139}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9936">'''Geometrical-optical illusions''' are [[visual illusions]], also [[optical illusions]], in which the geometrical properties of what is seen differ from those of the corresponding objects in the visual field.

==Geometrical properties==
In studying geometry one concentrates on the position of points and on the length, orientation and curvature of lines.  Geometrical-optical illusions then relate in the first instance to object characteristics as defined by geometry. Though vision is three-dimensional, in many situations depth can be factored out and attention concentrated on a simple view of a two-dimensional tablet with its x and y co-ordinates. '

==Illusions are in visual space==
Whereas their counterparts in the observer's object space are public and have measurable properties, the illusions themselves are private to the observer's (human or animal) experience.  Nevertheless, they are accessible to portrayal by verbal and other communication and even to measurement by [[psychophysics]]. A nulling technique is particularly useful in which a target is deliberately given an opposing deformation in an effort to cancel the illusion.

== Categories of visual illusions ==

[[Image:Mach band.svg|thumb|left|120px|Mach bands = visual illusion of brightness (intensive property)]] [[Image:PoggZoelMuel.png|thumb|120px|right|Illusions of position (Poggendorff), orientation (Zöllner) and, below, length (Müller-Lyer)]] 
[[Image:Heringill.png|thumb|right|120px|Hering Illusion of curvature]] 
[[Image:Delboeufill.png|thumb|left|120px|Delboeuf Illusion of size: left inner circle and right outer circle are actually equal]] 
[[Image:HorVert.png|thumb|right|120px|Vertical-horizontal Illusion]] 
[[Image:Shifted chessboard.svg|thumb|left|120px|Shifted chessboard illusion]]

Visual or Optical Illusions can be categorized according to the nature of the difference between objects and percepts. For example, these can be in brightness or color, called ''intensive'' properties of targets, e.g. [[Mach bands]]. Or they can be in their location, size, orientation or depth, called ''extensive''.  When an illusion involves properties that fall within the purview of geometry it is ''geometrical-optical'', a term given to it in the first scientific paper devoted to the topic by J.J. Oppel, a German high-school teacher, in 1854.  It was taken up by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology, and is now universally used.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J.O. (1998) ''The Psychology of Visual Illusion''. Dover, Mineola, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coren, S. and Girgus, J.S. (1978) ''Seeing is Deceiving: The Psychology of Visual Illusions''. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade, N. (1982) ''The Art and Science of Visual Illusions''. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; That by 1972 the first edition of Robinson's book devotes 100 closely printed pages and over 180 figures to these illusions attests to their popularity.

==Examples of geometrical-optical Illusions==
The easiest to explore are the geometrical-optical illusions that show up in ordinary black and white line drawings. A few examples are drawn from the list of optical illusions. They illustrate illusions of position ([[Poggendorff illusion]]), of length ([[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), of orientation  ([[Zöllner illusion]],  [[Münsterberg illusion]] or shifted-chess-board illusion and its [[café wall illusion]] variant), of rectilinearity or straightness of lines ([[Hering illusion]]), of size ([[Delboeuf illusion]])  and of vertical/horizontal anisotropy ([[Vertical-horizontal illusion]]), in which the vertical extension appears exaggerated.

==Related phenomena==
[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|right|120px|Necker cube = reversible figure]] [[Image:Penrose triangle.svg|thumb|120px|left|Penrose triangle = unrealizable object]] [[Image:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|120px|left|Kanizsa triangle = illusory contours]]  Visual illusions proper should be distinguished from some related phenomena.  Some simple targets such as the [[Necker Cube]] are capable of more than one interpretation, which are usually seen in alternation, one at a time. They may be called ambiguous configurations rather than illusion, because what is seen at any time is not actually illusory.  The configurations of the [[Roger Penrose|Penrose]] or [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] type are illusory in the sense that only on a detailed logical analysis it becomes apparent that they are not physically realizable. If one thinks of an ''illusion'' as something out there that is misinterpreted, and of a ''delusion'' when a demonstrable substrate is lacking, the distinction breaks down for such effects as the [[Kanizsa triangle]]  and ''[[illusory contours]].''

==Explanations ==
Explanations of geometrical-optical illusion are based on one of two modes of attack: 
* the ''physiological'' or ''bottom-up,'' seeking the cause of the deformation in the eye's optical imaging or in signal misrouting during neural processing in the retina or the first stages of the brain, the primary visual cortex, or
* the ''cognitive'' or ''perceptual'', which regards the deviation from true size, shape or position as caused by the assignment of a percept to a meaningful but false or inappropriate object class.

The first stage in the operations that transfer information from a visual target in front of an observer into its neural representation in the brain and then allow a percept to emerge, is the imaging by the eye and the processing by the neural circuits in the retina.  Some components of geometrical-optical illusions can be ascribed to aberrations at that level.  Even if this does not fully account for an illusion, the step is helpful because it puts elaborate mental theories in a more secure place. The [[moon illusion]] is a good example.  Before invoking concepts of apparent distance and [[size constancy]], it helps to be sure that the retinal image hasn't changed much when the moon looks larger as it descends to the horizon. 
   
Once the signals from the retina enter the visual cortex, a host of local interactions are known to take place.  In particular, neurons are tuned to target orientation and their response are known to depend on context.  The widely accepted interpretation of, e.g. the Poggendorff and Hering illusions as manifestation of expansion of acute angles at line intersections, is an example of successful implementation of a "bottom-up," physiological explanation of a geometrical-optical illusion.

[[Image:PonzoType.png|thumb|left|120px|Ponzo illusion in a purely schematic form and, below, with perspective clues]] However, almost all geometrical optical illusions have components that are at present not amenable to physiological explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, R.L. 1997 ''Eye and Brain''. Princeton University Press: Princeton N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject, therefore, is a fertile field for propositions based in the disciplines of perception and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Howe CQ, Purves D (2005) ''Perceiving geometry : geometrical illusions explained by natural scene statistics''  Springer : New York&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate: Instead of interpreting them as just a pair the sloping lines within which one feature is seen smaller than an identical one nearer to the point of convergence, the Ponzo pattern may be taken for a railroad track rendered as a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing. A barrel lying within the rails would have to be physically wider to cover the increased portion of the width of the track if it were farther away.  The consequence is the judgment that the barrels differ in diameter, whereas their physical size in the drawing is equal.

A scientific study will include the recognition that a representation of the visual word is embodied in the state of the organism's nervous system at the time the illusion is experienced. In the discipline of experimental neuroscience, a top-down influence has the meaning that signals originating in higher neural centers, repository of memory traces, innate patterns and decision operations, travel down to lower neuronal circuits where they cause a shift of the excitation balance in the deviated direction.  Such a concept is to be distinguished from the bottom-up approach which would look for aberrations that are imposed on the input in its path through the sensory apparatus. Top-down neural signaling would be a fitting implementation of the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] concept enunciated by [[Max Wertheimer]] &lt;ref&gt;Wertheimer, M. (1938) in W.D. Ellis (Ed) ''A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology''. Harcourt Brace : New York&lt;/ref&gt; that the "properties of any of the parts are determined by the intrinsic structural laws of the whole."

==Mathematical transformation==
When objects and associated percepts, in their respective spaces, correspond to each other albeit with deformations describable in terms of geometry, the mathematically inclined are tempted to search for transformations, perhaps non-Euclidean,&lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947) ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; that map them on each other. Application of differential geometry has so far not been notably successful [https://bspace.berkeley.edu/access/content/user/54855/Spatrans.pdf]; the variety and complexity of the phenomena, significant differences between individuals and dependence on context, previous experience and instruction set a high bar for satisfying formulations.&lt;ref&gt;Westheimer, G. (2008) "Geometrical-optical illusions and the neural representation of space". ''Vision Res'', 48, 2128-2142&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''grandfather paradox''' is a [[paradox]] of [[time travel]] in which inconsistencies emerge through changing the past.&lt;ref name="lobo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0206078v2.pdf |title=Time, Closed Timelike Curves and Causality |page=2 |author=Francisco Lobo |year=2002 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the paradox's common description: a person travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before the conception of their father or mother, which prevents the time traveler's existence.&lt;ref name="sagan-nova"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/time/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan Ponders Time Travel|work=NOVA|date=December 10, 1999|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth. Rather, the paradox regards any action that alters the past,&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{citation|title=Beyond Experience: Metaphysical Theories and Philosophical Constraints|date=2001|author=Norman Swartz|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/beyond_experience/chap08.htm|pp=226&amp;mdash;227}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was.&lt;ref name="NicholasSmith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel/index.html#CauLoo |author=Nicholas J.J. Smith |date=2013 |title=Time Travel |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
The grandfather paradox was alluded to in written stories as early as 1929, and in 1931 it was described as "the age-old argument of preventing your birth by killing your grandparents" in a letter to American science fiction magazine [[Amazing Stories]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39KQY1FnSfkC|title=Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=0387985719|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=255, 286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[science fiction]] stories dealing with the paradox are the short story ''Ancestral Voices'' by [[Nathaniel Schachner]], published in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginn|first1=Sherry|last2=Leach|first2=Gillian I.|title=Time-Travel Television: The Past from the Present, the Future from the Past|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=London|isbn=1442255773|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1944 book ''[[Future Times Three]]'' by [[René Barjavel]], although a number of other works from the 1930s and 1940s touched upon the topic in various degrees of detail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Variants==
The grandfather paradox encompasses any change to the past,&lt;ref name="NicholasSmith"/&gt; and it's presented in many variations. Physicist John Garrison et al. give a variation of the paradox of an electronic circuit which sends a signal through a time machine to shut itself off, and receives the signal before it sends it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=J.C.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M.W.|last3=Chiao|first3=R.Y.|last4=Bolda|first4=E.L.|title=Superluminal Signals: Causal Loop Paradoxes Revisited|journal=Physics Letters A|date=August 1998|volume=245|issue=1-2|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(98)00381-8|arxiv=quant-ph/9810031|bibcode=1998PhLA..245...19G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Machine Tales|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319488622|pages=335-336}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent paradox is known in [[philosophy]] as ''autoinfanticide'', going back in time and killing oneself as a baby.&lt;ref name="horwich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horwich|first1=Paul|title=Asymmetries in Time: Problems in the Philosophy of Science|date=1987|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262580888|page=116|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Hitler's murder paradox}}Another variant of the grandfather paradox is the "Hitler paradox" or "Hitler's murder paradox",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/04/06/book-review-life-after-life-kate-atkinson/OL6nDqGHPFgxaUBrJgXEHL/story.html|title=Book review: Life after Life’ by Kate Atkinson|author=Eugenia Williamson|date=6 April 2013|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=9 August 2013|quote=Google the phrase “go back in time and,” and the search engine will suggest completing the phrase with a simple directive: “kill Hitler.” The appeal of murdering the Nazi dictator is so great that it has its own subgenre within speculative fiction, a trope known as “Hitler’s murder paradox” in which a time traveller journeys back far enough to nip the leader — and World War II — in the bud, typically with unexpected consequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fairly frequent trope in science fiction, in which the protagonist travels back in time to murder [[Adolf Hitler]] before he can instigate [[World War II]] and [[The Holocaust]].

Some advocate a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] approach to the grandfather paradox. When the time traveller kills their grandfather, they are actually killing a parallel universe version of their grandfather, and the time traveller's original universe is unaltered; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not "genuine" time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other variants, the actions of the time traveller have no effect outside of their own personal experience, as depicted in [[Alfred Bester]]'s short story ''[[The Men Who Murdered Mohammed]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Philosophical analysis==
Even without knowing whether time travel to the past is physically possible, it is possible to show using [[modal logic]] that changing the past results in a logical contradiction. If it is necessarily true that the past happened in a certain way, then it is false and impossible for the past to have occurred in any other way. A time traveller would not be able to change the past from the way it ''is'', they would only act in a way that is already consistent with what ''necessarily'' happened.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198236212|pages=368–369|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration of the grandfather paradox has led some to the idea that time travel is by its very nature paradoxical and therefore logically impossible. For example, the philosopher [[Bradley Dowden]] made this sort of argument in the textbook ''Logical Reasoning'', arguing that the possibility of creating a contradiction rules out time travel to the past entirely. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that time travel into the past need not be logically impossible provided that there is no possibility of changing the past,&lt;ref name="NicholasSmith"/&gt; as suggested, for example, by the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]. Bradley Dowden himself revised the view above after being convinced of this in an exchange with the philosopher Norman Swartz.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/time_travel1.htm |title=Time Travel - Visiting the Past|author=Norman Swartz|year=1993|publisher=SFU.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical physics===
Consideration of the possibility of backwards time travel in a hypothetical universe described by a [[Gödel metric]] led famed logician [[Kurt Gödel]] to assert that time might itself be a sort of illusion.&lt;ref name="Yourgrau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yourgrau|first1=Palle|title=A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780786737000|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtY907BlhxYC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22time+itself+-+hence+speed+and+motion+-+is+but+an+illusion%22&amp;dq=2005+A+World+Without+Time:+The+Forgotten+Legacy+of+G%C3%B6del+and+Einstein#v=onepage|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt|first=Jim|title=Time Bandits|date=2005-02-21|publisher=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/28/time-bandits-2|accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests something along the lines of the [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|block time]] view in which time is just another dimension like space, with all events at all times being fixed within this 4-dimensional "block".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A variation of [[Hugh Everett|Everett's]] [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not "genuine" time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one.&lt;ref name="Hawking warp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html|title=Space and Time Warps|year=1999|accessdate=February 25, 2012|last1=Hawking|first1=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causal loops==
{{main|Causal loop}}
Backwards time travel that does not create a grandfather paradox creates a causal loop. The [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] expresses one view on how backwards [[time travel]] would be possible without the generation of paradoxes. According to this hypothesis, physics in or near [[closed timelike curves]] (time machines) can only be consistent with the universal laws of physics, and thus only self-consistent events can occur. Anything a time traveller does in the past must have been part of history all along, and the time traveller can never do anything to prevent the trip back in time from happening, since this would represent an inconsistency. Novikov et al. used the example given by physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] for the grandfather paradox, of a billiard ball heading towards a time machine: the ball's older self emerges from the time machine and strikes its younger self so its younger self never enters the time machine. Novikov et al. showed how this system can be solved in a self-consistent way which avoids the grandfather paradox, though it creates a causal loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

Norton|location=New York|isbn=0393312763}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|510–511}} Some physicists suggest that causal loops only exist in the quantum scale, in a fashion similar to the [[chronology protection conjecture]] proposed by [[Stephen Hawking]], so histories over larger scales are not looped.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;{{rp|517}} Another conjecture, the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]], suggests that every closed timelike curve passes through an [[event horizon]], which prevents such causal loops from being observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|title=Traversable wormholes: The Roman ring|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 April 1997|volume=55|issue=8|pages=5212–5214|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212|arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth Lloyd and other researchers at MIT have proposed an expanded version of the Novikov principle, according to which probability bends to prevent paradoxes from occurring. Outcomes would become stranger as one approaches a forbidden act, as the universe must favor improbable events to prevent impossible ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Laura|title=Physicists Tame Time Travel by Forbidding You to Kill Your Grandfather|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/07/time-travel-2/|website=WIRED|accessdate=2017-01-02|date=2010-07-20|quote=But this dictum against paradoxical events causes possible unlikely events to happen more frequently. 'If you make a slight change in the initial conditions, the paradoxical situation won’t happen. That looks like a good thing, but what it means is that if you’re very near the paradoxical condition, then slight differences will be extremely amplified,' says Charles Bennett of IBM’s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] has argued that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=David|authorlink=David Deutsch|title=Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 November 1991|volume=44|issue=10|pages=3197–3217|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers published a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name="Ringbauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringbauer|first1=Martin|last2=Broome|first2=Matthew A.|last3=Myers|first3=Casey R.|last4=White|first4=Andrew G.|last5=Ralph|first5=Timothy C.|title=Experimental simulation of closed timelike curves|journal=Nature Communications|date=19 June 2014|volume=5|page=4145|doi=10.1038/ncomms5145|pmid=24942489|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4145R|arxiv=1501.05014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch uses the terminology of "multiple universes" in his paper in an effort to express the quantum phenomena, but notes that this terminology is unsatisfactory. Others have taken this to mean that "Deutschian time travel" involves multiple universes in order to resolve the grandfather paradox.&lt;ref name="Billings"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lee Billings|title=Time Travel Simulation Resolves 'Grandfather Paradox'|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|accessdate=24 September 2014|agency=Scientific American|date=2 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC (closed timelike curve) fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31087">'''Implicit self-esteem''' refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with ''explicit self-esteem'', which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit and implicit self-esteem are constituents of [[self-esteem]].

==Overview==
Implicit self-esteem has been specifically defined as "the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self-attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects".&lt;ref name="social cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, selfesteem, and stereotypes | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 | pmid=7878162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because by definition implicit self-esteem may not be accessible to conscious introspection, measures of implicit do not rely on direct self-reports, but rather infer the valence of associations with the self through other means.

The vast majority of implicit self-esteem measures suggest that an individual's self-evaluation spills over to self-related objects. Also, these measures reveal that people, on average, have positive self-evaluations. The overestimation of one's traits and abilities is argued to be a spillover of positive affect from the self to objects associated with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Farnham, D. S., Greenwald, G. A., &amp; Banaji, M. N. (1999) Implicit self-esteem. In D. Abrams &amp; M. Hogg(Eds.), Social identity and social cognition (pp. 230-248). Oxford, UK: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This "spillover" is automatic and unconscious. Implicit self-esteem therefore offers an explanation of positivity bias for things related to the self. [[Association (psychology)|Associations]] are especially important; implicit self-esteem is made up of a series of associations between the [[Self (psychology)|self]] and a positive or negative evaluation of the self. This is especially shown in measures of the [[Implicit Association Test]].

==Influencing factors==
Several researchers have suggested that levels of implicit self-esteem can be affected by [[evaluative conditioning]], through pairing of construct of the self with positive or negative stimuli, with the objective of altering attitude towards the self.&lt;ref name="likes and dislikes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Houwer | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = S. | last3 = Baeyens | first3 = F. | year = 2001 | title = Associative learning of likes and dislikes: A review of 25 years of research on human evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 853–869 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baccus | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = M.W. | last3 = Packer | first3 = D.J. | year = 2004 | title = Increasing implicit self-esteem through classical conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 498–502 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00708.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, social comparison, or more specifically the performance of people in one’s close social circle, can also affect implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = E. | last2 = Stukas | first2 = A.A. | year = 2011 | title = Narcissism and the self-evaluation maintenance model: Effects of social comparison threats on relationship closeness | url = | journal = The journal of social psychology | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 201–212 | doi=10.1080/00224540903510852}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information suggests that expectancies of social inclusion is a factor in self-evaluation.

===Evaluative conditioning===
The influence of evaluative conditioning on implicit self-esteem is analogous to the principles of classical conditioning on behavioral responses. Although the latter involves pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus repeatedly until presence of the neutral stimulus evokes the consequence of the unconditioned stimulus, evaluative conditioning involves pairing positive and negative stimulus with an internal construct- the self- to manipulate levels of implicit self-esteem.

The effectiveness of evaluative conditioning hinges on the understanding that implicit self-esteem is interpersonally associative in nature, and that there is a causal relationship between the self and positive/negative social feedback. Studies have shown that participants repeatedly exposed to pairings of self-relevant information with smiling faces showed enhanced implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem" /&gt;

In addition, studies have also found that pairing the word ‘I’ with positive traits heightens implicit self-esteem regardless of the level of temporal self-esteem prior to the conditioning process. Subliminal presentation of the stimuli reflected that implicit self-esteem is altered in the absence of consciousness. Given that evaluative conditioning changes attitude at a fundamental level and the evaluation that is automatically activated on encountering the attitude object, implicit self-esteem could be assessed as attitude towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = AP. | year = 2004 | title = I like myself but I don't know why: enhancing implicit self-esteem by subliminal evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 345–355 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.345 | pmid=14769089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social comparison===
The [[self-evaluation maintenance theory]] (SEM)  suggests that the success of one's partner or "[[significant other]]" in areas that are self-relevant can cause people to feel threatened, allowing comparison of one’s self to the self of another, impacting self-evaluation. Intimacy of relationships predicts likelihood of upward social comparison, which inevitably leads to lower implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"/&gt;

Given that the SEM is moderated by intimacy of relationship, its impact can be a prominent influential factor between romantic partners. Evidence shows that men tend to have lowered implicit self-esteem when their romantic partner succeeded than when they failed, automatically interpreting their romantic partner's success as their own failure. The underlying explanation might be that self-evaluation is driven by one's expectations around fulfillment of one's role as a man. Another explanation in line with the interpersonal nature of self-evaluation stems from the belief that women are attracted to men’s success. Hence, the perception of failure in a man could trigger his fear associated with acceptance from his significant other, as well as abandonment issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratliff | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Oishi | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Gender difference in implicit self-esteem following a romantic partner's success or failures | doi = 10.1037/a0033769| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 688–702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, studies of social comparison on implicit self-esteem has yielded the conclusion that comparisons with other individuals can impact one's self-esteem. In addition, these effects are greater when there is a close psychological identification with the partner with whom one is being compared.

==Consequences and correlations==
An individual's level of implicit self-esteem affects him or her in various crucial domains that are relevant to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being. In some cases, discrepancies between the implicit and explicit self-esteem effects affective well-being and are highly associated with clinical symptoms. Implicit self-esteem also determines how individuals approach relational conflicts and social settings. While low levels of implicit self-esteem can be erroneous, boosts in implicit self-esteem through mechanisms involved in narcissism can also impair an individual's performance in cognitive tasks and external representation of competence in occupational settings.

===Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem===
When explicit self-esteem is lower, it is called ''damaged self-esteem.''  When the implicit self-esteem is lower it is called ''defensive self-esteem.''

It has been found that individuals who tend to have a higher correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem, trust their intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Christian H. | last2 = Whitfield | first2 = Mervyn | last3 = Zeigler-Hill | first3 = Virgil | year = 2007 | title = Intuition and the correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1067–1079 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Damaged self-esteem====
Individuals with a combination of high implicit and low explicit self-esteem possess what psychologists call a ''damaged self-esteem''.

Study results indicate that, in comparison to individuals with low implicit and low explicit self-esteem, individuals with damaged self-esteem exhibit more optimism and less self-protection&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Spencer, Christian H. Jordan, Christine E.R. Logel, Mark P. Zanna: ''Nagging doubts and a glimmer of hope. The role of implicit self-esteem in self-image maintenance''. 2005. As cited by: {{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher levels of both maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate with many clinical symptoms and disorders. In particular, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem in the direction of a damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate positively with heightened symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While implicit self-esteem itself is not correlated with these internalizing symptoms, the interaction between implicit and explicit self-esteem does. In particular, when individuals display low explicit self-esteem, their level of implicit self-esteem becomes directly and positively correlated with their level of suicidal ideation. This reflects the crucial role of implicit self-esteem in internalizing problems. We can understand the impact of a damaged self-esteem as an entrapment between goals, which stem from implicit self-esteem, and reality, which mediates explicit self-esteem. Indeed, damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate with a maladaptive pattern of perfectionism, which is hinged upon rigidly high expectations that often contribute to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of damaged self-esteem also showed a relationship to the use of self-defeating humor as a coping strategy, however, the causal direction is unclear. It could be that the frequent use of self-defeating humor lead to the development of damaged self-esteem (e.g., through a downward spiral of social rejection), or, that people with damaged self-esteem are more likely to use self-defeating humor (i.e., in line with their uncomplimentary view of the self). Another alternative is that both self-defeating humor and damaged self-esteem are caused by a third variable, such as neuroticism or [[alexithymia]].&lt;ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate positively with internet addiction, the underlying mechanism of which parallels that of clinical conditions such as bulimia nervosa. This occurrence of compulsions may be attributed to an automatic defense mechanism in which the individual avoids anxiety. However, the development of a damaged self-esteem as an avoidance mechanism can also precipitate difficulties in establishing a consistent self-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stieger | first1 = S. | last2 = Burger | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem in the context of internet addiction | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 681–687 | doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0426 | pmid=21142993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defensive self-esteem====
Conversely, individuals with a combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem have what is called ''defensive self-esteem'' (or synonymously ''fragile self-esteem''). In a comparative study it was found that individuals with defensive self-esteem tended to be less forgiving than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eaton | first1 = Judy | last2 = Struthers | first2 = C. Ward | last3 = Shomrony | first3 = Anat | last4 = Santelli | first4 = Alexander G. | year = 2007 | title = When apologies fail: The moderating effect of implicit and explicit self-esteem on apology and forgiveness | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 2–3 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit self-esteem correlates===

====Social performance====
An important indicator of relationship stability and health is conflict behavior, the way individuals behave during a conflict. Peterson and DeHart found that implicit self-esteem can regulate connection during times of relationship crises. Studies suggest that individuals with high implicit self-esteem tend to engage more in nonverbal positive behaviors during conflict when they perceive their partners to be committed. Positive nonverbal behaviors during conflict is extremely predictive of relationship outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction and stability. Also, implicit self-esteem also predicts sensitivity towards partners’ availability or support, even within a relationship-threat. That is, individuals high in implicit self-esteem tend to be implicitly motivated to consciously correct for connection and sensitivity to their partners’ effort, despite explicitly doubting their investment in the relationship. This ability to overcome relationship-threats as perpetuated by high levels of implicit self-esteem is crucial to relational well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = J.L. | last2 = DeHart | first2 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Regulating connection: implicit self-esteem predicts positive non-verbal behavior during romantic relationship-threat | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 99–105 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, low implicit self-esteem has also been found to precipitate uncertainty in self-concept. This instability in grasping the self is especially erroneous in regulation of behaviors in social situations. It has been shown that uncertainty about the self makes people vulnerable to holding and expressing minority opinions, especially those who are susceptible to self-threat (low self-esteem). Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more self-diagnostic than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rios | first1 = K. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Miller | first3 = D.T. | year = 2012 | title = Compensatory and nonconformity: Self-uncertainty and low implicit self-esteem increase adoption and expression of minority opinions | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1300–1309 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to take extreme views and to over-estimate the social consensus for their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jordan | first2 = Christian H. | year = 2007 | title = The mask of zeal: Low implicit self-esteem, threat, and defensive extremism | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 223–237 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601115351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender role====
Gender differences play a vital role in implicit self-esteem in how it is influenced by the performance of the significant other.

Also, women are more prone to trust their feelings and intuition, in contrast to men.  The correlation between explicit and implicit self-esteem is greater for women then for men. Implicit self-esteem contains instinctive and empirical factors; then people who are in touch with their feelings, would report to have higher explicit self-esteem scores, which are consistent to implicit self-esteem scores. There were six studies that supported this idea, and these results were held in three diverse cultures, two unlike measures of implicit self-esteem.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} These ideas showed the correlation between implicit and explicit self-esteem. This is higher for women than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = Brett W. | last2 = Koole | first2 = Sander L. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = Curtis D. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = John J. | last5 = Seah | first5 = Eileen | last6 = DeHart | first6 = Tracy | year = 2005 | title = Gender moderates the relation between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 84–89 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive performance====
Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one’s own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty. Results like this suggest that a peak in unconscious positivity associated with the self may discount an individual’s efforts to further prove his worth in other areas. Consequently, this leaves an individual unmotivated to perform well in more practical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toma | first1 = C. L. | year = 2013 | title = Feeling better but doing worse: effects of Facebook self-presentation on implicit self-esteem and cognitive task performance | url = | journal = Media psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 199–220 | doi=10.1080/15213269.2012.762189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and assessment==
Implicit self-esteem is assessed using indirect measures of cognitive processing. These include the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sander L. |last1=Koole |first2=Brett W. |last2=Pelham |chapter=On the Nature of Implicit Self-Esteem: The Case of the Name Letter Effect |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJIKwXPZKg0C&amp;pg=PA93 |editors=Steven Spencer, [[Steven Fein]], Mark P. Zanna and James M. Olson |title=Motivated social perception |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum]] |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]] |year=2003 |pages=93–116 |isbn=0-8058-4036-2 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Implicit Association Test]].&lt;ref name="association test"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony G. |last1=Greenwald |first2=Shelly D. |last2=Farnham |title=Using the implicit association test to measure self-esteem and self-concept |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=1022–38 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11138752 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.1022 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Gwald_Farnham_JPSP_2000.OCR.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the [[self (psychology)|self]], such as personal pronouns (e.g., "I") or letters in one's name.

===Name-letter effect===
{{Main article|Name-letter effect}} 
The so-called Name Letter Task (NLT, also called Initial Preference Task, IPT) relies on the name-letter effect and is one of the widest used measures of implicit self-esteem. Different measures have been proposed in order to improve the psychometrical properties of the name letter task.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name-letter effect represents the idea that an individual prefers the letters belonging to their own name and will select these above other letters in choice tasks or rate them as more favourable or attractive than other letters in rating tasks. It seemingly occurs subconsciously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koole | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | last3 = van Knippenberg | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = What's in a name: Implicit self-esteem and the automatic self | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 669–685 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[mere-exposure effect]] ruled out as a possible explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Pelham | first2 = B. W. | last3 = Mirenberg | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = J. J. | year = 2002 | title = Name–letter preferences are not merely mere exposure: Implicit egotism as self-regulation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 170–177 | doi=10.1006/jesp.2001.1497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect has been found in a vast range of studies. In one such scenario, participants were given a list of letters, one of which contained letters from their own name and the other of which contained other letters, and asked them to circle the preferred letter. This study found that, even when accounting for all other variables, letters belonging to the participants' own names were preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nuttin | first1 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: The name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 353–361 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results have been found in cross-cultural studies, using different alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoorens | first1 = V. | last2 = Nuttin | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Herman | first3 = I. E. | last4 = Pavakanun | first4 = U. | year = 1990 | title = Mastery pleasure versus mere ownership: A quasi-experimental cross-cultural and cross alphabetical test of the name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 181–205 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420200302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note the difference between the name-letter effect and 'implicit egotism',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Carvallo | first2 = M. | last3 = Jones | first3 = J.T. | year = 2005 | title = Implicit egoism | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 106–110 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being attributed to the way people gravitate towards places, people and situations that reflect themselves, including perhaps similarities with their own name. Indeed, research into the topic has shown similarities between people's names and their future careers; for example, the names Dennis and Denise are overepresented among [[dentists]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelham, B.W., Mirenberg, M.C., &amp; Jones, J.T. (2002) Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions, Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit-association test===
{{Main article|Implicit-association test}} 
The implicit-association test is an experimental method used by psychologists to attempt to tap into a person's automatic, or [[subconscious]] association between a concept and an attribute.&lt;ref name="social cognition" /&gt; It has been widely used in an attempt to uncover a person's subconscious prejudices against certain members of society, such as those who are overweight, as well as other implicit stereotypes and associations. The test was formatted in order to measure [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="association test" /&gt; Participants are asked to make rapid responses, co-classifying themselves ("the self") and positive attributes, as well as negative attributes. The speed, or ease of these associations made is said to show a subconscious, or implicit preference for one attribute over another, with regards to the self.

====Findings====
Many studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karpinski | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = Measuring self-esteem using the implicit association test: The role of the other | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 22–34 | doi=10.1177/0146167203258835}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the vast majority of people's implicit self-esteem is positively biased. That is, people find it a great deal easier to associate themselves with a positive concept than a negative one. Whether this is truly displaying implicit self-esteem is arguable; the findings may instead be linked with [[illusory superiority]], in that people tend to rate themselves as above average on a number of scales.

'''Implicit self-esteem''' &lt;br&gt;
In the article "Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?",&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W. R. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the validity and reliability of seven implicit self-esteem measures have been explored. The implicit measures were not correlated with one another. However they did correlate, but only faintly with measures of explicit self-esteem.  The implicit self-esteem measurements confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities.  Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that measurements of implicit self-esteem are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research of implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"/&gt;

====Links with explicit self-esteem====
However, the validity of the implicit-association test and implicit self-esteem as a measure of [[self-esteem]] itself is questionable due to mixed evidence with regards to explicit self-esteem. On the one hand, researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J.K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W.B. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 631–649 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a detailed and comprehensive study of implicit self-esteem found the IAT to correlate weakly, yet consistently, with measures of explicit self-esteem. However, more recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudolph | first1 = A. | last2 = Schroder-Abe | first2 = M. | last3 = Schultz | first3 = A. | last4 = Gregg | first4 = A. P. | last5 = Sedikides | first5 = C. | year = 2008 | title = Through a glass, less darkly?

The '''infinity symbol''' {{math|∞|size=150%}} (sometimes called the [[lemniscate]]) is a [[List of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbol]] representing the concept of [[infinity]].

==History==
[[File:John Wallis by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Wallis]] introduced the infinity symbol to mathematical literature.]]

The shape of a sideways figure eight has a long pedigree; for instance, it appears in the cross of [[Saint Boniface]], wrapped around the bars of a [[Latin cross]].&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{citation|title=Cosmic Imagery: Key Images in the History of Science|first=John D.|last=Barrow|authorlink=John D. Barrow|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2008|isbn=9780393061772|contribution=Infinity: Where God Divides by Zero|pages=339–340|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRg6iN10JCIC&amp;pg=PA339}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Wallis]] is credited with introducing the infinity symbol with its mathematical meaning in 1655, in his ''De sectionibus conicis''.&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03M_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 |title=De sectionibus conicis nova methodo expositis tractatus - John Wallis - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}} See e.g. Prop.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Wallis did not explain his choice of this symbol, but it has been conjectured to be a variant form of a [[Roman numeral#Large numbers|Roman numeral]] for 1,000 (originally CIƆ, also CƆ), which was sometimes used to mean "many", or of the Greek letter&amp;nbsp;ω ([[omega]]), the last letter in the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A brief history of infinity: the quest to think the unthinkable|first=Brian|last=Clegg|publisher=Robinson|year=2003|isbn=9781841196503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euler's infinity sign.svg|thumb|Symbol used by Euler to denote infinity]]
[[Leonhard Euler]] used an open variant of the symbol&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cor. 1 p. 174 in:  Leonhard Euler.  Variae observationes circa series infinitas. Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 9, 1744, pp. 160-188. [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E072.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to denote "absolutus infinitus". Euler freely performed various operations on infinity, such as taking its logarithm. This symbol is not used anymore, and is not encoded as a separate character in Unicode.

==Usage==
In mathematics, the infinity symbol is used more often to represent a [[potential infinity]],&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt; rather than to represent an actually infinite quantity such as the [[ordinal number]]s and [[cardinal number]]s (which use other notations). For instance, in the mathematical notation for [[summation]]s and [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]s such as
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2^x-1}{2^{x-1}} = 2,&lt;/math&gt;
the infinity sign is conventionally interpreted as meaning that the variable grows arbitrarily large (towards infinity) rather than actually taking an infinite value.

The infinity symbol may also be used to represent a [[point at infinity]], especially when there is only one such point under consideration. This usage includes, for instance,
the infinite point of a [[projective line]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Geometry: An Introduction|first=Daniel|last=Perrin|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9781848000568|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vn1yR9qPvlMC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the point added to a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to form its [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|first1=Charalambos D.|last1=Aliprantis|first2=Kim C.|last2=Border|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9783540295877|pages=56–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vyXtR3vUhoC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas other than mathematics, the infinity symbol may take on other related meanings; for instance, it has been used in [[bookbinding]] to indicate that a book is printed on [[acid-free paper]] and will therefore be long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A handbook for the study of book history in the United States|first1=Ronald J.|last1=Zboray|first2=Mary Saracino|last2=Zboray|publisher=Center for the Book, Library of Congress|year=2000|isbn=9780844410159|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern symbolism==
[[File:RWS Tarot 08 Strength.jpg|thumb|The infinity symbol appears on several cards of the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider–Waite]] [[tarot]] deck]]

In modern mysticism, the infinity symbol has become identified with a variation of the [[ouroboros]], an ancient image of a snake eating its own tail that has also come to symbolize the infinite, and the ouroboros is sometimes drawn in figure-eight form to reflect this identification, rather than in its more traditional circular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities|first=Wendy Doniger|last=O'Flaherty|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1986|isbn=9780226618555|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhNNrX3bmo4C&amp;pg=PA243}}. The book also features this image on its cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the works of [[Vladimir Nabokov]], including ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'' and ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the figure-eight shape is used symbolically to refer to the [[Möbius strip]] and the infinite, for instance in these books' descriptions of the shapes of bicycle tire tracks and of the outlines of half-remembered people. The poem after which ''Pale Fire'' is entitled explicitly refers to "the miracle of the lemniscate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nabokov: The Mystery of Literary Structures|first=Leona|last=Toker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780801422119|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jud1q_NrqpcC&amp;pg=PA159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic design==
The well known shape and meaning of the infinity symbol have made it a common [[typography|typographic]] element of [[graphic design]]. For instance, the [[Métis flag]], used by the Canadian [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] in the early 19th century, is based around this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Native American Flags|first1=Donald T.|last1=Healy|first2=Peter J.|last2=Orenski|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2003|isbn=9780806135564|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern commerce, corporate logos featuring this symbol have been used by, among others, [[Room for PlayStation Portable]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], [[Fujitsu]], and [[CoorsTek]].

'''Intrinsic value''' exists wherever self-valuing beings exist &lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1996) "Forms of capital and intrinsic value," Chemosphere (1996) Vol. 33, No. 9, pp. 1801-1811. https://www.academia.edu/25475674/FORMS_OF_CAPITAL_AND_INTRINSIC_VALUES&lt;/ref&gt;. The intrinsic value of a human, or any other sentient animal, is the value it confers on itself by desiring its own lived experience as an end in itself. Because intrinsic value is self-ascribed, all animals have it, unlike instrumental or extrinsic values. Instrumental value is the value that others confer on an animal (or on any other entity) because of its value as a resource (e.g. as property, labour, food, fibre, 'ecosystem services') or as a source of emotional, recreational, aesthetic or spiritual gratification. Intrinsic values are conferred from within an animal, and are therefore not directly measurable by economists, while extrinsic values are conferred from outside and can, in principle, be measured econometrically.  

The phrase "intrinsic value" (often used synonymously with ''inherent value'') has been adopted by [[animal rights]] advocates. The Dutch ''Animal Health and Welfare Act'' referred to it in 1981: "Acknowledgment of the intrinsic value of animals means that animals have value in their own right and as a consequence their interests are no longer automatically subordinate to man's interests."&lt;ref&gt;Cock Buning, Tj. (2006). "Empirisch onderzoek naar morele oordeelsvorming bij genetische modificatie van dieren," ''NVBE Nieuwsbrief'', 13,3, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; This acknowledgement has stirred a debate on what it [[logical consequence|entails]] in the context of [[animal husbandry]], [[animal breeding]], [[vivisection]], [[animal testing]] and [[biotechnology]]. It is also used by environmental advocates and in law to holistically encompass the totality of intrinsic values in an ecosystem. Article 7(d) of New Zealand's ''Resource Management Act'' (RMA), for example, requires particular regard to be to given to "intrinsic values of ecosystems" &lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Parliament (1991) ''Resource Management Act'' http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/whole.html#DLM230267&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the moral status of animals (1880–1980) ==

Moral attitudes towards animals in the west (as expressed in public debate and legislation) have changed considerably over time. Britain's first anti-cruelty laws were introduced in the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]]. This was followed by similar laws in many other countries, especially in the second half of the 20th century. These laws did not challenge the idea that other animals are resources for human use and they only limited those acts of cruelty which (a) had few economic or social repercussions; and (b) were offensive to human sensibilities (the so-called [[Offence principle]]) or at odds with human dignity. These regulations were [[anthropocentric]] in character: they generally gave human economic and recreational interests, such as farming, fishing and blood sports, greater priority than animal suffering - that is they favoured the animals' instrumental values over their intrinsic ones. 

During the second half of the 20th century, the intensification of cattle breeding, the growth of pig and chicken factory farming and the increased use of animals in harmful laboratory experiments provoked fierce debates in which the negative consequences for the animals themselves became an issue. Notably during the 1960s and 1970s, pressure groups started to argue on behalf of the interests of animals kept in laboratories and farms. They expressed their discontent with laws that protected the institutional cruelty of the animal exploitation industries while only prohibiting selected acts of individual cruelty in certain situations. They called for new forms of legislation that would protect animals for non-[[anthropocentric]] reasons.

In these discussions (of the moral relevance of the animal's welfare) two key issues were involved. To begin with, the [[Harm principle]], rather than the [[Offence principle]], should be the moral foundation for the protection of animals. Secondly, as to the scepticism expressed by scientists regarding the presence of consciousness and self-awareness in animals, they should be granted the benefit of the doubt by adopting the so-called ''analogy postulate''. Applied [[ethology|ethological]] research into the behaviour of animals in captivity made it clear that the intensive use of animals had negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Nevertheless, concern for the well-being of animals had to be purged from [[anthropomorphism]] and [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. This point of view is taken for example in a report by the Dutch Federation of Veterinarians in the EEC (FVE, 1978) concerning welfare-problems among domestic animals. This document states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
although the interests of animals often conflict with the demands of society, society remains responsible for the welfare of the animals involved. Considerations regarding animal welfare ought to be based on veterinary, scientific and ethological norms, but not on sentiment. And although animals do not have fundamental rights, human beings have certain moral obligations towards them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Intrinsic value and animal ethics (1980–2000) ==
During the 1970s and 1980s, the criticism regarding the living conditions of farm and laboratory animals became mixed up with other social debates, notably the discussions concerning the protection of the (natural) environment and the ones concerning the development of new breeding techniques. Due to this broadening of the issues, other objections against the use of animals for scientific or economic reasons emerged. The instrumental use of the animals, it was said, is hard to reconcile with their ''intrinsic'' (or ''inherent'') value. In 1981 the Dutch government included the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]-argument in a statement concerning the protection of animals (CRM, 1981). Now a principle was formulated that allowed for the possibility that, in some cases, the interests of animals might prevail over and above those of science and industry. The interests of the animal involved health and well-being as experienced by the animals themselves, independent from considerations concerning their suitability for human use. It was now claimed that animals have an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], that is a ''good-of-their-own'', and an interest in their own well-being.

Developments within the field of biotechnology broadened the scope of the debate on the moral status of animals even more. After the controversy concerning the transgenic bull Herman and the [[lactoferrin]] project of GenePharming, modern biotechnology has almost become a synonym for [[genetic engineering]]. In the debate on bull Herman, concern for the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals became an issue in its own right. Many felt that there was more to [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] than merely the concern for the animal's welfare. Since then, [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] not only refers to the animal's welfare, but also to the moral attitude society takes towards animals (or nature) as such. For some, this stance means a return to the [[Offence principle]], and therefore not helpful in the struggle against [[anthropocentrism]] or [[anthropomorphism]]. Others however maintain that recognition of the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals goes beyond [[animal welfare]], since it respects the animal as "centre of its own being".

== Analysis of the term ''intrinsic value'' ==
The cause of much confusion in the discussion over [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] in relation to the moral status of animals, is the diversity of meanings and connotations associated with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. Broadly speaking there are 4 main positions in this debate defining [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. One can adhere to a meaning of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals in a sense that is:&lt;ref&gt;van der Tuuk, Edward. "Intrinsic value &amp; the struggle against anthropocentrism," in Dol, Marcel et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l74rq21v5846474t/ ''Recognizing the Intrinsic Value of Animals''], APS, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1999, chapter 2, pp. 29–37. {{ISBN|90-232-3469-3}}&lt;!--it is the book or the article that is being referenced here?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]], as a ''morally neutral'' value that the animal's ''own'' (hence ''intrinsic'') species-specific behaviour seeks to satisfy. Ethologists like [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Gerard Baerends]] refer in this context to [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-values]] (see also [[ethology]])
* [[utilitarian]], as a ''formal'' basis to grant animals ''specific'' rights, based upon the idea of [[sentience]] and ''interests'', defined by [[ethology|ethological]] knowledge, and defines corresponding human obligations (see also [[Peter Singer]]'s ideas about [[Equal consideration of interests]])
* [[deontological]], as respect for the animal's ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or [[Conatus|striving]] and consequential ''fundamental'' rights (see also [[Tom Regan]]'s ideas about ''inherent value'' and [[Tom_Regan#Animal_rights|animal rights]])
* [[respect|attitudinal]], as ''[[prima facie]]'' respect for all living beings, regardless of qualities like [[sentience]] (see also [[Reverence for Life]] and [[Ethical intuitionism]] and [[Moral sense theory]])

Of the first, [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]] interpretation, one can say (since it is ''morally neutral'') that it is useless to ethical theory. Of the fourth, attitudinal or intuitionistic interpretation, one can say that it is indiscriminate of sentience or interests, and could be used for any kind of (natural, cultural or abstract) entity worth protecting (including species, cultures, languages, historical buildings or sites, etc.). [[Animal_welfare#Animal_welfare_compared_with_animal_rights|The core issue in the debate over intrinsic value of animals remains between utilitarianists and deontologists]].

{{unreferenced|date=June 2015}}

Each clue in a [[Jumble]] word puzzle is a word that has been “jumbled” by permuting the letters of each word to make an [[anagram]]. A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles.

==Computerized solution==
Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word.

First algorithm:

# Begin
# Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
# Sort the letters of J in alphabetical order, preserving duplicates
# Look up sorted letters in a hash table, initialised with a dictionary, that maps a sorted set of letters to unscrambled words
# Print the set of words, which is W
# End

Second algorithm:

#Begin
#Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
#Frame a word list Y with all [[permutation]]s of J
#For each word in Y check if the word is existing in the dictionary
#If a match is found then collect it in word list W
#Print the words in W
# End

Algorithm to find the [[permutation]]s of J:

#Begin 
#Initialize a string with first character of J denoted by J(1)
#Add the second character of J denoted by J(2) on either side of J(1) to get two strings&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)'''J(2)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

'''J(2)'''J(1)

#Add the third character of J denoted by J(3) on either side and in between the above 2 strings to get 6 strings&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)J(2)'''J(3)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)'''J(3)'''J(2)

&lt;!--
--&gt;

'''J(3)'''J(1)J(2)

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(2)J(1)'''J(3)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(2)'''J(3)'''J(1)

&lt;!--
 --&gt;

'''J(3)'''J(2)J(1)

#In the same way add J(4) to each of the above strings in either sides and between two characters to get 24 strings
#Continue this until all the characters are completed

Though the algorithm looks complex it is easy to program.

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] developed a program called [[Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies|Jumbo]] that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would.
The program doesn't rely on a dictionary and doesn't try to find real English words, but rather words that could be English, exploiting a database of plausibilities for various combinations of letters.
Letters are combined non-deterministically, following a strategy inspired by chemical reactions and free associations.

[[File:Mars Polar Lander in aeroshell.jpg|thumb|Mars Polar Lander prep]]
A '''lander''' is a [[spacecraft]] which descends toward and comes to rest on the surface of an [[astronomical body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ball, Garry, Lorenz and Kerzhanovich | title = Planetary Landers and Entry Probes | url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1170279/?site_locale=en_GB | year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast with an impact probe, which makes a [[hard landing]] and is damaged or destroyed so ceases to function after reaching the surface, a lander makes a [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] after which the probe remains functional.

For bodies with [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]], the [[landing]] occurs after [[atmospheric reentry|atmospheric entry]]. In these cases, landers may employ [[parachute]]s to slow down and to maintain a low terminal velocity. Sometimes small landing [[rocket]]s are fired just before [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] to reduce the impact velocity. Landing may be accomplished by [[attitude control|controlled descent]] and setdown on [[Spacecraft lander landing gear|landing gear]], with the possible addition of a [[Philae (spacecraft)|post-landing attachment mechanism]] for celestial bodies with low gravity. Some missions (for example, [[Luna 9]] and [[Mars Pathfinder]]), used inflatable [[airbag]]s to cushion the lander's impact rather than a more traditional landing gear.

When a high velocity impact is planned not for just achieving the surface but for study of consequences of impact, the spacecraft is called an impactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Phil Davis |author2=Kirk Munsell | title=Deep Impact Legacy Site: Technology – Impactor | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/deepimpact/tech/impactor.cfm | work=Solar System Exploration | publisher=NASA / JPL| date=23 January 2009 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial bodies]] have been subject of lander or impactor exploration: among them Earth's [[Moon]], the planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]], and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the Saturn moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s.

==Landers==

=== Lunar ===
{{main|Moon landing}}
[[File:Lunar surface shortly after landing, Apollo 16.jpg|thumb|right|The lunar surface through an Apollo Lunar Module window shortly after landing.]]
[[File:Surveyor 3 on Moon.jpg|thumb|Surveyor 3 on the Moon.]]
Beginning with [[Luna 2]] in 1959, the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors, not landers. They were part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna program]] or the [[United States|American]] [[Ranger program]].

In 1966, the Soviet [[Luna 9]] became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth. The American [[Surveyor program]] (since 1966) was designed to determine where Apollo could land safely. As a result, these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer, which was unknown before Surveyor.

The U.S. manned [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s (since 1969) with rovers (since 1971) and Soviet unmanned late big landers (since 1969), [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]]s (since 1970) and [[sample return mission]]s (since 1970) used a [[rocket]] descent engine for a soft landing of astronauts and lunar rovers on the Moon.

The [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] spacecraft, previously known as the "Lunar Surface Access Module" or "LSAM", was the planned lander for the [[Constellation program]], prior to the cancellation of Project Constellation.

{{asof |2012 |8}} NASA is developing vehicles that use a [[rocket]] descent engine permitting them land on the Moon and other locations. These vehicles include the [[Mighty Eagle lander]] and the [[Morpheus lander]]. The [[Project Morpheus]] lander may have sufficient thrust to propel a manned ascent stage.

Russia has plans for [[Luna-Grunt]] mission to return samples from the Moon by 2021.

The Chinese [[Chang'e 3]] mission and its Jade Rabbit rover landed on 14 December 2013. Then China plans to repeat lander with rover in [[Chang'e 4]] mission after 2015 that will followed by [[Chang'e 5]] and [[Chang'e 6]] sample return missions in 2017 and before 2020.

=== Venus ===
{{main|Venus#Exploration}}
The Soviet [[Venera program]] included a number of [[Venus]] landers, some of which were crushed during descent much as Galileo's Jupiter "lander" and others of which successfully touched down. [[Venera 3]] in 1966 and [[Venera 7]] in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on Venus. The Soviet [[Vega program]] also placed in 1985 two balloons in the Venusian atmosphere, they were the first aerial tools on other planets.

=== Mars ===
{{main|Mars landing}}
{{see also|Mars rover|Mars sample return mission}}

The Soviet Union's [[Mars 1962B]] was the first Earth based mission intended to reach the surface as impact on Mars in 1962. In 1971, the lander of the [[Mars 3]] probe conducted the first [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] on Mars, but communication was lost within a minute after touchdown, which occurred during one of the worst global dust storms since the beginning of telescopic observations of the Red Planet. Three other landers, [[Mars 2]] in 1971 and [[Mars 5]], [[Mars 6]] in 1973, either crashed or failed to even enter the planet's atmosphere. All four landers used an aeroshell-like heat shield during [[Mars atmospheric entry|atmospheric entry]]. Mars 2 and Mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking [[Mars rover|Martian]] [[Rover (space exploration)|rovers]] that did not work on the planet.

The Soviet Union planned the heavy [[Marsokhod]] [[Mars 4NM]] mission (in 1973) [[Mars sample return mission|Mars sample return]] [[Mars 5NM]] mission (in 1975) but they did not occur due to need of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 superlauncher]] that was never flown successfully. A double-launching Soviet [[Mars 5M|Mars 5M (Mars-79)]] sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems.

{{Wide image|Mars Viking 12a001.png|800px|First "clear" image ever transmitted from the surface of [[Mars]] – shows [[List of rocks on Mars#Viking|rocks]] near the ''[[Viking 1]]'' Lander (July 20, 1976).}}  
[[Viking program|Viking 1 and 2]] were launched respectively in August and September 1975, each comprising an orbiter vehicle and a lander. Viking 1 landed in July 1976 and Viking 2 in September 1976. The Viking rovers were the first successful, working Mars landers. The mission ended in May 1983, after both landers had died.

In the 1970s, the US planned the [[Voyager program (Mars)|Voyager-Mars]] mission. This would have consisted of two orbiters and two landers, launched by a single [[Saturn V]] rocket, but the mission was cancelled.

[[Mars 96]] was the first complex post-Soviet Russian mission with an orbiter, lander and penetrators. Planned for 1996, it failed at launch. A planned repeat of this mission, [[Mars 98]], was cancelled due to lack of funding.
   
The U.S. [[Mars Pathfinder]] was launched in December 1996 and released the first acting [[Mars rover|rover on Mars]], named ''Sojourner'', in July 1997. It failed in September 1997, probably due to electronics failure caused by the cold temperatures. Mars Pathfinder was part of the cancelled [[Mars Environmental Survey]] program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999–2009.

[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|The lander which brought the [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'' rover]] to the surface of [[Mars]].]]  
The [[Mars Polar Lander]] ceased communication on 3 December 1999, prior to reaching the surface, and is presumed to have crashed.
 
The European [[Beagle 2]] lander deployed successfully from the [[Mars Express]] spacecraft but the signal confirming a landing which should have come on 25 December 2003 was not received. Indeed, no communication was ever established and ''Beagle 2'' was declared lost on 6 February 2004. The proposed 2009 British [[Beagle 3]] lander mission to search for life, past or present was not adopted.

The French/ESA [[NetLander]] mission for 2007 or 2009, with an orbiter and 4 landers, was cancelled because it was too expensive. Its successor, [[Mars MetNet]], a multi-lander mission for 2011–2019 was not adopted by the ESA.

The American [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'']] and [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'']] were launched in June and July 2003. They reached the Martian surface in January 2004 using landers featuring airbags and parachutes to soften impact. ''Spirit'' ceased functioning in 2010, more than five years past its design lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20090810a.html|title=Meteorite Found on Mars Yields Clues About Planet's Past|date=10 August 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2017, ''Opportunity'' remains active, having exceeded its three-month design lifetime by well over a decade.&lt;ref name="nasaStatus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_opportunityAll.html | title=Opportunity Status | publisher=NASA | work= | date= |accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The U.S. [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix spacecraft]] successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of Mars on May 25, 2008, using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines.

[[Mars Science Laboratory]] (''Curiosity'') was successfully launched by [[NASA]] on November 26, 2011. It landed in the [[Aeolis Palus]] region of [[Gale Crater]] on Mars on August 6, 2012.

Planned for 2018, NASA's [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher]] lander mission was cancelled due to budget cuts.

[[Exploration of Mars#Future missions|Exploration of Mars]] including the use of landers continues to this day. Amongst them, Russia has planned a Mars sample return mission [[Mars-Grunt]] for near 2026, and China for near 2030.

=== Martian moons ===
{{main|Moons of Mars#Exploration by spacecraft|}}
While several flybys conducted by Mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the Martian moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites. Two probes under the Soviet [[Phobos program]] were successfully launched in 1988, but in 1989 the intended landings on Phobos and Deimos were not conducted due to failures in the spacecraft system. The post-Soviet Russian [[Fobos-Grunt]] probe was an intended [[sample return mission]] to Phobos in 2012 but failed after launch in 2011.

In 2007 [[European Space Agency]] and [[EADS Astrium]] proposed and developed the mission to Phobos to 2016 with lander and sample return, but it stayed as project. Since 2007 the [[Canadian Space Agency]] considering the mission to Phobos PRIME (Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration) with orbiter and lander.

===Titan ===
{{main|Titan (moon)#Observation and exploration}}
[[File:Huygens surface color.jpg|thumb|right|Surface of Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] as seen by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] after landing in 2005]]

The [[Huygens probe|''Huygens'' probe]], carried to [[Saturn]]'s [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] by the [[Cassini probe|''Cassini'']], was specifically designed to survive landing on land and on liquid. It was thoroughly drop-tested to make sure it could withstand impact and continue functioning for at least three minutes. However, due to the low speed impact, it continued providing data for more than two hours after it landed. The landing on Titan in 2005 was the first landing on planet's satellites outside the Moon.

The proposed U.S. [[Titan Mare Explorer|TiME]] mission considered a lander that would splash down in a lake in Titan's northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for few months. Spain's proposed [[Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer|TALISE]] mission is similar to TIME lander but has its own propulsion system for controlling shipping.

===Comets and asteroids===
{{main|Asteroid#Exploration|Comet#Spacecraft missions}}
[[Vesta (spacecraft)|Vesta]], the multiaimed Soviet mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding, included the flyby of Mars with delivering the aerostat and small landers or penetrators followed by flybys of [[1 Ceres]] or [[4 Vesta]] and some other [[asteroid]]s with impact of large penetrator on the one of them.

The cancelled NASA's [[Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby]] mission considered the launch in 1995 and landing of penetrators on comet's nucleus in 2001.

The first landing on a similarly small body, the [[asteroid]] [[433 Eros]], was performed in 2001 by the probe [[NEAR Shoemaker]] despite the fact that NEAR was not originally designed to be capable of landing.

The [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|''Hayabusa'']] probe made several attempts to land on [[25143 Itokawa]] in 2005 with mixed success, including a failed attempt to deploy a [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]. Meanwhile, it was the second lander on asteroid and in 2010 the first sample returm mission from asteroid.

The [[Rosetta space probe|''Rosetta'' probe]], launched 2 March 2004, put the first robotic lander ''[[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]]'' on [[comet]] [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] on 12 November 2014. Due to the extremely low gravity of such bodies, the landing system includes a harpoon launcher intended to anchor a cable in the surface and pull it down.

Japan ([[JAXA]]) launched the [[Hayabusa 2]] asteroid space probe in 2014 to deliver several landing parts (including Minerva II and German MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout) landers and SCI (Small Carry-on Impactor) penetrator) in 2018–2019 and to return samples to Earth by 2020.

NASA launched the [[OSIRIS-REx]] sample return mission to asteroid [[101955 Bennu]] in 2016.

[[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] is a mission concept of ESA to investigate the effects of impact crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid.

ESA proposed the [[Marco Polo (spacecraft)|Marco Polo]] and then [[MarcoPolo-R]] sample return missions in near 2020 from the surface of a [[Near Earth asteroid]] but these missions were not adopted.

The [[China National Space Administration|Chinese Space Agency]] is designing a sample retrieval mission from Ceres that would take place during the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.nssc.cas.cn/ns/NU/201410/W020141016603613379886.pdf China's Deep-space Exploration to 2030 by Zou Yongliao Li Wei Ouyang Ziyuan Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury ===
{{main|Exploration of Mercury}}
Scheduled to launch in October 2018 and expected to reach Mercury in December 2025, [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[BepiColombo]] mission to [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] originally included the [[Mercury Surface Element]]. The MSE lander would have carried a 7&amp;nbsp;kg payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer, a magnetometer, a seismometer, a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro-rover. The MSE aspect of the mission was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints.[http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Press_Releases/Critical_decisions_on_Cosmic_Vision]

=== Moons of Jupiter ===
{{main|Exploration of Jupiter|Moons of Jupiter#Exploration by spacecraft}}
A few [[Jupiter]] probes provides many images and other data about its moons. Some proposed missions with landing on Jupiter's moons were cancelled or no adopted. The small nuclear-powered [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] lander was proposed as part of NASA's [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter|JIMO]] mission that cancelled in 2006.
[[File:JIMO Europa Lander Mission.jpg|thumb|Concept for a Europa lander]]
Currently planning by ESA to launch in 2022 [[Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer|JUICE]] mission includes Russian [[Ganymede Lander]] on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] that would make a soft landing near 2033. NASA proposed ESA to include a lander or impactor on Europa under [[Europa Clipper]] mission planning to launch in 2025. As [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is very interesting and [[Europa (moon)#Exploration|need to be investigate]] for [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] (by [[extraterrestrial life]]) and assess its [[Astrobiology|astrobiological]] potential by confirming the existence and determining the characteristics of water within and below Europa's icy shell, despite of high radiation environment around itself and Jupiter troubling for any robotic surface mission, the Europa Lander Mission of NASA still considering and have led to steady lobbying for future missions. Russian [[Laplace-P|Europa Lander]] was proposed to include as part of now cancelled joint NASA/ESA [[Europa Jupiter System Mission – Laplace|EJSM/Laplace]] mission and then stays planning for realisation in any other or separate mission. Also, another proposal calls for a large [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] "melt probe" ([[cryobot]]) that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below where it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle ([[AUV|hydrobot]]) that would gather information.

==Impactors==
[[File:Deep Impact HRI.jpeg|thumb|The collision of comet [[Tempel 1|9P/Tempel]] and the [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|''Deep Impact'' probe]]]]

===''Deep Space 2''===
The [[Deep Space 2]] impactor probe was to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet. However the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship, [[Mars Polar Lander]] after communication was lost after entry into Mars atmosphere on 3 December 1999.

===''Deep Impact'' ===
Comet [[Tempel 1]] was visited by NASA's [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|''Deep Impact'']] probe on 4 July 2005. The [[impact crater]] formed was approximately 200 m wide and 30–50 m deep, and detected  the presence of [[silicate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[smectite]], [[amorphous carbon]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.

===''Moon Impact Probe''===
{{main|Moon Impact Probe}} 
The '''Moon Impact Probe''' ('''MIP''') developed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)]], [[India]]'s national space agency, was a [[moon|lunar]] probe that was released on 14 November 2008 by ISRO's [[Chandrayaan-1]] [[Exploration of the Moon|lunar remote sensing]] orbiter which in turn was launched, on 22 October 2008. It discovered the [[Lunar water|presence of water on the Moon]].&lt;ref name="Water found"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mip-detected-water-on-moon-way-back-in-june-isro-chairman/article24854.ece | title=MIP detected water on Moon way back in June: ISRO Chairman | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=September 25, 2009 | accessdate=2013-06-09 | location=Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India first"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/1292942/report-chandrayaan-first-discovered-water-on-moon-but | title=Chandrayaan first discovered water on moon, but? | work=[[Daily News and Analysis|DNA]] | date=Sep 25, 2009 | agency=DNA | accessdate=2013-06-09 | location=Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Landstände''''' (singular ''Landstand'') or '''''Landtage''''' (singular ''Landtag'') were the various [[estates of the realm|territorial estates or diets]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], as opposed to their respective [[territorial lord]]s (the ''Landesherrn'').

== Usage ==
The structure of the ''Landstände'' was highly variable depending on the country and period of history. Furthermore, both the representatives of the older system, the ''Ständeordnung'', where the estates were predominant, and the parliaments of the newer people's representative systems were called ''Landstände''. The term ''Landtag'' was used, both under the ''Ständeordnung'' as well as the newer representative structures, for a general assembly of the estates or the parliament. The totality of the ''Landstände'' in a sovereign territory was also called the ''Landschaft''.

In the older feudal system the estates originally consisted of the assembly of deputies of the privileged estates of a country, the [[nobility]] and the [[clergy]], who had joined together to form an organised body. Later, representatives of the towns were added. In some cases (for example, in [[Vienna]], [[Württemberg]] or [[Mecklenburg]]) [[yeomen]] (''Freibauer'') were also given the right to participate as representatives of the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref name="Herders"&gt;Herders Conversations-Lexikon. Freiburg im Breisgau 1855, Vol. 3, p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual exception were the estates in the land of [[Land Hadler|Hadler]], which were formed almost exclusively of the farmers of large farms (''Großbauer'').&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Rüther: „Hadler Chronik. Quellenbuch zur Geschichte des Landes Hadeln.“ 1932. Neu heraus gegeben Bremerhaven 1979. pp. 37 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''Landtage'' the ''Landstände'' were divided into separate ''curiae'' (divisions). As a rule, three ''curiae'' were usually distinguished: the [[prelate]]s, the [[knight]]s and the [[town]]s.&lt;ref name="Götzinger"&gt;Götzinger, E.: Reallexicon der Deutschen Altertümer. Leipzig, 1885., pp. 943-944.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early ''Landstände'' initially only represented the rights of their own estate and could only indirectly be considered to represent the whole population in their domain at the same time. In the ''Ständeordnungen'', unlike [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] systems of rule, the prince could not raise new taxes or adopt new laws outside his own personal estate (''chamber goods'' or ''Kämmergüter'') without the consent of the ''Landstände''.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; In some cases, the estates also shared in the administration of justice and other public affairs. The limits of their powers were not usually accurately determined.

Sometimes the term ''Landstände'' was retained even for the constitutional assemblies of newer representative systems, which in many countries took the place of the privileged assemblies of the ''Ständeordnung'' during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Michael EHRLE: Volksvertretung im Vormärz. Studien zur Zusammensetzung, Wahl und Funktion der deutschen Landtage im Spannungsfeld zwischen monarchischem Prinzip und ständischer Repräsentation, 2 Bde., Frankfurt a. M., 1979 [=Europ. Hochschulschriften III/127].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Precursor ===
The ''Landstände'' first emerged in the 14th century, although the term itself was not used in [[Middle High German]] and was probably first translated later from the [[French language|French]] word ''états''.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;  But it was not a new concept. The records of the Roman historian, [[Tacitus]], show that co-determination was already being practised in the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] at important public occasions. And according to the old Germanic law, public meetings and court hearings - the so-called ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]'' - were held, in the open. Even in the later [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], alongside the general assemblies of the [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], so-called ''[[placita]]'' are recorded; a form of representation of the people.

In individual tribes, for example the [[Bavaria]]ns and [[Saxons]], there were such meetings too. However, these gatherings did not represent a formal grouping of the estates, as had evolved by the 14th century. Even the [[Hoftag|imperial and knightly assemblies]] and the state ''things'' of the 12th and 13th centuries were structures that dealt with the general welfare of the land, but these meetings still lacked the character of an independent body.

=== Entstehung der Landstände ===
Seit dem 14. Jahrhundert bildeten sich mit der Entwicklung der [[Landeshoheit]] und mit der festeren [[Territorialisierung|Begrenzung des Territorialbestandes]] der einzelnen Herrschaften die eigentlichen Landstände aus den eingesessenen Herren, [[Vasall]]en und [[Ministeriale]]n heraus.&lt;ref name="Pierer"&gt;Pierer's Universal-Lexikon, Band 10. Altenburg 1860, S. 91-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Diese fingen an, sich über ihre Rechte und Freiheiten von den Landesherrn urkundliche Zusicherungen erteilen zu lassen und schlossen untereinander Bündnisse zur Wahrung ihrer eigenen Rechte und Freiheiten.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;

Für den Zusammenschluss zu festen Organisationen bestanden verschiedene Gründe. Zum einen verlangten die Landesherren jetzt häufig Steuern und die größeren Grundbesitzer, wollten sich von dem Landesherrn bestimmtere Versprechungen über die künftige Anlegung der Steuern geben lassen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Zum anderen waren Streitigkeiten über [[Sukzession]]sverhältnisse, der Übergang des Landes an einen neuen Herrn oder die Wiedervereinigung getrennter Landesteile Veranlassung zur Bildung einer festen Vereinigung.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus den dabei gewonnenen Privilegien bildete sich nach und nach eine Summe von Landesfreiheiten der Landstände gegenüber den Landesherren heraus.

Im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert wuchs der Einfluss der Landstände. Die [[Landesherr]]en waren wegen der Beschränktheit ihrer eigenen Mittel oft auf die Unterstützung ihrer Landstände angewiesen, womit diese an Bedeutung gewannen. Daher traten die Landstände im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert häufig sogar als wirkliche [[Mitregent]]en auf und beschäftigten sich mit allen wichtigeren Angelegenheiten, selbst solchen, die zunächst nur die fürstliche Familie angingen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus der ursprünglichen Pflicht der Vasallen, ihren Lehnsherrn in bestimmten Fällen mit besonderen Leistungen zu unterstützen, entwickelte sich das Steuerbewilligungsrecht der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Band 12. Leipzig 1908, S. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Es folgte die Gründung eigener landschaftlicher Kassen, in die zunächst die bewilligten Steuern eingezahlt wurden, um von da aus erst in die fürstlichen Kassen übergeführt zu werden. Für die Abwicklung setzten die Landstände vielfach ständig tagende Gremien (genannt Collegium, Ausschuss, Kommissariat, Verordnung usw.) ein und bauten repräsentative Gebäude.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45078 Maximilian Lanzinner, Landstände, in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niedergang der Landstände ===
Im 17. Jahrhundert begann durch den [[Dreißigjähriger Krieg|Dreißigjährigen Krieg]] der Niedergang der Landstände in den meisten deutschen Staaten.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Dieser setzte sich im 18. Jahrhundert fort.

Mit der wachsenden Macht des Landesfürstentums (gemäß den Vorstellungen des [[Absolutismus]]) und der Entwickelung eines fürstlichen Beamtenstandes sank die Macht der Landstände, die in vielen Territorien fast bedeutungslos wurde, in andern Gebieten aber auch im 18. Jahrhundert noch großen Einfluss auf die Landesverwaltung besaßen.&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt; Dazu trug besonders die völlige Veränderung des Kriegswesens bei, welche die Macht in den Händen der Landesherren konzentrierte. Zudem beschränkte die Reichsgesetzgebung die Selbständigkeit der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt;

In Württemberg erhielt sich ihre volle Wirksamkeit bis 1805.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Im [[Königreich Sachsen]] behielten die Landstände bis zur Einführung der konstitutionellen Verfassung 1831 ihre Vormachtstellung. In [[Geschichte Mecklenburgs|Mecklenburg]] konnten die Landstände sogar bis 1918 ihre Macht erhalten. In Niedersachsen existieren „[[Landschaften und Landschaftsverbände in Niedersachsen|Landschaften]]“ mit ständischer Verfassung bis heute fort.

The '''Looting of the Eastern Mausoleum''' was an incident in which some of the major [[mausoleum]]s of the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] in the [[Eastern Qing Tombs]] were looted by troops under the command of the warlord [[Sun Dianying]].

==Prelude==
In the early hours of June 8, 1928, warlord [[Sun Dianying]] led his army into the Eastern Mausoleums of the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[Malanyu]], northwest of [[Zunhua]], [[Hebei]]. This was the final resting place of the Qing emperors and empresses, and was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the [[Forbidden City]] of Peking. The 78-square-kilometer (30.1-square-mile) burial site was for five emperors, 15 empresses and 136 imperial [[concubine]]s within 15 tombs, including the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] (1638–61), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1654–1722), the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–99) and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (1835–1908).

==Looting operation==
On June 12, 1928, Sun Dianying ordered a large-scale graverobbing operation that removed almost all the underground funeral objects of the Huifeiling and Yuling Mausoleums and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling. Ma Futian, Regimental Commander in the 28th Army of [[Zhang Zuolin]], had quietly occupied Malanyu. Sun Dianying ordered [[Tan Wenjiang]], one of his division commanders, to capture the tomb area. At dawn on July 2, Ma Futian was driven away and Tan's army looted the mausoleums in Malanyu. After that, Sun's army went straight to the area of the Eastern Qing Tombs, pretending to engage in war exercises in the area. Tan Wenjiang placed policemen all around, denying access to the area and signs declared the army was "protecting the Tombs" to prevent interference.&lt;ref name="qing east"&gt;The Qing East Imperial Tombs http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/atam/115430.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[looting]] operation was directed by Sun Dianying from his car. Trucks were on hand to speed away with the loot as soon as they were loaded. At midnight the engineering corps blew up the entrance, opening the passage leading to the underground palace. The stone door was pried open to give access to the rear room of the grave. Sun gave first priority to officers above battalion commander level to collect treasure for themselves. Ordinary soldiers were eventually allowed to take the leftovers.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

The robbers first took the large treasure objects placed around the remains of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], such as [[jadeite]] watermelons, grasshoppers and vegetables, jade lotus and coral. They snatched objects found beneath the body and ravaged the corpse itself, taking her imperial robe; tearing off her undergarments, shoes and socks, and taking all the pearls and jewels on her body. The looters even pried open her jaws and took the rare pearl from her mouth. Ultimately, they looted the objects under the coffin that had been favorites of Cixi when she was alive.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

While Tan Wenjiang was robbing Cixi's tomb, Han Dabao, a brigade commander under Sun Dianying, led another group to the Yuling Mausoleum and declared his intention to conduct a war exercise. They blew the entrance and doorways of the underground palace and rushed into the tomb. The coffins of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] and his two empresses and three concubines were pried open, all the valuables looted and the skeletons thrown into the mud. The soldiers then rushed to the Yuling Mausoleum and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling and looted what they could.

Newspapers reported the graverobbing and the news spread throughout China and around the world. People were outraged. China's dethroned last emperor [[Puyi]], who had dismissed Sun from his post, sent telegrams to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[Yan Xishan]], Commander of Garrison Force in Beijing; the Central Committee of [[Kuomintang]] and local newspapers asking them to punish Sun Dianying severely. Many others also called for punishment. However, Sun Dianying bribed those who were in a position to discipline him and nothing was done.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

After removing the treasures from the graves, Sun and his army sealed the empty chambers with stones. They carted off some of China's greatest treasures, but some things could not be easily removed and the imposing buildings of the mausoleum still survive.&lt;ref name="Qing"&gt;Qing Tombs Tell Tales http://www.china-sd.net/eng/sdnews/listnews.asp?classid=159&amp;siteid=2483&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination (sidebar)}}
'''Lynching''' is a premeditated [[extrajudicial killing]] by a group.  It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, or to intimidate a group. It is an extreme form of informal group social control such as ''[[charivari]],'' [[skimmington]], [[Riding a rail|riding the rail]], and [[tarring and feathering]], and often conducted with the display of a public spectacle for maximum intimidation. It is to be considered an act of terrorism and punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701719807 | title=Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874–1947 | publisher=North Carolina University Press | author=Wood, Amy Louise | year=2009 | isbn=9780807878118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dennisrhidalgo.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/lynching-and-the-susquehannocks/ | title=Lynching and the Susquehannocks | publisher=Wordpress | work=Blog | date=November 27, 2013 | accessdate=28 November 2013 | author=Hidalgo, Dennis Ricardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in every society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Berg, Manfred &amp; Wendt, Simon |date=2011| title=Globalizing Lynching History: Vigilantism and Extralegal Punishment from an International Perspective| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| isbn= 978-0-230-11588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22984858 | title=Vigilantism and the state in modern Latin America : essays on extralegal violence | publisher=Praeger | author=Huggins, Martha Knisely | year=1991 | location=New York | isbn=0275934764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/657223792 | title=Lynching : American mob murder in global perspective | publisher=Ashgate | author=Thurston, Robert W. | year=2011 | location=Burlington, VT | isbn=9781409409083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynching in the United States|In the United States, lynchings]] of African Americans, typically by [[hanging]], became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era and especially during the decades on either side of the turn of the 20th century. At the time, Southern states were passing new constitutions and laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise African Americans]] and impose legal segregation and [[Jim Crow]] rule. Most lynchings were conducted by white mobs against black victims, often suspects taken from jail before they were tried by [[all-white juries]], or even before arrest. The political message—the promotion of [[white supremacy]] and black powerlessness—was an important element of the ritual. Lynchings were photographed and published as postcards, which were popular souvenirs in the U.S., to expand the intimidation of the acts.&lt;ref&gt;James Allen, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/without-sanctuary-lynching-photography-in-america/oclc/43312471 ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America''] , Santa Fe: Twin Palms Publishers, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moyers"/&gt; Victims were sometimes shot, burned alive, or otherwise tortured and mutilated in the public events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/27/news/mn-11152/2 "An Obsessive Quest to Make People See"].

Lynching and Spectacle: Witnessing Racial Violence in America, 1890-1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the West, other minorities—[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Mexicans]] and [[Asians]]—were also lynched. The South had the states with the highest total numbers of lynchings.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word "lynch" are obscure, but it likely originated during the [[American revolution]]. The verb comes from the phrase "Lynch Law", a term for a [[Extrajudicial punishment|punishment without trial]]. Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase: [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]] and [[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]], who both lived in Virginia in the 1780s. Charles Lynch has the better claim, as he was known to have used the term in 1782, while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later. There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men.&lt;ref name=quinion&gt;{{cite web |title=Lynch |author=Michael Quinion |work=World Wide Words |date=December 20, 2008 |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-lyn1.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1782, Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered "Lynch's law" to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] "for Dealing with Negroes, &amp;c."&lt;ref name =EAAH1&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Lynching and Mob Violence |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History 1619–1895 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York City |last=Waldrep |first=Christopher |editor-last=Finkleman  |editor-first=Paul |volume=2 |page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the terms ''lynching'' and ''lynch law'' is traditionally attributed In the [[United States]] to Charles Lynch, a Virginia [[Quakers|Quaker]].&lt;ref name="Cutler, James E. 1905"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lynch-law: An Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United States |first=James Elbert |last=Cutler |publisher=Longmans Green and Co. |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23''ff''}} [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]] (1736–1796) was a Virginia planter and American Revolutionary who headed a county court in Virginia which incarcerated Loyalist supporters of the British for up to one year during the war. While he lacked proper jurisdiction, he claimed this right by arguing wartime necessity. Subsequently, he prevailed upon his friends in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] to pass a law that exonerated him and his associates from wrongdoing. He was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those so incarcerated, even though the American Colonies had won the war. This action by the Congress provoked controversy, and it was in connection with this that the term "Lynch law", meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority, came into common parlance in the United States. Lynch was not accused of racist bias. He acquitted blacks accused of murder on three separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0088-6;didno=atla0088-6;view=image;seq=00732;node=atla0088-6%3A1 |title=The Atlantic Monthly Volume 0088 Issue 530 (Dec 1901) |publisher=Digital.library.cornell.edu |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webstersabridged&gt;[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;word=lynch+law&amp;resource=Webster%27s University of Chicago, ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913 + 1828)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523010101/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;word=lynch%20law&amp;resource=Webster%27s |date=2017-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was accused, however, of ethnic prejudice in his abuse of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] miners.&lt;ref name =EAAH1/&gt;

[[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]] (1742–1820) from Virginia claimed that the phrase was first used in a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbors in [[Pittsylvania County]]. While [[Edgar Allan Poe]] claimed that he found this document, it was probably a [[hoax]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A 17th-century legend of [[James Lynch fitz Stephen]], who was [[Mayor of Galway]] in Ireland in 1493, says that when his son was convicted of murder, the mayor hanged him from his own house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mayor Lynch of Galway: A Review of the Tradition |first=James |last=Mitchell |journal=Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society |volume=32 |date=1966–1971 |pages=5–72 |jstor=25535428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was proposed by 1904 as the origin of the word "lynch".&lt;ref name="matthews1904"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Term Lynch Law |first=Albert |last=Matthews |journal=Modern Philology |date=October 1904 |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-432538/432538#page/n11 |volume=2 |number=2 |pages=173–195 : 183–184 |jstor=432538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dismissed by etymologists, both because of the distance in time and place from the alleged event to the word's later emergence, and because the incident did not constitute a lynching in the modern sense.&lt;ref name="matthews1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name=quinion/&gt;

The archaic verb ''linch'', to beat severely with a pliable instrument, to chastise or to maltreat, has been proposed as the etymological source; but there is no evidence that the word has survived into modern times, so this claim is also considered implausible.&lt;ref name="Cutler, James E. 1905"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

==History==
[[File:1891 New Orleans Italian lynching.jpg|190px|thumb|Rioters breaking into a parish prison during [[March 14, 1891, lynchings|anti-Italian lynchings]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in 1891]]
Every society has had forms of extrajudicial punishments, including murder. The legal and cultural antecedents of American lynching were carried across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] by migrants from the [[British Isles]] to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial North America]]. Collective violence was a familiar aspect of the early modern Anglo-American legal landscape. Group violence in the British Atlantic was usually nonlethal in intention and result. In the seventeenth century, in the context of political turmoil in England and unsettled social and political conditions in the American colonies, there arose rebellions and riots that took multiple lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724308353 | title=The Roots of Rough Justice : Origins of American Lynching | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Pfeifer, Michael J. | year=2011 | location=Urbana, Illinois | isbn=9780252093098}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, during the decades before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (sometimes called the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era .281781.E2.80.931860.29|Antebellum era]]), free Blacks, Latinos in the South West, and runaways were the objects of racial lynching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815043342 | title=Forgotten Dead : Mob Violence against Mexicans in the United States, 1848–1928 | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Carrigan, William D. |author2=Clive Webb | year=2013 | location=Oxford | isbn=9780195320350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But lynching attacks on [[African Americans|U.S. blacks]], especially in [[Southern United States|the South]], increased dramatically in the aftermath of Reconstruction, after [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] had been abolished and freed men gained the right to vote. The peak of lynchings occurred in 1892, after southern white Democrats had regained control of state legislatures. Many incidents were related to economic troubles and competition. At the turn of the 20th century, southern states passed new constitutions or legislation which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many [[Poor White|poor white]]s, established [[racial segregation|segregation]] of public facilities by race, and separated blacks from common public life and facilities through [[Jim Crow]] rules. Nearly 3,500 [[African Americans]] and 1,300 [[White Americans|whites]] were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968.&lt;ref name=tuskegee_umkc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968 |pages= |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archivedate=June 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynching in the [[British Empire]] during the 19th century coincided with a period of violence which denied people participation in white-dominated society on the basis of race after the [[Emancipation Act]] of 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Thomas E.|last=Smith|title=The Discourse of Violence: Transatlantic Narratives of Lynching during High Imperialism|work=[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]|volume=8|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0040|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynchings took place in the United States both before and after the [[American Civil War]], most commonly in Southern states and Western frontier settlements and most frequently in the late 19th century.  It was performed without [[due process]] of law by self-appointed commissions, [[Ochlocracy|mobs]], or [[vigilantes]]  as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offences. At the first recorded lynching, in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1835, a black man named McIntosh who killed a deputy sheriff while being taken to jail was captured, chained to a tree, and burned to death on a corner lot downtown in front of a crowd of over 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;William Hyde and Howard L. Conrad (eds.), [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhi04hyde ''Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis: A Compendium of History and Biography for Ready Reference: Volume 4.''] New York: Southern History Company, 1899; pg. 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southern United States|the South]] in the antebellum era, members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] or other people who opposed [[slavery]] were sometimes victims of mob violence. The largest lynching during the war and perhaps the largest lynching in all of U.S. history, was the lynching of 41 men in the [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas]] in October 1862. Most of the victims were hanged after an extrajudicial "trial" but at least fourteen of them did not receive that formality.&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, Richard B. ''Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas 1862'', Louisiana State University Press, 1994, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  The men had been accused of [[insurrection]] or [[treason]].  Five more men were hanged in [[Decatur, Texas]] as part of the same sweep.&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, southern whites struggled to maintain their social dominance. Secret vigilante and insurgent groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings in order to keep whites in power and discourage [[freedmen]] from voting, working and getting educated. They also sometimes attacked Northerners, teachers, and agents of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. A study of the period from 1868 to 1871&lt;!-- which? needs cite --&gt; estimates that the KKK was involved in more than 400 lynchings. The aftermath of the war was a period of upheaval and social turmoil, in which most white men had been war veterans. Mobs usually alleged crimes for which they lynched blacks. In the late 19th century, however, journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] showed that many presumed crimes were either exaggerated or had not even occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Lynching |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx71O0QS?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the Ku Klux Klan and others used lynching as a means to control blacks, forcing them to work for planters and preventing them from exercising their right to vote.&lt;ref name="New South 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry A. Crouch 1868"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner1988p119-123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.C.A. Stagg 1871"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Federal troops and courts enforcing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] largely broke up the Reconstruction-era Klan.

By the end of Reconstruction in 1877, with fraud, intimidation and violence at the polls, white Democrats regained nearly total control of the state legislatures across the South. They passed laws to make voter registration more complicated, reducing black voters on the rolls. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven Southern legislatures ratified new constitutions and amendments to effectively [[disenfranchise]] most African Americans and many poor whites through devices such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], property and residency requirements, and [[literacy tests]]. Although required of all voters, some provisions were selectively applied against African Americans. In addition, many states passed [[grandfather clauses]] to exempt white illiterates from literacy tests for a limited period. The result was that black voters were stripped from registration rolls and without political recourse. Since they could not vote, they could not serve on juries. They were without official political voice.

The [[ideology]] behind lynching, directly connected with the denial of political and social equality, was stated forthrightly by [[Benjamin Tillman]], [[governor of South Carolina]] and later a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]:

{{quote|We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will.

Lynchings declined briefly after the takeover in the 1870s. By the end of the 19th century, with struggles over labor and disenfranchisement, and continuing agricultural depression, lynchings rose again. The number of lynchings peaked at the end of the 19th century, but these kinds of murders continued into the 20th century. [[Tuskegee Institute]] records of lynchings between the years 1880 and 1951 show 3,437 African-American victims, as well as 1,293 white victims. Lynchings were concentrated in the [[Cotton Belt (region)|Cotton Belt]] ([[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dahleen Glanton, "Controversial exhibit on lynching opens in Atlanta" May 5, 2002, ''Chicago Tribune''. {{cite web|url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/archiv13.htm |title=Reproduced online |accessdate=2006-10-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311100917/http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/archiv13.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid influx of blacks into the North during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early 20th century disturbed the racial balance within Northern cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white Northerners. Many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward blacks, while many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous regions, a process known as [[white flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Amanda|title=Block by block : neighborhoods and public policy on Chicago's West Side|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-74663-0|pages=213–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, blacks in Northern cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;Michael O. Emerson, Christian Smith (2001). "Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America". p. 42. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings—mob-directed hangings—increased dramatically in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

African Americans resisted through protests, marches, lobbying Congress, writing of articles, rebuttals of so-called justifications of lynching, organizing women's groups against lynching, and organizing integrated groups against lynching. African-American playwrights produced 14 anti-lynching plays between 1916 and 1935, ten of them by women.

After the release of the movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), which glorified lynching and the Reconstruction-era Klan, the Klan re-formed. Unlike its earlier form, it was heavily represented among urban populations, especially in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. In response to the massive immigration of people from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the Klan espoused an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]], [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] stance, in addition to exercising the oppression of blacks.

Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to their victims in order to spread awareness and fear of their power. Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards. In 2000, [[James Allen (collector)|James Allen]] published a collection of 145 lynching photos in book form as well as online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://withoutsanctuary.org/|author=Allen, James|title=Musarium: ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America''|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with written words and video to accompany the images.

===Dyer Bill===
The [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] was first introduced to the [[United States Congress]] in 1918 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Leonidas C. Dyer]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The bill was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1922, and in the same year it was given a favorable report by the [[United States Senate]] Committee. Its passage was blocked by white Democratic senators from the [[Solid South]], the only representatives elected since the southern states [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|had disenfranchised African Americans]] around the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000]. Accessed March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dyer Bill influenced later anti-lynching legislation, including the [[Costigan-Wagner Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;Zangrando, NAACP Crusade, pp. 43–44, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dyer and Costigan Wagner bills were blocked by Senator [[William Borah]] (R-ID).&lt;ref&gt;''Black Americans in Congress, 1870–2007''. p. 178. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt;

As passed by the House, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws, and to punish the crime of lynching.... Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the phrase 'mob or riotous assemblage,' when used in this act, shall mean an assemblage composed of three or more persons acting in concert for the purpose of depriving any person of his life without authority of law as a punishment for or to prevent the commission of some actual or supposed public offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |title="Anti-Lynching Bill," 1918 |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217081129/http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the frequency of lynching dropped in the 1930s, there was a spike in 1930 during the Great Depression. For example, in North Texas and southern Oklahoma alone, four people were lynched in separate incidents in less than a month. In his book ''Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?'' (1934), Sherwood Eddy wrote: "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what they are going to do to the [[Scottsboro boys|Scottsboro Negro boys]] and why they lynch Negroes."&lt;ref name=sherwoodeddy&gt;{{citation|first=Sherwood|last=Eddy|title=Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?|pages=73, 151|publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehar|year=1934|location=New York|oclc=1617454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spike in lynchings occurred after [[World War II]], as tensions arose after veterans returned home. Whites tried to re-impose white supremacy over returning black veterans. The last documented mass lynching occurred in Walton County, Georgia, in 1946, when two war veterans and their wives were killed by local white landowners. 

By the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining new momentum. It was spurred by the lynching of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old youth from Chicago who was killed while visiting an uncle in Mississippi.

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, is the civil rights conspiracy statute, which makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States (or because of his/her having exercised the same) and further makes it unlawful for two or more persons to go in disguise on the highway or premises of another person with intent to prevent or hinder his or her free exercise or enjoyment of such rights. Depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and any resulting injury, the offense is punishable by a range of fines and/or imprisonment for any term of years up to life, or the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 – Conspiracy Against Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224144931/http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm |date=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felony lynching===
The term 'felony lynching' was used in California law. It described the act of taking someone out of the custody of a police officer by "means of riot". It does not refer to the act of lynching, or murder by physical violence. This statute has been used to charge individuals who have tried to free someone from police custody. There have been several notable cases in the twenty-first century, some controversial, when a black person has attempted to free another black person from police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-murrieta-protesters-charged-20140904-story.html|title=Murrieta immigration protesters charged with obstructing officers|first=James|last=Barragan|date=4 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/06/03/pasadena-black-lives-matter-activist-convicted-of-felony-lynching-could-spend-four-years-behind-bars/|title=Pasadena Black Lives Matter Activist Convicted of 'Felony Lynching', Could Spend Four Years Behind Bars|first=Tanasia|last=Kenney|date=3 June 2016|website=atlantablackstar.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation by Senator [[Holly Mitchell]] removing the word "lynching" from the state's criminal code without comment after it received unanimous approval in a vote by state lawmakers. Mitchell stated, "It's been said that strong words should be reserved for strong concepts, and 'lynching' has such a painful history for African Americans that the law should only use it for what it is – murder by mob." The law was otherwise unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-lynching-law-governor-jerry-brown/|title=California legislation removing "lynching" from law signed by Governor Jerry Brown|website=www.cbsnews.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===
A 2017 study found that exposure to lynchings in the post-Reconstruction South "reduced local black voter turnout by roughly 2.5 percentage points."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel B.|last2=Troesken|first2=Werner|last3=Walsh|first3=Randall|date=2017-08-04|title=Political participation in a violent society: The impact of lynching on voter turnout in the post-Reconstruction South|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387817300615|journal=Journal of Development Economics|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was other violence directed at blacks, particularly in campaign season. Most significantly for voting, from 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] due to barriers to voter registration. These actions had major effects, soon reducing black voter turnout in most of the South to insignificant amounts.

Another 2017 study found supportive evidence of Stewart Tolnay and E. M. Beck's claim that lynchings were "due to economic competition between African American and white cotton workers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Cornelius|title=Lynchings, Labour, and Cotton in the US South: A Reappraisal of Tolnay and Beck|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498317301870|journal=Explorations in Economic History|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2017.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that lynchings were associated with greater black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Britain, a series of [[race riots]] broke out in several cities in 1919 between whites and black sailors. In [[Liverpool]], after a black sailor had been stabbed by two whites in a pub, his friends attacked the pub in revenge. In response, the police raided lodging houses with black occupants, accompanied by an "enraged lynch mob". Charles Wootton, a young black seaman who had not been involved in the attacks, was chased into the river [[Mersey]] and drowned after being pelted with missiles thrown by the mob, who chanted "Let him drown!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/liverpool-campaigns/anthony-walker/2005/08/03/the-roots-of-racism-in-city-of-many-cultures-100252-15813753/ "Roots of racism in City of Many Cultures"], ''Liverpool Echo'', August 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool was named in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jacqueline Nassy (2005).

In 1944, Wolfgang Rosterg, a German [[prisoner of war]] known to be unsympathetic to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime, was lynched by [[Nazi]]s in [[Prisoner of War|POW]] Camp 21 in [[Comrie]], Scotland. At the end of [[World War II|the war]], five of the perpetrators were [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]] Prison&amp;nbsp;– the largest multiple execution in 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caledonia.tv/index.php?page=16 Caledonia.tv] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524202824/http://www.caledonia.tv/index.php?page=16 |date=2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is less clear with regards to reported "lynchings" in Germany. Nazi propaganda sometimes tried to depict state-sponsored violence as spontaneous lynchings. The most notorious instance of this was "[[Kristallnacht]]", which the government portrayed as the result of "popular wrath" against Jews, but it was carried out in an organised and planned manner, mainly by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men. Similarly, the approximately 150 confirmed murders of surviving crew members of crashed Allied aircraft in revenge for what Nazi propaganda called [[Strategic bombing during World War II|"Anglo-American bombing terror"]] were chiefly conducted by German officials and members of the police or the [[Gestapo]], although civilians sometimes took part in them. The execution of enemy aircrew without trial in some cases had been ordered by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] personally in May 1944. Publicly it was announced that enemy pilots would no longer be protected from "public wrath". There were secret orders issued that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and Allied forces, or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts.&lt;ref&gt;"Hamm 1944". polizeihistorischesammlung-paul.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-20794719.html|title=KRIEGSVERBRECHEN: Systematischer Mord - DER SPIEGEL 47/2001|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg,|last=Germany|website=www.spiegel.de|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary,

:"the assaults on crashed allied aviators were not typically acts of revenge for the bombing raids which immediately preceded them. [...] The perpetrators of these assaults were usually National Socialist officials, who did not hesitate to get their own hands dirty. The lynching murder in the sense of self-mobilizing communities or urban quarters was the exception."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Barbara: "Lynchmorde an alliierten Fliegern im Zweiten Weltkrieg". In: Dietmar Süß (Hrsg.): Deutschland im Luftkrieg. Geschichte und Erinnerung. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, Munich 2007, {{ISBN|3-486-58084-1}}, p. 71–84. p. 83. "Die Übergriffe auf abgestürzte alliierte Flieger waren im Regelfall keine Racheakte für unmittelbar vorangegangene Bombenangriffe. [...] Täter waren in der Regel nationalsozialistische Funktionsträger, die keine Scheu davor hatten, selbst Hand anzulegen. Der Lynchmord im Sinne sich selbstmobilisierender Kommunen und Stadtviertel war dagegen die Ausnahme."&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; three Mexican undercover federal agents investigating a narcotics-related crime were lynched in the town of [[Tláhuac|San Juan Ixtayopan]] (Mexico City) by an angry crowd who saw them taking photographs and suspected that they were trying to abduct children from a primary school. The agents immediately identified themselves but they were held and beaten for several hours before two of them were killed and set on fire. The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning, including their pleas for help and their murder.

By the time police rescue units arrived, two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured. Authorities suspect that the lynching was provoked by the persons who were being investigated.
Both local and federal authorities had abandoned the agents, saying that the town was too far away for them to try to intervene. Some officials said they would provoke a massacre if the authorities tried to rescue the men from the mob.

{{Main|Necklacing}}

The practice of whipping and [[necklacing]] offenders and political opponents evolved in the 1980s during the [[apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]]. Residents of black townships formed "people's courts" and used whip lashings and deaths by necklacing in order to terrorize fellow blacks who were seen as collaborators with the government. Necklacing is the [[torture]] and execution of a victim by igniting a kerosene-filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim's chest and arms. Necklacing was used to punish victims who were alleged to be traitors to the black liberation movement along with their relatives and associates. Sometimes the "people's courts" made mistakes, or they used the system to punish those whom the anti-Apartheid movement's leaders opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/southafrica1/6.htm 4.

{{See also|Caste-related violence in India}}

In [[India]], lynchings may reflect internal tensions between ethnic communities. An example is the 2006 [[Kherlanji massacre]], where four members of a [[Dalit]] [[caste]] family were slaughtered by [[Kunbi]] caste members in Khairlanji, a village in the [[Bhandara district]] of [[Maharashtra]]. Though this incident was reported as an example of "upper" caste violence against members of a "lower" caste, it was found to be an example of communal violence. It was retaliation against a family who had opposed the Eminent Domain seizure of its fields so a road could be built that would have benefitted the group who murdered them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/age-old-rivalry-behind-khairlanji-violence/9290 |title=Age old rivalry behind Khairlanji violence Video |publisher=NDTV.com |date=November 21, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women of the family were paraded naked in public, before being mutilated and murdered.

==In popular culture==
==="Strange Fruit"===
In 1937, [[Abel Meeropol]], a [[Jew]]ish schoolteacher from [[New York City|New York]], saw a copy of the photograph of a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He said that the photograph "haunted me for days" and inspired him to write the poem "[[Strange Fruit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cross and the Lynching Tree|last=Cone|first=James H.|publisher=Oribis Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=Maryknoll, New York|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in the ''New York Teacher'' and later in the magazine ''[[New Masses]]'', in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan. This poem was set to music, also written by Meeropol, and the song was performed and popularized by [[Billie Holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/strangefruit/film.html|website=Independent Lens|author=PBS|title=Strange Fruit}} PBS ''Independent Lens'' credits the music as well as the words to Meeropol, though Billie Holiday's autobiography and the Spartacus article credit her with co-authoring the song.&lt;/ref&gt; The song reached 16th place on the charts in July 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The song has been performed by many other singers, including [[Nina Simone]].

The finale of the 2015 film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' set in post Civil War America is a detailed and close focused depiction of the lynching of a white woman, prompting some debate about whether it is a political commentary on racism and hate in America or if it was simply created for entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/movies/review-quentin-tarantinos-the-hateful-eight-blends-verbiage-and-violence.html|title=Review: Quentin Tarantino’s ‘The Hateful Eight’ Blends Verbiage and Violence|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22900">In [[agriculture]], '''Managed intensive rotational grazing''' ('''MIRG'''), also known as simply as managed grazing or cell grazing, mob grazing and [[Holistic management|holistic managed planned grazing]], describes a variety of closely related systems of forage use in which [[ruminant]] and non-ruminant herds and/or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh rested areas with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of [[forage]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Undersander|first1=Dan|title=Pastures for Profit, a guide to rotational grazing|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1097378.pdf|website=USDA-NRCS|publisher=University of Minnesota extension service|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One primary goal of MIRG is to have a vegetative cover over all grazed areas at all times, and to prevent the complete removal of all vegetation from the grazed areas ("bare dirt")&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrilifenews.tamu.edu/showstory.php?id=1786 Healing native rangeland may require a combination of burning and rotational grazing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/SmallAcreageBrochure.pdf Small Acreage Grazing impacts to our natural resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630100728/http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/SmallAcreageBrochure.pdf |date=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/rotational-grazing-zm0z15amzcom.aspx Rotational grazing for Pastured Livestock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1167363.pdf Managing Your Pasture: Small scale solutions for your farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks and other animals. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover.  The length of time a paddock is grazed will depend on the size of the herd and the size of the [[Field (agriculture)|paddock]] and local environmental factors.  Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves, rebuild shoot systems, and deepen root systems, with the result being long-term maximum [[biomass]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Alice E. Beetz and Lee Rinehart  2004.  [http://watershedbmps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/01772_rotgraze.pdf Rotational grazing].  National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service  (ATTRA).&lt;/ref&gt;  MIRG is especially effective because grazers do better on the more tender younger plant stems. MIRG also leave parasites behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers.  Pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements, and with the increased productivity of MIRG systems, the grazers obtain the majority of their nutritional needs without the supplemental feed sources that are required in continuous grazing systems.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"&gt;Undersander, D., Albert, B., Cosgrove, D., Johnson, D., Peterson, P.  UW-Extension 2002.  [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1097378.pdf Pastures for profit: A guide to rotational grazing]&lt;/ref&gt;

One key element of this style of animal husbandry is that either each grazed area must contain all elements needed for the animals (water source, for instance) or the feed or water source must be moved each time the animals are moved.  Having fixed feeding or watering stations defeats the rotational aspect, leading to degradation of the ground around the water supply or feed supply if additional feed is provided to the animals.  Special care must be taken to ensure that high use areas do not become areas where mud, parasites or diseases are spread or communicated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/grazing-systems/grazing-systems-handbook.pdf Grazing systems planning guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1097378.pdf Pastures for profit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herd health and welfare==

===Animal health risks===
[[Ruminal tympany]], also known as bloat, is a common problem in [[grazing systems]] for [[ruminants]], although not for pigs or poultry, that if left untreated can lead to animal death.  This problem occurs when foam producing compounds in plants are digested by cows, causing foam to form in the rumen of the animal and ultimately prohibiting animals from expelling gas.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, K., DeClue, R., Emmick, D.  2000. [http://grazingguide.net/documents/cow-feeding-mgt.pdf Prescribed grazing and feeding management for lactating dairy cows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123133549/http://grazingguide.net/documents/cow-feeding-mgt.pdf |date=2015-11-23 }}  USDA-NRCS&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of bloat can be mitigated by seeding non-bloating [[legume]]s with the grasses.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005&gt;2005. [https://store.extension.iastate.edu/ItemDetail.aspx?ProductID=5256 Pasture management guide for Livestock Producers]. Iowa State University (note, no electronic source available)&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are especially susceptible to bloat if they are moved to new pasture sources when they are particularly hungry.   It is therefore important to ensure that the herd is eating enough at the end of a rotation when forage will be more scarce, limiting the potential for animals to gorge themselves when turned onto new paddocks.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

Several problems are related to shade in pasture areas.  Although shade provides relief from heat and reduces the risk of heat stress, animals tend to congregate in these areas which leads to nutrient loading, uneven grazing, and potential soil erosion.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;  Taller shade trees move the shade area around as the day progresses minimizing this problem.

===Animal health benefits and animal welfare===
Herd health benefits arise from animals having access to both space and fresh air.  Freedom of movement within a paddock results in increased [[physical fitness]], which limits the potential for injuries and [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasion]], and reduces the potential of exposure to high levels of harmful disease-causing [[microorganism]]s and insects.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

In a concentrated animal feeding operation ([[CAFO]]), it is considered normal for a large number of animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of manure and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as [[foot rot]] due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of [[antibiotic]]s to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to [[antibiotic resistance]] for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.

By comparison, with managed grazing, the animals are able to spread out and exist in a natural environment more suited for their natural growth and development. As the animals move to a new paddock, wastes are left behind and allowed to decay without the animals nearby. The animals experience less disease without the need for regular antibiotic dosing, and fewer foot ailments.

==Weed control==
In general, a well managed rotational grazing system has rather low pasture weed establishment because the majority of niches are already filled with established forage species, making it hard for competing weeds to emerge and become established.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt; The use of multiple species in the co-grazing helps to minimize weeds. Established forage plants in rotational grazing pasture systems are healthy and unstressed due to the "rest" period, enhancing the [[competitive advantage]] of the forage.  Additionally, in comparison to cash grain crop production, many plants which would be considered weeds are not problematic in perennial pasture.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;  Many of these plants are actually nutritious to grazers and control of these plants is therefore not necessary in management intensive rotational systems.  However, certain species such as [[thistles]] and various other weeds, are indigestible and possibly poisonous to grazers.  These plant species will not be grazed by the herd and can be recognized for their prevalence in pasture systems.

A key step in managing weeds in any pasture system is identification.  Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management can be implemented to control weed populations.  It is important to recognize that no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;  Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures.  Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant.  These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production.  Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on [[herbicides]], weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary.  Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used.  Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

==Nutrient availability and soil fertility==
If pasture systems are seeded with more than 40% legumes, commercial nitrogen [[fertilization]] is unnecessary for adequate plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, J., Grant, R., Olesen, J.E., Kristensen, I.S., Vinther, F.P, Molgaard, J.P., and Petersen, B.M.  2006.  Nitrogen cycling in organic farming systems with rotational grass-clover and arable crops.  Soil Use and Management, 22: 197-208.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Legumes are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus providing nitrogen for themselves and surrounding plants. 
Although grazers remove nutrient sources from the pasture system when they feed on forage sources, the majority of the nutrients consumed by the herd are returned to the pasture system through manure.  At a relatively high [[stocking rate]], or high ratio of animals per [[hectare]], manure will be evenly distributed across the pasture system.  The nutrient content in these manure sources should be adequate to meet plant requirements, making commercial fertilization unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;   Management intensive rotational grazing systems are often associated with increased [[soil fertility]] which arises because manure is a rich source of [[organic matter]] that increases the health of soil.  In addition, these pasture system are less susceptible to [[erosion]] because the land base has continuous ground cover throughout the year.

High levels of fertilizers entering waterways are a pertinent environmental concern associated with agricultural systems.  However, management intensive rotational grazing systems effectively reduce the amount of nutrients that move off-farm which have the potential to cause environmental degradation.&lt;ref name="Blanchet, K. 2003"&gt;Blanchet, K., Moechnig, H., and DeJong-Hughes, J.  2003.  [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/components/DI7606.pdf Grazing systems planning guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618055354/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/components/DI7606.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}.  USDA-NRCS and University of Minnesota Extension and University of Minnesota Water Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt;  These systems are fertilized with on-farm sources, and are less prone to leaching as compared to commercial fertilizers.  Additionally, the system is less prone to excess nutrient fertilization, so the majority of nutrients put into the system by manure sources are utilized for plant growth.&lt;ref name="Blanchet, K. 2003"/&gt;  Permanent pasture systems also have deeper, well established forage root systems which are more efficient at taking up nutrients from within the soil profile.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;

==Socio-cultural-economic considerations==
Although milk yields are often lower in MIRG systems, net farm income per cow is often greater as compared to confinement operations.  This is due to the additional costs associated with  herd health and purchased feeds are greatly reduced in management intensive rotational grazing systems.  Additionally, a transition to management intensive rotational grazing is associated with low start-up and maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"/&gt; Another consideration is that while production per cow is less, the number of cows per acre on the pasture can increase. The net effect is more productivity per acre at less cost.

The main costs associated with transitioning to management intensive rotational grazing are purchasing fencing, fencers, and water supply materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cadwallader, T. and Cosgrove, D.  [http://www.uwex.edu/ces/crops/uwforage/settpost.pdf Setting Posts: Fencing systems for rotational grazing].  University of Wisconsin Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2005.  Electric fencing for serious grazers.  USDA-NRCS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watering systems for grazing livestock.  Great Lakes Basin Grazing Network and Michigan State University Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a pasture was continuously grazed in the past, likely capital has already been invested in fencing and a fencer system.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"&gt;Kriegl, T., McNair, R. 2005. [http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/pastplenty607.pdf Pastures of Plenty: Financial performance of Wisconsin grazing dairy farms]. Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems, Center for Dairy Profitability, and Program on Agricultural Technology Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  Cost savings to [[Pastoral farming|grazier]]s can also be recognized when one considers that many of the costs associated with livestock operations are transmitted to the grazers.  For example, the grazers actively harvest their own sources of food for the portion of the year where grazing is possible.  This translates into lower costs for feed production and harvesting, which are fuel intensive endeavors.  MIRG systems rely on the grazers to produce fertilizer sources via their excretion.  There is also no need for collection, storage, transportation, and application of manure, which are also all fuel intensive.  Additionally, external fertilizer use contributes to other costs such as labor, purchasing costs.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

It can also be demonstrated that management intensive rotational grazing system also result in time savings because the majority of work which might otherwise require human labor is transmitted to the herd.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

==Environmental considerations==
Many pastures undergoing MIRG are less susceptible to soil erosion and are associated with higher soil fertility than continuously grazed pastures, depending on the skill of the manager and the management system they are using.  As a result, the paddocks require fewer commercial inputs, which have been associated with negative environmental impacts.  In addition, because these systems tend to be more resilient and stable they are more capable of responding to changing environmental conditions and perturbations while not compromising productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Steve, Fred E. Smeins|title=Grazing Management an ecological perspective edited by Rodney K Heitschmidt and Jerry W Stuth|page=Chapter 5|url=http://cnrit.tamu.edu/rlem/textbook/Chapter5.htm#index1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nutrition==
Animals raised on pasture have shown major differences in the nutritional quality of the products they produce for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duckett|first=S K|author2=D G Wagner|author3=L D Yates|author4=H G Dolezal|author5=S G May|title=Effects of time on feed on beef nutrient composition|journal=[[Journal of Animal Science]]|year=1993|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/grassfedbeef/research/documents/sources/Duckett%20SK%204.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208181041/http://www.csuchico.edu/grassfedbeef/research/documents/sources/Duckett%20SK%204.pdf|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leheska|first=J.

== Criticism ==
Managed intensive rotational grazing paints a wide brush over many different managed grazing systems. Managers have found that rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briske|first=D. D.|title=Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/person/1354/75.%20REM-D-10-00084.1.pdf|work=Rangeland Ecol Manage 64:325–334|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management.  The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent on the effectiveness of those management models. Depending on the management model, plant production has been shown to be equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Briske, J. D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17565">The '''Matilda effect''' is a bias against acknowledging the achievements of those [[women in science|women scientists]] whose work is attributed to their male colleagues.  This effect was first described by suffragist and abolitionist [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] (1826–98) in her essay, "Woman as Inventor".  The term "Matilda effect" was coined in 1993 by science historian [[Margaret W. Rossiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Rossiter Margaret W.| title = The Matthew/Matilda Effect in Science| journal = Social Studies of Science| volume=23 | issue = 2| place = London| year = 1993| pages = 325–341| issn = 0306-3127| url=| doi=10.1177/030631293023002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter provides several examples of this effect.  Trotula ([[Trota of Salerno]]), a 12th-century Italian woman physician, wrote books which, after her death, were attributed to male authors.  Nineteenth- and twentieth-century cases illustrating the Matilda effect include those of [[Nettie Stevens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12105830/nettie-stevens-genetics-gender-sex-chromosomes|title=Nettie Stevens discovered XY sex chromosomes.

The Matilda effect is sometimes compared to the [[Matthew effect]], whereby an eminent scientist often gets more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is shared or similar.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Professor [[Ben Barres]] (born 1955), a neurobiologist at [[Stanford University Medical School]] who transitioned from female to male, has spoken of his scientific achievements having been perceived differently, depending on his sex at the time.&lt;ref name="vedantam"&gt;Shankar Vedantam, (13 July 2006). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201883.html Male Scientist Writes of Life as Female Scientist: Biologist Who Underwent Sex Change Describes Biases Against Women.] ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This offers one account of biases experienced from different identities, as perceived by one individual.

== Research ==
In 2012, two female researchers from [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] showed that in the [[Netherlands]] the sex of professorship candidates influences the evaluation made of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Marieke van den Brink|author2 = Yvonne Benschop| author-link = | title = Gender practices in the construction of academic excellence: Sheep with five legs| journal = Organization| volume = 19 | issue = 4|  pages = 507–524| doi = 10.1177/1350508411414293| url=http://org.sagepub.com/content/19/4/507.abstract|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cases are described by two Italian female researchers in a study &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Andrea Cerroni|author2 = Zenia Simonella| author-link = | title = Ethos and symbolic violence among women of science: An empirical study| journal = Social Science Information| volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 165–182 |  doi = 10.1177/0539018412437102 | url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/51/2/165.abstract|year = 2012|hdl = 10281/30675}}&lt;/ref&gt; corroborated further by a Spanish study.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = María Luisa Jiménez-Rodrigo1|author2 = Emilia Martínez-Morante|author3 = María del Mar García-Calvente|author4 = Carlos Álvarez-Dardet| author-link = | title = Through gender parity in scientific publications| journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health| volume = 62|issue = 6| pages = 474-475| year = 2008|  doi = 10.1136/jech.2008.074294 |pmid = 18477742| url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/62/6/474.extract|hdl = 10045/8447}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, several studies found no difference between citations and impact of publications of male authors and those of female authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Peter Hegarty|author2 = Zoe Walton| author-link = | title = The Consequences of Predicting Scientific Impact in Psychology Using Journal Impact Factors| journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume = 7 |issue = 1| pages = 72–78|  doi = 10.1177/1745691611429356|pmid = 26168426| url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/1/72.abstract|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Stephane Baldi| author-link = | title = Normative versus Social Constructivist Processes in the Allocation of Citations: A Network-Analytic Model| journal = American Sociological Review|volume = 63 |issue = 6| pages = 829–846|  doi = 10.2307/2657504| jstor=2657504| year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Nick Haslam|author2 = Lauren Ban|author3 = Leah Kaufmann|author4 = Stephen Loughnan|author5 = Kim Peters|author6 = Jennifer Whelan|author7 = Sam Wilson| author-link = | title = What makes an article influential?

According to one U.S. study, "although overt gender discrimination generally continues to decline in American society," "women continue to be disadvantaged with respect to the receipt of scientific awards and prizes, particularly for research."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author = Anne E.

== Examples ==
Examples of women subjected to the Matilda effect:
* [[Trotula]] ([[Trota of Salerno]], 12th century) -  Italian physician, author of works which, after her death, were attributed to men authors.  Hostility toward women as teachers and healers led to denial of her very existence. At first her work was credited to her husband and son but as information got passed on, monks confused her name for that of a man. She is not mentioned in the "Dictionary of Scientific Biography"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=Margaret W.|date=1993|title=The Matthew Matilda Effect in Science|jstor=285482|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume= 23| issue =  2|pages=325–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nettie Stevens]] (1861–1912), discoverer of the [[XY sex-determination system]].   Her crucial studies of mealworms revealed for the first time that an organism’s sex is determined by its chromosomes rather than by environmental or other factors. Stevens greatly influenced the scientific community’s transition to this new line of inquiry:  chromosomal sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Doing Biology|last = Hagen|first = Joel|publisher = Harper Collins|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Glenview, IL|pages = 37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], a distinguished geneticist at the time, is generally credited with this discovery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 6 Women Scientists Who Were Snubbed Due to Sexism|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130519-women-scientists-overlooked-dna-history-science/|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her extensive work in the field of genetics, Stevens’ contributions to Morgan’s work are often disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nettie Maria Stevens (1861-1912) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|url = https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/nettie-maria-stevens-1861-1912|website = embryo.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930)- [[Harvard University]] discovered that stimuli that were paired with other vivid stimuli would be recalled more easily. She also discovered that duration of exposure led to better recall. These findings, along with her paired-associations method, would later be used by [[Georg Elias Müller]] and [[Edward B. Titchener]], without any credit being given to Calkins.
* [[Gerty Cori]] (1896–1957), Nobel-laureate biochemist, worked for years as her husband's assistant, despite having equal qualification as him for a professorial position.
* [[Rosalind Franklin]] (1920–58) - now recognized as a important contributor to the 1953 discovery of [[DNA]] structure. At the time of the  discovery by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Dewey Watson|James Watson]], for which the two men received a 1962 Nobel Prize, her work was not properly credited (though Watson described the crucial importance of her contribution, in his 1968 book ''[[The Double Helix]]'').
* [[Marthe Gautier]] (born 1925) - now recognized for her important role in the discovery of the chromosomal abnormality that causes [[Down syndrome]], a discovery previously attributed exclusively to [[Jérôme Lejeune]].
* [[Marian Diamond]] (born 1926), working at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], experimentally discovered the phenomenon of [[brain plasticity]], which ran contrary to previous neurological dogma.  When her seminal 1964 paper&lt;ref&gt;Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR,[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.901230110/full "The Effects of an Enriched Environment on the Histology of the Rat Cerebral Cortex"],"J Comp Neurol 1964;123:111-120", retrieved 9 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; was about to be  published, she discovered that the names of her two secondary co-authors, [[David Krech]] and [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]], had been placed before her name (which, additionally, had been placed in parentheses).  She protested that she had done the essential work described in the paper, and her name was then put in first place (without parentheses).  The incident is described in a 2016 documentary film, ''My Love Affair with the Brain: The Life and Science of Dr. Marian Diamond''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunaproductions.com/ My Love Affair with the Brain: The Life and Science of Dr. Marian Diamond]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Harriet Zuckerman]] (born 1937) - as a result of the Matilda effect, Zuckerman was also credited by husband [[Robert K. Merton]] as co-author of the concept of the [[Matthew effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Non sequitur|date=March 2017}}
* Programmers of [[ENIAC]] (dedicated 1946) - several women made substantial contributions to the project, including [[Adele Goldstine]], [[Kathleen Antonelli|Kay McNulty]], [[Jean Bartik|Betty Jennings]], [[Betty Holberton|Betty Snyder]], [[Marlyn Meltzer|Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]] and [[Ruth Teitelbaum|Ruth Lichterman]], but histories of [[ENIAC]] have typically not addressed these contributions, and have at times focused on hardware accomplishments rather than software accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Light|first = Jennifer S.|title = When Computers Were Women|journal = Technology and Culture|volume = 40|issue = 3|year = 1999|pages = 455–483|url = http://pcfly.info/doc/Computers/18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Examples''' of men scientists favored over women scientists for '''[[Nobel Prize]]s'''
* In 1903, [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]] (1867–1934) was included in the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] only on the insistence of a Nobel Prize Committee member who was an advocate of women scientists—Swedish mathematician [[Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler]]—and of her fellow-laureate, husband [[Pierre Curie]].  Marie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.  She was never admitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]; a student of hers, [[Marguerite Perey]], would be the first woman so honored, in 1962.
* In 1934, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to [[George Whipple]], [[George Richards Minot]], and [[William P. Murphy]]. They felt their female co-worker, [[Frieda Robscheit-Robbins]], was excluded on grounds of her sex. Whipple however shared  the prize money with her as he felt she deserved the Nobel as well, since she was co-author of almost all of Whipple's publications.
* In 1944 the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was given to [[Otto Hahn]] as the sole recipient. [[Lise Meitner]] had worked with Hahn and had laid the theoretical foundations for [[nuclear fission]] (she coined the term "nuclear fission"). Meitner was not recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee, partly due to her gender and partly due to her persecuted Jewish identity in Nazi Germany. She was affected by the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which prohibited Jews from holding government-related positions, including in research. Initially, her Austrian citizenship shielded her from persecution, but she fled Germany after [[Anschluss|Hitler's annexation of Austria in 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ScienceWeek |url=http://scienceweek.com/2004/rmps-32.htm |date=2013-04-14 |accessdate=2015-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414151521/http://scienceweek.com/2004/rmps-32.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1950, [[Cecil Frank Powell|Cecil Powell]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and for the resulting discovery of the [[pion]] (pi-meson). [[Marietta Blau]] did pioneering work in this field. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] had nominated her for the prize along with [[Hertha Wambacher]], but both were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1728|title = Marietta Blau in the history of cosmic rays|journal = Physics Today|volume = 65|issue = 10|pages = 8|year = 2012|last1 = Sime|first1 = Ruth Lewin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, two American physicists [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]], predicted the violation of the parity law in weak interactions and suggested a possible experiment to verify it. In 1957, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] performed the necessary experiment in collaboration with [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] and showed the parity violation in the case of [[beta decay]].  The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 was awarded to the male physicists and Wu was omitted. She received the [[Wolf Prize]] in 1987 in recognition for her work.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2004/jan/20/wolf-prize-goes-to-particle-theorists&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1958, [[Joshua Lederberg]] shared a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[George Wells Beadle|George Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum|Edward Tatum]]. Microbiologists Joshua Lederberg and his wife [[Esther Lederberg]], along with Beadle and Tatum, developed [[replica plating]], a method of transferring bacterial colonies from one petri dish to another, which is vital to current understanding of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Esther Lederberg was not recognized for her vital work on this research project; her contribution was paramount to the successful implementation of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CensorshipIndex|url = http://www.esthermlederberg.com/Censorship/CensorshipIndex.html|website = www.esthermlederberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she did not receive recognition for her discovery of the [[lambda phage]] or for her studies on the F [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|fertility factor]] that created a foundation for future genetic and bacterial research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Esther Lederberg, pioneer in genetics, dies at 83|url = http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/november29/med-esther-112906.html|website = Stanford University|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the late 1960s, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] (born 1943) discovered the first radio [[pulsar]].  For this discovery, in 1974 a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to her supervisor [[Antony Hewish]] and to [[Martin Ryle]], citing Hewish and Ryle for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics.  Jocelyn Burnell was left out.  A Ph.D. student at the time of her discovery, she felt the intellectual effort had been mostly her supervisor's; but her omission from the Nobel Prize was criticized by several prominent astronomers, including [[Sir Fred Hoyle|Fred Hoyle]].  [[Iosif Shklovsky]], recipient of the 1972 [[Bruce Medal]], at the 1970 [[International Astronomical Union]]'s General Assembly.

==In the arts==
* ''[[:pl:Za ścianą|Za ścianą]]'' (Next Door): a 1971 Polish TV film directed by [[Krzysztof Zanussi]], starring [[Maja Komorowska]] as "Anna" and [[Zbigniew Zapasiewicz]] as "Jan".  The two apartment-building next-door neighbors both work in academia.  Jan is an assistant professor.  Anna, who would like to develop a closer acquaintance with him, might have achieved comparable academic rank and thus an easier entree to his affections, had a male colleague not appropriated the credit for her research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The term ''metafunction'' originates in [[systemic functional linguistics]] and is considered to be a property of all languages. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. "Systemic Theory". In R.E. Asher (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. ''On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the ''Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. [[Michael Halliday]], the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ''ideational'', ''interpersonal'', and ''textual''. The ideational function is further divided into the ''experiential'' and ''logical''.

Metafunctions are ''systemic clusters''; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Function is considered to be "a fundamental property of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ruqaiya Hasan]], the metafunctions in SFL "are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of [[Karl Bühler]], for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideational function==
The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes&lt;!--comprises? Or is there something aside from the exper. and logical?--&gt; the experiential function and the logical function.

=== Experiential function ===
The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:

:"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic “reality” that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]].

===Logical function===
Halliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another”&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The systems which come under the logical function are {{Sc|taxis}} and {{Smallcaps|logico-semantic relations}}. When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal function==
The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of [[systemic functional linguistics]] is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that these encounters:

:"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life – most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue – to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond."&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"/&gt;

The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include &lt;!--Can these be not all-caps?--&gt;Mood, Modality, and Polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual function==
Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”.

In [[mathematical logic]], and more specifically in [[model theory]], an infinite [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (''M'',&amp;lt;,...) which is [[Total order|totally ordered]] by &lt; is called an '''o-minimal structure''' if and only if every [[definable set|definable]] subset ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' (with parameters taken from ''M'') is a finite [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s and points.

O-minimality can be regarded as a weak form of [[quantifier elimination]]. A structure ''M'' is o-minimal if and only if every formula with one free variable and parameters in ''M'' is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula involving only the ordering, also with parameters in ''M''. This is analogous to the [[strongly minimal theory|minimal]] structures, which are exactly the analogous property down to equality.

A [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] ''T'' is an '''o-minimal theory''' if every [[Model theory|model]] of ''T'' is o-minimal. It is known that the complete theory ''T'' of an o-minimal structure is an o-minimal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Pillay and Steinhorn (1986), Pillay and Steinhorn (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; This result is remarkable because, in contrast, the [[complete theory]] of a minimal structure need not be a [[strongly minimal theory]], that is, there may be an elementarily equivalent structure which is not minimal.

==Set-theoretic definition==

O-minimal structures can be defined without recourse to model theory.  Here we define a structure on a nonempty set ''M'' in a set-theoretic manner, as a sequence ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,1,2,... such that
# ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|boolean algebra]] of subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
# if ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; then ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''A'' and ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;''M'' are in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;
# the set {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
# if ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''π''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the projection map on the first ''n'' coordinates, then ''π''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''M'' has a dense linear order without endpoints on it, say &lt;, then a structure ''S'' on ''M'' is called o-minimal if it satisfies the extra axioms

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the set {(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''} is in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sets in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are precisely the finite unions of intervals and points.
&lt;/ol&gt;

The "o" stands for "order", since any o-minimal structure requires an ordering on the underlying set.

==Model theoretic definition==

O-minimal structures originated in model theory and so have a simpler &amp;mdash; but equivalent &amp;mdash; definition using the language of model theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically if ''L'' is a language including a binary relation &lt;, and (''M'',&lt;,...) is an ''L''-structure where &lt; is interpreted to satisfy the axioms of a dense linear order,&lt;ref&gt;The condition that the interpretation of &lt; be dense is not strictly necessary, but it is known that discrete orders lead to essentially trivial o-minimal structures, see, for example, {{MR|0899083}} and {{MR|0943306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then (''M'',&lt;,...) is called an o-minimal structure if for any definable set ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M'' there are finitely many open intervals ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; with endpoints in ''M''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{±∞} and a finite set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;X=X_0\cup I_1\cup\ldots\cup I_r.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Examples of o-minimal theories are:
* The complete theory of dense linear orders in the language with just the ordering.
* RCF, the [[theory]] of [[real closed field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.99&lt;/ref&gt;
* The complete theory of the [[real number|real field]] with restricted [[analytic function]]s added (i.e. analytic functions on a neighborhood of [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, restricted to [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;; note that the unrestricted sine function has infinitely many roots, and so cannot be definable in an o-minimal structure.)
* The complete theory of the real field with a symbol for the [[exponential function]] by [[Wilkie's theorem]]. More generally, the complete theory of the real numbers with [[Pfaffian function]]s added.
* The last two examples can be combined: given any o-minimal expansion of the real field (such as the real field with restricted analytic functions), one can define its Pfaffian closure, which is again an o-minimal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Speisseger, ''Pfaffian sets and o-minimality,'' in: Lecture notes on o-minimal structures and real analytic geometry, C. Miller, J.-P. Rolin, and P. Speissegger (eds.), Fields Institute Communications vol. 62, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–218. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4614-4042-0_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Pfaffian closure of a structure is, in particular, closed under Pfaffian chains where arbitrary definable functions are used in place of polynomials.)

In the case of RCF, the definable sets are the [[semialgebraic set]]s. Thus the study of o-minimal structures and theories generalises [[real algebraic geometry]]. A major line of current research is based on discovering expansions of the real ordered field that are o-minimal. Despite the generality of application, one can show a great deal about the geometry of set definable in o-minimal structures. There is a cell decomposition theorem,&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.103&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]] and [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]] [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] theorems and a good notion of dimension and Euler characteristic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4648">In [[programming language theory]], '''parametricity''' is an abstract uniformity property enjoyed by [[Parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]] functions, which captures the intuition that all instances of a polymorphic function act the same way.

== Idea ==

Consider this example, based on a set ''X'' and the type ''T''(''X'') = [''X'' → ''X''] of functions from ''X'' to itself.  The higher-order function ''twice''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''T''(''X'') → ''T''(''X'') given by ''twice''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') = ''f'' ∘ ''f'', is intuitively independent of the set ''X''.  The family of all such functions ''twice''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, parametrized by sets ''X'', is called a "[[Parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic function]]".  We simply write '''twice''' for the entire family of these functions and write its type as &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''X''. ''T''(''X'') → ''T''(''X'').  The individual functions ''twice''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the ''components'' or ''instances'' of the polymorphic function.   Notice that all the component functions ''twice''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; act "the same way" because they are given by the same rule.  Other families of functions obtained by picking one arbitrary function from each ''T''(''X'') → ''T''(''X'') would not have such uniformity.  They are called [[Ad hoc polymorphism|"''ad hoc'' polymorphic functions"]].  ''Parametricity'' is the abstract property enjoyed by the uniformly acting families such as '''twice''', which distinguishes them from ''ad hoc'' families.  With an adequate formalization of parametricity, it is possible to prove that the parametrically polymorphic functions of type &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''X''. ''T''(''X'') → ''T''(''X'') are one-to-one with natural numbers.  The function corresponding to the natural number ''n'' is given by the rule ''f'' &lt;math&gt;\mapsto&lt;/math&gt; ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., the polymorphic [[Church encoding|Church numeral]] for ''n''.  In contrast, the collection of all ''ad hoc'' families would be too large to be a set.

== History ==
The ''parametricity theorem'' was originally stated by [[John C. Reynolds]], who called it the ''abstraction theorem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Programming language implementation ==

Parametricity is the basis for many [[program transformation]]s implemented in compilers for the [[Haskell programming language]]. These transformations were traditionally thought to be correct in Haskell because of Haskell's [[non-strict]] semantics. Despite being a [[Lazy evaluation|lazy]] programming language, Haskell does support certain primitive operations—such as the operator &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;—that enable so-called "selective strictness", allowing the programmer to force the evaluation of certain expressions. In their paper "Free theorems in the presence of ''seq''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
  | first = Patricia
  | last = Johann
  |author2=Janis Voigtlaender
  | title = Free theorems in the presence of ''seq''

  | booktitle = Proc., Principles of Programming Languages
  | date = January 2004
  | pages = 99–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Johann]] and [[Janis Voigtlaender]] showed that because of the presence of these operations, the general parametricity theorem does not hold for Haskell programs; thus, these transformations are unsound in general.

Predictive cues are an important part of our life that continuously influence and guide our actions. Hearing the sound of a horn makes us stop before we attempt to cross the street. Seeing an advertisement for fast food might make us hungry and lead us to seek out a specific type and source of food. In general, cues can both prompt us towards or stop us from engaging in a certain course of action. They can be adaptive (saving our life in crossing the street) or maladaptive, leading to suboptimal choices, e.g. making us eat when we are not really hungry (Colagiuri and Lovibond, 2015). In extreme cases they can even play a part in pathologies such as in addiction, where drug associated cues produce craving and provoke relapse (Belin et al., 2009).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

This is a signature feature of incentive salience. In daily life, the smell of food may make you suddenly feel hungry, when you hadn’t felt that way a minute before. In animal neuroscience experiments, a CS for reward may trigger a more frenzied pulse of increased instrumental efforts to obtain that associated UCS reward in situations that purify the measurement of incentive salience, such as in Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) experiments&amp;nbsp;... Similarly, including a CS can often spur increased consumption of a reward UCS by rats or people, compared to consumption of the same UCS when CSs are absent&amp;nbsp;... Thus Pavlovian cues can elicit pulses of increased motivation to consume their UCS reward, whetting and intensifying the appetite.

PIT is a behavioral process that reflects the impact of Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli (CS) on instrumental responding. For example, presentation of a Pavlovian CS paired with food can increase output of food-reinforced instrumental behaviors, such as lever pressing. Outcome-specific PIT occurs when the Pavlovian unconditioned stimulus (US) and the instrumental reinforcer are the same stimulus, whereas general PIT is said to occur when the Pavlovian US and the reinforcer are different.&amp;nbsp;... More recent evidence indicates that accumbens core and shell appear to mediate different aspects of PIT; shell lesions and inactivation reduced outcome-specific PIT, while core lesions and inactivation suppressed general PIT (Corbit and Balleine 2011). These core versus shell differences are likely due to the different anatomical inputs and pallidal outputs associated with these accumbens subregions (Root et al. 2015). These results led Corbit and Balleine (2011) to suggest that accumbens core mediates the general excitatory effects of reward-related cues. PIT provides a fundamental behavioral process by which conditioned stimuli can exert activating effects upon instrumental responding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior).&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;

An example of specific PIT, as described by a neuroscience review from 2013 on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer,&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt; is as follows: "in a typical experimental scenario a rat is trained to associate a sound (CS) with the delivery of food. Later, the rat undergoes an instrumental training where it learns to press a lever to get some food (without the sound being present). Finally, the rat is presented again with the opportunity to press the lever, this time both in the presence and absence of the sound. The results show that the rat will press the lever more in the presence of the sound than without, even if the sound has not been previously paired with lever pressing. The Pavlovian sound-food association learned in the first phase has somehow transferred to the instrumental situation, hence the name 'Pavlovian-instrumental transfer.'"&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;

==Specific and general transfer==
In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior).&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; Neurobiological state factors (e.g., [[appetite]] and [[satiety]] states, [[Psychological stress|stress level]], drug states such as [[drug intoxication|intoxication]] and [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], etc.), and particularly the motivational state of an animal, strongly affect the amount of appetitive motivational salience (i.e., [[incentive salience]]) that a ''reward cue''{{#tag:ref|A "reward cue" is a conditioned stimulus (CS) that has been paired with a rewarding stimulus via classical conditioning.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;|group="note"|name=""}} confers to an associated rewarding stimulus via Pavlovian-instrumental transfer.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;  Acute stress amplifies the motivational salience that reward cues confer to rewarding stimuli through both specific and general PIT;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; however, chronic stress reduces the motivational impact reward cues.&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;

Specific PIT and general PIT also occur with aversive stimuli and are defined analogously.&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; Specific PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with an aversive stimulus and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed away from the aversive stimulus with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes escape and avoidance behavior).&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; General PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with one aversive stimulus and it enhances an operant response that is directed away from a different aversive stimulus.&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbit LH, Balleine BW | title = Learning and Motivational Processes Contributing to Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer and Their Neural Bases: Dopamine and Beyond | journal = Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 259–289 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26695169 | doi = 10.1007/7854_2015_388 | quote = Such effects suggest that specific motivational states gate the arousing effects of Pavlovian incentives processes on instrumental performance&amp;nbsp;... Behavioral findings are supported by evidence that distinct neural circuits centered on the NAc core and shell mediate the general and specific forms of transfer, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Finally, stress has been shown to increase the magnitude of transfer effects, particularly general transfer, suggesting a shift in cognitive control under stress conditions.&amp;nbsp;... corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) administered directly into the NAc shell enhances transfer in a dose-dependent fashion without affecting baseline lever-press performance (Pecina et al. 2006), suggesting that CRF amplifies the motivational impact of cued rewards in much the same manner as dopamine.&amp;nbsp;... In general, acute treatments seem to enhance transfer effects, whereas chronic treatments decrease transfer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural substrates==

Based upon studies on rats that involved PIT with rewards, specific PIT is mediated by the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] and [[basolateral amygdala]], while general PIT is mediated by the [[nucleus accumbens core]] and [[Central nucleus of the amygdala|central amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;  Studies on humans which employed neuroimaging during PIT experiments with rewards appear to be consistent with these findings.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Puglisi-Allegra S, Baldassarre G | title = The three principles of action: a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer hypothesis | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 153 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24312025 | pmc = 3832805 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00153 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Addiction===
Due to the effect of reward cues and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer on the amplification of incentive salience for rewarding stimuli, PIT is believed to be one of the mechanisms responsible for producing "cue-triggered wanting", or craving, for a drug that occurs when an individual with a [[drug addiction]] is exposed to [[drug cue]]s{{#tag:ref|Drug cues are environmental contexts, situations, and objects which have been repeatedly associated with drug use through classical conditioning.|group="note"}} even after long periods of abstinence.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Preclinical PIT and incentive salience in addiction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RJ, Schindler CW, Pinkston JW | title = Conditioned stimuli's role in relapse: preclinical research on Pavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 233 | issue = 10 | pages = 1933–1944 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26800688 | pmc = 4863941 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-016-4216-y | quote = Pavlovian learning plays a central role in many theories of addiction, particularly with regard to relapse. In broad terms, encountering drug-paired CSs are hypothesized to precipitate relapse, often, though not always, by increasing motivation to take drugs. Presumably, if a drug-paired CS increases motivation to take drugs, then a drug-paired CS should increase drug consumption.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]]&amp;nbsp;– which is a type of drug cue –&amp;nbsp;as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effect of incentive salience in causing cravings and [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

===Dieting===
The sight or smell of food which one has consumed and enjoyed in the past can elicit hunger (i.e., the motivation to eat) in humans, an effect which is presumably mediated through PIT.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer of reward - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;  In PIT experiments with rats, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus which has been paired with food has been shown to increase instrumental actions that have been reinforced by food, such as pressing a lever which leads to the delivery of a food pellet.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">A '''philosophical theory''' or '''philosophical position'''&lt;ref name="dot"&gt;''Dictionary of Theories'', [[Jennifer Bothamley]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of beliefs that explains or accounts for a general [[philosophy]] or specific branch of philosophy.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The use of the term theory here is a statement of colloquial English and not reflective of the term [[theory]].&lt;ref name="Lacey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lacey |first=A.R. |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |date=1976 |edition=second |page=122 |isbn=0-415-05872-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While any sort of [[thesis]] or opinion may be termed a position, in [[analytic philosophy]] it is thought best to reserve the word "theory" for systematic, comprehensive attempts to solve problems.&lt;ref name="Sparkes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparkes |first=A.W. |title=Talking Philosophy: a wordbook |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, New York |date=1991 |page=114 |isbn=0-415-04222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

In essence, the collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[life stance]], [[religion]], [[world view]], or [[ideology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10608">'''Posthegemony''' or '''post-hegemony''' is a period or a situation in which [[hegemony]] is no longer said to function as the organizing principle of a national or post-national [[social order]], or of the relationships between and amongst [[nation state]]s within the global order.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|p=327|ps=: "Posthegemony&amp;nbsp;... is no longer a name for the hegemony of transnational capital, but the name of those 'places in which hegemony ceases to make sense' (Jean Franco)."}} The concept has different meanings within the fields of [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], and [[international relations]].

==In cultural studies==
In the field of [[cultural studies]], posthegemony has been developed as a concept by a number of critics whose work engages with and critiques the use of [[cultural hegemony]] theory within the writings of [[Ernesto Laclau]] and within [[subaltern studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{harvp|Yúdice|1995}}, {{harvp|Moreiras|2001}}, {{harvp|Williams|2002}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Yúdice, in 1995, was one of the first commentators to summarize the background to the emergence of this concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flexible accumulation, consumer culture, and the "new world information order" are produced or distributed (made to flow) globally, to occupy the space of the nation, but are no longer "motivated" by any essential connections to a state, as embodied, for example, in a "national-popular" formation. Their motivations are both infra- and [[Supranational union|supranational]]. '''We might say that, from the purview of the national proscenium, a posthegemonic situation holds.''' That is, the "compromise solution" that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational. Instead, the "culture-ideology of consumerism" serves to naturalize global capitalism everywhere [emphasis added].{{sfnp|Yúdice|1995|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of posthegemony is related to the rise of the "[[multitude]]" as a social force which, unlike the "people", cannot be captured by [[hegemony]], together with the roles of [[affect (philosophy)|affect]] and [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] in mechanisms of social control and agency.&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2000}}, {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2004}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Posthegemony and its related terms are influenced by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]]’s accounts of the supra- and infra-national forces that are said to have rendered obsolete the national-popular forms of coercion and consent through which, for [[Antonio Gramsci]], hegemony structured and constituted society.

The features of posthegemony as a concept correspond closely to those of [[postmodernity]]. Thus, posthegemony theory argues that ideology is no longer a political driving force in mechanisms of social control and that the modernist theory of hegemony, which depends on ideology, therefore no longer accurately reflects the [[social order]].{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=119}} Some commentators also argue that history is not, as [[Karl Marx]] described it, a [[class struggle]], but rather a "struggle to produce class".{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=120}}

The concept of posthegemony also resonates with the work of post-[[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] theorists such as [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Nicholas Thoburn, drawing on Agamben's discussion on the "state of exception", writes that "it is, perhaps, with the recasting of the relationship between law and politico-military and economic crises and interventions that is instituted in the state of exception that the time of hegemony is most revealed to have passed."{{sfnp|Thoburn|2007|p=89}}

== In international relations ==
In [[international relations]], ''posthegemony'' refers to the decline of the US [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] hegemony. This has likely been the result of the difficulties that have arisen out of the unilateral style [[foreign policy]]. These difficulties predominantly include disdain from; those directly affected by the, sometimes forceful, hegemonic actions of the US, those who spectated the actions, and even Americans themselves who view the actions of their government as immoral. For example, after the [[Vietnam War]], in 1978, 72 per cent of Americans thought the war was not a mistake but fundamentally wrong and immoral.{{sfnp|Hagopian|2009|p=13}} This exemplifies the hegemonic decline: how could the US maintain the legitimacy of their interventions if their own citizens find them wrong and immoral?{{tone inline|date=June 2018}}

The dominant power(s) of the world is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage,
{{quote|there have been no shortage of people who, from the rise of the [Soviet Union's] space programme in the 1950s, through to the third world revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere, and to the emergence of Japan, Europe and now China as major economic powers, have predicted that US dominance, predominance, hegemony or, in more recent, [[post–Cold War era|post–Cold War]] terms, "unipolarity", are ebbing away.{{sfnp|Halliday|2008|p=12}}}}
The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people could still see the inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage.

==Criticism==

Among the criticisms of the theory of posthegemony is Richard Johnson's, that it involves "a marked reduction of social complexity."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} Johnson concedes that "one considerable achievement of 'the post-hegemony project' is to draw many observable [[post-9/11]] features into a single imaginative picture, while also synthesizing different currents in contemporary social theory." But he argues that "it is strange, however, that the result is viewed as the end of hegemony rather than as a new hegemonic moment."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} He, therefore, calls for a rejuvenation of the concept of hegemony, rather than its abandonment.

The service involves signing up, filling out a profile based on the user's preferences, and agreeing to send a gift to a randomly assigned user.&lt;ref name="IrishTimesRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boran|first1=Marie|title=Give and receive gifts online with Redditgifts|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/give-and-receive-gifts-online-with-redditgifts-1.2789833|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The service is a [[gift exchange]] designed for Reddit users. It matches a Reddit user with another Reddit user, and each user must then send a gift to the other user according to that user's tastes and preferences listed on their profile.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumparak|first1=Greg|title=Reddit Acquires Fan-Made Secret Santa Site, RedditGifts|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/23/reddit-acquires-redditgifts/|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=TechCrunch|date=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation is free, although extra perks can be purchased with the optional "RedditGifts Elves" membership,&lt;ref name="AboutRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is this all about?|url=https://www.redditgifts.com/about/|website=RedditGifts|publisher=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and goods are usually priced between $10 and $25 USD.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shih|first1=Gerry|title=Reddit aims for profitability with geek-culture bazaar|url=http://www.afr.com/business/retail/reddit-aims-for-profitability-with-geekculture-bazaar-20131228-iyd0a|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=Australian Financial Review|date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service also requests that users leave "thank-you notes" for their gift-giver on the website.&lt;ref name="GeekSundryDYK"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Jessica|title=Redditgifts: Why I Send Presents to Strangers|url=https://geekandsundry.com/redditgifts-why-i-send-presents-to-strangers/|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=Geek &amp; Sundry|date=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since starting as a [[Secret Santa]] exchange, RedditGifts has added a variety of different themed exchanges that run throughout the year, such as [[Nintendo]] and [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name="AboutRG" /&gt; The service also runs Arbitrary Day, "a celebration of nothing in particular". Up to 2011, approximately $1.5 million had been spent by Reddit users on the project.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Microsoft chairman and philanthropist [[Bill Gates]] has participated in the service for five years under the username "thisisbillgates",&lt;ref name="BillGatesFiveTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clifford|first1=Catherine|title=Billionaire Bill Gates was this cat lover’s Secret Santa — here’s the epic haul of gifts he gave her|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/22/what-billionaire-bill-gates-gave-his-reddit-secret-santa.html|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=CNBC|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in 2013 and in 2014,&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Onfro|first1=Jillian|title=Bill Gates Got One Lucky Reddit User An Incredibly Thoughtful Secret Santa Gift|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bill-gates-reddit-secret-santa-gift-2014-12|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=Business Insider Australia|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] confirmed this.&lt;ref name="BillGatesSMH"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prakash|first1=Neha|title=Bill Gates gives secret Santa present on Reddit|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/bill-gates-gives-secret-santa-present-on-reddit-20131220-2zozf.html|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates was noted to send objects to Reddit users like "Calid7" (a 25-year-old Californian woman),&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt; such as a travel book and a stuffed cow.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt; He has also been known to donate to charities in the name of the user he has been matched with.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt;

==History==
RedditGifts was originally created by Reddit user Dan McComas,&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ries|first1=Brian|title=Secret Santa: The Creator of Reddit's Gift Exchange, the World's Biggest|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-santa-the-creator-of-reddits-gift-exchange-the-worlds-biggest|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "kickme444" as known on the site, and "5days". McComas first conceived the idea while working on freelance projects in 2009.&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG" /&gt;

The site was launched in 2009 with 4,500 participants;&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; the website reports that 212,894 people worldwide participated in the event during 2014.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt;

The site is a three-time [[Guinness World Record]] holder for the World's Largest Gift Exchange.&lt;ref name="WorldRecordRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=redditgifts Secret Santa Guinness World Record|url=https://www.redditgifts.com/blog/view/worldrecord/|website=RedditGifts|publisher=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldRecordGWR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest online Secret Santa game|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-online-secret-santa-game|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reddit acquisition===
In August 2011, Reddit bought the RedditGifts site. The two site-runners reportedly could not afford to continue maintaining the site while simultaneously working their day jobs. Both site-runners continued to run the website, although they are not involved with the daily operations of Reddit.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; The company takes a 15 to 20 percent cut of every purchase. Reddit operates the website as part of its ongoing plans to monetise their website. As of December 2013, approximately 14 percent of Reddit's revenue came from running the service, although McComas said that those sales alone could "put Reddit firmly in the black", and that the company may choose to reinvest funds in [[e-commerce]] customer service and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

In December 2013, while expressing his desire for the Reddit business to become self-sustaining, then-Chief Executive [[Yishan Wong]] stated that the RedditGifts service "provides real value", and called it "promising" for the business. Wong increased the staff count dedicated to the project to eight after realising the service's potential.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

'''{{lang|la|Reductio ad Hitlerum}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|t|l|ər|əm}}; pseudo-Latin for "reduction to Hitler"; sometimes '''''argumentum ad Hitlerum''''', "argument to Hitler", '''{{lang|la|ad Nazium}}''', "to Nazism"), or '''playing the Nazi card''', is an attempt to invalidate someone else's position on the basis that the same view was held by [[Adolf Hitler]] or the [[Nazi Party]],&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma"/&gt; for example: "Hitler was against tobacco smoking, X is against tobacco smoking, therefore X is a Nazi".

Coined by [[Leo Strauss]] in 1953, {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} borrows its name from the term used in logic, {{lang|la|[[reductio ad absurdum]]}} (reduction to the absurd).&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''Natural Right and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965 [1953], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strauss, {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is a form of {{lang|la|[[ad hominem]]}}, {{lang|la|[[argumentum ad misericordiam|ad misericordiam]]}}, or a {{lang|la|[[Ignoratio elenchi|fallacy of irrelevance]]}}. The suggested rationale is one of [[association fallacy|guilt by association]]. It is a tactic often used to derail arguments, because such comparisons tend to distract and anger the opponent, as Hitler and Nazism have been condemned in the modern world.&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnazium.html|title=Logical Fallacy: The Hitler Card|work=Fallacy Files|year=2004|last=Curtis|first=Gary N.|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallacious nature==
{{lang|la|Reductio ad Hitlerum}} is a form of [[association fallacy]].&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/guiltbya.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Guilt by Association|work=Fallacy Files|year=2004|last=Curtis|first=Gary N.|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that a policy leads to {{ndash}} or is the same as {{ndash}} one advocated or implemented by [[Adolf Hitler]] or the [[Third Reich]] and so "proves" that the original policy is undesirable.

Another instance of {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is asking a question of the form "You know who else...?" with the deliberate intent of impugning a certain idea or action by implying Hitler held that idea or performed such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ask.metafilter.com/71925/You-know-who-else-Origin |title=You know who else ___? Origin? - catchphrase meme |publisher=Ask MetaFilter |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An invocation of Hitler or Nazism is not a {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} when it illuminates the argument instead of causing distraction from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Gabriel H. Teninbaum}}, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445423 ''Reduction ad Hitlerum'': Trumping the Judicial Nazi Card]. Michigan State Law Review, Vol. 2009, p. 541-578, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is first known to have been used in an article written by [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Leo Strauss]] for ''Measure: A Critical Journal'' in spring 1951;&lt;ref name="Hutchins1951"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchins|first=Robert Maynard|title=Measure: A Critical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6z3WAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 February 2014|year=1951|publisher=H. Regnery Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was made famous in a book by the same author published in 1953&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.edu/cas/psc/bookstrauss.htm |title=Natural Right and History|work=University of Oklahoma|year=2008|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natural Right and History'', Chapter II:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In following this movement towards its end we shall inevitably reach a point beyond which the scene is darkened by the shadow of Hitler. Unfortunately, it does not go without saying that in our examination we must avoid the fallacy that in the last decades has frequently been used as a substitute for the {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}: the {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}. A view is not refuted by the fact that it happens to have been shared by Hitler.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase was derived from the legitimate [[logical argument]] called {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}. The {{lang|la|argumentum}} variant takes its form from the names of many classic fallacies, such as {{lang|la|argumentum ad hominem}}. The {{lang|la|ad Nazium}} variant may be further derived, humorously, from {{lang|la|[[Ad nauseam|argumentum ad nauseam]]}}.

In 2000, [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]] described its use against traditional values:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Leo Strauss called it the {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}. If Hitler liked neoclassical art, that means that classicism in every form is Nazi; if Hitler wanted to strengthen the German family, that makes the traditional family (and its defenders) Nazi; if Hitler spoke of the "nation" or the "folk", then any invocation of nationality, ethnicity, or even folkishness is Nazi ...&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fleming, editor, ''Chronicles'' (Rockford, Illinois), May 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Limits to classification as a fallacy==
Some historians studying [[the Holocaust]] argue that not all comparisons to Hitler and Nazism are logical fallacies since if they all were, there would be nothing to learn from the events that led to the Holocaust. That would undermine the entire significance of studying the Holocaust to avoid future [[genocide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.proquest.com/openview/8690dfba45e051dab6cbf8b92ef45f3b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=589 Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust], Daniel Jonah Goldhagen 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eichmann was Outrageously Stupid". Hannah Arendt: The Last Interview: And Other Conversations. November 9, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of this point do make distinctions between many different categories of comparison(s) to Hitler, some of which are fallacies, some of which are not, and some of which may or may not be fallacies. This approach is also critical to strict refusal to acknowledge similarities to the Holocaust, since there were early stages leading up to it and policies today can be comparable to those without being comparable to the "final solution". Advocates of this approach argue that such early stages are those where something can really be done about it, before it is too late.&lt;ref name="Y. Michael Barilan, 2004"&gt;Y. Michael Barilan, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Categories include:
* Similarities that are not in any way related to political or institutional decision making, e.g. going on walks or wearing expensive clothes. These are invariably fallacies when used as arguments.
* Similarities that are related to politics, in the absence of centralized power. This example usually refers to political party and movements still struggling to gain power. These similarities can only be to early stages of Nazism, not to a full-blown organized genocide. These comparisons may or may not be fallacies: a detailed analysis of methods, decision-making and ideology is necessary to determine that.
* Pointing out that Hitler did some things that are often considered to be related to being good in the context of criticizing psychological assumptions of them being connected, without implying that anyone doing them are like Hitler in other ways. E.g. that Hitler's engagement for animal protection shows that treatment of animals is divorced from treatment of humans, not implying a negative connection but mere non-connection. This is not an example of the fallacy, though not directly related to the study of organized genocide either.
* Pointing out that the Nazis believed in some things that are often thought to be protection from persecution within the context of rejecting assumptions about connections between concepts and tolerance. For example, that the Nazis believed [[homosexuality]] to be innate and, far from tolerating it, extended their [[homophobia]] to relatives as well, just to show that ideas on origin of a behavior (in this case homosexuality, but also applicable to other things) is unrelated to tolerance of said behavior and not implying that an idea is Nazi-like. This is not a fallacy. It does not show what should be done to prevent repetition, but it narrows it down by eliminating irrelevancies.
* Pointing out similarities between the Nazi [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and modern chain of command as a risk factor for genocide shared between Nazi and modern society in general without applying it to individuals specifically, e.g. that administrative and military laws are significant risk factors. It does not imply advocacy of a repetition of the [[Nuremberg trials]] to those who only follow orders/obey laws, partly since referring to that trial as a source of authority would promote the [[death penalty]] exactly as much as "superior orders is no defense" and partly since forcing individual executioners into a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation is ineffective for preventing organized genocides like the Holocaust. Instead, it is criticism of structures and laws that lead to dangerous officiousness. This is not a fallacy. It is relevant for genocide studies.&lt;ref name="Y. Michael Barilan, 2004"/&gt;

===Antecedents===
Although named for and formalized around Hitler, the logical fallacy existed prior to the [[Second World War]]. There were other individuals from history who were used as stand-ins for pure evil.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/explainer/2011/10/hank_williams_jr_firing_who_was_the_rhetorical_worst_person_in_h.html |title=Before Hitler, Who Was the Stand-In for Pure Evil? |work=Slate |author=Brian Palmer |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus]] was commonly seen as the most villainous person in history.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; In the years prior to the Civil War, abolitionists referred to slaveholders as modern-day Pharaohs. After [[VE Day]], Pharaoh continued to appear in the speeches of social reformers like [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; [[Judas Iscariot]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] were also commonly held up as pure evil. However, there was no universal Hitler-like person and different regions and times used different stand-ins.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; In the years after the [[American Revolution]], [[King George III]] was often vilified in the United States. [[Andrew Jackson]] was also called [[King Andrew the First]]. During the Civil War, some Southerners spoke of Lincoln in Hitler-like terms. Some Confederates even called Lincoln a "modern Pharaoh".&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt;

==Invocations==
In 1991, Michael André Bernstein alleged {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} over a full-page advertisement placed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by the [[Lubavitch]] community, following the [[Crown Heights Riot]], under the heading "This Year ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights." [[Henry Schwarzschild]], who had witnessed ''Kristallnacht'', wrote to the ''New York Times'' that "however ugly were the anti-Semitic slogans and the assaultive behavior of people in the streets [during the Crown Heights riots]... one thing that clearly did not take place was a ''Kristallnacht''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=The Lubavitcher community itself, in the form of the 'Crown Heights Emergency Fund,' placed a full-page advertisement in ''The New York Times'' on September 20, 1991, under the heading 'This Year Kristallnacht Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights.' Their version of Leo Strauss's {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} was rightly perceived by those who had been in Germany on Kristallnacht (November 9, 1938) as an outrageous comparison.|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft3x0nb2ns|title=Foregone Conclusions|publisher=Escholarship.org|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American conservative radio and television host [[Glenn Beck]] is often criticized for his frequent use of {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}, including a controversial statement comparing the victims of the [[2011 Norway attacks]] to members of the [[Hitler Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/26/glenn-beck-site-of-norway-massacre-sounds-like-the-hitler-youth/|title=Glenn Beck: Site of Norway Massacre 'Sounds like the Hitler Youth'|work=Time|date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck has also compared the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to [[Joseph Goebbels]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenn Beck Show'', November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] to Hitler's [[Sturmabteilung|"Brown Shirts"]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenn Beck Show'', May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The American Conservative]]'' accused [[Jonah Goldberg]]'s book ''[[Liberal Fascism]]'' of employing the {{lang|la|reductio}} fallacy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That Nazism and contemporary liberalism both promote healthy living is as meaningless a finding as that [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|bloody marys]] and [[martini (cocktail)|martinis]] may both be made with [[gin]]. Repeatedly, Goldberg fails to recognize a {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}. ... In no case does Goldberg uncover anything more ominous than a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/goldbergs-trivial-pursuit/|title=Goldberg's Trivial Pursuit|author=Austin Bramwell|date=January 28, 2008|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">The '''Roy model''' is one of the earliest works in economics on [[Self-selection (labor economics)|self-selection]] due to [[A.D. Roy]]. The basic model considers two types of workers that choose occupation in one of two sectors. 

==Original model==
Roy's original paper deals with workers selecting into fishing and hunting professions, where there is no uncertainty about the amount of goods (fish or rabbits) that will be caught in a given period, but fishing is more costly as it requires more skill. The central question that Roy tries to answer in the original paper is whether the best hunters will hunt and the best fishermen will fish. While the discussion is non-mathematical, it is observed that choices will depend on the distribution of skills, the correlation between these skills in the population, and the technology available to use these skills.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A. (1951): Some Thoughts on the Distribution of Earnings. Oxford Economic Papers 3(2), pp. 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==
[[George Borjas]] was the first to formalize the model of Roy in a mathematical sense and apply it to self-selection in [[immigration]]. Specifically, assume source country 0 and destination country 1, with log earnings in a country ''i'' given by ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;= a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;∼N(0, &lt;math&gt;s_i^2&lt;/math&gt; )''. Additionally, assume there is a cost ''C'' associated with migrating from country 0 to country 1 and workers know all parameters and their own realization of e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Borjas then uses the implications of the Roy model to infer something about what wages for immigrants in country 1 would have been had they stayed in country 0 and what wages for non-immigrants in country 0 would have been had they migrated. The third, and final, element needed for this is the correlation between the wages in the two countries, ''ρ''. A worker will choose to immigrate if ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - C + e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0'' which will happen with probability 
''1 - Φ ( v )'' where ''v'' is &lt;math&gt; \frac {(a_{1} - a_{0}-{C})}{s_{v}} &lt;/math&gt; , ''s&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the standard deviation of ''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and  ''Φ'' is the standard normal cdf.&lt;ref&gt;	Borjas, G. J. (1987): Self-Selection and the Earnings of Immigrants. American Economic Review 77(4), pp. 531-553.&lt;/ref&gt;  This leads to the famous central result that the expected wage for immigrants depends on the selection mechanism, as shown in equation (1), where ''ϕ'' is the standard normal pdf and, like before, ''Φ'' is the standard normal cdf.

''E[w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' |''Immigrate''] = a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; +ρs&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;  (\frac {\phi ({v})}{1-\phi ({v}) })	&lt;/math&gt;											(1)

While Borjas was the first to mathematically formalize the Roy model, it has guided thinking in other fields of research as well.

The '''secrecy of correspondence''' ({{lang-de|Briefgeheimnis}}, {{lang-fr|secret de la correspondance}}) or literally translated as '''secrecy of letters''', is a fundamental [[legal principle]] enshrined in the [[constitution]]s of several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Legal Protection of the Secrecy of Correspondence |author=Roxana Maria |journal=Curentul ”Juridic” |year=2009 |number=1 |location=Tîrgu-Mureş, România |url=http://revcurentjur.ro/arhiva/attachments_200901/recjurid091_10F.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=1936 Constitution of the USSR |chapter=Chapter X, Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, Article 128 |url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons04.html#chap10 |quote=The inviolability of the homes of citizens and privacy of correspondence are protected by law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

It is thus the main legal basis for the assumption of '''privacy of correspondence'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The principle has been naturally extended to other forms of [[telecommunication|communication]], including [[telephony]] and [[electronic communication]]s on the [[Internet]] as the constitutional guarantees are generally thought to cover also these forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Constitution to extend protection to e-mails |date=11 July 2014 |publisher=Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations - Government of the Netherlands |url=http://www.government.nl/ministries/bzk/news/2014/07/16/constitution-to-extend-protection-to-e-mails.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, national telecommunications privacy laws may allow [[lawful interception]], i.e. [[wiretapping]] and monitoring of electronic communications in cases of [[Suspect|suspicion of crime]]. Paper letters have in most jurisdictions remained outside the legal scope of law enforcement [[surveillance]], even in cases of ''"reasonable searches and seizures"''.

When applied to electronic communication, the principle protects not only the content of the communication, but also the information on when and to whom any messages (if any) have been sent (see: [[Call detail record]]s), and in the case of [[Mobile phone|mobile communication]], the [[location information]] of the mobile units. As a consequence, in jurisdictions with a safeguard on secrecy of letters, location data collected from mobile phone networks has a higher level of protection than data collected by [[vehicle telematics]] or transport tickets.

==United States==
{{See also|Third-party doctrine}}
In the [[United States]] there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through [[litigation]] from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In an 1877 case the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No law of [[United States Congress|Congress]] can place in the hands of officials connected with the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] any authority to invade the '''secrecy of letters''' and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Jackson'', {{ussc| source=f |96|727|1877| pin=733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has [[California v. Greenwood|even been argued]] to extend to the contents of [[trash can]]s outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations.  By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]".

A '''self-replicating machine''' is a type of [[autonomous robot]] that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting [[self-replication]] in a way analogous to that found in [[nature]]. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by [[Homer Jacobsen]], [[Edward F. Moore]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[John von Neumann]] and in more recent times by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his book on [[nanotechnology]], ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (coining the term '''clanking replicator ''' for such machines) and by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in their review ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines''&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"&gt;{{cite book| last=Freitas| first=Robert A.|author2=Ralph C. Merkle | title=Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines| year=2004| publisher=Landes Bioscience| location=Georgetown, Texas| isbn=1-57059-690-5| url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space. The future development of such technology is an integral part of several plans involving the mining of [[moon]]s and [[asteroid]] belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of [[solar power satellite]]s in space. The possibly misnamed [[von Neumann probe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p3 |title=3.11 Freitas Interstellar Probe Replicator (1979-1980) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]], a self-replicating machine that would operate in a [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] environment.

A self-replicating machine is an artificial [[self-replication|self-replicating]] system that relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. Certain idiosyncratic terms are occasionally found in the literature. For example, the term clanking replicator was once used by Drexler&lt;ref name=EoC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_4.html#section01of03| title=Engines of Abundance (Chapter 4) Clanking Replicators| work=Engines of Creation| first=K. Eric| last=Drexler| year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish macroscale replicating systems from the microscopic [[nanorobot]]s or "[[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]]" that [[nanotechnology]] may make possible, but the term is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions. Replicators have also been called "von Neumann machines" after John von Neumann, who first rigorously studied the idea. However, the term "von Neumann machine" is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated [[Von Neumann architecture|computer architecture]] that von Neumann proposed and so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important.&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"/&gt; Von Neumann himself used the term [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] to describe such self-replicating machines.

Historians of [[machine tool]]s, even before the [[numerical control]] era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines because they have the ability to "reproduce themselves"&lt;ref name="Colvin1947pp6-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later planning and programming the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for [[RepRap Project|RepRaps]], which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such non-autonomous "self-replication". In contrast, machines that are ''truly autonomously'' self-replicating (like [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]]) are the main subject discussed here.

==History==

The general concept of artificial machines capable of producing copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher [[René Descartes]], who suggested to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] that the human body could be regarded as a machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering "see to it that it reproduces offspring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American| title=Build Your Own Replicator| volume=285|date=August 2001| pages=38–39| first=Moshe| last= Sipper|author2=James A. Reggia }} Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] proposed in his 1872 novel ''[[Erewhon]]'' that machines were already capable of reproducing themselves but it was man who made them do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p5 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and added that ''"machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Butler |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew.html |title=Erewhon, Chapter 24, The book Of the Machines |publisher=Nzetc.org |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] 1879 book ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]'', a series of essays that she wrote in the character of a fictional scholar named Theophrastus, the essay "Shadows of the Coming Race" speculated about self-replicating machines, with Theophrastus asking "how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply, self-repair, and reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Eliot |url=http://www.online-literature.com/george_eliot/theophrastus-such/17/ |title=Impressions of Theophrastus Such, Chapter 17, Shadows of the Coming Race |publisher=online-literature.com |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 [[William Paley]] formulated the first known [[teleological argument]] depicting machines producing other machines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p11 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the [[watchmaker argument|question of who originally made a watch]] was rendered moot if it were demonstrated that the watch was able to manufacture a copy of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=William| last= Paley| title= Natural Theology: or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature| chapter=Chapter i, Section 1| publisher= E. Goodale| year= 1802| isbn=0-576-29166-8}}; [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/p/pd-modeng/pd-modeng-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=TEI.2&amp;byte=53049319 (12th Edition, 1809)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} See also: {{cite book| editor=Michael Ruse| title=Philosophy of Biology| year=1998| pages=36–40}}; {{cite journal| first=Richard| last= Lenski| title=Twice as Natural| journal=Nature| volume= 414|date=15 November 2001| page=255| doi=10.1038/35104715| pmid=11713507| issue=6861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific study of self-reproducing machines was anticipated by [[John Bernal]] as early as 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Bernal/| last=Bernal| first= John Desmond| title=The World, the Flesh and the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul| year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mathematicians such as [[Stephen Kleene]] who began developing [[recursion theory]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p14 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this latter work was motivated by interest in information processing and algorithms rather than physical implementation of such a system, however. In the course of the 1950s, suggestions of several increasingly simple mechanical systems capable of self-reproduction were made—notably by [[Lionel Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1179|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===von Neumann's kinematic model===

A detailed conceptual proposal for a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward by mathematician [[John von Neumann]] in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton model as a [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=von Neumann| first=John| year=1966| title=The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata| editor= A. Burks| publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press| location= Urbana, IL| isbn=0-598-37798-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.htm |title=2.1 Von Neumann's Contributions |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann's concept of a physical self-replicating machine was dealt with only abstractly, with the hypothetical machine using a "sea" or stockroom of spare parts as its source of raw materials. The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this "sea" using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due to the difficulty of analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more abstract model self-replicator based on [[cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.3.htm |title=2.1.3 The Cellular Automaton (CA) Model of Machine Replication |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kemeny| first=John G.| title=Man Viewed as a Machine| journal=Scientific American| volume=192|date=April 1955| issue=4| pages=58–67| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0455-58| bibcode=1955SciAm.192d..58K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore's artificial living plants===

In 1956 mathematician [[Edward F. Moore]] proposed the first known suggestion for a practical real-world self-replicating machine, also published in ''Scientific American''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| first=Edward F.| last=Moore|date=October 1956| volume=195| title=Artificial Living Plants| issue=4| pages=118–126| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1056-118| bibcode=1956SciAm.195d.118M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.1.htm |title=3.1 Moore Artificial Living Plants (1956) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's "artificial living plants" were proposed as machines able to use air, water and soil as sources of raw materials and to draw its energy from sunlight via a [[solar cell|solar battery]] or a [[steam engine]]. He chose the seashore as an initial habitat for such machines, giving them easy access to the chemicals in seawater, and suggested that later generations of the machine could be designed to float freely on the ocean's surface as self-replicating factory barges or to be placed in barren desert terrain that was otherwise useless for industrial purposes. The self-replicators would be "harvested" for their component parts, to be used by humanity in other non-replicating machines.

===Dyson's replicating systems===

The next major development of the concept of self-replicating machines was a series of thought experiments proposed by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1970 Vanuxem Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "The twenty-first century," Vanuxem Lecture delivered at Princeton University, 26 February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.6.htm |title=3.6 Dyson Terraforming Replicators (1970, 1979) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed three large-scale applications of machine replicators. First was to send a self-replicating system to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], which in addition to producing copies of itself would also be programmed to manufacture and launch [[solar sail]]-propelled cargo spacecraft. These spacecraft would carry blocks of Enceladean ice to [[Mars]], where they would be used to [[Terraforming of Mars|terraform the planet]]. His second proposal was a solar-powered factory system designed for a terrestrial desert environment, and his third was an "industrial development kit" based on this replicator that could be sold to developing countries to provide them with as much industrial capacity as desired. When Dyson revised and reprinted his lecture in 1979 he added proposals for a modified version of Moore's seagoing artificial living plants that was designed to distill and store fresh water for human use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chapter 18: Thought Experiments| work=Disturbing the Universe| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| year=1979| publisher=Harper and Row| location=New York| pages=194–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Astrochicken]]."

===''Advanced Automation for Space Missions''===
[[File:Advanced Automation for Space Missions figure 5-19.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a "self-growing" robotic lunar factory]]

In 1980, inspired by a 1979 "New Directions Workshop" held at Wood's Hole, [[NASA]] conducted a joint summer study with [[ASEE]] entitled [[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The study was conducted at [[Santa Clara University]] and ran from June 23 to August 29, with the final report published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions |editor=[[Robert Freitas]], William P. Gilbreath| title=Advanced Automation for Space Missions| year=1982| id=NASA Conference Publication CP-2255 (N83-15348)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed system would have been capable of [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] productive capacity and the design could be modified to build self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy.

The reference design included small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails inside the factory, mobile "paving machines" that used large parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight on lunar [[regolith]] to melt and sinter it into a hard surface suitable for building on, and robotic front-end loaders for [[strip mining]]. Raw lunar regolith would be refined by a variety of techniques, primarily [[hydrofluoric acid]] [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]]. Large transports with a variety of manipulator arms and tools were proposed as the constructors that would put together new factories from parts and assemblies produced by its parent.

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery would be placed under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use sculpting tools and templates to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster was selected because the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide [[laser cutting]] and welding system was also included.

A more speculative, more complex microchip fabricator was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins."

A 2004 study supported by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts took this idea further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/883Toth-Fejel.html|title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata: An Approach to Self-Replication|last=Toth-Fejel|first=Tihamer|date=|year=2004|website=|publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts are beginning to consider self-replicating machines for [[asteroid mining]].

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]]. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith.

===Lackner-Wendt Auxon replicators===

In 1995, inspired by Dyson's 1970 suggestion of seeding uninhabited deserts on Earth with self-replicating machines for industrial development, [[Klaus Lackner]] and Christopher Wendt developed a more detailed outline for such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lackner| first=Klaus S.|author2=Christopher H. Wendt | title=Exponential growth of large self-replicating machine systems| journal=Mathl. Comput.

Their proposal didn't include a complete analysis of the system's material requirements, but described a novel method for extracting the ten most common chemical elements found in raw desert topsoil (Na, Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Al, C, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using a high-temperature carbothermic process. This proposal was popularized in [[Discover Magazine]], featuring solar-powered desalination equipment used to irrigate the desert in which the system was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Discover|date=October 1995| first=Thomas| last=Bass| title=Robot, build thyself| pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named their machines "Auxons", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''auxein'' which means "to grow."

Early experimentation with [[rapid prototyping]] in 1997-2000 was not expressly oriented toward reproducing rapid prototyping systems themselves, but rather extended simulated "[[evolutionary robotics]]" techniques into the physical world. Later developments in rapid prototyping have given the process the ability to produce a wide variety of electronic and mechanical components, making this a rapidly developing frontier in self-replicating system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.20.htm |title=Freitas 2004, pp. 64-67 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Chris Phoenix informally outlined a design for a hydraulically powered replicator a few cubic feet in volume that used ultraviolet light to cure soft plastic feedstock and a fluidic logic control system, but didn't address most of the details of assembly procedures, error rates, or machining tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| author=Christopher J. Phoenix| newsgroup=sci.nanotech| title=Partial design for macro-scale machining self-replicator| date=March 21, 1998| url=http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;selm=6f0nui%248ih%241%40news.nanospace.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.20.htm#p8 |title=3.20 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First replication.jpg|300px|right|thumb|All of the plastic parts for the machine on the right were produced by the almost identical machine on the left. (Adrian Bowyer (left) and Vik Olliver(right) are members of the RepRap project.)]]

In 2005, [[Adrian Bowyer]] of the [[University of Bath]] started the [[RepRap Project]] to develop a [[rapid prototyping]] machine which would be able to manufacture some or most of its own components, making such machines cheap enough for people to buy and use in their homes. The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| title=WebHome| accessdate=2007-02-18| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112200308/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| archivedate=2007-01-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RepRap approach uses [[fused deposition modeling]] to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel rods, nuts and bolts, motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally. In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.

Some researchers have proposed a [[microfactory]] of specialized machines that support recursion—nearly all of the parts of all of the machines in the factory can be manufactured by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;

===NIAC studies on self-replicating systems===

In the spirit of the 1980 "Advanced Automation for Space Missions" study, the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] began several studies of self-replicating system design in 2002 and 2003. Four phase I grants were awarded:

*[[Hod Lipson]] ([[Cornell University]]), "Autonomous Self-Extending Machines for Accelerating Space Exploration"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/737Lipson.pdf| title=Autonomous Self-Extending Machines for Accelerating Space Exploration| first=Hod| last= Lipson|author2=Evan Malone | accessdate=2007-01-04| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bootstrapping Self-Replicating Factories in Space===

In 2012, NASA researchers Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani argued for a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | last2=Muscatello | first2=Anthony | last3=Mueller | first3=Robert | last4=Mantovani | first4=James | title=Affordable, Rapid Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Solar System Civilization | journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=18–29 | publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers | date= January 2013 | language=English | url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | access-date=2016-09-24| arxiv=1612.03238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed this concept on the basis of [[In situ resource utilization|In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)]] technologies that NASA has been developing to "live off the land" on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, [[Thomas Kalil]] of the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/14/bootstrapping-solar-system-civilization |title=Bootstrapping a Solar System Civilization |publisher=The White House |date=2014-10-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist [[Mason Peck]] has dubbed "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that you do not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-05/exciting-new-ideas-space-technology-are-getting-short-changed-congress |title=Exciting new ideas in space technology are getting short-changed by Congress |publisher=PRI.org |date=2015-01-15 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of about a third of the space budgets of the [[International Space Station]] partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | title=Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity | journal=Space Policy | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=77–91 | publisher=Elsevier Ltd. | date= August 2016 | language=English | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964616300625 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.08.004 | access-date=2016-12-09 | arxiv=1609.00737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornell University's self-assembler===

In 2005, a team of researchers at [[Cornell University]], including [[Hod Lipson]], implemented a self-assembling machine. The machine is composed of a tower of four articulated [[cube]]s, known as ''molecubes'', which can revolve about a [[triagonal]]. This enables the tower to function as a [[robotic arm]], collecting nearby molecubes and assembling them into a copy of itself. The arm is directed by a [[computer program]], which is contained within each molecube, analogous to how each animal [[cell (biology)|cell]] contains an entire copy of its [[DNA]]. However, the machine cannot manufacture individual molecubes, nor do they occur naturally, so its status as a self-replicator is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news4055.html |title=Researchers build a robot that can reproduce |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York University artificial DNA tile motifs ===

In 2011, a team of scientists at [[New York University]] created a structure called 'BTX' (bent triple helix) based around three double helix molecules, each made from a short strand of DNA.  Treating each group of three double-helices as a code letter, they can (in principle) build up self-replicating structures that encode large quantities of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm |title=Self-Replication Process Holds Promise for Production of New Materials| publisher=Science Daily |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html |title=Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns|journal=Nature|accessdate=2011-10-13|volume=478|doi=10.1038/nature10500|pages=225–228|bibcode=2011Natur.478..225W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of magnetic polymers ===

In 2001 Jarle Breivik at [[University of Oslo]] created a system of magnetic building blocks, which in response to temperature fluctuations, spontaneously form self-replicating polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/3/4/273 |title=Self-Organization of Template-Replicating Polymers and the Spontaneous Rise of Genetic Information| publisher=Entroy |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of neural circuits ===

In 1968 [[Zellig Harris]] wrote that "the metalanguage is in the language,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Mathematical Structures of Language|page=17|last=Harris|first=Zellig|year=1968|publisher=John Wiley and Son|location= New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that self-replication is part of language. In 1977 [[Niklaus Wirth]] formalized this proposition by publishing a self-replicating [[deterministic context-free grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wirth|first1=Niklaus|title= What can we do about the unnecessary diversity of notation for syntactic definitions?|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=20|pages=822–823|doi=10.1145/359863.359883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to it probabilities, [[Bertrand du Castel]] published in 2015 a self-replicating [[stochastic grammar]] and presented a mapping of that grammar to [[neural networks]], thereby presenting a [[Conceptual model|model]] for a self-replicating neural circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|publisher=EPFL|location=Lausanne|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial construction==
Partial construction is the concept that the constructor creates a partially constructed (rather than fully formed) offspring, which is then left to complete its own construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Automata 2008| title=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biological Theory| title=Computational Ontogeny| volume=3| issue=1| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.1.3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The von Neumann model of self-replication envisages that the mother automaton should construct all portions of daughter automatons, without exception and prior to the initiation of such daughters. Partial construction alters the construction relationship between mother and daughter automatons, such that the mother constructs but a portion of the daughter, and upon initiating this portion of the daughter, thereafter retracts from imparting further influence upon the daughter. Instead, the daughter automaton is left to complete its own development. This is to say, means exist by which automatons may develop via the mechanism of a zygote.

==Self-replicating spacecraft==
{{Main article|Self-replicating spacecraft}}

The idea of an automated spacecraft capable of constructing copies of itself was first proposed in scientific literature in 1974 by [[Michael A. Arbib]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p1 |title=3.11 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael A.| last=Arbib| title=The Likelihood of the Evolution of Communicating Intelligences on Other Planets| work= Interstellar Communication: Scientific Perspectives| editor=Cyril Ponnamperuma, A. G. W. Cameron| location=Boston| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company| year=1974| pages=59–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept had appeared earlier in [[science fiction]] such as the 1967 novel ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]] or the 1950 novellette trilogy ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]]. The first quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-01|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..251F }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

== Prospects for implementation ==
As the use of industrial automation has expanded over time, some factories have begun to approach a semblance of self-sufficiency that is suggestive of self-replicating machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.7.htm |title=3.7 Self-Replicating Automated Industrial Factory (1973-present) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such factories are unlikely to achieve "full closure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.6.htm |title=5.6 Closure Theory and Closure Engineering |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the cost and flexibility of automated machinery comes close to that of human labour and the manufacture of spare parts and other components locally becomes more economical than transporting them from elsewhere. As [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] has pointed out in [[Erewhon]], replication of partially closed universal machine tool factories is already possible. Since safety is a primary goal of all legislative consideration of regulation of such development, future development efforts may be limited to systems which lack either control, matter, or energy closure. Fully capable machine replicators are most useful for developing resources in dangerous environments which are not easily reached by existing transportation systems (such as [[outer space]]).

An artificial replicator can be considered to be a form of [[artificial life]]. Depending on its design, it might be subject to [[evolution]] over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.L.htm |title=5.1.9.L Evolvability |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with robust [[error correction]], and the possibility of external intervention, the common [[science fiction]] scenario of robotic life run amok will remain extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.11.htm |title=5.11 Replicators and Public Safety |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ship's bell''' is used to indicate the time aboard a [[ship]] and hence to regulate the sailors' duty [[watch system|watch]]es.  The bell itself is usually made of brass or bronze, and normally has the ship's name engraved or cast on it.

==Strikes of the ship's bell==
===Timing of duty periods===
Unlike civil [[clock]] bells, the strikes of a ship's bell do not accord to the number of the hour. Instead, there are eight bells, one for each half-hour of a four-hour watch. In the age of sailing, watches were timed with a 30-minute hourglass. Bells would be struck every time the glass was turned, and in a pattern of pairs for easier counting, with any odd bells at the end of the sequence.

Most of the crew of a ship would be divided into two to four groups, called [[watch system|watches]]. Each watch would take its turn with the essential activities of manning the helm, navigating, trimming sails, and keeping a lookout.

The hours between 16:00 and 20:00 are so arranged because that watch (the "[[dog watch]]") was divided in two. The odd number of watches aimed to give each man a different watch each day; it also allowed the entire crew of a vessel to eat an evening meal, the normal time being at 17:00 with first dog watchmen eating at 18:00.&lt;ref name=BHI /&gt;

===Other uses for bell strikes===

*Ship's bells are also used for safety in foggy conditions, their most important modern use.&lt;ref name="NMM"/&gt; 
*On US naval vessels, bells additionally are rung as "boat gongs" for officers and dignitaries coming aboard or leaving the ship, in a number equivalent to the number of [[sideboy]]s to which the visitor is entitled.&lt;ref&gt;www.seaflags.us/customs/trads.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*At midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], 16 bells would be struck&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; eight bells for the old year and eight bells for the new.
*When a sailor has died he or she can be honoured with the sounding of eight bells; meaning "end of the watch". The term "eight bells" can also be used in an [[obituary]], as a nautical [[euphemism]] for ''finished''.

==Name of the ship==
[[File:HMS Cavalier ship's bell.jpg|thumb|Ship's bell of {{HMS|Cavalier|R73|6}}]]
The ship's name is traditionally engraved or cast onto the surface of the bell, often with the year the ship was launched, as well. Occasionally (especially on more modern ships) the bell will also carry the name of the [[shipyard]] that built the ship. If a ship's name is changed, maritime tradition is that the original bell carrying the original name will remain with the vessel. A ship's bell is a prized possession when a ship is broken up&lt;ref name="NMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=EQA0482|title=Ship's Bell|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=2008-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209002216/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=EQA0482|archivedate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often provides the only positive means of identification in the case of a [[shipwreck]].

==Number of bells==

Most [[United States Navy]] ships of the post–World War II era have actually carried two ship's bells: the official bell on deck and a smaller one in the pilot house and at the quarterdeck at the [[1MC]] (public address) station, used when the ship is underway.

==Cook and boatswain==
According to seafaring legend, the ship's [[cook (profession)|cook]]s and [[Boatswain|boatswain's mates]] had a duty arrangement to give the cooks more sleep. The boatswain's mates, who worked 24 hours a day on [[watchstanding|watches]], would build the fire in the [[kitchen stove|stove]], so the cook could get up a little while later and the fire would be already going so he could begin preparing [[breakfast]]. In return, between meals, the cooks would shine the bell, which was traditionally the boatswain's mates' responsibility.

==Baptizing children==
It is a naval tradition to [[Baptism|baptize]] children using the ship's bell as a [[baptismal font]] and to engrave the names of the children on the bell afterwards. Christening information from the bells held by the [[CFB Esquimalt|Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt]] Museum has been entered into a searchable data archive.&lt;ref name=CFB&gt;{{cite web|title=The Christening Bells Project|url=http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/bells/bells.asp|website=CFB Esquimalt Naval &amp; Military Museum|accessdate=6 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230223824/http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/bells/bells.asp|archivedate=30 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''signal-to-interference ratio''' ('''SIR''' or '''''S/I'''''), also known as the '''carrier-to-interference ratio''' ('''CIR''' or '''''C/I'''''), is the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power ''S'' or ''C'' and the average received [[co-channel interference]] power ''I'', i.e. [[cross-talk]], from other transmitters than the useful signal. 

The CIR resembles the [[carrier-to-noise ratio]] (CNR or ''C/N''), which is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR or ''S/N'') of a modulated signal before demodulation. A distinction is that interfering radio transmitters contributing to ''I'' may be controlled by [[radio resource management]], while ''N'' involves noise power from other sources, typically [[additive white gaussian noise]] (AWGN).

==Carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio (CNIR)==
The CIR ratio is studied in interference limited systems, i.e. where ''I'' dominates over ''N'', typically in cellular radio systems and broadcasting systems where frequency channels are reused in view to achieve high level of area coverage. The ''C/N'' is studied in noise limited systems. If both situations can occur, the '''carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio''' ('''CNIR''' or '''''C/(N+I)''''') may be studied.

'''Social engineering''' is a discipline in [[social science]] that refers to efforts to [[psychological manipulation|influence]] particular [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[social behavior]]s on a large scale, whether by [[government]]s, [[mass media|media]] or private groups in order to produce desired characteristics in a target population. Social engineering can also be understood philosophically as a deterministic phenomenon where the intentions and goals of the architects of the new [[Social constructionism|social construct]] are realized.

Social engineers use the [[scientific method]] to analyze and understand social systems in order to design the appropriate methods to achieve the desired results in the human subjects.

==Overview==
[[Decision-making]] can affect the safety and survival of billions of people. The scientific theory expressed by German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'',&lt;ref&gt;''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569–688&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that society can no longer operate successfully using outmoded methods of social management. To achieve the best outcomes, all conclusions and decisions must use the most advanced techniques and include reliable [[statistics|statistical data]], which can be applied to a [[social structure|social system]]. According to this, social engineering is a data-based [[systems theory|scientific system]] used to develop a [[sustainability|sustainable]] design so as to achieve the intelligent management of Earth’s resources and human capital with the highest levels of freedom, prosperity, and happiness within a population.

As a result of abuse by authoritarian regimes and other non-inclusive attempts at social engineering, the term has in cases been imbued with a negative connotation. In British and Canadian [[jurisprudence]], changing public attitudes about a behaviour is accepted as one of the key functions of laws prohibiting the behaviour. Governments also influence behavior more subtly through incentives and disincentives built into economic policy and tax policy, for instance, and have done so for centuries.

R. D. Ingthorsson states that a human being is a biological creature from birth but is from then on shaped as a person through [[social influence]]s (upbringing/[[socialisation]]) and is in that sense a social construction, a product of society.

==History==
The Dutch industrialist J.C. Van Marken ([[:de:Jacob van Marken|de]]) introduced the term ''sociale ingenieurs'' in an essay in 1894. The idea was that modern employers needed the assistance of specialists—"social engineers"—in handling the ''human'' challenges, just as they needed technical expertise (traditional engineers) to deal with non-human challenges (materials, machines, processes). The term came to America in 1899, when the notion of "social engineering" was also launched as the name of the task of the social engineer in this sense. "Social engineering" was the title of a small journal in 1899 (from 1900 named "Social Service"), and in 1909 the title of a book by its former editor, [[William H. Tolman]] (translated into French in 1910), marking the end of the usage of the terminology in the sense of Van Marken. With the Social Gospel sociologist Edwin L. Earp's ''The Social Engineer'', published during the "efficiency craze" of 1911 in the U.S., the usage of the term was launched that has since then been standard: the one building on a metaphor of social relations as "machineries",&lt;ref name="Knower and Friend"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A knower and friend of human beings, not machines: The business career of the terminology of social engineering, 1894-1910 |journal=Ideas in History |year=2007 |last=Östlund |first=David |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=43–82 |issn=1890-1832 |url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A182548&amp;dswid=5876 |accessdate=2016-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be dealt with in the manner of the technical engineer.&lt;ref name="Knower and Friend"/&gt;

A prerequisite of social engineering is a body of reliable information about the society that is to be engineered and effective tools to carry out the engineering.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The availability of which has dramatically increased within the past one hundred years.  Prior to the invention of the printing press, it was difficult for groups outside of the wealthy to gain access to a reliable body of information, as the media for conveying the information was prohibitively expensive.  With the rise of the [[information age]], information can be distributed and produced on an unprecedented scale. Similarly digital technology has increased the variety and access of effective tools.  However, it has also created questionably reliable bodies of information.

Social engineering can be carried out by any organization, without regard to scale, or sponsorship in the public or private sector.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some of the most comprehensive, and most pervasive campaigns of social engineering are those initiated by powerful central governments with the systems of authority to widely affect the individuals and cultures within their purview.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Extremely intensive social engineering campaigns occurred in countries with [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments. In the 1920s the government of the [[Soviet Union]] embarked on a campaign to fundamentally alter the behavior and ideals of Soviet citizens, to replace the old social frameworks of the [[Russian Empire]] with a new Soviet culture, to create the [[New Soviet man]]. The Soviets used newspapers, books, film, mass relocations, and even architectural-design tactics to serve as a "[[social condenser]]" and to change personal values and private relationships. In a less positive manner, political executions (for example the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]] in Moscow in 1952), and arguably fear of becoming a victim of mass murder with the [[Mass killings under Communist regimes]], played an influential role in the social engineering frameworks in Soviet Russia.  Similar examples include the Chinese "[[Great Leap Forward]]" (1958–1961) and "[[Cultural Revolution]]"  (1966–1976) programs and the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s deurbanization of [[Cambodia]] (1975–1979). In [[Singapore]], the government's housing policies attempt to promote a mix of all races within each subsidized housing district in order to foster social cohesion and national loyalty while providing citizens with affordable housing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In Tanzania in the 1970s, the government pursued a policy of enforced villagisation under [[Operation Vijiji]] in order to promote [[collective farming]].&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Siri. (2008) ''[http://www.cmi.no/publications/publication/?3008=land-tenure-and-mining-in-tanzania Land Tenure and Mining In Tanzania]''. Bergen: Chr. Michelson Institute, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-authoritarian regimes tend to rely on more sustained social engineering campaigns that create more gradual, but ultimately far-reaching, change. Examples include the "[[War on Drugs]]" in the [[United States]], the increasing reach of [[intellectual-property]] rights and [[History of copyright law|copyright]], and the promotion of [[elections]] as a political tool. The campaign for promoting elections, which is by far the most successful of the three examples, has been in place for over two centuries. Social theorists of the [[Frankfurt School]] in [[Weimar Germany]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] had observed the new phenomenon of [[mass culture]] and commented on its new [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] power, when the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] drove them out of the country around 1930 (many of them became connected with the [[Institute for Social Research]] in the United States). National Socialists themselves were no strangers to the idea of influencing political attitudes and redefining personal relationships. The national-socialist [[propaganda]] machine under [[Joseph Goebbels]] was a synchronized, sophisticated and effective tool for shaping public opinion.

In a similar vein the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by propaganda but also by inventing new words and slogans such as ''palaiokommatismos'' (old-partyism), ''Ellas Ellinon Christianon'' (Greece of Christian Greeks), and ''Ethnosotirios Epanastasis'' (nation-saving revolution, meaning ''[[coup d'état]]'').

Social engineering can be used as a means to achieve a wide variety of different results, as illustrated by the different governments and other organizations that have employed it. Discussion of the possibilities for such manipulation became especially active following [[World War II]], with the advent of mass [[television]], and continuing discussion of techniques of social engineering, particularly in [[advertising]], and bias-based [[journalism]], remains quite pertinent in the western model of [[consumer capitalism]].  Journalism, when the intent is not to report objectively, but to report with an intent to sway popular attitudes and social behaviors or to "shape public opinion", comes under the scope of social engineering.  This also applies when information that would bring into question the viewpoints and social goals of a journalistic establishment is withheld in favor of other information.  Within ethical journalism the knowledge of both personal and establishment/producer bias allows the journalist to avoid social engineering by correcting it and by reporting factual evidence in a way which does not promote or oppose attitudes and social behaviors, and thereby portray or deny them as the "popular" attitude and preferable social behavior by virtue of the establishment's authority or possession of a national or international platform.

Note that social engineering practiced in exclusion of cultural elements and interacting societies has led to pogroms and to mass murders, particularly when employed by authoritarian regimes.  Often this occurs because these cultures or societies are perceived as possessing "undesirable" traits.  The acting engineers have used the simple "effective" tool of violence rather than the difficult and time-consuming methods of persuasion and logic.

Caution in social engineering methods includes consideration of the inherent incompleteness of their body of information and how it affects their utilization of tools at hand.  Analysis of social engineering goals and their desirability—which includes the desires of the community which they desire to engineer—answer the question of the ethics of disclosure.  Social engineering without consent is a violation of the culture, and constitutes an assault tantamount to a rape, or seizing by force of that culture [[raptio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Consent, full disclosure and involvement, presents additional difficulties which help to avoid marginalization and feelings of violation within the culture.  Long-term attempts at social engineering in the Middle East may be considered to have extreme backlash, as a result of being non inclusive of the cultural values, body of reliable information, or utilization of effective tools.

In defense of the comparison to rape, consider the article [[Raptio]], which describes the origin of the word, which meant "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an Old French legal term for "to seize", in turn from Latin ''rapere''—"seize, carry off by force, abduct".  Social engineering is an exercise of removing an attitude or behavior and replacing it with another.  Which is done with force, when done without consent, that constitutes a violation through abducting an individual or societies culture and replacing it with the engineers' culture.

In Egypt, social engineering is being practiced by the current authoritarian regime and by the media controlled by the Egyptian Intelligence, Military since July 2013. The coup d'état engineered by them to overthrow the first democratic elected president, former president Mohamed Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Social Engineering is also being used on children in schools by ordering children to repeat sentences in support of Sisi like "Long live president Sisi". The video was shared on social media Facebook and viewed by 1.5 million viewers. It is believed by many Egyptians it is an act to imprint on children in order to shift their behavior and thinking fearing another revolution in the future like the one that ousted former president Mubarak that was led by youth and young adults in January 2011. Something a little similar to Nazi Germany when Hitler was using children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Karl Popper==
In his classic political science book, ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', volume I, ''The Spell of Plato'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] examined the application of the critical and rational methods of science to the problems of the open society. In this respect, he made a crucial distinction between the principles of ''democratic'' social engineering (what he called "piecemeal social engineering") and ''Utopian'' social engineering.

Popper wrote:
{{quote|The piecemeal engineer will, accordingly, adopt the method of searching for, and fighting against, the greatest and most urgent evils of society, rather than searching for, and fighting for, its greatest ultimate good.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.]] 1971 ''The Open Society and Its Enemies'' Princeton, New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Popper, the difference between "piecemeal social engineering" and "Utopian social engineering" is:
{{quote|"It is the difference between a reasonable method of improving the lot of man, and a method which, if really tried, may easily lead to an intolerable increase in human suffering. It is the difference between a method which can be applied at any moment, and a method whose advocacy may easily become a means of continually postponing action until a later date, when conditions are more favorable. And it is also the difference between the only method of improving matters which has so far been really successful, at any time, and in any place, and a method which, wherever it has been tried, has led only to the use of violence in place of reason, and if not to its own abandonment, at any rate to that of its original blueprint.&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt;}}

[[File:Tathagata Tsal 02.jpg|thumb|Tathagata, [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]] amidst clouds and hills in [[Sikkim]], India, 2016|466x466px]]
'''Tathāgata''' ({{IPA-sa|t̪əˈt̪ʰɑːɡət̪ə|lang}}) is a [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] word; [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama Buddha]] uses it when referring to himself in the [[Pāli Canon]]. The term is often thought to mean either "one who has thus gone" (''tathā-gata'') or "one who has thus come" (''tathā-āgata''). This is interpreted as signifying that the Tathāgata is beyond all coming and going – beyond all [[impermanence|transitory phenomena]]. There are, however, other interpretations and the precise original meaning of the word is not certain.&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;Chalmers, Robert. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/bert.htm The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1898. pp.103-115]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is quoted on numerous occasions in the Pali Canon as referring to himself as ''the Tathāgata'' instead of using the pronouns ''me'', ''I'' or  ''myself''. This may be meant to emphasize by implication that the teaching is uttered by one who has transcended the human condition, one beyond the otherwise endless cycle of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[death]], i.e. beyond [[dukkha]].

The term Tathāgata has a number of possible meanings.&lt;ref name="tat"&gt;Tathāgata तथागत. [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tathAgata&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= tathAgata]. (accessed: January 19, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and interpretation==
The word's original significance is not known and there has been speculation about it since at least the time of [[Buddhaghosa]], who gives eight interpretations of the word, each with different etymological support, in his commentary on the [[Digha Nikaya]], the ''SUMAṄGALAVILĀSINĪ'':&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;
# He who has arrived in such fashion, i.e. who has worked his way upwards to perfection for the world's good in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas.
# He who walked in such fashion, i.e. (a) he who at birth took the seven equal steps in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas or (b) he who in the same way as all previous Buddhas went his way to Buddhahood through the four Jhanas and the Paths.
# He who by the path of knowledge has come at the real essentials of things.
# He who has won Truth.             
# He who has discerned Truth.  
# He who declares Truth. 
# He whose words and deeds accord.
# The great physician whose medicine is all-potent.
{{quote|Monks, in the world with its devas, Mara and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed and cognized, attained, searched into, pondered over by the mind—all that is fully understood by the Tathagata. That is why he is called the Tathagata.([[Anguttara Nikaya]] 4:23)&lt;ref&gt;[[Anguttara Nikaya]] 4:23, trans. [[Nyanaponika Thera]] and [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Modern scholarly opinion generally opines that Sanskrit grammar offers at least two possibilities for breaking up the compound word: either ''tathā'' and ''āgata'' (via a [[sandhi]] rule&lt;br&gt;ā + ā → ā), or ''tathā'' and ''gata.''&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381–382}} ''Tathā'' means "thus" in Sanskrit and Pali, and Buddhist thought takes this to refer to what is called "reality as-it-is" (''yathābhūta''). This reality is also referred to as "thusness" or "suchness" ([[tathatā]]), indicating simply that it (reality) is what it is.

Tathāgata is defined as someone who "knows and sees reality as-it-is" (''yathā bhūta ñāna dassana''). ''Gata'' "gone" is the past passive participle of the verbal root ''gam'' "go, travel". ''Āgata'' "come" is the past passive participle of the verb meaning "come, arrive". In this interpretation, Tathāgata means literally either “the one who has gone to suchness” or "the one who has arrived at suchness".

Another interpretation, proposed by the scholar Richard Gombrich, is based on the fact that, when used as a suffix in compounds, ''-gata'' will often lose its literal meaning and signifies instead "being". Tathāgata would thus mean  "one like that", with no motion in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jayarava, (27 February 2009). [http://jayarava.blogspot.com/2009/02/philological-odds-and-ends.html "Philological odds and ends I"], jayarava.blogspot.com, . Retrieved 2012-10-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]], the term has a non-Buddhist origin, and is best understood when compared to its usage in non-Buddhist works such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Florin Giripescu Sutton (1991),''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra: A Study in the Ontology and Epistemology of the Yogācāra School of Mahāyāna Buddhism'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Shcherbatskoy gives the following example from the ''Mahabharata'' (''Shantiparva'', 181.22): "Just as the footprints of birds (flying) in the sky and fish (swimming) in water cannot be seen, Thus (''tātha'') is going (''gati'') of those who have realized the Truth."

==The nature of a ''Tathāgata''==
[[Image:Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|260px| Beyond all coming and going: the Tathāgata]]
{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
A number of passages affirm that a Tathāgata is "immeasurable", "inscrutable", "hard to fathom", and "not apprehended".&lt;ref name="Harvey1995"&gt;Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227}} A tathāgata has abandoned that clinging to the ''[[skandhas]]'' (personality factors) that render ''[[citta]]'' (the mind) a bounded, measurable entity, and is instead "freed from being reckoned by" all or any of them, even in life. The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and cognizance that comprise personal identity have been seen to be ''[[dukkha]]'' (a burden), and an enlightened individual is one with "burden dropped".&lt;ref name="Harvey1995" /&gt;{{rp|229}}The Buddha explains "that for which a monk has a latent tendency, by that is he reckoned, what he does not have a latent tendency for, by that is he not reckoned.&lt;ref name="Harvey1995" /&gt;{{rp|227, SN 3.3.5}} These tendencies are ways in which the mind becomes involved in and clings to [[sankhara|conditioned phenomena]]. Without them, an enlightened person cannot be "reckoned" or "named"; he or she is beyond the range of other beings, and cannot be "found" by them, even by gods, or [[Mara (demon)|Mara]].&lt;ref name="Harvey1995" /&gt;{{rp|230}} In one passage, [[Sariputta]] states that the mind of the Buddha cannot be "encompassed" even by him.&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu" /&gt;{{rp|416–417}}

The Buddha and Sariputta, in similar passages, when confronted with speculation as to the status of an arahant after death, bring their interlocutors to admit that they cannot even apprehend an arahant that is alive.&lt;ref name="Harvey1995" /&gt;{{rp|235}} As Sariputta puts it, his questioner Yamaka "can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life."&lt;ref&gt;Yamaka Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.085.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; These passages imply that condition of the arahant, both before and after [[parinirvana]], lies beyond the domain where the descriptive powers of ordinary language are at home; that is, the world of the skandhas and the greed, hatred, and delusion that are "blown out" with nirvana.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Tyson Anderson, [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/anderson.htm Kalupahana on Nirvana]. ''Philosophy East and West'', April 1990, 40(2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|226}}

In the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]], an ascetic named Vaccha questions the Buddha on a variety of metaphysical issues. When Vaccha asks about the status of a tathagata after death, the Buddha asks him in which direction a fire goes when it has gone out. Vaccha replies that the question "does not fit the case ... For the fire that depended on fuel ... when that fuel has all gone, and it can get no other, being thus without nutriment, it is said to be extinct." The Buddha then explains: "In exactly the same way ..., all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint, all that form has been abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree, and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future. The saint ... who has been released from what is styled form is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, like the mighty ocean."&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;{{rp|225}} The same is then said of the other aggregates. A variety of similar passages make it clear that the metaphor "gone out, he cannot be defined" (''atthangato so na pamanam eti'') refers equally to liberation in life.&lt;ref name="Wynne"&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91, 95}} In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta itself, it is clear that the Buddha is the subject of the metaphor, and the Buddha has already "uprooted" or "annihilated" the five aggregates.&lt;ref name="Wynne" /&gt;{{rp|95}} In Sn 1074, it is stated that the sage cannot be "reckoned" because he is freed from the category "name" or, more generally, concepts. The absence of this precludes the possibility of reckoning or articulating a state of affairs; "name" here refers to the concepts or apperceptions that make propositions possible.&lt;ref name="Wynne" /&gt;{{rp|94}}

[[Nagarjuna]] expressed this understanding in the nirvana chapter of his [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]]: "It is not assumed that the Blessed One exists after death. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist, or both, or neither. It is not assumed that even a living Blessed One exists. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist, or both, or neither."&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;{{rp|230}}

Speaking within the context of Mahayana Buddhism (specifically the Perfection of Wisdom sutras), [[Edward Conze]] writes that the term 'tathagata' denotes inherent true selfhood within the human being:
{{quote|Just as ''tathata'' designates true reality in general, so the word which developed into "Tathagata" designated the true self, the true reality within man.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze, ''The Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines'', Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 1994, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Buddhism, the '''three marks of existence''' are three characteristics ([[Pali]]: ''tilakkha{{IAST|ṇ}}a''; [[Sanskrit]]: ''trilak{{IAST|ṣ}}a{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') of all existence and beings, namely '''[[impermanence]]''' (''anicca''), '''unsatisfactoriness''' or '''suffering''' (''[[dukkha]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''non-self''' (''[[anattā]]'').&lt;ref name=gombrich47&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buswelllopez42&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

==Description==
The three marks are:{{sfn|Walsh|1995|p=30}}
# ''sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā'' — "all ''[[saṅkhāra]]s'' (conditioned things) are impermanent"
# ''sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā'' — "all ''saṅkhāras'' are unsatisfactory"
# ''sabbe dhammā anattā'' — "all ''[[dharma#Buddhism)|dharmas]]'' (conditioned or unconditioned things) are not self"

==Explanation==
===Anicca===
{{Main|Impermanence}}
Impermanence (Pali ''anicca'', [[Sanskrit]] ''anitya'') means that all conditioned things (''saṅkhāra'') are in a constant state of flux. Buddhism states that all physical and mental events come into being and dissolve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anicca Anicca Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Human life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of repeated birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Samsara]]), nothing lasts, and everything decays. This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including beings who are [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]] in [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] ([[deity|god]]) and [[naraka]] (hell) realms.&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[nirvana]], the reality that is ''nicca'', or knows no change, decay or death.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p355"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=355, Article on '''Nicca''' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dukkha===
{{Main|Dukkha}}

===Anatta===
{{Main|Anatta}}
''[[Anatta]]'' (Sanskrit ''anatman'') refers to the doctrine of "non-self", that there is no unchanging, permanent Self or soul in living beings and no abiding essence in anything or phenomena.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=51 }}, '''Quote:''' "(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps - the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering."&lt;br&gt;[c] {{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon."&lt;/ref&gt;

While anicca and dukkha apply to "all conditioned phenomena" (saṅkhārā), anattā has a wider scope because it applies to all dhammā without "conditioned, unconditioned" qualification.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|author2=Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub|title=Buddhist Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7_Rea05eAMC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3248-0|pages=209, for context see pp. 195–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''nirvana'' too is a state of "without Self" or anatta.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209/&gt; The phrase "sabbe dhamma anatta" includes within its scope each [[skandha]] (aggregate, heap) that compose any being, and the belief "I am" is a mark of conceit which must be destroyed to end all Dukkha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Pérez Remón |title=Self and Non-self in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ6svBmxAhEC |year=1980|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-90-279-7987-2 |pages=218–222, 234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anattā'' doctrine of Buddhism denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of ''Dukkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

==Application==
In Buddhism, ignorance of ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]], or [[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]; i.e. a failure to grasp directly) the three marks of existence is regarded as the first link in the overall process of [[saṃsāra]] whereby a being is subject to repeated existences in an endless cycle of suffering. As a consequence, dissolving that ignorance through [[Vipassanā|direct insight]] into the three marks is said to bring an end to saṃsāra and, as a result, to that suffering (''dukkha nirodha'' or ''nirodha sacca'', as described in the third of the [[Four Noble Truths]]).

[[Gautama Buddha]] taught that all beings conditioned by causes (''saṅkhāra'') are impermanent (''anicca'') and suffering (''dukkha''), and that not-self (''anattā'') characterises all dhammas, meaning there is no "I", "me", or "mine" in either the conditioned or the unconditioned (i.e. nibbāna).&lt;ref&gt;Nārada, The Dhammapada (1978), pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bhikkhu|last=Bodhi|year=2003|title=The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya|page=1457|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Somerville, MA|isbn=978-0-86171-331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching of three marks of existence in the Pali Canon is credited to the Buddha.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhammapada Verses 277, 278 and 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Pérez Remón |title=Self and Non-self in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ6svBmxAhEC |year=1980|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-90-279-7987-2 |pages=210–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Brigade''' was a labour protest organisation for women formed during the first of several strikes to occur in the mining town of [[Broken Hill]], NSW, Australia between 1889-1920.&lt;ref name="bhs"&gt;http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE4102b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precedents===
As early as 1874, Australian women were engaging in direct action in mining disputes in Australia. During the 1874 strikes at the Wallaroo and Moonta mines in South Australia, women entered the mines armed with brooms, forced the men out and closed down the engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=7344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SCENE AT THE WALLAROO STRIKE. (20 April 1874). ''[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]]'' (Sydney, NSW : 1850-1875), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60986910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN AT MOONTA. (28 April 1874). ''[[Launceston Examiner]]'' (Tas. : 1842-1899), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52892684&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Meeting===
The notice for the first meeting read:&lt;ref name="rhb"&gt;Kearns, R.H.B, 1982.Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p154.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of Broken Hill Women are very anxious to do something towards supporting the men now out on strike and a meeting for women only will be held at the Masonic Hotel tonight, at 7:30. The president will be the chair. Mr T.C. Tait, the proprietor of the Masonic Hotel, has kindly given the use of his new hall, erected at the site of the hotel, for the use of the women's brigade. All matrons and maids who are in sympathy with the union are requested to attend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conditions==
According to Unbroken Spirit, 'Poor living conditions and negligent managerial policy on the mines at Broken Hill fed into a strong union presence from the very early days'.&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" &gt;Unions and Politics, Unbroken Spirit, Australian Women's Archives Project, 2009, http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhib/bh/unionspol.html&lt;/ref&gt; Women and children found life in the mining town harsh, yet fought alongside the miners in favour of the union goals despite the hardship prolonged strikes caused to family welfare.&lt;ref name="bhs" /&gt;

According to Carroll (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, B. 1986 Built on Silver: a history of Broken Hill South, Hill of Content Publishing Company, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-85572-1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blainey (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. 1968. The Rise of Broken Hill, Macmillan of Australia, Victoria, p61.&lt;/ref&gt; there was particular concern in the town regarding [[lead poisoning]] from the mine dust. Due to a long delay in developing the technical process for extracting value from the low-lying ores that were mined at Broken Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;ft high hills of toxic tailings were created about the mines and left without processing until the opening of the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[BHP Steelworks]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, pp42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

===1889===

Broken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers. The strike lasted a week and during this time the Women's Brigade was formed.&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the arrival of BHP directors from Melbourne on 13 November, the Women's Brigade had set up as 'sentinels'&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt; in order to catch any non-union labour, including shift bosses who were 'tarred and whitewashed' the following day while the 2500 miners met to negotiate the dispute with the directors.&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE. (14 November 1889). The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889-1931), p. 5. Retrieved 15 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24488285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;Broken Hill Strike. (14 November 1889). ''The Brisbane Courier'' (Qld. : 1864-1933), p. 5. Retrieved 15 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3503893&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of men were injured by the Women's Brigade on 14 November. As a result of this [[Richard Sleath]] on behalf of the union distanced himself from their actions while mentioning the resolve of the women who had a week's worth of provisions and that they intended to remain on picket for the week. An appeal was made for the miners to use their influence with the women to calm their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE. (14 November 1889). South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839-1900), p. 5. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47285099&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The brigade now numbers 400 members, many of whom took part in the famous sweeping affair at the [[Moonta]] and [[Wallaroo]] mines 15 years ago. Two hundred women spent the night in the mines and two of them have been locked up for trespassing.&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1892===

The Women's Brigade was very active in using direct action methods against the imported contract labour during the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]].&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R.J. 1988. The Richest Lode:Broken Hill 1883-1988, Hale &amp; Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloodworth (1996), there were daily mass rallies and the Barrier United Females' Strike Protest Committee was formed in the initial weeks. The 500-strong Brigade passed a resolution to join the 24 August union demonstration but this was later abandoned in favour of a women's rally on the 25th.&lt;ref name="bloodworth"&gt;Bloodworth, S. (1996) The Rebel Women of Broken Hill in ''Militant Spirits'', La Trobe University, Melbourne. retrieved at http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/rebelwomen/militant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent suffragette, [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] publicly supported the women of Broken Hill claiming 'that the women of Broken Hill are the first great body of working women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring injustice that ''the present constitution will not allow them a voice in framing the laws''...' and that this rendered the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]] 'more profoundly interesting' than any before.&lt;ref name="bloodworth" /&gt;

===1919-1920===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The womenfolk that evening at least got some of their own back, for wherever a 'cop' was observed during the march, he either received a 'back-hander' from a woman on passing or was spat upon. This happened not once, but hundreds of times during that memorable tramp through the city's streets. And, under the circumstances, show to me the workingman that did not, and does not, applaud such acts, and I will show you a creature who lives but to creep and to cringe, and knows but little of the history of his class, or the damnable actions of its historic enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, G in Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
