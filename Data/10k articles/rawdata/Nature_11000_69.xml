[[Image:Albeluvisol.png|thumb|right|400px|Distribution of Albeluvisols]]
'''Albeluvisol''' was a Reference Soil Group of the first edition (1998) and the second edition (2006) of the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/ag/agl/agll/wrb/doc/wrb2007_corr.pdf World Reference Base for Soil Resources, Second edition 2006, First update 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;. In the third edition of the WRB (2014), Albeluvisols were replaced by the broader defined [[Retisol]]s. An Albeluvisol is a [[soil]] with a thin, dark surface [[Soil horizon|horizon]] on a bleached subsurface horizon (an albic horizon) that tongues into a clay illuviation (Bt) horizon. The Bt horizon has an irregular or broken upper boundary resulting from the tonguing of bleached soil material into the illuviation horizon. Albeluvisols correlate with [[Alfisols|Glossaqualfs, Glossocryalfs and Glossudalfs]] in the [[USDA soil taxonomy]].

These soils are formed mostly in unconsolidated [[glacial till]], [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] or [[fluvial]] materials or [[Aeolian processes|aeolian deposits]] such as [[loess]]. They occur on flat to undulating [[plain]]s under [[coniferous forest]] or mixed forest in [[boreal climate|boreal]] and [[temperate climate]]s with cold winters and short cool summers.

The [[agriculture|agricultural]] suitability of Albeluvisols is limited because of their [[acidity]], low [[nutrient]] levels, [[tillage]] and [[drainage]] problems. In northern regions there is also a short [[growing season]] and severe [[frost]] during the long winter. The Albeluvisols of the northern [[taiga]] zone are almost exclusively under forest with small areas used for [[pasture]] or [[hay]] fields. In the southern taiga zone, less than 10 percent of the non-forested area is used for [[livestock]] farming. In the southern and western parts of the taiga in [[Russia]] [[agronomy|arable]] [[crop]]s, such as [[cereal]]s, [[potato]]es, [[sugar beet]] and forage [[maize]], are found, especially on soils with higher base saturations in the [[subsoil]].

Albeluvisols cover an estimated 320 million ha in [[Europe]], [[North Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and in [[North America]]. They are concentrated in two regions:
*the [[continent]]al regions that had [[permafrost]] in the [[Pleistocene]] of northeast Europe, northwest Asia and southern [[Canada]], which constitute by far the largest areas of Albeluvisols;
*the loess and cover sand areas and old [[alluvial]] areas in moist temperate regions, such as [[France]], central [[Belgium]], the southeast of the [[Netherlands]] and the north and north-east of [[Germany]].

The Secretary of the Army [[John M. McHugh]] established the task force on Sept. 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army to Establish Energy Initiatives Office Task Force for Large-Scale Renewable Energy Projects|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14726|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EITF supports the Army’s goal of deploying 1 gigawatt of renewable energy by 2025.

On 1 October 2014, the Secretary of the Army directed the establishment of the permanent [[U.S. Army Office of Energy Initiatives (OEI)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/134994/Army_establishes_permanent_Office_of_Energy_Initiatives Army Establishs permanent Office of Energy Initiatives].

== History==
On April 14, 2014, the Army announced the development of a [[solar array]] at [[Fort Huachuca]] designed to provide about 25 percent of the annual electricity requirement.  The project is a joint effort between the U.S. Army Energy Initiatives Task Force, Fort Huachuca, The General Services Administration, Tucson Electric Power and developer E.ON Climate and Renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest solar array on a U.S. military installation to be developed|url=http://www.army.mil/article/124009/Largest_solar_array_on_a_U_S__military_installation_to_be_developed/|publisher=U.S. Army News Release|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2014, ReEnergy Holdings LLC was issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Award by [[Defense Logistics Agency]] (DLA) for the purchase of up to 28 megawatts (MW) of electricity from a renewable energy [[biomass]] facility at [[Fort Drum, New York]].  The DLA said that the project is capable of supplying 100% of Fort Drum's electricity requirements.  Fort Drum provides planning and support for the mobilization and training of almost 80,000 Army troops annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Army's Fort Drum Moves Closer To Achieving Energy Security|url=http://www.army.mil/article/120353/U_S__Army_s_Fort_Drum_Moves_Closer_To_Achieving_Energy_Security/|publisher=Army.mil|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EITF in 2013 made 79 contract award announcements for the Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Renewable and Alternative Energy Power Production at Department of Defense Installations.  The MATOC is a contract vehicle that aims to establish a pool of qualified firms/contractors for [[biomass]], [[solar power]], [[geothermal electricity|geothermal]] and [[wind power]] technologies to compete for individual task order contracts.

The '''Atlantic hurricane season''' is the period in a year when [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] usually form in the Atlantic Ocean. [[Tropical cyclone]]s in the North Atlantic are called hurricanes, tropical storms, or tropical depressions. In addition, there have been several [[storm]]s over the years that have not been fully tropical and are categorized as subtropical depressions and subtropical storms. Even though subtropical storms and subtropical depressions are not technically as strong as tropical cyclones, the damages can still be devastating.

Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ G1"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season? |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065833/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |archivedate=July 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct hurricane season occurs from June 1 to November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September;&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ G1"/&gt; the season's [[climatology|climatological]] peak of activity occurs around September 10 each season.&lt;ref name="NHC Atl climatology"&gt;{{cite web | author = McAdie, Colin | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Tropical Cyclone Climatology | url =http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml | date = May 10, 2007 | accessdate =June 9, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528163713/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml| archivedate= May 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the norm, but in 1938, the Atlantic hurricane season started as early as January 3.

Tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a [[Lists of tropical cyclone names|pre-determined list]]. On average, 10.1 named storms occur each season, with an average of 5.9 becoming hurricanes and 2.5 becoming major hurricanes ([[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category 3]] or greater). The most active season was [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], during which 28&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclones formed, of which a record 15 became hurricanes. The least active season was [[1914 Atlantic hurricane season|1914]], with only one known tropical cyclone developing during that year.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}
The Atlantic hurricane season is a time when most tropical cyclones are expected to [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] across the northern Atlantic Ocean. It is currently defined as the time frame from June 1 through November 30, though in the past the season was defined as a shorter time frame. During the season, regular tropical weather outlooks are issued by the [[National Hurricane Center]], and coordination between the [[Weather Prediction Center]] and National Hurricane Center occurs for systems which have not formed yet, but could develop during the next three to seven days.

==Operations==
{{See also|National Hurricane Center|Weather Prediction Center}}
During the hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center routinely issues their Tropical Weather Outlook product, which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones. If systems occur outside the defined hurricane season, special Tropical Weather Outlooks will be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo_atl.shtml|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|year=2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011|title=Atlantic Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623203417/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo_atl.shtml| archivedate=June 23, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routine coordination occurs at 1700 UTC each day between the Weather Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics, and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Commerce]] (2006). [http://www.weather.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/Katrina.pdfService Assessment: Hurricane Katrina, August 23–31, 2005.] Retrieved on 2008-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible tropical cyclones are depicted with a closed isobar, while systems with less certainty to develop are depicted as "spot lows" with no isobar surrounding them.

==HURDAT==
{{Main|HURDAT}}
The North Atlantic hurricane database, or HURDAT, is the database for all tropical storms and hurricanes for the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, including those that have made landfall in the United States. The original database of six-hourly positions and intensities were put together in the 1960s in support of the Apollo space program to help provide statistical track forecast guidance. In the intervening years, this database&amp;nbsp;— which is now freely and easily accessible on the Internet from the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) webpage&amp;nbsp;— has been utilized for a wide variety of uses: climatic change studies, seasonal forecasting, risk assessment for county emergency managers, analysis of potential losses for insurance and business interests, intensity forecasting techniques and verification of official and various model predictions of track and intensity.

HURDAT was not designed with all of these uses in mind when it was first put together and not all of them may be appropriate given its original motivation. HURDAT contains numerous systematic as well as some random errors in the database. Additionally, analysis techniques have changed over the years at NHC as their understanding of tropical cyclones has developed, leading to biases in the historical database. Another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events is the lack of exact location, time and intensity at hurricane landfall.

===Re-analysis project===
{{Main|Atlantic hurricane reanalysis}}
HURDAT is regularly updated annually to reflect the previous season's activity. The older portion of the database has been regularly revised since 2001. The first time in 2001 led to the addition of tropical cyclone tracks for the years 1851 to 1885. The second time was August 2002 when Hurricane Andrew was upgraded to a Category 5. Recent efforts into uncovering undocumented historical hurricanes in the late 19th and 20th centuries by various researchers have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events. Possible changes for the years 1951 onward are not yet incorporated into the HURDAT database. Because of all of these issues, a re-analysis of the Atlantic hurricane database is being attempted that will be completed in three years.

In addition to the groundbreaking work by Partagas{{Context inline|date=October 2017}}, additional analyses, digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by the NOAA Office of Global Programs. This re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hpmag.com/mag/fall2003/specialreport.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006131733/http://www.hpmag.com/mag/fall2003/specialreport.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} [http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s2005.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Hurricane Center's Best Track Change Committee has approved changes for a few recent cyclones, such as Hurricane Andrew. Official changes to the Atlantic hurricane database are approved by the National Hurricane Center Best Track Change Committee. Thus research conducted by Chris Landsea and colleagues as part of the Atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project are submitted through this review process.  Not all Landsea's recommendations are accepted by the Committee.

A 2011 study analyzing one of the main sources of hurricanes - the [[Tropical wave|African easterly wave]] (AEW) - found that the change in AEWs is closely linked to increased activity of intense hurricanes in the North Atlantic. The synoptic concurrence of AEWs in driving the dynamics of the Sahel greening also appears to increase tropical cyclogenesis over the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Wang and Gillies|year=2011|title=Observed Change in Sahel Rainfall, Circulations, African Easterly Waves, and Atlantic Hurricanes Since 1979|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijge/2011/259529/abs|doi=10.1155/2011/259529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31653">'''Carbon capture and storage''' ('''CCS''') is an approach to try to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] global warming by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] {{CO2}} from large point sources such as [[fossil fuel power plant]]s and storing it instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. [[Carbon capture and storage]] is also used to sequester {{CO2}} filtered out of natural gas from certain from natural gas fields. While typically the {{CO2}} has no value after being stored, [[Enhanced Oil Recovery]] uses {{CO2}} to increase yield from declining oil fields.

There are no currently-operating large-scale CCS projects in Australia, although the [[Gorgon gas project]] will qualify when it is fully operational. Despite multiple CCS demonstration projects at Australian [[coal-fired power station]]s, none of Australia's coal plants are currently capturing {{CO2}} or have a time frame for doing so. [[Australian Treasury]] modelling finds that CCS is not expected to be commercially viable until the 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rintoul|first1=Stuart|last2=Hepworth|first2=Annabel|title=Treasury backs carbon capture|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/treasury-backs-carbon-capture/news-story/978ebf8881e9c640b001d4d8e120b708?nk=7cc5c013eaeb9c7aadb11fa96514ecb6-1504575264|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Australian|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until 2100.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'&gt;[IPCC, 2005] ''IPCC special report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage''.

==Benefits==
# Fossil fuels are capable of dispatching electricity whenever there is demand.
# Australia has significant deposits of coal allowing economic benefits for years to come without significant environmental impacts.
# CCS can be used to capture CO2 from high-emission industrial processes such as the making of certain chemicals, steel and cement.
# CCS, when it comes on line, is likely to make the greatest impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the transition to sustainable energy supplies.

==Challenges==
# Cost of CCS will make coal-fired electricity more expensive than wind power &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/event/documents/RefutingWindpowerFallacies.pdf Refuting Fallacies about Wind power]. Dr Mark Diesendorf. Accessed 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Leakage from underground or undersea reservoirs
# Scarcity of potential sites and capacity compared to volumes of [[greenhouse gas]] needed to be sequestered on an ongoing basis
# Existing power stations unlikely to be able to have carbon capture technology retrofitted &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/false-hope.pdf Layout 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# CCS currently requires up to 30% more coal than conventional plants to cover the energy needs of CCS (although R&amp;D is rapidly improving efficiencies), and that extra coal must first be mined (which has environmental effects) and transported to the plant (which takes energy)
# Infrastructure required would take years to build
# emissions of [[acid rain]]-causing gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides of a plant that captures {{CO2}} will be up to 40 percent greater than the total cradle-to-grave emissions of a modern plant that doesn't capture its {{CO2}} because of the extra coal burnt &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/35181/title/Carbon_sequestration_frustration |last = Barry|first = Patrick |title = Carbon sequestration frustration |accessdate=2008-08-19 |date=2008-08-13 |publisher=[[Society for Science &amp; the Public]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport of {{CO2}} ===
In Australia, the major emissions sites are in the [[Latrobe Valley|Latrobe]] and [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valleys]]. The Latrobe Valley has considerable potential storage within a few hundred kilometres in Bass Strait which the CarbonNet Project was investigating (see below). There are no particularly promising large storage prospects near the Hunter Valley. Geologically prospective areas include the North West Shelf (see the Gorgon Project below) and Bass Strait. Australia has very extensive basins with deep saline formations, both onshore and particularly offshore, in which large quantities of carbon dioxide can dissolve. In such formations Australia has a potential carbon dioxide storage resource equivalent to many hundreds of years of emissions at the current rate. Work is now underway to fully assess storage potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.co2crc.com.au/aboutccs/stor_capacity |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129081022/http://co2crc.com.au/aboutccs/stor_capacity |archive-date=2013-01-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government involvement==
In November 2008, the Australian Commonwealth Government passed the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Act 2008, which provides a regulatory framework for carbon dioxide storage in federal offshore waters.

The Victorian Greenhouse Gas Geological Sequestration Act 2008 (No. 61 of 2008) received Royal Assent on 5 November 2008. It provides a dedicated legal framework enabling the onshore injection and permanent storage of greenhouse gas substances. The state government has also developed a regulatory framework for offshore storage sites (i.e. those sites falling within the 3 nautical mile extent of state jurisdiction; the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://decarboni.se/publications/onshore-co2-storage-legal-resources | title = Australian Onshore Regulation | author = Carbon Capture Legal Programme, University College London and Global CCS Institute | accessdate = 2014-03-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140319035356/http://decarboni.se/publications/onshore-co2-storage-legal-resources | archive-date = 2014-03-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Australia's state and federal governments have been major contributors to CCS research and development. Federal government CCS initiatives include the [[CO2CRC]] (founded 2003), the [[Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund]] (2004-2017), funding for the [[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]] (2006-2011, renewables, CCS and other), [[National Low Emissions Coal Initiative]] (founded 2008), [[Global CCS Institute]] (founded 2009), [[Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships]] (2009-2019), the [[Carbon Capture and Storage Research Development and Demonstration Fund]] (2015-2016) and the [[National CO2 Infrastructure Plan]] operated by Geoscience Australia (2012-2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Bill|last2=Swann|first2=Tom|title=Money for Nothing|url=http://www.tai.org.au/content/money-nothing|website=The Australia Institute|publisher=The Australia Institute|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal funding commitments to these initiatives total $3.5-3.6 billion, of which $1.3-$1.6 billion has been committed or is expected to be committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Bill|last2=Swann|first2=Tom|title=Money for Nothing|url=http://www.tai.org.au/content/money-nothing|website=The Australia Institute|publisher=The Australia Institute|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Malcolm|title=Address at the National Press Club and Q&amp;A|url=http://malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/address-at-the-national-press-club-and-qa-canberra|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial projects in operation==
There are no large-scale commercial CCS projects within Australia. The [[Global CCS Institute]] defines "large-scale" as 400,000 tonnes of {{CO2}} per annum, or 800,000 tonnes per annum for a coal plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Large-scale CCS projects - definitions|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/large-scale-ccs-projects-definitions|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It previously used a one million tonnes per annum threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G8 objective|url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/strategic-analysis-global-status-carbon-capture-storage-report-5/12-g8-objective|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstration and proposed projects and projects under construction are listed below with brief descriptions.

==Demonstration projects==

===CO2CRC Otway Project===
The CO2CRC Otway Project in Western Victoria is a demonstration project which has injected and stored over 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in a depleted natural gas reservoir 2&amp;nbsp;km below the Earth’s surface. The project was first proposed to the Board of the then Australian Petroleum Cooperative Research Centre (APCRC) in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologically Storing Carbon: Learning from the Otway Project Experience |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/pid/7317.htm |editor1=Cook, Peter |publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781486302307}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no sign of leakage according to a comprehensive monitoring and verification program. A mixture of Carbon dioxide and methane gas is extracted from a well in the Bathurst field, then compressed and transported via dedicated pipeline to the Naylor field two kilometres away. The gases are then injected into the depleted gas reservoir through a dedicated injection well. A nearby well (previously used to produce natural gas) is used to monitor the injected carbon dioxide. A second stage of the project, involving evaluation of carbon dioxide storage in deep saline formations, has been highly successful and provided data on estimating CO2 storage capacity using an innovative single well test. The project is Australia's first demonstration of geosequestration and one of the world's largest geosequestration research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co2crc.com.au/otway/ CO2CRC - Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This area has active exploration for geothermal and petroleum resources and has been supported by geotechnical work completed by the public sector and the private sector.

===Post combustion capture projects in the Latrobe Valley===
The Latrobe Valley Post Combustion Capture Project was a joint collaboration between Loy Yang Power, International Power Hazelwood, government and researchers from CSIRO’s Energy Transformed Flagship and CO2CRC (including Monash and Melbourne Universities), involving research at both Loy Yang and Hazelwood power stations. The 10.5-metre-high pilot plant at Loy Yang was designed to capture up to 1,000 tonnes of {{CO2}} per annum from the power station's exhaust-gas flues. Future trials were expected to involve the use of a range of different {{CO2}}-capture liquids. On 9 July 2008, CSIRO Energy Technology Chief Dr David Brockway announced that carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) had been captured from power station flue gases in a post-combustion-capture (PCC) pilot plant at Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. The purpose of the pilot plant is to conduct research, not to capture all the emissions from the power station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/news/CarbonDioxideCapture.html Coal-generated {{CO2}} captured in Australia – a first (Media Release)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further government projects in this area led to many geo-technical studies that review gas and liquid migration, trapping and leakage. While the Gippsland area has been described as a basin margin, this is somewhat vague. The area defines a major fold belt onshore and offshore. The key risk to injection of {{CO2}} in the area is the ability to keep gas in the ground. Multiple regional and local studies over the area have been completed by government and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3d-geo.com 3D GEO Australia geo-technical services in carbon capture/storage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the PICA Post-Combustion Project was announced. This is a joint collaboration between [[CSIRO]], [[IHI Corporation]] (Japanese technology provider) and [[AGL Energy|AGL]]. It will use a pilot plant to test {{CO2}}-capture liquids over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cottrell|first1=Aaron|title=PICA Post-Combustion Capture Project|url=http://www.bcinnovation.com.au/167Research|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905094831/http://www.bcinnovation.com.au/167Research#|archive-date=2017-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CO2CRC/HRL Mulgrave Capture Project===
CO2CRC commissioned three carbon dioxide capture research rigs at HRL’s gasifier research facility at Mulgrave in Melbourne, Victoria. The CO2CRC rigs captured carbon dioxide from [[syngas]], the product of the brown coal gasifier, using solvent, membrane and adsorbent technologies. The capture technologies are equally applicable to syngas from brown and black coal, gas or biomass fuels. During the project, researchers evaluated each technology for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Advanced gasifier technologies are highly suitable for carbon dioxide capture for CCS as they produce a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.co2crc.com.au/research/demo_precombustion.html |title=CO2CRC/HRL Mulgrave Capture Project |access-date=2009-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620045542/http://www.co2crc.com.au/research/demo_precombustion.html |archive-date=2009-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed projects==

===Gorgon gas field, Barrow Island===
This project led by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] will be designed to capture 3.5&amp;nbsp;Mt of carbon dioxide per annum from [[Gorgon gas project|Greater Gorgon gas fields]] and store it in the Dupuy formation beneath the [[Barrow Island (Western Australia)|Barrow Island.]] The project will be the largest carbon dioxide sequestration operation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-begins-even-as-abbott-tax-repeal-looms-20130911-2tj0c.html|title=World's largest carbon capture begins even as Abbott tax repeal looms|last=Kemp|first=John|date=2013-09-10|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chevron is liable for leaks and other damage during the project's lifetime and for 15 years afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-begins-even-as-abbott-tax-repeal-looms-20130911-2tj0c.html|title=World's largest carbon capture begins even as Abbott tax repeal looms|last=Kemp|first=John|date=2013-09-10|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2009 the state and federal governments agreed to indemnify Chevron against liability for the project after that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/wa-and-commonwealth-to-share-gorgon-load-20090817-endr.html|title=WA and Commonwealth to share Gorgon load|date=2009-08-17|website=WAtoday|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Commonwealth in 2015 confirming it would adopt 80% of the liability and WA the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Parliament/Bills.nsf/9D4676B11F1471BC48257E0C001AA55F/$File/Bill87-1BSR.pdf|title=Barrow Island Amendment Bill 2015: Second reading speech|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project ===
In April 2018, the federal and Victorian governments announced a brown coal-to-hydrogen project that would operate out of [[AGL Energy]]'s [[Loy Yang A]] power station. Construction is expected to begin in 2019, and hydrogen production by 2020 or 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gippslandtimes.com.au/story/5344848/converting-coal-to-hydrogen/|title=Converting coal to hydrogen|last=Slater|first=Michelle|date=2018-04-16|work=Gippsland Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CarbonNet Project===
[[CarbonNet]] was established by the Victorian Government in 2009 to investigate the potential for establishing a world class, large-scale, multi-user carbon capture and storage network in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/www.globalccsinstitute.com/files/publications/50856/carbonnet-corporate-brochure.pdf Global CCS Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Australian Government selected CarbonNet as one of only two CCS flagship projects under its Clean Energy Initiative and, with the State of Victoria, awarded the project a further $100 million in joint funding to undertake feasibility. The Global CCS Institute provided $2.3 million in support.

In 2016 it was reported that "When Australia repealed the [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon price]] the project did not advance",&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Finkel &amp; Belinda Smith, Can We Bury the Problem?, ''Cosmos'', Feb-Mar 2016, p 54.&lt;/ref&gt; but as of January 2018 the project was conducting a 17-day seismic survey of former oil wells in the [[Gippsland Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-18/golden-beach-closes-for-seismic-survey-ahead-of-carbon-capture/9338562|title=Victorian beach closes for carbon capture and storage seismic survey|date=2018-01-18|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Completed projects ==

===Callide Oxyfuel Project, Queensland===
The Callide Oxyfuel Project demonstrated carbon capture using oxyfuel combustion, but did not achieve carbon storage. The Oxyfuel boiler operated for two years and nine months, beyond the project's expected duration, and achieved "partial capture" of 75 tonnes of {{CO2}} per day (27,300 tonnes per annum). The project team assessed eight potential carbon storage sites but were unsuitable because of location, availability and geological profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greig|first1=Chris|last2=Bongers|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Stott|first3=Caroline|last4=Byrom|first4=Stephanie|title=Overview of CCS Roadmaps and Projects|url=http://anlecrd.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Overview-of-CCS-Roadmaps-and-Projects.pdf|website=ANLEC|accessdate=5 September 2017|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was headed by [[CS Energy Ltd]] (which operates the Callide power plants) in conjunction with an international team of partners, including IHI Corporation (Japan), J-Power (Japan), Mitsui &amp; Company (Japan) Schlumberger Oilfields Australia and Xstrata Coal. The [[Australian Coal Association]] (through the industry fund [[Coal21]]), and the Commonwealth (through the [[Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund]], Queensland and Japanese governments provided financial support for the project, which was expected to cost A$208 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Callide-A Oxyfuel Fact Sheet: Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Project|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/callide_a_oxyfuel.html|website=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies|publisher=MIT|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a project for the [[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newgencoal.com.au/solutions_ccs-projects_callide-oxyfuel.aspx Flagship Project: Callide Oxyfuel Project].

===International Power Carbon Capture Plant, Victoria (Hazelwood 2030) ===
A post-combustion capture plant operated at the International Power GDF Suez Hazelwood Power Station [[Hazelwood Power Station, Victoria|Hazelwood]]. 

When announced in 2007, the project was originally planned as a retro-fit of one of Hazelwood's eight generating units, which would have reduced its emissions intensity by 20% (500,000 tonnes per annum).

A pilot program with a more modest capture objective was completed. The solvent capture plant cost $10 million (including grants from state and federal governments) and began operation in 2009, capturing and chemically sequestered {{CO2}} at a nominal rate of 10,000 tonnes per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-08/10m-latrobe-valley-carbon-capture-plant-opens/1345948|title=$10m Latrobe Valley carbon capture plant opens|date=2009-07-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hazelwood Power Station closed in March 2017.

==Delayed projects==

===Monash coal-to-liquids===
On 2 December 2008 Shell and Anglo American announced that this possible [[brown coal]] project in the [[Latrobe Valley]] will not proceed at present. They have described it as a "long term" opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nges.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=1 Shell, Anglo to Delay A$5 Billion Clean Fuels Project] Retrieved 05 Feb 2009 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned project was planned to have some CCS, storing the gas captured in depleted off-shore oil fields in the [[Gippsland Basin]] in east [[Bass Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/09/monash_energy_m.html Green Car Congress: Monash Energy Moving Forward on 60Kbpd Coal-to-Liquids with Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled projects==

===BP Kwinana (WA) coal to gas plant===
A proposed $2 billion "hydrogen energy" coal-to-gas plant will not proceed because the geological formations off Perth, which were intended to sequester the {{CO2}}, contain gas "chimneys" that "mean it is next to impossible to establish a seal in the strata that could contain the CO2".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23672893-5005200,00.html | work=The Australian | first=Nigel | last=Wilson | title=Stock Quotes | date=10 May 2008 | access-date=2008-05-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511015133/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23672893-5005200,00.html# | archive-date=2008-05-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4953">In [[astrodynamics]], the '''characteristic energy''' (&lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;) is a measure of the excess [[specific energy]] over that required to just barely escape from a massive body. The units are [[length]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[time]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. [[velocity]] squared or twice the [[energy]] per [[mass]].

Every object in a [[two-body problem|2-body]] [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory has a constant [[specific orbital energy]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; equal to the sum of its specific kinetic and specific potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} v^2 - \frac{\mu}{r} = \text{constant} = \frac{1}{2} C_3,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu = GM&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]] of the massive body with mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radial distance]] from its center. As an object in an escape trajectory moves outward, its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy (which is always negative) increases, maintaining a constant sum.

Note that ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is ''twice'' the [[specific orbital energy]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of the escaping object.

==Non-escape trajectory==
A spacecraft with insufficient energy to escape will remain in a closed orbit (unless it intersects the [[central body]]), with
:&lt;math&gt;C_3 = -\frac{\mu}{a} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = GM&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the orbit's [[ellipse]].

If the orbit is circular, of radius ''r'', then
:&lt;math&gt;C_3 = -\frac{\mu}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

==Parabolic trajectory==
A spacecraft leaving the central body on a [[parabolic trajectory]] has exactly the energy needed to escape and no more:
:&lt;math&gt;C_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Hyperbolic trajectory==
A spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] has more than enough energy to escape:
:&lt;math&gt;C_3 = \frac{\mu}{|a|} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = GM&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the orbit's [[hyperbola]] (which may be negative in some convention).

Also,
:&lt;math&gt;C_3 = v_\infty^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the [[asymptotic]] velocity at infinite distance.  Spacecraft's velocity approaches &lt;math&gt;v_\infty&lt;/math&gt; as it is further away from the central object's gravity.

==Examples==
[[MAVEN]], a [[Mars]]-bound spacecraft, was launched into a trajectory with a characteristic energy of 12.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/11/atlasv-launch-maven-mars-mission Atlas V set to launch MAVEN on Mars mission], nasaspaceflight.com, 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When simplified to a [[two-body problem]], this would mean the MAVEN escaped Earth on a hyperbolic trajectory slowly decreasing its speed towards &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{12.2}\text{ km/s} = 3.5\text{ km/s}&lt;/math&gt;. However, since the Sun's gravitational field is much stronger than Earth's, the two-body solution is insufficient. The characteristic energy with respect to Sun was negative, and MAVEN – instead of heading to infinity – entered an [[heliocentric orbit|elliptical orbit around the Sun]]. But the maximal velocity on the new orbit could be approximated to 33.5&amp;nbsp;km/s by assuming that it reached practical "infinity" at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km/s and that such Earth-bound "infinity" also moves with Earth's orbital velocity of about 30&amp;nbsp;km/s.

The [[InSight]] mission to Mars launched with a maximum C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of 14.3 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/2016-10/04Banerdt_InSight.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group |last=Banerdt |first=B. |date=2016-10-06 |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parker Solar Probe]] (via Venus) plans a maximum C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of 154 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Launch |title=Parker Solar Probe: The Mission |author=JHUAPL |website=parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu |language=en |access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Pickering''' (November 10, 1805 – March 17, 1878) was an American [[Scientific racism|race scientist]] and [[naturalist]].&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Pickering, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born on Starucca Creek, Upper [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]], the grandson of Colonel [[Timothy Pickering]], after the death of his father he was raised in the house of his esteemed grandfather in [[Wenham, Massachusetts]]. Despite his part in the student rebellion of 1823, he received a medical degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=AMB /&gt; A practicing physician in [[Philadelphia]], he became active as librarian and [[curator]] at the city's [[Academy of Natural Sciences]].

Pickering went with the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838-1842 as one of its naturalists. [[Charles Wilkes]], the expedition's commander, named [[Pickering Passage]] in honor of Charles Pickering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His journal of the Expedition was a major influence on Wilkes' ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition''.

From 1842-43, Pickering curated the collection from the Wilkes Expedition, which was housed at the [[Patent Office]] in Washington DC, these collections were to form the foundation of the [[Smithsonian Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel. "The Scientific Legacy of the U.S. Exploring Expedition." http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/usexex/learn/philbrick.htm}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickering was a [[polygenist]], he believed that different races had been created separately. In 1843, he traveled to the Middle East, Zanzibar and India to continue his research for his book on the Races of Man. In 1848, Pickering published ''Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution'', which enumerated eleven races.

He later moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], where he resumed his medical practice, and eventually died on March 17, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Massachusetts Vital Records, 1840–1911|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Sarah Stoddard Pickering, who posthumously published his final work. He was an associate of many important figures in America's intellectual landscape, including [[Asa Gray]], [[Horatio Hale]], [[James Dwight Dana]] and [[Louis Agassiz]]. 

A [[subspecies]] of North American garter snake, ''[[Thamnophis sirtalis|Thamnophis sirtalis pickeringii]]'', is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''Ecological selection''' (or '''environmental selection''' or '''survival selection''' or '''individual selection''' or '''asexual selection''') refers to [[natural selection]] without [[sexual selection]], i.e. strictly ecological processes that operate on a [[species]]' inherited traits without reference to mating or secondary sex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The variant names describe varying circumstances where sexual selection is wholly suppressed as a mating factor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Ecologists often study ecological selection when examining the abundance of individuals per population across regions, and what governs such abundances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCoughlin |first1=Phillip D.|last2=Morris|first2=Douglas W.|last3=Fortin|first3=Daniel|last4=Vander Wal |first4=Eric |last5=Contasti|first5=Adrienne L.|title=Considering ecological dynamics in resource selection functions|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=January 1, 2010 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01613.x|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=23ab65ae-46a8-40c6-b205-964bd2413f11%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4206|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumstances in which it occurs==
Ecological selection can be said to be taking place in any circumstance where inheritance of specific traits is determined by ecology alone without direct sexual competition, when e.g. sexual competition is strictly ecological or economic, there is little or no mate choice, females do not resist any male who wishes to mate, all traits will be equally propagated regardless of mating, or the species is hermaphroditic or asexually reproducing, an ecological selection is taking place. For example, environmental pressures are largely responsible for the evolution of different life history strategies between the African honey bee, [[African honey bee|''A. m. scutellata'']], and the [[Western honey bee|European honey bee]].&lt;ref name="Fewell and Bertram, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fewell|first=Jennifer H.|author2=Susan M. Bertram|title=Evidence for genetic variation in worker task performance by African and European honeybees|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2002|volume=52|pages=318–25|doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0501-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species, it is applicable mostly to situations where ecological pressures prevent most competitors from reaching maturity, or where crowding or pair-bonding or an extreme suppression of sexual selection factors prevents the normal sexual competition rituals and selection from taking place, but which also prevent [[artificial selection]] from operating, e.g. arranged marriages, where parents rather than the young select the mate based on economic or even astrological factors, and where the sexual desires of the mated pair are often subordinated to these factors, are artificial unless ''wholly'' based on an ecological factor such as control of land which is held by their own force.

In forests, ecological selection can be witnessed involving many factors such as available sunlight, soil quality, and the surrounding [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  During forest growth, tree seedlings in particular, are ecosystem pioneers, and different tree seedlings can often react to a number of members in their ecological community in completely different ways, thus providing a spectrum of ecological occupations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marks|first1=C.O.|last2=Conti|first2=E.|title=The causes of variation in tree seedling traits: the roles of environmental selection versus chance|journal=Evolution|date=2007|volume=61|issue=2|pages=455–469|doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.00021.x|pmid=17348954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, adult trees can heavily impact their ecological communities, reversing the roles of ecological selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=B.V.|last2=Spurr|first2=S.H.|title=Forest Ecology|date=1980|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of the soil are an extremely influential selective factor in forest growth.  Throughout time, every species of tree has evolved to grow under specific soil conditions, whether it is dependent on the [[pH]] levels, the mineral contents, or the drainage levels.  Each of these is a vehicle for ecological selection to do its work in the course of [[evolution]].  However, ecological selection can be much more specific, not only working within species but within populations, even populations in the same region.  For example, scientists in [[Quebec]] recently examined how tree seedlings react to different nitrate levels.  What they found was that areas with higher nitrate levels contained plants that could much more efficiently metabolize nitrogen.  Such plants could perform [[photosynthesis]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] at a much faster rate than their nitrogen lacking peers, and also had longer root lengths on average, giving them an evolutionary advantage for their [[habitat]].  Nitrogen levels that are unexpectedly too high could harm some tree species, but these particular specimens created a [[Ecological niche|niche]] for themselves, and could outcompete others around them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A site of tree growth can also be influenced by slope, rockiness, climate, and available sunlight.  Space is initially available to everything, but seedlings that can most quickly inhabit the soil and take advantage of the available nutrients are usually most successful.  Generally, one of the first factors to control which species grow best in the soil is the amount of sunlight.  Soil and water themselves are both very important (For instance, a dry hardwood such as a white oak will not grow in a swamp), but sunlight is the initial decider in forest succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=A.|last2=Van|first2=B.M.|last3=Ashton|first3=M.S.|last4=Wishnie|first4=M.|last5=Mariscal|first5=E.|last6=Deago|first6=J.|last7=Ibarra|first7=D.|last8=Hall|first8=J.S.|title=Local and regional environmental variation influences the growth of tropical trees in selection trials in the Republic of Panama|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2010.03.021 |journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=260|issue=1|pages=12–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shade intolerant trees can immediately grow impressively.  They need the sunlight that is offered by an open canopy found in a bare environment.  Selection weeds out the seedlings that can not handle full sun, thus tall, straight trees will eventually grow and develop a full, lush canopy.  However, these behaviors will soon be reversed.  [[Seedlings]] that were once removed by ecological selection now become favored, because the shaded forest floor has become ideal for such shade tolerant species.  This is a great example of how ecological selection can create niches for different species by performing the same function with different outcomes.

==Vs. sexual selection==
In cases where ecological and sexual selection factors are strongly at odds, simultaneously encouraging and discouraging the same traits, it may also be important to distinguish them as sub-processes within natural selection.

For instance, ''Ceratogaulus'', the [[Oligocene]] [[horned gopher]], left in the fossil record a series of individuals with successively longer and longer horns, that seemed to be unrelated or maladaptive to its ecological niche.  Some modern scientists have theorized that the horns were useful or impressive in mating rituals among males (although other scientists dispute this theory, pointing out that the horns were not [[sexually dimorphic]]) and that it was an example of [[runaway evolution]].  The species seems to have suddenly died out when horns reached approximately the body length of the animal itself, possibly because it could no longer run or evade predators—thus ecological selection seems to have ultimately trumped sexual. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

It is also important to distinguish ecological selection in cases of extreme ecological abundance, e.g. the human [[built environment]], cities or zoos, where [[sexual selection]] must generally predominate, as there is no threat of the species or individuals losing their [[ecological niche]].  Even in these situations, however, where survival is not in question, the variety and the quality of food, e.g. as presented by male to female monkeys in exchange for sex in some species, still influences reproduction, however it becomes a sexual selection factor. Similar phenomena can be said to exist in humans e.g. the "[[mail order bride]]" who primarily mates for economic advantage.

Differentiating ecological selection from sexual is useful especially in such extreme cases;  Above examples demonstrate exceptions rather than a typical selection in the wild.  In general, ecological selection is assumed to be the dominant process in [[natural selection]], except in highly cognitive species that do not, or do not always, pair bond, e.g. [[walrus]], [[gorilla]], [[human]].  But even in these species, one would distinguish cases where isolated populations had no real choice of mates, or where the vast majority of individuals died before sexual maturity, leaving only the ecologically selected survivor to mate—regardless of its sexual fitness under normal [[sexual selection]] processes for that species.

For example, if only a few closely related males survive a natural disaster, and all are able to mate very widely due to lack of males, sexual selection has been suppressed by an ecological selection (the disaster).  Such situations are usually temporary, characteristic of populations under extreme stress, for relatively short terms.  However, they can drastically affect populations in that short time, sometimes eliminating all individuals susceptible to a [[pathogen]], and thereby rendering all survivors immune.  A few such catastrophic events where ecological selection predominates can lead to a population with specific advantages, e.g. in [[colonization]] when invading populations from more crowded disease-prone conditions arrive with antibodies to diseases, and the diseases themselves, which proceed to wipe out natives, clearing the way for the colonists.

In humans, the intervention of artificial devices such as ships or blankets may be enough to make some consider this an example of [[artificial selection]].  However it is clearly observed in other species, it seems unreasonable to differentiate colonization by ship from colonization by walking, and even the word "colony" is not specific to humans but refers generically to an intrusion of one species on an ecology to which it has not wholly adapted.  So, despite the potential controversy, it may be better to consider all examples of colonist-borne diseases to be ecological selection.

For another example, in a region devastated by [[nuclear radiation]], such as the [[Bikini Atoll]], capacity to survive [[gamma ray]]s to sexual maturity and (for the female) to term is a key ecological selection factor, although it is neither "[[natural selection|natural]]" nor sexual.  Some would call this too [[artificial selection]], not natural or ecological, as the radiation does not enter the ecology as a factor save due to man's effort.  Ambiguous artificial-plus-ecological factors may reasonably be called "[[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]]", and the term '''environmental selection''' may be preferable in these cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">The '''El Cielo Biosphere''' (''Reserva de la Biosfera El Cielo'' in Spanish) is located in the southern part of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Tamaulipas]].  The biosphere protects the northernmost extension of tropical forest and [[cloud forest]] in Mexico.  It has an area of {{convert|144530|ha|acre}} (558 square miles) made up mostly of steep mountains rising from about {{convert|200|m|ft}} to a maximum altitude of more than {{convert|2300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad'', http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/2/cielo.html, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Tamaulipas created the biosphere in 1985.  In 1987 it was recognized by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gomez Farias Region and El Cielo Biosphere Reserve", http://www.botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El cielo biosphere map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map of El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in Tamaulipas state, Mexico.]]

==History==

The El Cielo area attracted little attention until the 1930s.  In 1935, A Canadian farmer and horticulturalist named John William Francis (Frank, Francisco, or Pancho) Harrison established a homestead he named Rancho El Cielo at {{convert|1140|m|ft}} elevation in the cloud forest.  Extensive logging and logging roads penetrated the area in the 1950s.  Enthusiastic birdwatchers found their way to Harrison's small ranch and in 1965, to protect the ecosystem, Harrison transferred his land to a non-profit corporation in cooperation with [[Texas Southmost College]] and the [[Gorgas Science Foundation]]. In 1966, Harrison was murdered in a land dispute with local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Fred and Marie S. ''The Road to El Cielo'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001, pp. 113-118; "Gomez Farias Region and El Cielo Biosphere Reserve", http://www.botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison's farm is now the El Cielo Biological Research Center. In 1983, the Gorgas Science Foundation established Rancho El Cielito by purchasing land along the Sabinas River, just outside the Biosphere, to preserve part of a riparian ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;"Rancho El Cielo and Rancho El Cielito", Gorgas Science Foundation http://www.gsfinc.org/focus/mexico, accessed 23 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The {{convert|144530|ha|acre}} biosphere has two core areas in which most human travel and exploitation are prohibited.  One of {{convert|7844|ha|acre}} protects tropical forests; the larger core area of {{convert|28674|ha|acre}} includes a cross section of the altitudes and climates of the biosphere, especially the cloud forest. The remainder of the biosphere is a buffer zone in which human activities, including limited logging, is permitted. Several communities within the biosphere offer facilities for visitors and are reachable by road.&lt;ref&gt;Sosa Florescano, Alejandra, "El Cielo: A Reserve Teeming with Life" http://www.revistascisan.unam.mx/Voices/pdfs/6822.pdf, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt; An ecological interpretive center is reached by paved road a few miles west of the town of [[Gómez Farías, Tamaulipas|Gomez Farias]]. The interpretive center, located at an elevation of {{convert|360|m|ft}} offers good views of the tropical forest and facilities for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

The biosphere occupies portions of four Mexican municipalities in the state of Tamaulipas: [[Jaumave, Tamaulipas|Jaumave]], [[Llera, Tamaulipas|Llera de Canales]]. Gómez Farías, and [[Ocampo, Tamaulipas|Ocampo]].  Within the biosphere are 26 [[ejido]]s (hamlets with communal land) and about {{convert|8000|ha|acre}} of agricultural land used mostly to cultivate corn, beans, and rice.&lt;ref&gt;''Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad'', http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/2/cielo.html, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The principal access is a road, initially paved, from the town of Gomez Farias into the interior and higher elevations of the biosphere. The community of Alta Cima (also known as Altas Cimas), at an elevation of {{convert|910|m|ft}} has modest lodging and restaurants for visitors. Camping is allowed.

The highest point in the biosphere is {{convert|7719|ft|m}} located at 23 14N, 99 30W.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest elevations are about {{convert|200|m|ft}} at the eastern, northern, and southern borders of the biosphere. The biosphere is characterized by steep, north-south trending mountain ranges, eastern extensions of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], made up of [[limestone]].  Typical of [[karst]] topography, caves, sinkholes, and rock outcrops are common.&lt;ref&gt;"Gomez Farias Region and El Cielo Biosphere Reserve", http://www.botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora==
[[File:Asclepias curassavica crop.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Asclepias curassavica]]'', an important food source for the [[monarch butterflies]] which migrate through the biosphere.]]
Several distinct vegetation types are found in the biosphere. Vegetation in the drier northern and western portions of the biosphere up to an elevation of {{convert|1600|m|ft}} consists of desert and semi-desert shrublands, the montane [[Tamaulipan matorral]] and the lowland [[Tamaulipan mezquital]].  Shrubs and small trees generally do not exceed {{convert|5|m|ft}} in height except in riparian locations. Annual precipitation in the shrublands is less than {{convert|1000|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Tamaulipan Matorral" http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na1311, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern part of the biosphere, sub-tropical semi-deciduous forests ([[Veracruz moist forests]]) are found at elevations of from {{convert|200|m|ft}} and {{convert|800|m|ft}} above sea level. The closed canopy forests averages about {{convert|20|m|ft}} in height. Annual precipitation of this zone is usually from {{convert|1100|mm|in}} to more than {{convert|1800|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Veracruz Moist Forests" http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0176, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal reason for the establishment of the Biosphere was the prevalence of [[cloud forest]]s, distinguished by heavy precipitation, foggy conditions, and abundant mosses and fungi, at elevations of {{convert|800|m|ft}} to {{convert|1400|m|ft}}. The El Cielo cloud forests receive precipitation of about {{convert|2500|mm|in}} annually. The closed canopy forests reach a height of about {{convert|30|m|ft}}.

Oak forests, ([[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]]), mixed oak-pine forest, and pine forests are found at elevations of {{convert|700|m|ft}} to the top of highest summits in the biosphere. These forested highland areas are drier than the cloud forests with an average precipitation of {{convert|850|mm|in}} annually.&lt;ref&gt;''Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad'', http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/2/cielo.html, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downey|first1=Patricia J.|last2=Hellgren|first2=Eric C.|last3=Caso|first3=Arturo|last4=Carvajal|first4=Sasha|last5=Frangioso|first5=Kerri |year=2007 |title=Hair Snares for Noninvasive Sampling of Felids in North America: Do Gray Foxes Affect Success? |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=2090–2094 |doi=10.2193/2006-500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the vegetation types have a wet season from May to October and a dry season from November to April. More than 1,000 species of vegetation have been recorded from the cloud forests consisting of 56 percent tropical species, 20 percent temperate, 19 percent cosmopolitan, and 5 percent other. Included among the vegetation are species associated with the temperate climate of the eastern United States such as [[maple]] (''Acer skutchii''), [[hickory]] (''[[Carya ovata]]''), [[hornbeam]] (''[[Carpinus caroliniana]]''), and [[redbud]] (''[[Cercis canadensis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Gomez Farias Region and El Cielo Biosphere Reserve", http://www.botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A botanical garden and [[arboretum]] is located in Alta Cima at an elevation of {{convert|800|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Botanical Gardens Conservation International" http://www.bgci.org/garden.php?id=3594&amp;ftrCountry=MX&amp;ftrKeyword=&amp;ftrBGCImem=&amp;ftrIAReg=, accessed 22 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Six species of cats, none abundant, are found in the biosphere: [[jaguar]], [[mountain lion]], [[ocelot]], [[margay]], [[jaguarundi]], and [[bobcat]]. A small population of [[American black bear|black bear]]s is present.

At least 255 species of birds are resident in the biosphere preserve and more than 175 migratory species have been recorded.  Both birds and mammals are a mixture of temperate and tropical species.&lt;ref&gt;''Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad'', http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/2/cielo.html, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

The climate of Gomez Farias at the eastern entrance to the park is typical of the lower and wetter elevations of the biosphere.  Higher elevations are substantially cooler and precipitation declines rapidly on the western slopes of the mountains.  The town of [[Jaumave, Tamaulipas]] at the northwestern entrance to the biosphere receives only {{convert|17.9|in|mm}} of precipitation annually and has a semi-arid, near-desert climate. Freezing temperatures are rare at the lower elevations of El Cielo, but common in winter at elevations of more than {{convert|1000|m|ft}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3638">The '''Federal Fuel Administration''' was a [[World War I]]-era agency of the [[Federal government of the United States]] established by {{EO|2690}} of August 23, 1917 pursuant to the [[Food and Fuel Control Act]], managed use of coal and oil. To conserve energy, it introduced daylight saving time, shortened work weeks for civilian goods factories, and encouraged Heatless Mondays.

Even prior to a declaration of war by the United States, shortages of coal were experienced in the winter of 1916-17. To address concerns about a steady supply of fuel to support military and industrial operations and for use by consumers, in 1917 the Federal Fuel Administration was established and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] appointed [[Harry A. Garfield]] to lead the agency. Garfield in turn selected local administrators for each state. Fuel committees were organized down to the [[County (United States)|county]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E0D9103BE03ABC4053DFBF66838C609EDE GARFIELD ASKS AID OF COAL CONSUMERS; Wants Them to Co-operate in Enforcing Prices Fixed by Him. TO NAME STATE AGENTS Seeks Voluntary Arrangements with Operators for Adjustment of Contracts.] The New York Times. September 8, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the administration included [[price control|setting and enforcing the prices]] of [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800EEDC133BEE3ABC4952DFBF66838C609EDE GARFIELD TO FIX RETAIL COAL PRICES; Administrator Likely to Make Announcement Before Oct. 1] The New York Times. September 11, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The administration had broad powers to set the price of coal at various points (mine, dock) and the cost of transportation (by rail), and in regard to end use (home, factory, or business, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D05E1DD113AE433A2575AC2A9669D946696D6CF PRICE FIXED FOR LAKE COAL.; $6.20 to $7 for Run of Mine on Michigan and Superior] October 29, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Daylight Saving Time was formally adopted in the United States in 1918 by the Fuel Administration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The [[Standard Time Act of 1918]] established both standard time zones and set summer DST to begin on March 31, 1918. The idea was unpopular, however, and Congress abolished DST after the war, overriding President Woodrow Wilson's veto. DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year-round DST, called "War Time," on February 9, 1942. It lasted until the last Sunday in September 1945. The next year, many states and localities adopted summer DST.

By mid-1922, the administration's activities were declining and some states were taking a more active role in managing coal production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFDD1039EF3ABC4950DFBE668389639EDE GOVERNOR ARRIVES TO PICK FUEL HEAD; L.

Mr. Outerbridge said the Federal Fuel Administration was 'dissolving and going home,' indicating that the failure of the Washington officials to continue to function withdrew needed support from the local fuel officials."&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2011 Nuon announced the pilot plant would be closed down since no investor for production expansion could be found. However, on May 7, 2012 Nuon announced that '''Helianthos''' has been sold to HyET Solar.

==Process technology==
The process uses a temporary substrate on which flexible [[thin-film solar cell]]s are deposited.  The use of the temporary substrate allows relatively high processing temperatures while using (semi-)continuous roll-to-roll (or [[reel-to-reel]]) production processes and cost-efficient, abundantly available materials.

The [[active layer]]s of such solar cells comprise a transparent [[conductive]] [[oxide]] layer ([[Transparent conducting oxide|TCO]]), an [[active absorbent layer]] (e.g. [[thin-film silicon]]), and a back [[contact layer]] (e.g. a [[reflective]] [[metal]] layer).

==Process sequence==
The key steps in the process sequence are:
#  Deposit the TCO layer on a temporary metal substrate foil using [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) at about 500&amp;nbsp;°C (932&amp;nbsp;°F) .
# Deposit the active absorber layer (e.g. thin film silicon layer) using plasma enhanced CVD
# Deposit the reflective back contact by means of [[physical vapor deposition]]
# Pattern for monolithic interconnection
# [[Laminate]] to a permanent carrier foil
# Remove the temporary substrate foil by means of [[Industrial etching|wet etching]]
# Confectioning, contact application and encapsulation

==Applications==
Using this process, flexible photovoltaic (PV) [[laminate]]s are fabricated that can substantially reduce the per-[[kilowatt hour]] costs of solar [[electricity]].  Further, the resulting photovoltaic laminates are lightweight, rugged and offer certain freedoms of design.

PV laminates have the potential to be used for a range of applications, including:
* Large area roofing and other large area applications to generate electricity
* Rural electrification
* Industrial applications
* Portable applications.

Archeological evidence suggests that the first civilizations arose in [[Sumer]], in southern [[Mesopotamia]] (now Iraq) and [[Egypt]], both dating from around 3000 [[BCE]]. By 1000 BCE, civilizations were also established in India, China, Mexico, Peru and in parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, S. (1988).

The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating in search of wild foods and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia required many labourers to build and maintain its [[irrigation]] system. This, in turn, led to political [[hierarchy]], [[bureaucracy]], and [[religion|religious]] sanction, along with standing [[Army|armies]] to protect the emergent civilization. Intensified agriculture allowed for population increase, but also led to [[deforestation]] in upstream areas with resultant flooding and over-irrigation, which raised [[soil salinity]].  While there was a shift from the cultivation of [[wheat]] to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]], yields still diminished. Eventually, decreasing agricultural production and other factors led to the decline of the civilization. From 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population was reduced by nearly sixty percent.&lt;ref name = Wright/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson |first=W.

Technological advances over several millennia gave humans increasing control over the environment. But it was the Western [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in [[fossil fuels]]. [[Coal]] was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease.&lt;ref name="Hilgenkamp" /&gt; Such conditions led to a human population explosion and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the [[Anthropocene]]. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;Goudie A. (2005). ''The Human Impact on the Natural Environment.'' 6th ed. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-2704-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the environmental and social impacts of industry were expressed by some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists and through the [[Romantic movement]] of the 1800s. The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]], devised catastrophic and [[Malthusian catastrophe#Criticism|much-criticized theories of "overpopulation"]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] foresaw the desirability of a "stationary state" economy, thus anticipating concerns of the modern discipline of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J.

==Early 20th century==
{{See also|Environmental movement}}
By the 20th century, the industrial revolution had led to an exponential increase in the human consumption of resources. The increase in health, wealth and population was perceived as a simple path of progress.&lt;ref&gt;de Long, B. (2000). "Cornucopia: The Pace of Economic Growth in the
Twentieth Century." Working Paper 7602. Cambridge, MA:National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1930s economists began developing models of [[non-renewable resource]] management (see [[Hotelling's rule]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hotelling | first1 = H | year = 1931 | title = The Economics of Exhaustible Resources | url = | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 137–175 | doi=10.1086/254195}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources ([[Hartwick's rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartwick | first1 = J | year = 1977 | title = Intergenerational Equity and the Investing of Rents from Exhaustible Resources | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 972–974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecology]] had now gained general acceptance as a scientific discipline, and many concepts vital to sustainability were being explored. These included: the interconnectedness of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the [[biosphere]]; the importance of [[biogeochemical cycles|natural cycles]] (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through [[trophic level]]s of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Worster, D (1994) "Nature's economy: a history of ecological ideas".

Innovations in technology (including plastics, synthetic chemicals, nuclear energy) and the increasing use of fossil fuels, were transforming society. Modern industrial agriculture—the "[[Green Revolution]]"—was based on the development of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides which had devastating consequences for rural wildlife, as documented by American marine biologist, naturalist and environmentalist  [[Rachel Carson]] in ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962).

In 1956, American geoscientist [[M. King Hubbert|M. King Hubbert's]] [[peak oil]] theory predicted an inevitable peak of oil production, first in the United States (between 1965 and 1970), then in successive regions of the world—with a global peak expected thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, N.

Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations.&lt;ref name = LPR/&gt; A move toward [[sustainable living]] by increasing public awareness and adoption of [[recycling]], and [[renewable energies]] emerged.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Hyades''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|.|ə|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ὑάδες}}, popularly "rain-makers"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt; or "the rainy ones" from ὕω ''hyo'' "I fall as rain", but probably from ὗς ''hys'' "swine"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Hyades&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. "Hyades"]. Accessed 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) are a sisterhood of [[nymph]]s that bring rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHyades.html|title=HYADES - Star Nymphs of Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The Hyades were daughters of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (by either [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]] or [[Aethra (Greek mythology)#Oceanid|Aethra]], one of the [[Oceanides]]) and sisters of [[Hyas]] in most tellings, although one version gives their parents as Hyas and [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Fabulae 192"&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 5. 169 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Poetical Astronomy, 2. 21"&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'' 2. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyades are sisters to the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]] and the [[Hesperides]].

The main myth concerning them is envisioned to account for their collective name and to provide an [[etiology]] for their weepy raininess: Hyas was killed in a hunting accident and the Hyades wept from their grief.&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Fabulae 192" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 248&lt;/ref&gt; They were changed into a [[Hyades (star cluster)|cluster of stars, the Hyades]], set in the head of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]].&lt;ref&gt;"Taurus' face gleams with seven rays of fire, which Greek sailors call Hyades from their rain-word." ([[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 5. 164). In Ancient Greek, "to rain" is ''hyein''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their number varies from three in the earliest sources to fifteen in the late ones. The names are also variable, according to the mythographer, and include:

Additionally, '''[[Semele|Thyone]]''' and '''Prodice''' were supposed to be daughters of Hyas by [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]], and have been added to the group of stars.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Greeks believed that the [[heliacal rising]] and setting of the Hyades star cluster were always attended with rain, hence the association of the Hyades (sisters of Hyas) and the Hyades (daughters of ocean) with the constellation of the Hyades (rainy ones).&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Poetical Astronomy, 2. 21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Works and Days'' 609 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2. 43. 111; he also points out that the Romans wrongly refer to the Hyades as ''Suculae'' (Piglets), as though the name Hyades was derived from ''hys'' "sow", while it actually derives from ''hyein'' "to rain"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hyades are also thought to have been the tutors of [[Dionysus]], in some tellings of the latter's infancy,&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Fabulae 192" /&gt; and as such are equated with the [[Nysiads]], the nymphs who are also believed to have cared for Dionysus,&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 4. 3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with other reputed nurses of the god — the Lamides,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 9. 28 ff; in 14. 143, the identification is explicit&lt;/ref&gt; the Dodonides&lt;ref name="Hyginus, Poetical Astronomy, 2. 21" /&gt; and the nymphs of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'' 5.52.1; the Naxian nymphs were named Philia, Coronis and Cleide&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources relate that they were subject to aging, but Dionysus, to express his gratitude for having raised him, asked [[Medea]] to restore their youth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 7. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda|Suidas]] s. v. ''απεψησάμην''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tennyson's poem, Ulysses recalls his travels of old: 

"I cannot rest from travel: I will drink -
Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd -
Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those - 
That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when -
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades -
Vext the dim sea ..."

'''Ironwood''' is a common name for a large number of [[wood]]s or plants that have a reputation for hardness of the/their wood, or the wood density is over 1000 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the wood sinks in water. Usage of the name ironwood in english may (or may not) include the tree that yields this heavy wood that sinks in water.

[[File:Johngore.jpg|thumb|John Gore by [[John Webber]], 1780]]
Captain '''John Gore''' (c. 1730{{ndash}}10 August 1790) was a [[British American]] sailor who circumnavigated the globe four times with the [[Royal Navy]] in the 18th century and accompanied [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] in his discoveries in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==History==
Although little is known about John Gore before his service with the [[Royal Navy]], it is believed he was born in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Colony of Virginia]] in either 1729 or 1730. He first appears in the record books in 1755, joining [[HMS Windsor (1695)|HMS ''Windsor'']] at [[Portsmouth]] as a [[midshipman]].

Five years later Gore took his lieutenant's exam and was appointed [[master's mate]] of [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. Aboard the ''Dolphin'' Gore circumnavigated the globe twice&amp;mdash;first under [[John Byron]] and then [[Samuel Wallis]]. His experience in the Pacific Ocean and on extended navy expeditions led to him being called up to join [[James Cook]]'s mission to record the [[1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti|Transit of Venus in Tahiti]] and search for ''[[Terra Australis]]'' in 1768 aboard [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']]. On ''Endeavour'', Gore was initially third-in-command (i.e. 3rd Lieutenant) behind Cook (1st Lieutenant) and [[Zachary Hicks]]
(2nd Lieutenant). After the death of Hicks on the return voyage to England on 26 May 1771, Gore became second-in-command (2nd Lieutenant)
&lt;ref&gt;''Captain James Cook'' by Richard Hough. Coronet, London 1995 p 64,210&lt;/ref&gt;

Gore had previously been part of the Royal Navy crew aboard Wallis's ''Dolphin'' that had "discovered" Tahiti and he became valuable to Cook for his knowledge of the island. In 1769 Gore became the first recorded person on the expedition to shoot and kill a person of [[Māori people|Māori]] descent, following an altercation over a piece of cloth as the ''Endeavour'' charted the coast of [[New Zealand]]. Later, on 14 July 1770 Gore became famous for being the first person to shoot and kill a [[kangaroo]] (for scientific research) as the expedition made its way up the eastern seaboard of [[Australia]].

Returning to England, in 1772 Gore joined the [[botanist]] [[Joseph Banks]] (who had also been on Cook's first Pacific voyage) in a private scientific expedition to [[Iceland]] and the [[Hebrides]]. Gore and Banks may have become friends as evidence shows that Banks was the executor of Gore's will. The trip did not return until after Cook had sailed on his second Pacific voyage.

However, in 1776 Gore answered the call from Cook and the admiralty once again and joined [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] as [[First Lieutenant]] for Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]]. As the ''Resolution'' explored the Pacific in search of the famed [[Northwest Passage]], Gore would sight the American continent of his birth from the west coast. Later, following Cook's death in [[Hawaii]], [[Charles Clerke]], captain of ''Resolution's'' sister ship [[HMS Discovery (1774)|HMS ''Discovery'']] took command. Gore then assumed command of ''Discovery'' in Clerke's place. When Clerke himself died shortly after, Gore took responsibility for the entire expedition (unaware that his place of birth had [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] from Great Britain two years previously) and brought the ships home to England on 4 October 1780&amp;mdash;more than a year after assuming command. He was formally promoted to the post of captain on 2 October 1780.

In recognition of his achievements [[John Webber]], who had previously painted Cook, took Gore's portrait as the navy made him an honorary [[post-captain]]. Moving further in the footsteps of Cook, he was offered the late Captain's vacant rooms at the [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]]. In 1790, having circumnavigated the globe four times, he died on 10 August.

==Legacy==
Gore was survived by a son, John (born 1774) who was also a Royal Navy Officer, who reached the rank of captain on 19 July 1821, retiring in that rank on 1 October 1846, later promoted to Retired Rear Admiral on 8 March 1852 and dying in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;This John Gore is not to be confused with two other British naval officers - Sir John Gore, who reached the rank of vice admiral on 27 May 1825, and died on 21 August 1836, and the Honourable John Gore, who died in 1812 with the rank of commander; see ''The Commissioned Sea Officers of the Royal Navy 1660-1815'' (Navy Records Society, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Australia in 1834 as one of the first free settlers. Little is known of his mother (John Gore senior's wife), Ann Gore, although she is known to have received a Royal Navy widow's pension from 1790.&lt;ref&gt;WRD Leigh 1978 Biographical Notes and Genealogical Charts of Families descended from John Gore and Richard Leigh in Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; His son (that is, John Gore senior's grandson), Graham Gore, continued the expeditionary heritage, perishing in [[John Franklin]]'s [[Franklin's lost expedition|ill-fated attempt]] to navigate the Northwest Passage, nearly 70 years after his grandfather had attempted the same.

Gore Point and the Gore Peninsula in the [[Alaska]]n [[Kenai Fjords National Park|Kenai fjords]] were named for John Gore by Captain [[Nathaniel Portlock]], a fellow veteran of Cook's third voyage who explored the Pacific Northwest of America in the late 18th century. There are also several Australian sites named after John Gore.

[[File:Karta NZ Kermadec isl.PNG|thumb|map of the Kermadec Islands]]
[[File:STS008-36-1403 cropped rotated.jpg|right|thumb|Raoul Island from space]]

The '''Kermadec Islands''' {{IPAc-en|k|ər|ˈ|m|æ|d|ɛ|k}} ('''''Rangitāhua''''' in [[Maori language|Māori]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/kermadec-islands|title=Kermadec Islands – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|date=|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a [[subtropical]] [[island arc]] in the South Pacific Ocean {{convert|800|-|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]], and a similar distance southwest of [[Tonga]]. The islands are part of New Zealand, {{convert|33|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} in total area and nowadays uninhabited, except for the permanently manned [[Raoul Island]] Station, the northernmost outpost of New Zealand.

The islands are listed with the [[New Zealand Outlying Islands]]. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any [[Regions of New Zealand|region]] or [[Territorial Authorities of New Zealand|district]], but instead ''Area Outside Territorial Authority'', like all the other outlying islands except the [[Solander Islands]].

==History==
[[Polynesia]]n people settled the Kermadec Islands in around the 14th century (and perhaps previously in the 10th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Raoul &amp; the Kermadecs: New Zealand's Northernmost Islands, a History|first=Steven|last=Gentry|isbn=978-1-927242-02-5|year=2013|chapter=2: Rangitahua – the Stopping-off Place|pages=37–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first Europeans to reach the area—the ''[[Lady Penrhyn (1786 ship)|Lady Penrhyn]]'' in May 1788—found no inhabitants. The islands were named after the [[Brittany|Breton]] captain [[Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec]], who visited the islands as part of the [[d'Entrecasteaux]] expedition in the 1790s. European settlers, initially the Bell family, lived on the islands from the early nineteenth century until 1937, as did whalers. One of the Bell daughters, Bessie Dyke, recounted the family's experience there to writer [[Elsie K. Morton]], who published the story in 1957 as ''Crusoes of Sunday Island''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-MorCrus-t1-front1-d3.html|title=Crusoes of Sunday Island|chapter=Author's Note|first=Elsie|last=Morton|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raoul Island Station===
The Station consists of a government [[meteorology|meteorological]] and radio station, and a hostel for [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] officers and volunteers, that has been maintained since 1937.  It lies on the northern terraces of Raoul Island, at an elevation of about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}, above the cliffs of Fleetwood Bluff.  It is the northernmost inhabited outpost of New Zealand.

===Nuclear Testing Proposals===

In 1955 the British Government required a large site remote from population centres to test the new [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] devices it was developing. Various islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. The Admiralty suggested the [[Antipodes Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold &amp; Pyne 2001, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;. In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, Selwyn Lloyd, concluded that the Kermadec Islands would be suitable. They were part of New Zealand, so Eden wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, [[Sidney Holland]], to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in the upcoming 1957 general election in New Zealand. Despite reassurances and pressure from the British government, Holland remained firm.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Priestley: Mad on radium—New Zealand in the atomic age (Auckland University Press, Auckland, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The islands lie within 29° to 31.5° south latitude and 178° to 179° west longitude, {{convert|800|-|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of New Zealand's [[North Island]], and a similar distance southwest of [[Tonga]]. The centre of the Kermadec Islands group is located at approximately {{coord|29|16|37|S|177|55|24|W|display=inline,title}}.  The total area of the islands is {{convert|33.08|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}.

===Climate===
The climate of the islands is [[subtropical]], with a mean monthly temperature of {{convert|22.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in February and {{convert|16.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in August. Rainfall is approximately {{convert|1500|mm|in|abbr=on|-1}} annually, with lower rainfall from October through January.

===Islands===
[[File:Nugent Meyer Dayrell Islands.jpg|thumb|View from Raoul Island]]
The group includes four main islands (three of them might be considered island groups, because the respective main islands have smaller islands close by) and some isolated rocks, which are, from north to south:
* [[Raoul Island]] or Sunday Island is by far the largest of the islands. It is located at {{coord|29|16|0|S|177|55|10|W|type:isle|name=Raoul Island}}, {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-southwest of [['Ata]], the southernmost island of Tonga, and {{convert|1100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of New Zealand. Raoul Island has an area of {{convert|29.38|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}} with numerous smaller satellite islands; Moumoukai peak, is {{convert|516|m|ft|abbr=on}} high
* [[Macauley Island]], the second largest, is located at {{coord|30|14|S|178|26|W|type:isle|name=Macauley Island}}, {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-southwest of Raoul Island, Mount Haszard with an elevation of {{convert|238|m|ft|abbr=on}}, area {{convert|3.06|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with neighbouring island: Haszard Island.

===Geology===
[[File:Kermadec Arc.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Bathymetry of the Kermadec volcanic island arc and surrounding areas]]
[[File:Parma kermadecensis (Kermadec scalyfin).jpg|thumb|The [[Kermadec scalyfin]] – part of the rich marine biota of the Kermadecs]]
The islands are a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[island arc]], formed at the [[convergent boundary]] where the [[Pacific Plate]] subducts under the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. The subducting Pacific Plate created the [[Kermadec Trench]], an 8&amp;nbsp;km deep [[submarine trench]], to the east of the islands. The islands lie along the undersea Kermadec Ridge, which runs southwest from the islands towards the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]] and northeast towards [[Tonga]] ([[Kermadec-Tonga Arc]]).

The four main islands are the peaks of volcanoes that rise high enough from the seabed to project above sea level. There are several other volcanoes in the chain that do not reach sea level, but form [[seamount]]s with between 65 and 1500 m of water above their peaks. [[Monowai Seamount]], with a depth of 120 m over its peak, is midway between Raoul Island and Tonga. 100&amp;nbsp;km south of L'Esperance Rock is the little-explored [[Star of Bengal Bank]], probably with submarine volcanoes.

Further south are the [[South Kermadec Ridge Seamounts]], the southernmost of which, [[Rumble IV Seamount]], is just 150&amp;nbsp;km North of the North Island of New Zealand. The ridge eventually connects to [[Whakaari/White Island|White Island]] in New Zealand's [[Bay of Plenty]], at the northern end of the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]. The islands experience many earthquakes from plate movement and volcanism.

Raoul and Curtis are both active [[volcano]]es. The volcanoes on the other islands are currently inactive, and the smaller islands are the eroded remnants of extinct volcanoes.

From 18 to 21 July 2012, [[Havre Seamount]] (near Havre Rock) [[2012 Kermadec Islands eruption and pumice raft|erupted]], breaching the ocean surface from a depth of more than 1100 m and producing a [[pumice raft|large raft]] of [[pumice]] floating northwest of the volcano. The eruption was not directly observed, but it was located using earthquake and [[remote sensing]] data after the pumice raft was spotted by aircraft and encountered by [[HMNZS Canterbury (L421)|HMNZS ''Canterbury'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=78849 | date=14 August 2012 | accessdate=14 August 2012 |title=NASA Satellites Pinpoint Volcanic Eruption |work=NASA Earth Observatory |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==

===Flora===
The islands are recognised by ecologists as a distinct [[ecoregion]], the Kermadec Islands subtropical moist forests. They are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] ecoregion, part of the [[Oceania ecozone]]. The forests are dominated by the red-flowering [[Metrosideros kermadecensis|Kermadec pōhutukawa]], related to the [[Metrosideros excelsa|pōhutukawa]] of New Zealand.  The islands are home to 113 native species of [[vascular plant]]s, of which 23 are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]], along with mosses (52 native species), lichens and fungi (89 native species). Most of the plant species are derived from New Zealand, with others from the tropical Pacific.  152 non-native species of plants introduced by humans have become established on the islands.

Dense subtropical forests cover most of Raoul, and formerly covered Macauley. ''[[Metrosideros kermadecensis]]'' is the dominant forest tree, forming a 10 – 15-meter high canopy. A native [[nikau palm]] (''[[Rhopalostylis baueri]]'') is another important canopy tree. The forests had a rich understory of smaller trees, shrubs, ferns, and herbs, including ''[[Matipo|Myrsine kermadecensis]]''; ''[[Lobelia]] anceps'', ''[[Poa|Poa polyphylla]]'', ''[[Coprosma acutifolia]]'', and ''[[Coriaria arborea]]''. Two endemic [[tree fern]]s, ''[[Cyathea milnei]]'' and the rare and endangered ''[[Cyathea kermadecensis]]'', are also found in the forests.

Areas near the seashore and exposed to salt spray are covered by a distinct community of shrubs and ferns, notably ''[[Myoporum]] obscurum'', ''[[Coprosma]] petiolata'', ''[[Asplenium]] obtusatum'', ''[[Cyperus ustulatus]]'', ''[[Disphyma australe]]'', and ''[[Ficinia nodosa]]''.

===Fauna===
The islands have no native land mammals.  An endemic bird subspecies is the [[Kermadec red-crowned parakeet]].  The group has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds, including [[white-necked petrel|white-necked]] and [[black-winged petrel]]s, [[wedge-tailed shearwater|wedge-tailed]] and [[little shearwater]]s, [[sooty tern]]s and [[blue noddy|blue noddies]].&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Kermadec Islands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 3 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The area also hosts rich habitats for cetaceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svfalcongt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-Kermadec-Whale-Project1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311071336/http://www.svfalcongt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-Kermadec-Whale-Project1.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, increased presences of [[humpback whale]]s indicate Kermadec Islands functioning as migratory colliders, and varieties of baleen (not in great numbers) and toothed whales including [[minke whale]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/science/a-surprise-encounter-while-sailing-to-the-kermadecs/|title=A surprise encounter while sailing to the Kermadecs Islands  – The Listener|last=Noted|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sperm whale]]s, less known [[beaked whale]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and dolphins frequent in adjacent waters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/getmedia/5c7fa634-52dd-4a6d-88cc-cfc146ab4033/bulletin-vol20-kermadec-biodiscovery-expedition-23-duffyetal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/files/file/KermadecsSantuarybooklet_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Vast numbers of [[southern right whale]]s were historically seen in southwestern areas although only a handful of recent confirmations exist around [[Raoul Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthenviroleadersforum.org/young-blake-expeditions/kermadecs-expedition-2013/learn-about-the-kermadecs/the-kermadecs-science/whales-and-dolphins/|title=Sir Peter Blake Trust|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep sea [[hydrothermal vents]] along the Kermadec ridge support diverse [[extremophile]] communities including the [[Gandalfus puia| New Zealand blind vent crab]].&lt;ref&gt;McLay, Colin.

===Conservation===
The introduction of cats, [[rat]]s, and goats devastated the forests and seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Courchamp | first1 = F. | last2 = Chapuis | first2 = J.

Predation by rats and cats reduced the seabird colonies on the main islands from millions of birds to tens of thousands. The New Zealand government has been working for the last few decades to restore the islands. New Zealand declared the islands a [[nature reserve]] in 1937, and the sea around them a [[marine reserves of New Zealand|marine reserve]] in 1990. Goats were removed from Macauley in 1970 and from Raoul in 1984, and the forests have begun to recover. The islands are still known for their bird life, and seabird colonies presently inhabit offshore islets, which are safe from introduced rats and cats. Efforts are currently underway to remove the rats and cats from the islands, as well as some of the invasive exotic plants.

Visits to the islands are restricted by the Department of Conservation. The Department allows visits to Raoul by volunteers assisting in environmental restoration or monitoring projects, and other visitors engaged in nature study. Visits to the other islands are generally restricted to those engaged in scientific study of the islands.

On 29 September 2015, New Zealand prime minister [[John Key]] announced the creation of the [[Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary]], a {{convert|620000|km²|0|abbr=on}} [[protected area]] in the Kermadec Islands region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/72497269/john-key-announces-one-of-the-worlds-largest-ocean-sanctuaries|title=John Key announces one of the world's largest ocean sanctuaries|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Marine/MFE7910_A4_Brochure_LR.pdf|title=Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jurassic}}
In the [[geologic timescale]], the '''Kimmeridgian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[Late Jurassic|Late or Upper Jurassic]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between 157.3 ± 1.0 [[annum|Ma]] and 152.1 ± 0.9 Ma (million years ago). The Kimmeridgian follows the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] and precedes the [[Tithonian]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed version of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]' timescale, see Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definition==
The Kimmeridgian stage takes its name from the village of [[Kimmeridge]] on the [[Dorset]] coast, [[England]]. The name was introduced in literature by Swiss geologist [[Jules Thurmann]] in 1832.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}} The [[Kimmeridge Clay Formation]] has its name from the same [[type locality (geology)|type location]]. It is the source for about 95% of the [[petroleum]] in the [[North Sea]].{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}

Historically, the term Kimmeridgian has been used in two different ways. The base of the interval is the same but the top was defined by British [[stratigrapher]]s as the base of the [[Portlandian]] (''sensu anglico'') whereas in France the top was defined as the base of the Tithonian (''sensu gallico''). The differences have not yet been fully resolved; {{as of|2004}} Tithonian is the uppermost stage of the Jurassic in the timescale of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/people/bown/ISJS31.pdf INTERNATIONAL SUBCOMMISSION ON JURASSIC STRATIGRAPHY, Newsletter 31, Edited by Nicol Morton and Paul Bown, August 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the Kimmeridgian is at the first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''[[Pictonia|Pictonia baylei]]'' in the [[stratigraphic column]].&lt;ref name="GSSP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the International Commission on Stratigraphy|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/gssp/|website=GSSP Table - All Periods|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global reference profile for the base (the [[GSSP]] of the Kimmeridgian stage) had in 2009 not yet been assigned.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}} The top of the Kimmeridgian (the base of the Tithonian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species ''[[Hybonoticeras|Hybonoticeras hybonotum]]''. It also coincides with the top of [[magnetostratigraphy|magnetic anomaly]] M22An.&lt;ref name="GSSP" /&gt;

===Subdivision===
The Kimmeridgian is sometimes{{weasel inline|date=May 2016}} subdivided into Upper and Lower substages.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}} In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Kimmeridgian contains seven ammonite [[biozone]]s:{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}

| ''Camptosaurus'' could be more than {{convert|7.9|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long, and {{convert|2.0|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall at the hips. It had heavy bodies but, as well as walking on four legs (quadrupedal), they could rear up to walk on two legs (bipedal). This genus is probably closely related to the ancestor of the later iguanodontid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs. It probably ate cycads with its parrot-like beak.

| Averaging around {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall, the quadrupedal ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along its arched back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail.

A '''lava bench''' is a volcanic landform with a horizontal surface raised above the level of the surrounding area. They are created when molten [[lava]] travels away from a volcanic vent and expands an old shoreline.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2001/01_08_09.html|title=Lava bench is no boardwalk|last=Observatory|first=HVO, Hawaiian Volcano|website=hvo.wr.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process that creates new land in the ocean that life can eventually grow on. The [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian islands]] are an example of land that was formed this way, and the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] is currently still expanding due to lava benches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Kīlauea|Kilauea Volcano]] releases lava that flows down the slope of the volcano and eventually encounters the ocean; this lava flow hardens when it comes into contact with the significantly cooler water of the ocean and forms an unstable lava bench. Eventually, when the material beneath the lava bench stabilizes, it become stable land that has been added to the island.  If a newly formed lava bench rests on [[sediment]]s, it may pose hazards due to its extremely unstable structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/en/photoglossary.html?&amp;tx_tpkeywords_pi1%5Buid%5D=560&amp;cHash=d58b22aadc|title=Volcanology photoglossary: explanation of volcanologic terms|website=www.volcanodiscovery.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, these benches are so unstable that they collapse into the sea, exposing the water to the hot lava on the interior of the bench and releasing acres of land into the ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the hot lava hits the water, violent explosions of steam can shoot large rocks and molten lava up to {{Convert|300|ft||-1}} inland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These collapses are extremely dangerous because they can happen without warning, and anyone or anything on the bench will be caught in the collapse. For safety, people are advised not to walk on lava benches because of their unstable nature, and they must maintain a safe distance from the lava bench.&lt;ref&gt;Advertiser, Final.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37362">The following is not a complete list of natural gas and petroleum product accidents before 1900, which run into the thousands. The oil and gas industry was as yet unregulated, so leaks and explosions were not tracked in an organized fashion except by city fire departments. Many natural gas accidents were not recorded unless they occurred in population centers with newspapers to report them.&lt;ref&gt;Many nineteenth-century newspapers have been digitized and are searchable online. The U.S. Library of Congress provides access to 2,493 newspapers at https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/, accessed 2018.01.19. Some states have digitized their newspapers; see Colorado Historic Newspapers at https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org and Utah Digital Newspapers at https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/. Many libraries also provide access to the early ''New York Times'', ''Boston Globe'' and other nineteenth-century newspapers, or databases of historic newspapers such as ProQuest or Gale NewsVault.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA), a United States [[Department of Transportation]] agency, would be established to develop and enforce regulations for the safe and environmentally sound operation of the United States' pipelines, and to collect data on pipeline leaks, accidents, and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a second the air was aflame with a roar like artillery. “As soon as the gas took fire, the head of the jet of oil was in a furious blaze, and falling like water from a fountain over a space 100 feet in diameter; each drop came down a blazing globe of boiling oil. Instantly the ground was aflame.” The men and boys working on the site were set on fire; 15 died and 34 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;”Explosion of an Oil Well,” Plymouth Weekly Democrat (Plymouth, Ind.), 02 May 1861, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress, &lt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87056248/1861-05-02/ed-1/seq-1/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source says this occurred at [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]], Warren County, Pennsylvania, and the drill pipe was 5½ inches in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;”The Oil Well Explosion,” Deseret News (Salt Lake City, Utah), 1861-05-22, Utah Digital Newspapers, https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/, accessed 2018.01.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of men, women, and children were displaced from their homes, rushing away from the advancing fire with nothing but what they could carry and the clothes on their backs. The following day, fires broke out again due to gas explosions where pipes continued to leak because the gas company had not shut down the gas supply to what remained of the downtown. The fire burned into a third day before it was brought under control. Casualties included firefighters and soldiers burned fighting the fire and a woman injured when she jumped out of a second-story window to escape the flames.

* On December 22, 1875, the five-inch diameter gas main running under Federal Street and its bridge to South [[Boston]] exploded, tearing up the pavement for 175 feet. The street was thronged with people at the time and many were buried under the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a bright flash of light about midway across the causeway, followed by an explosion, with paving stones and gravel flying in all directions. Immediately thereafter the side of the causeway over the gas main collapsed into the river, carrying several people into the water. There were 16 known casualties and an unknown number of others missing; searchers were dragging the river for bodies.&lt;ref&gt;”Terrible Explosion – Bursting of a Boston Gas-Main,” National Republican (Washington D.C.), 23 Dec. 1875, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress, &lt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053573/1875-12-23/ed-1/seq-1/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 29, investigators determined that the natural gas explosion in South Boston was caused by a careless the gas company employee leaving a drip-cock of the gas main open, allowing gas to escape until something ignited it.&lt;ref&gt;”Cause of the Boston Gas Explosion,” Memphis Daily Appeal (Memphis, Tenn.), 30 Dec. 1875, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress, &lt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045160/1875-12-30/ed-1/seq-1/&gt; .&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 23, the death toll was estimated to be 5; one or two of the wounded has a doubtful prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;”Boston Gas Explosion,” Evening Star (Washington, D.C.), 23 Dec. 1875, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress, &lt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1875-12-23/ed-1/seq-1/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

* At [[Eastport, Maine]], on March 2, 1883, a gas leak exploded due to the efforts of the men working to repair it. Unable to dig through the frozen soil to reach the pipe, the workers built a fire on the ground over the supposed location of the leak and went to dinner, leaving the fire to thaw the earth. They had just departed when a terrific blast blew up the main and the street itself for 20 feet. Dirt was thrown more than 200 feet.&lt;ref&gt;"Terrific Gas Explosion," Milwaukee Sentinel [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], 3 Mar. 1883: 2, from Gale NewsVault: Nineteenth Century U.S. Newspapers, accessed 18 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

* An explosion of natural gas on March 20, 1886, at [[Murrysville, Pennsylvania]], injured seven people, three fatally, and burned seven houses. The Charter Gas Company was connecting a pipeline from a new gas well to their main line; the increased pressure ruptured the main and the escaping gas filled nearby houses before the leak could be fixed. The gas ignited from the grate in one house and quickly spread to the others.&lt;ref&gt;“Fatal and Disastrous Gas Explosion,” in "News by Telegraph," Daily Evening Bulletin [San Francisco, California], 20 Mar. 1886: 3, Gale NewsVault: Nineteenth Century U.S. Newspapers, accessed 19 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 6, 1887, a man was “burned to a crisp” as he slept when gas exploded at [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. Several others were reported missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9210">[[File:Albanian Rivers.png|thumb|200px|Map of drainage systems and drainage divide in Albania]]
Albania has more than 152 [[River|river]]s and streams, forming 8 large rivers flowing from southeast to northwest, mainly discharging towards the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]]. The rivers of Albania are characterized by a high [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=nces See all › 7 FiguresShare Download full-text PDF The quality of Albanian natural waters and the human impact|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8121855_The_quality_of_Albanian_natural_waters_and_the_human_impact|website=researchgate.net|page=137|language=English|quote=Albanian rivers are characterized by ahigh flow rate; the total annual mean flow is 1308 m3s1,which corresponds to an annual water volume of 41,250 km3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Agim SELENICA|title=WATER RESOURCES OF ALBANIA|url=http://medhycos.mpl.ird.fr/en/project/who/pres/alb-pre.htm|website=medhycos.mpl.ird.fr|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the precipitation that falls on Albania, drains into the [[river]]s and reaches the coast on the west without even leaving the country. In the north, only one small stream escapes Albania. In the south, an even smaller rivulet drains into [[Greece]]. Due to the topographical divide is east of the border with the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. An extensive portion of the basin of the [[White Drin]], basin is in the [[Dukagjin highlands|Dukagjin region]], across the northeastern border with [[Kosovo]]. The [[Ohrid Lake|Lake of Ohrid]], [[Prespa Lake|Lake of Prespa]] and the [[Small Prespa Lake|Small Lake of Prespa]] on the southeast, as well as the streams that flow into them, drain into the [[Black Drin]]. The watershed divide in the south also dips nearly {{convert|75|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} into Greece at one point. Several tributaries of the [[Vjosa River]] rise in that area. About 65% of their watershed lies within the Albanian territory. The water temperature ranges from 3.5 to 8.9° C in the winter, and from 17.8 to 24.6° C in the summer months.

The '''Loewe 3NF''' was an early attempt to combine several functions in one [[electronics|electronic]] device.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Produced by the German [[Loewe (electronics)|Loewe-Audion GmbH]] as early as 1926, the device consisted of three [[triode]] valves (tubes) in a single glass envelope together with two fixed capacitors and four fixed resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. The resistors and capacitors had to be sealed in their own glass tubes to prevent them from contaminating the vacuum. 

The only other parts required to build a [[radio]] receiver were the tuning coil, the tuning capacitor and the loudspeaker. The device was produced not to enter the [[integrated circuit]] era several decades early, but to evade German taxes levied on a per valveholder basis. As the Loewe set had only one valveholder, it was able to substantially undercut the competition. The resultant radio receiver required a 90 volt &lt;abbr title="high tension"&gt;HT&lt;/abbr&gt; plus a 4 volt &lt;abbr title="low tension"&gt;LT&lt;/abbr&gt; (A and B) [[battery (vacuum tube)|battery]] (the HT battery provided not only 82.5 volts for the HT, but also two grid bias supplies at −1.5 volts and −7.5 volts).

One major disadvantage of the 3NF was that if one filament failed, the whole device was rendered useless. Loewe countered this by offering a filament repair service.

Loewe were to also offer the 2NF (two [[tetrode]]s plus passive components) and the WG38 (two [[pentode]]s, a triode and the passive components).

'''''Lord of the Flies''''' is a 1954 novel by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]]–winning British author [[William Golding]]. The book focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an [[desert island|uninhabited island]] and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves.

The novel has been generally well received. It was named in the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]], reaching number 41 on the editor's list, and 25 on the reader's list. In 2003 it was listed at number 70 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll, and in 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named it as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.

== Background ==
Published in 1954, ''Lord of the Flies'' was Golding's first novel. Although it did not have great success after being released—selling fewer than three thousand copies in the United States during 1955 before going out of print—it soon went on to become a best-seller. It has been adapted to film twice in English, in 1963 by [[Peter Brook]] and 1990 by [[Harry Hook]], and once in Filipino by Lupita A. Concio (1975).

The book takes place in the midst of an unspecified war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ce1ar053wwC&amp;pg=PA90|title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies|series=Bloom's Guides|editor-first=Portia Williams|editor-last=Weiskel|publisher=Infobase |year=2010|isbn=9781438135397|chapter=Peter Edgerly Firchow Examines the Implausible Beginning and Ending of ''Lord of the Flies''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the marooned characters are ordinary students, while others arrive as a musical choir under an established leader. With the exception of Sam and Eric and the choirboys, they appear never to have encountered each other before. The book portrays their descent into savagery; left to themselves on a paradisiacal island, far from modern civilization, the well-educated children regress to a primitive state.

Golding wrote his book as a counterpoint to [[R.M. Ballantyne]]'s youth novel ''[[The Coral Island]]'' (1858),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kundu |first=Rama |title=New Perspectives on British Authors: From William Shakespeare to Graham Greene |year=2006 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=219|isbn=978-81-7625-690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included specific references to it, such as the rescuing naval officer's description of the children's initial attempts at civilised cooperation as "a jolly good show, like the Coral Island".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reiff |first=Raychel Haugrud |title=William Golding: Lord of the Flies |year=2010 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |page=93|isbn=978-0-7614-4700-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golding's three central characters—Ralph, Piggy and Jack—have been interpreted as caricatures of Ballantyne's ''Coral Island'' protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British [[aeroplane]] crashes on or near an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or [[preadolescence]]. Two boys—the fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy nicknamed "Piggy"—find a [[conch]], which Ralph uses as a horn to convene all the survivors to one area. Ralph is optimistic, believing that grown-ups will come to rescue them but Piggy realises the need to organise: ("put first things first and act proper"). Because Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together, he immediately commands some authority over the other boys and is quickly elected their "chief". He does not receive the votes of the members of a boys' choir, led by the red-headed Jack Merridew, although he allows the choir boys to form a separate clique of hunters. Ralph establishes three primary policies: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain a [[smoke signal]] that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island and thus rescue them. The boys establish a form of democracy by declaring that whoever holds the conch shall also be able to speak at their formal gatherings and receive the attentive silence of the larger group.

Jack organises his choir into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source. Ralph, Jack, and a quiet, dreamy boy named Simon soon form a loose [[triumvirate]] of leaders with Ralph as the ultimate authority. Upon inspection of the island, the three determine that it has fruit and [[Sus (genus)|wild pigs]] for food. The boys also use Piggy's glasses to create a fire. Although he is Ralph's only real confidant, Piggy is quickly made into an outcast by his fellow "biguns" (older boys) and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children while being hated by Jack. Simon, in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters, feels an instinctive need to protect the "littluns" (younger boys).

The semblance of order quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle; they give little aid in building shelters, spend their time having fun and begin to develop [[paranoia]]s about the island. The central paranoia refers to a supposed monster they call the "beast", which they all slowly begin to believe exists on the island. Ralph insists that no such beast exists, but Jack, who has started a power struggle with Ralph, gains a level of control over the group by boldly promising to kill the creature. At one point, Jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig, drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire. A ship travels by the island, but without the boys' smoke signal to alert the ship's crew, the vessel continues without stopping. Ralph angrily confronts Jack about his failure to maintain the signal; in frustration Jack assaults Piggy, breaking his glasses. The boys subsequently enjoy their first feast. Angered by the failure of the boys to attract potential rescuers, Ralph considers relinquishing his position as leader, but is persuaded not to do so by Piggy, who both understands Ralph's importance and deeply fears what will become of him should Jack take total control.

One night, an [[dogfight|aerial battle]] occurs near the island while the boys sleep, during which a [[fighter pilot]] ejects from his plane and dies in the descent. His body drifts down to the island in his parachute; both get tangled in a tree near the top of the mountain. Later on, while Jack continues to scheme against Ralph, the twins Sam and Eric, now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire, see the corpse of the fighter pilot and his parachute in the dark. Mistaking the corpse for the beast, they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected to warn the others. This unexpected meeting again raises tensions between Jack and Ralph. Shortly thereafter, Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island, where a mountain of stones, later called Castle Rock, forms a place where he claims the beast resides. Only Ralph and a quiet suspicious boy, Roger, Jack's closest supporter, agree to go; Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys but eventually all three see the parachutist, whose head rises via the wind. They then flee, now believing the beast is truly real. When they arrive at the shelters, Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph, asking them to remove Ralph from his position. Receiving no support, Jack storms off alone to form his own tribe. Roger immediately sneaks off to join Jack, and slowly an increasing number of older boys abandon Ralph to join Jack's tribe. Jack's tribe continues to lure recruits from the main group by promising feasts of cooked pig. The members begin to paint their faces and enact bizarre rites, including sacrifices to the beast. One night, Ralph and Piggy decide to go to one of Jack's feasts.

Simon, who faints frequently and is probably an [[epileptic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies|editor-first=James Rupert |editor-last=Baker |editor2-first=Arthur P. |editor2-last=Ziegler|publisher=Penguin|year=1983|page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenfield|first=Claire|title=Men of a Smaller Growth: A Psychological Analysis of William Golding's ''Lord of the Flies''|work=Contemporary Literary Criticism|location=Detroit, MI|volume=58|publisher=Gale Research|year=1990|pages=93–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a secret hideaway where he goes to be alone. One day while he is there, Jack and his followers erect an offering to the beast nearby: a pig's head, mounted on a sharpened stick and soon swarming with scavenging [[Flesh-fly|flies]]. Simon conducts an imaginary dialogue with the head, which he dubs the "[[Beelzebub|Lord of the Flies]]". The head mocks Simon's notion that the beast is a real entity, "something you could hunt and kill", and reveals the truth: they, the boys, are the beast; it is inside them all. The Lord of the Flies also warns Simon that he is in danger, because he represents the soul of man, and predicts that the others will kill him. Simon climbs the mountain alone and discovers that the "beast" is the dead parachutist.  He rushes down to tell the other boys, who are engaged in a ritual dance. The frenzied boys mistake Simon for the beast, attack him, and beat him to death. Both Ralph and Piggy participate in the melee, and they become deeply disturbed by their actions after returning from Castle Rock.

Jack and his rebel band decide that the real symbol of power on the island is not the conch, but Piggy's glasses—the only means the boys have of starting a fire. They raid Ralph's camp, confiscate the glasses, and return to their abode on Castle Rock. Ralph, now deserted by most of his supporters, journeys to Castle Rock to confront Jack and secure the glasses. Taking the conch and accompanied only by Piggy, Sam, and Eric, Ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object. Confirming their total rejection of Ralph's authority, the tribe capture and bind the twins under Jack's command. Ralph and Jack engage in a fight which neither wins before Piggy tries once more to address the tribe. Any sense of order or safety is permanently eroded when Roger, now sadistic, deliberately drops a boulder from his vantage point above, killing Piggy and shattering the conch. Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are tortured by Roger until they agree to join Jack's tribe.

Ralph secretly confronts Sam and Eric, who warn him that Jack and Roger hate him and that Roger has sharpened a stick at both ends, implying the tribe intends to hunt him like a pig and behead him. The following morning, Jack orders his tribe to begin a hunt for Ralph. Jack's savages set fire to the forest while Ralph desperately weighs his options for survival. Following a long chase, most of the island is consumed in flames. With the hunters closely behind him, Ralph trips and falls. He looks up at a uniformed adult—a British naval officer whose party has landed from a passing cruiser to investigate the fire. Ralph bursts into tears over the death of Piggy and the "end of innocence". Jack and the other children, filthy and unkempt, also revert to their true ages and erupt into sobs. The officer expresses his disappointment at seeing British boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behaviour before turning to stare awkwardly at his own warship.

== Themes ==
At an [[allegory|allegorical]] level, the central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward [[civilisation]] and social organisation—living by rules, peacefully and in harmony—and toward the [[will to power]]. Themes include the tension between [[groupthink]] and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. How these play out, and how different people feel the influences of these form a major subtext of ''Lord of the Flies''.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  The name "Lord of the Flies" is a literal translation of [[Beelzebub]], from {{Bibleref2|2Kings|1:2–3,6,16|NIV|2 Kings 1:2–3, 6, 16}}.

== Reception ==
In February 1960, [[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' rated ''Lord of the Flies'' five stars out of five, stating that "Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society ... Well on its way to becoming a modern classic".&lt;ref name="gale196002"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Floyd C. |date=February 1960 |title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf |url=https://archive.org/stream/GalaxyV18n03196002AkFhd/Galaxy%20v18n03%20%281960-02%29%20ak%20fhd#page/n163/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=164–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
There have been three film adaptations based on the book:

* ''[[Lord of the Flies (1963 film)|Lord of the Flies]]'' (1963), directed by [[Peter Brook]]

&lt;!--Please try to limit this section to works that are substantially inspired by Lord of the Flies, rather than referring to it in passing.--&gt;
Many writers have borrowed plot elements from ''Lord of the Flies''. By the early 1960s, it was required reading in many schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/teaching-the-lord-of-the-flies-with-the-new-york-times/|title=Teaching 'The Lord of the Flies' With The New York Times|first1=Holly Epstein|last1=Ojalvo|first2=Shannon|last2=Doyne|date=5 August 2010|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108093017/https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/teaching-the-lord-of-the-flies-with-the-new-york-times/|archivedate=8 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">In [[climatology]], the term '''mesothermal''' is used to refer to certain forms of [[climate]] found typically in the [[Earth]]'s [[Temperate|Temperate Zones]].  It has a moderate amount of heat, with winters not cold enough to sustain snow cover.  Summers are warm within oceanic climate regimes, and hot within continental climate regimes. 

==Origin of term==
The term is derived from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words meaning "having a moderate amount of heat."  This can be misinterpreted, however, since the term is actually intended to describe only the [[temperature]] conditions that prevail during the winter months, rather than those for the year as a whole.

==Definition==
Under the broadest definition, all places with an average temperature in their coldest month that is colder than 18°C, but warmer than &amp;minus;3°C, are said to have a mesothermal climate.  In some climate classification schemes, however, this is divided into two segments, with a coldest-month average of 6°C being the line of demarcation between them; then only those locations with a coldest-month temperature of between &amp;minus;3°C and 6°C are reckoned as mesothermal, the label "'''[[subtropical climate|subtropical]]'''" being applied to areas where the average temperature in the coldest month ranges from 6°C to 18°C.

Observing the narrower definition articulated above, the mesothermal locations are those where the winters are too cold to allow year-round [[photosynthesis]], but not cold enough to support a fixed period of continuous [[snow]] cover every year.

==Range==
In the USA, the northern boundary line between mesothermal and microthermal ranges is north of [[Juneau]] and [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] at the Pacific Ocean. It goes sharply south to about 38N latitude in the Rockies, then eastward across the lower Midwest to the East Coast near Boston. The southern boundary line between mesothermal and  megathermal (or tropical) is across south Florida just above Palm Beach.

==Summer==
Summers in these places may be hot (that is to say, having an average temperature in their warmest month of 22°C or above) or merely warm (with the warmest month averaging between 10°C and 22°C).  The hot-summer, or continental, mesothermal climate is encountered exclusively in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the landmass interiors of [[Asia]] and [[North America]] and along their east coasts, while the most frequently seen example of a warm to cool-summer mesothermal climate is the [[oceanic climate]]s found along the west coasts of all of the world's continents, roughly equidistant between the geographical [[tropical]] and [[Polar region|polar zones]].

List of mesothermal cities and their summer temperatures: &lt;br&gt;
[[Hong Kong]]-hot summer &lt;br&gt;
[[Milan]]-hot summer &lt;br&gt;
[[New York City]]-hot summer &lt;br&gt;
[[Tokyo]]-hot summer &lt;br&gt;
[[London]]-warm summer &lt;br&gt;
[[Mexico City]]-warm summer &lt;br&gt;
[[Vancouver]]-warm summer

==Moisture== 
In addition to being subdivisible by summer temperature, mesothermal climates can also be subclassified on the basis of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] &amp;mdash; into [[humid]], [[semiarid]] and [[arid]] subtypes within your front door within depth

'''Monte Cavo''', or less occasionally, "Monte Albano," is the second highest mountain of the complex of the [[Alban Hills]], near [[Rome]], [[Italy]].  An old volcano extinguished around 10,000 years ago, it lies about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the sea, in the  territory of the ''comune'' of  [[Rocca di Papa]]. It is the dominant peak of the Alban Hills. The current name comes from ''Cabum'', an [[Italic tribes|Italic]] settlement existing on this mountain.

Volcanic activity under king [[Tullus Hostilius]] on the site was  reported by [[Livy]] in his book of Roman history:&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Albanus Mons |volume=1 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...there had been a shower of stones on the Alban Mount...".

==Jupiter Latiaris==
Monte Cavo is the sacred ''Mons Albanus''&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; of the [[Italic people]] of ancient Italy who lived in [[Alba Longa]] (the [[Albani (people)|Albani]]), and other cities, and therefore a [[sacred mountain]] to the Romans; there they built the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] (Jupiter) Latiaris, one of the most important destinations of pilgrimage for all Latin people in the centuries of Roman domination.
 
On the ''Mons Albanus'', between January and March, the "Latin Festivals" were held. The newly chosen Consuls had to sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris and to announce the Latin Holidays. When the Consul obtained a victory in war he also had to celebrate the triumph on the Alban Mount. Here in the Latium temple were celebrated every year the ''[[Feriae Latinae]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 531 BC, King [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]] built here a temple shared with the Latins, the [[Hernici]] and the [[Volsci]], where every year celebrations in honor of Jupiter Latiaris were held. In return, Jupiter Latiaris conferred upon whoever was elected head of the Latin confederation, the power of ''dictator latinus''.    
A triumphal procession along this sacred way left the Appian Way at [[Ariccia]] and climbed up 450 m to the hillside. More than 5&amp;nbsp;km of this way is well preserved through the woods.

==Pagan temple, hermitage, hotel, station==
[[File:Hotel Monte Cavo 1907 img122.jpg|thumb|250px|Hotel Monte Cavo at the beginning of the 20th century.]] 
[[File:The structure on the top of Monte Cavo 100.jpg|thumb|250px|The same structure used as a telecommunications station at the end of the 20th century.]]
The history of the Pagan temple of ''Iuppiter Latiaris'' was interrupted in the [[Early Middle Ages]], when a hermitage devoted to [[Saint Peter]] which replaced the pagan temple was built by a Dalmatian hermit. It  was visited by [[Pope Pius II]] in 1463, and subsequently by [[Pope Alexander VII]]. After the Dalmatian hermits the Polish religious order of Edmondo of Buisson was established there, then the Trinitarian Spaniards, and finally the Flemish Missionaries.

Then the hermitage was converted to a monastery (1727). The [[Passionist]]s came in 1758 and restored it in 1783, using the materials of the temple of Jupiter, as found and raised by  [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry Benedict Stuart, Duke of York]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[bishop of Frascati]].

During this period there were guests in the monastery: the king [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]] of Naples in 1865 and [[Pope Pius IX]] in  1867. The "contemplative-missionaries" abandoned the monastery in 1889.

In 1890 the structure was converted to an hotel that entertained national and international personalities, among others: [[Umberto II of Italy]], [[Massimo d'Azeglio]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Armando Diaz]] (who sojourned in [[Rocca di Papa]] and was remembered with a commemorative headstone mail in the residence on De Rossi palace) and the King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] with his wife [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]].

From 1942 the hotel was used as military base for radio communications by the German [[Wehrmacht]]. On June 3, 1944, soldiers of 142nd Regiment-[[36th Infantry Division (United States)]] ("Texas" Division), attacked and captured the military site&lt;ref&gt;''National Archives and Records Administrations'' of College Park, MD, USA (signature:Record Group 407, Entry 427, File 334-INF(142)-0.3)&lt;/ref&gt;—with 20 enemy soldiers killed and 30 prisoners taken.

In the post-war era the structure became a telecommunications station. Access is prohibited to unauthorized persons. A few blocks of the ancient temple are still visible behind the fenced area. The unsightly presence of the antennae has been a cause of some civil complaint. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The '''National Museum (NM)''' ({{lang-cs|Národní muzeum}}) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[museum]] institution intended to systematically establish, prepare and publicly exhibit natural scientific and historical collections. It was founded in 1818 by [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg|Kašpar Maria Šternberg]]. Historian [[František Palacký]] was also strongly involved.

At present the National Museum houses almost 14 million items from the area of natural history, history, arts, music and librarianship, located in dozens of buildings.

== Origins ==
The founding of the National Museum should be seen in the context of the times, where after the French Revolution, royal and private collections of art, science, and culture were being made available to the public. The beginnings of the museum can be seen as far back as 1796, when the private Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts was founded by Count Casper Sternberk-Manderschied and a group of other prominent nobles. The avowed purpose of the society was "the renewed promotion of art and taste", and during the time of Joseph II, it would be adamantly opposed to the King. In 1800 the group founded the Academy of Fine Arts, which would train students in progressive forms of art and history.

== The National Museum in Prague ==
[[Image:Wenceslas Square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Night shot of the old facade of the museum, taken from the centre of [[Wenceslas Square]].]]The National Museum in Prague was founded on April 15, 1818, with the first president of the Society of the Patriotic Museum being named Count Sternberk, who would serve as the trustee and operator of the museum. Early on, the focus of the museum was on natural sciences, partially because Count Sternberk was a botanist, mineralogist, and eminent phytopaleontologist, but also because of the natural science slant of the times, as perpetrated by Emperor Joseph II of Austria.

The museum was originally located in the Sternberg Palace but it was soon apparent that this was too small to hold the museum's collections. The museum relocated to the Nostitz Palace but this was also found to be of insufficient capacity, which led to the decision to construct a new building for the museum in Wenceslas Square.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prague.cz/national-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum did not become interested in the acquisition of historical objects until the 1830s and 40s, when Romanticism became prevalent, and the institution of the museum was increasingly seen as a center for Czech nationalism. Serving as historian and secretary of the National Museum in 1841, Frantisek Palacky would try to balance natural science and history, as he described in his Treatise of 1841. It was a difficult task, however, and it would not be until nearly a century later until the National Museum’s historical treasures equaled its collection of natural science artifacts.

However, the importance of the museum was not in its focus, but rather that it signaled, and indeed helped bring about, an intellectual shift in Prague. The Bohemian nobility had, until this time, been prominent, indeed dominant, both politically and fiscally in scholarly and scientific groups. However, the National Museum was created to serve all the inhabitants of the land, lifting the stranglehold the nobility had had on knowledge. This was further accelerated by the historian Frantisek Palacky, who in 1827 suggested that the museum publish separate journals in German and Czech. Previously, the vast majority of scholarly journals were written in German, but within a few years the German journal had ceased publication, while the Czech journal continued for more than a century.

In 1949, the national government took over the museum, and spelled out its role and leadership in the Museum and Galleries Act of 1959. In May 1964, the Museum was turned into an organization of five professionally autonomous components: the Museum of Natural Science, the Historical Museum, the [[Naprstek Museum]] of Asia, African, and American Cultures, the National Museum Library, the Central Office of Museology. A sixth autonomous unit, the Museum of Czech Music, was established in 1976.

==Collections and Departments==
According to their website, the National Museum at present contains several million items of material in three main parts, the natural Museum, the Historical Museum and the Library.

=== The Natural Museum ===
in 2010 moved their collections to Prague 10, Horní Počernice. It has the departments of [[mineralogy]], [[paleontology]], [[mycology]], [[botany]], [[entomology]], [[zoology]] and [[anthropology]], as well as scientific laboratories.

=== The Historical Museum has six departments including Archives===

*'''The Department of Prehistory and Protohistory''' – Contains an extremely rich collection of artifacts which were used daily thousands of years ago. The curators of this collection were also among the first Czech archeologists: J.L. Píč, curator of one of the collection from 1893-1911 is credited with conducting the first system archeological field exploration in Czechoslovakia. The department also maintains collections in the field of classical archeology, however its main value is in the documentation of Greek and Roman arts and crafts. Among its most valuable objects are a painted dish of Nikosthenes, a glass bottle from the port of Puteolo, and a gilded silver rhyton.[[archeology]] which is mostly concerned with the period from Neolithic times to the 10th century CE. '''The Collection of Classical Archeology''' belongs to the same department.
*'''The Department of the Old Czech History''' has assembled numerous objects which trace the development of Czech state beginning from the Slavonic culture of 10th century up to the independent republic Czechoslovakia in 1918. This is done through the acquisition of objects which recall outstanding figures of Czech culture and leadership. Collection of [[Archeology]] concerns many objects from archaeological excavation of the land (ceramics, metals, stone), artifacts of painting, sculpture and decorative arts beginning from the Roman period through Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque style up to the Romanticism of 19th century.

Important parts of the Medieval collection is jewelry, panel painting, wooden sculpture, and weapons (also such as used in the Hussite movement of the 15th century). In addition to their historical value, many of the objects held by this department contain a high artistic value. Examples of precious objects include: a silver tiara of a duke from the twelfth century; Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque jewelry; liturgical objects from the Medieval period, which include several chalices, the reliquary of St Eligius in the shape of mitre; Gothic and Renaissance glazed tiles and paving stones; precious embroidery of Rosenberg antependium dated about 1370. Fine Bohemian porcelain and glass collection represent before all the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as collection of painted portraits and miniature painting.

*'''The Department of Ethnography''' – The stated aim of this department is to gather, in a systemic manner, factual material and data about the history and culture of the people of Czechoslovakia and the other nations of Europe, from the end of the 17th century to the present day. It should be noted, however, that much of the focus is placed on Slavic nations. The oldest ethnographic collections of the National Museum were inherited from the [[General Land Centennial Exhibition (1891)|Jubilee Exhibition of 1891]], with the result being that much of the focus has shifted to the past half-century, and the collections of the department are filled with simple wood and ceramic objects, which show the gradual shift from a rural society to one that has become increasingly urbanized.
*'''Department of Numismatics''' – Among the oldest departments in the Museum, it was founded through the gift of Count Sternberk. The goal of this department is to achieve a complete collection of legal tender coins used in past and present day Czechoslovakia. In addition, the department has a large number of foreign coin collections, the most valuable of these being a collection of coins of classical antiquity. Along with collecting coins, the department also maintains a large collection of medals. At present day, the National Museum contains approximately half-a million objects.
*'''Archives of the National Museum'''
It contains the most rare charts and manuscripts of the Czech history from the 11th to the 20th century, the ancient ones have been digitalised. The collection of personal legacy contains written sources of famous personalities of Czech history. Large collection of seals and sealsticks include about 3000 pieces.

*'''Department of Theater''' – Originally part of the National Museum Library, it was set up as a separate entity in 1930. Its first collections were primarily drawn from the archives of two theaters: the National Theater and the theater Vinohardy. In the following years, the collections were greatly expanded by the department's founder, Jan Bartos, and his successor, Joseph Knap. The department today contains extensive exhibits on the history of theater in Czechoslovakia, costume designs by prominent Czech artists, music, memorabilia, and items from the Czech puppet theater. The collections primarily contain stagecraft items from the middle of the 19th century to the present day, with efforts being made to enlarge the department’s exhibits from the 18th century.

== Main building ==
[[Image:Narodni muzeum interior.jpg|thumb|right|Main hall of the Czech National Museum]]
The main museum building is located on the upper end of [[Wenceslas Square]] and was built by prominent Czech [[Neo-Renaissance|neo-renaissance]] architect [[Josef Schulz]] from 1885 - 1891. Prior to the museum being constructed, there had been several noblemen’s palaces located at this site. With the construction of a permanent building for the museum, a great deal of work which had previously been devoted to ensuring that the collections would remain intact was now put toward collecting new materials.

The building was damaged during [[World War II]] in 1945 by a bomb, but the collections were not damaged due to their removal to other secured storage sites. The museum was reopened after intensive repairs in 1947, and in 1960 exterior night floodlighting was installed, which followed a general repair of the facade that had taken place in previous years.

During the [[Prague Spring#Occupation|1968 Warsaw Pact intervention]] the main facade was severely damaged by strong Soviet machine-gun and automatic submachine-gun fire. The shots made numerous holes in sandstone pillars and plaster, destroyed stone statues and reliefs and also caused damage in some of the depositaries. Despite the general facade repair made between 1970 - 1972 the damage still can be seen because the builders used lighter sandstone to repair the bullet holes.

The main Museum building was also damaged during the construction of the [[Prague Metro]] in 1972 and 1978. The opening of the [[North-South Highway (Prague)|North-South Highway]] in 1978 on two sides of the building resulted in the museum being cut off from city infrastructure. This also led to the building suffering from an excessive noise level, a dangerously high level of dust and constant vibrations from heavy road traffic.

== Reconstruction ==
Due to major renovations the museum is closed since 7 July 2011 and the re-opening is planned for October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nm.cz/Reconstruction/&lt;/ref&gt; Some seven million items had to be removed to the museum’s depositories in what has been dubbed the biggest moving of museum collections in Czech history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/landmark-national-museum-building-closes-for-five-year-long-reconstruction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest study of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] "The Future of Geothermal Energy – Impact of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) on the United States in the 21st Century" (2006) points out the essential importance of developing an economical deep geothermal boring technology. With current boring technologies, bore price rises exponentially with depth. Thus, finding a boring technology with which the bore price rise would be approximately linear with increasing bore depth is an important challenge.

==New drilling technologies requirements==

This MIT study characterizes the requirements on new fast and ultra-deep boring technology as follows:

*the price of boring rises linearly with depth
*bore axis with neutral floating
*the possibility to make vertical or inclined bores up to 10&amp;nbsp;km deep
*the possibility to make large diameter bores – even 5 times larger than on the ground compared to today drilling technologies
*casing formed on site in the borehole

==Examples of new drilling technologies==

There are more than 20 research efforts solving innovative drilling technology such as: laser, spallation, plasma, electron beam, pallets, enhanced rotary, electric spark and discharge, electric arc, water jet erosion, ultrasonic, chemical, induction, nuclear, forced flame explosive, turbine, high frequency, microwave, heating/cooling stress, electric current and several other. The most promising solutions are mentioned below:

1.	[[Spallation|Hydrothermal spallation]] – Thermal spallation drilling uses a large, downhole burner, much like a jet engine, to apply a high heat flux to the rock face. This drilling technology is based on thermal processes of rock spallation and fusion. 

2.	[[Plasma (physics)|Chemical plasma]] – is based on crushing by high-speed combustion, but nitric acid as oxidizing agent instead of oxygen.

3.	[[Erosion]] - most patents refer to water jet rock cutting. Different modification variants are described, e.g. utilization of cavitation, turbulent processes, combination with mechanical processes, etc.

4.	[[Laser]] - during the recent decade intense research has been made into utilization of high energy laser beams for rock disintegration. Primarily conversion of military equipment is concerned. Laser energy is used for the process of thermal spallation, melting, or evaporation of rock. 

5.	[[Electric discharge]] - The methods utilizing electric discharge are based on long-term experience gained in other application areas.  

6.	[[Plasma deep drilling technology|Electrical plasma]] - is based on crushing by irradiation of plasma with high temperature up to 20 000°C

7.      [[Direct transfer of heat]] - This technology is based on electrically melting rock at 1400°C; lava gravel will float to top; bore hole walls are of glass of surrounding rock.  Cost decreases with depth, with no limit on depth of bore hole.  Bore diameters from 1m to 10m.  Recovery of energy used to melt rock.

==High-energetic electrical plasma==
[[Image:Plasmatorch using water steam as plasma-creation gas.jpg|thumb|Plasmatorch using water steam as plasma-creation gas]]
One of the most promising approaches in deep drilling field is utilization of [[Plasma deep drilling technology|electrical plasma]]. It has lower energy efficiency than some of the other technologies, but it has several other advantages. Producing boreholes with wide range of diameters or drilling in water environment can be mentioned. The research team from Slovakia has developed drilling concept based on utilization of electrical plasma. The core of the research is held in [[Research Centre for Deep Drilling]] which was opened in the premises of [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]]. Only a very small number of companies have embraced this method, e.g. [[Geothermal Anywhere|GA Drilling]], headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia.
=== Advantages of Plasma deep drilling technology ===

# Higher drilling energy efficiency
# Continuous drilling process without replacement of mechanical parts
# Constant casing diameter
# Effective transport of disintegrated rock

==State of the art==

No one as of yet has proved the effective use of these techniques in severe conditions. Other complications including on site energy and material transport from 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;km bores also require refinement to become both technically and economically feasible.

'''Nudo de los Pastos''', in English meaning "Knot of the Pastos" or also known as the "Massif of [[Huaca]]",  is an [[Andes|Andean]] [[orographic]] complex located in the Ecuadorian province of [[Carchi]] and the Colombian department of [[Nariño]].&lt;ref name="kline"&gt;Kline, Harvey. ''Historical Dictionary of Colombia''. Scarecrow Press, 2012. 150-151. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the intricate mountain region where the Andes splits into two branches on entering Colombia: the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Central.

Although there is no precise definition of the region of ''Nudos de los Pastos'', it is generally considered to begin north of the rivers Chota and Apaqui and east of the rivers Cuasmal and Bishop and extends to the [[Sickle of Minamá]] in the Cordillera Occidental and to the Colombian Massif in the Cordillera Central, where this gives rise to the Cordillera Oriental.

In the Cordillera Occidental the taller heights are the volcanoes Chile (4,718 m), [[Cumbal]] (4,764 m) and Azufral (4,070 m).&lt;ref name="kline" /&gt; The Minamá Sickle is a deep depression created when the Patia River crosses the Cordillera Occidental on its way to the Pacific coast [[Nariño]].

In the Cordillera Central there are the highlands Túquerres and Ipiales, Atriz Valley, volcanoes Galeras (4276 m) and Doña Juana (4,250 m), and the town of San Juan de Pasto and Cocha lagoon.

{{about|Nutrients|Nutrition in humans|Human nutrition|Nutrition in animals|Animal nutrition|Nutrition in plants|Plant nutrition}}
A '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Audrey H.

Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005&gt;Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. ''Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition'', p. 6.

==Plant nutrition==
{{main|Plant nutrition|Fertilizer}}
Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air. These three, in the form of water and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Jones1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Benton Jones|title=Plant nutrition manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNP2exwYMJIC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 October 2010|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-884015-31-1|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants:&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen V. Barker|author2=D. J. Pilbeam|title=Handbook of plant nutrition|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ZWjLBQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|accessdate=17 August 2010|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5904-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and the micronutrients iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental '''macronutrients''' for all [[biological life|organisms]].&lt;ref name=wsj20101203&gt;
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode New Link in Chain of Life], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."&lt;/ref&gt;
They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[diatomic molecule]]s of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s).

==Types of nutrients==
{{main|Nutrition}}

===Macronutrients===
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.&lt;ref name="Kern2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], summarized as [[CHNOPS]].
* The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[fat]]s. Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Macronutrients provide energy:

* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Micronutrients===
Micronutrients support metabolism.

* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.

== Essentiality ==

=== Essential nutrients ===
An '''essential nutrient''' is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body&amp;nbsp;– either at all or in sufficient quantities&amp;nbsp;– and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/nutrition/lect1/2_1.html | title = What is an essential nutrient? | publisher = NetBiochem Nutrition, [[University of Utah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson |author4=Elisabeth Dowle |author5=Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[water]], which is universally required for the maintenance of [[homeostasis]] in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jéquier|first1=E|last2=Constant|first2=F|title=Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2 September 2009|volume=64|issue=2|pages=115–123|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.111|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n2/pdf/ejcn2009111a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [[metabolic process]]es and maintaining tissue and organ function.&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chipponi|first1=JX|last2=Bleier|first2=JC|last3=Santi|first3=MT|last4=Rudman|first4=D|title=Deficiencies of essential and conditionally essential nutrients.|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1982|volume=35|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1112–1116|pmid=6805293|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/5/1112.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of humans, there are nine [[amino acid]]s, two [[fatty acid]]s, thirteen [[vitamin]]s and fifteen [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] that are considered essential nutrients.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt; In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Jane|title=Neonatal Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=299–311|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511544712.020|chapter=Conditionally essential nutrients: choline, inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendler|first1=BS|title=Supplemental conditionally essential nutrients in cardiovascular disease therapy|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–16|pmid=16407731|doi=10.1097/00005082-200601000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amino acids====
{{Main|Essential amino acid}}
An essential amino acid is an [[amino acid]] that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [[endogenous]]ly synthesized by humans: [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J.

====Fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [[fatty acid]]s that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [[Biosynthesis|synthesize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 6th | year = 1980 |author1=Robert S. Goodhart |author2=Maurice E. Shils | publisher = Lea and Febinger | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-8121-0645-8 | pages = 134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [[amino acid]]s or [[fatty acid]]s. They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145–1155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].

===Conditionally essential nutrients===
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt; [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

=== Non-essential nutrients ===
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.{{mcn|date=January 2018}} For example, [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [[bowel movement]] to avoid [[constipation]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} A subset of dietary fiber, [[soluble fiber]], can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion" /&gt; Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] function{{snd}}promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s like [[butyric acid]], which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vital M, Howe AC, Tiedje JM | title = Revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00889 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24757212 | pmc = 3994512 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00889-14 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–482 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S-420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-nutrients===
[[Ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}}, which at 40%{{nbsp}}ethanol (80{{nbsp}}proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%{{nbsp}}alcohol, 17.5{{nbsp}}grams and 122.5{{nbsp}}calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of {{convert|5|USfloz|ml}} and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}}, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8{{nbsp}}grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By definition, [[phytochemical]]s include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.&lt;ref name="lpi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phytochemicals|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included as nutritional constituents are [[provitamin]] A [[carotenoid]]s,&lt;ref name="lpi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carotenoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[resveratrol]], and [[lignan]]s &amp;ndash; often claimed to have [[antioxidant]] effects &amp;ndash; that are present in numerous plant foods.&lt;ref name="lpi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flavonoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health.&lt;ref name="lpi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi3/&gt; However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is that they must first be defined with a [[Dietary Reference Intake]] level to enable accurate food labeling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims--general principles; 21CFR101.13|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.13|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
''See [[Vitamin]], [[Mineral (nutrient)]], [[Protein (nutrient)]]''

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nutrient Toxicity|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=39|issue=6|pages=249–256|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb07453.x|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat different from that used by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of a "basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dietary Reference Intakes.

In setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity.&lt;ref name=DRITable&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/5Summary%20TableTables%2014.pdf?la=en Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)] Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanDRI&gt;[http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/info/pdf/dris2010en.pdf Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010)] National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for [[vitamin C]], recommended intakes range from 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day in India&lt;ref name="NIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icmr.nic.in/final/rda-2010.pdf |title=Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians: A Report of the Expert Group of the Indian Council of Medical Research. pp.283-295 (2009) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615094048/http://icmr.nic.in/final/RDA-2010.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 155&amp;nbsp;mg/day for the European Union.&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2017 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data date to 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

*For niacin and magnesium there appears to be a contradiction inherent in the information in the table, as the amounts recommended for daily consumption can be more than the amounts identified as the safe upper limits. For both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium above the UL may cause diarrhea. Niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below when symptoms may occur, so the ULs can differ.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

'''EAR''' U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.

'''RDA''' U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating.

'''AI'''  U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs established when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

'''PRI''' Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin the PRIs are expressed as amounts per MJ of calories consumed. MJ = megajoule = 239 food calories.

'''Upper Limit'''  Tolerable upper intake levels.

'''ND'''  ULs have not been determined.

'''NE'''  EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).

The '''Optical Ground Station''' ('''OGS''') '''telescope''' (or '''ESA Space Debris Telescope'''), installed in the [[Teide Observatory]], has been built by [[Carl Zeiss]]. The telescope is ESA's [[Optical Ground Station]] forming a part of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] experiment and is operated by the IAC ([[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]]) and Ataman Science S.L.U.

The telescope is a 1 m [[Ritchey-Chretien]] / Coudé telescope with field of view of 0.7 degrees, supported by an English-built mount inside a dome 12.5 metre in diameter. Its main purposes are: 
# to be the optical ground station of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis telecommunications satellite]] (the project from which the telescope takes its name)
# to make surveys of [[space debris]] in different orbits around the Earth, 
# to test observing strategies of [[near-Earth object]]s as part of ESA's [[Space Situational Awareness programme]], and
# to make scientific astronomical night observations.

It is equipped with a cryogenically cooled mosaic CCD-Camera of 4k*4k pixels. The detection threshold is between 19th and 21st [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]], which corresponds to a capability to detect [[space debris]] objects as small as 10&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[geostationary ring]]. As a large part of the observation time is dedicated to space debris surveys, in particular the observation of [[space debris]] in the [[geostationary ring]] and in [[geostationary transfer orbit]]s, the term ESA Space Debris Telescope became used very frequently. Space debris surveys are carried out every month, centered on New Moon.

Since 2006, the telescope has also been used as a receiver station for quantum communication experiments (such as [[Bell test experiments| testing Bell inequalities]], [[quantum cryptography]], [[quantum teleportation]]), with the sender station being 143&amp;nbsp;km away in the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|observatory on La&amp;nbsp;Palma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLWO7YJ6H_index_0.html |title=ESA observatory breaks world quantum teleportation record |work=ESA press release |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because this telescope can be tilted to a near-horizontal position to point it at La&amp;nbsp;Palma, which many large astronomical telescopes are unable to do.

[[File:Changes in aragonite saturation of the world's oceans, 1880-2012 (US EPA).png|thumb|The map was created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution using Community Earth System Model data. This map was created by comparing average conditions during the 1880s with average conditions during the most recent 10&amp;nbsp;years (2003–2012). Aragonite saturation has only been measured at selected locations during the last few decades, but it can be calculated reliably for different times and locations based on the relationships scientists have observed among aragonite saturation, pH, dissolved carbon, water temperature, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and other factors that can be measured. This map shows changes in the amount of aragonite dissolved in ocean surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade (2003–2012). Aragonite saturation is a ratio that compares the amount of aragonite that is actually present with the total amount of aragonite that the water could hold if it were completely saturated. The more negative the change in aragonite saturation, the larger the decrease in aragonite available in the water, and the harder it is for marine creatures to produce their skeletons and shells. The global map shows changes over time in the amount of aragonite dissolved in ocean water, which is called aragonite saturation.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}]]

The carbon cycle involves both [[organic compound]]s such as [[cellulose]] and inorganic carbon compounds such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbonate|carbonate ion]], and [[Bicarbonate|bicarbonate ion]]. The inorganic compounds are particularly relevant when discussing ocean acidification for they include many forms of dissolved {{chem|CO|2}} present in the Earth's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Kump | first1=Lee R. | first2=James F. | last2=Kasting | first3=Robert G. | last3=Crane |authorlink2=James Kasting | title=The Earth System | edition=2nd | pages=162–164 | publisher=Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall | year=2003| isbn=0-613-91814-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When {{chem|CO|2}} dissolves, it reacts with water to form a balance of ionic and non-ionic chemical species: dissolved free carbon dioxide ({{chem|CO|2(aq)}}), [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|CO|3}}), [[bicarbonate]] ({{chem|HCO|3|-}}) and [[carbonate]] ({{chem|CO|3|2-}}). The ratio of these species depends on factors such as [[seawater]] [[temperature]], pressure and salinity (as shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]]). These different forms of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] are transferred from an ocean's surface to its interior by the ocean's [[solubility pump]].

The resistance of an area of ocean to absorbing atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} is known as the [[Revelle factor]].

==Acidification==
Dissolving {{chem|CO|2}} in seawater increases the [[hydrogen]] ion ({{chem|H|+}}) concentration in the ocean, and thus decreases ocean pH, as follows:&lt;ref name=IPCC&gt;{{cite journal |last=IPCC |year=2005 |title=IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=390 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_wholereport.pdf |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[industrial revolution]] began, it is estimated that surface ocean pH has dropped by slightly more than 0.1 units on the [[logarithm]]ic scale of pH, representing about a 29% increase in {{chem|H|+|}}.

One of the first detailed datasets to examine how pH varied over 8 years at a specific north [[Temperate zone|temperate]] [[coast]]al location found that acidification had strong links to ''in situ'' benthic species dynamics and that the  variation in ocean pH may cause calcareous species to perform more poorly than noncalcareous species in years with low pH and predicts  consequences for near-shore [[benthic]] ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Wootton | first=J.

Current rates of ocean acidification have been compared with the greenhouse event at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (about 55&amp;nbsp;million years ago) when surface ocean temperatures rose by 5–6&amp;nbsp;degrees [[Celsius]].

A review by climate scientists at the [[RealClimate]] blog, of a 2005 report by the [[Royal Society]] of the UK similarly highlighted the centrality of the ''rates'' of change in the present anthropogenic acidification process, writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David |date=July 2, 2005 |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/07/the-acid-ocean-the-other-problem-with-cosub2sub-emission/|title=The Acid Ocean – the Other Problem with CO2 Emission |website=Real Climate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The natural pH of the ocean is determined by a need to balance the deposition and burial of {{chem|CaCO|3}} on the [[sea floor]] against the influx of {{chem|Ca||2+}} and {{chem|CO|3|2-}} into the ocean from dissolving rocks on land, called weathering. These processes stabilize the pH of the ocean, by a mechanism called {{chem|CaCO|3}} compensation...The point of bringing it up again is to note that if the {{chem|CO|2}} concentration of the atmosphere changes more slowly than this, as it always has throughout the [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok record]], the pH of the ocean will be relatively unaffected because {{chem|CaCO|3}} compensation can keep up. The [present] fossil fuel acidification is much faster than natural changes, and so the acid spike will be more intense than the earth has seen in at least 800,000&amp;nbsp;years."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 15-year period 1995–2010 alone, acidity has increased 6 percent in the upper 100&amp;nbsp;meters of the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to Alaska.&lt;ref name="2010aug_sciam"/&gt; According to a statement in July 2012 by [[Jane Lubchenco]], head of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] "surface waters are changing much more rapidly than initial calculations have suggested. It's yet another reason to be very seriously concerned about the amount of carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere now and the additional amount we continue to put out."&lt;ref name="HPost"/&gt;

A 2013 study claimed acidity was increasing at a rate 10 times faster than in any of the evolutionary crises in Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fiona Harvey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/25/rising-acid-levels-seas-endanger-marine-poertner |title=Rising levels of acids in seas may endanger marine life, says study |work=The Guardian |date=2013-08-25 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a synthesis report published in ''Science'' in 2015, 22 leading marine scientists stated that {{CO2}} from burning fossil fuels is changing the oceans' chemistry more rapidly than at any time since the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]], Earth's most severe known extinction event, emphasizing that the 2&amp;nbsp;°C maximum temperature increase agreed upon by governments reflects too small a cut in emissions to prevent "dramatic impacts" on the world's oceans, with lead author Jean-Pierre Gattuso remarking that "The ocean has been minimally considered at previous climate negotiations. Our study provides compelling arguments for a radical change at the UN conference (in Paris) on climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33369024|title=CO2 emissions threaten ocean crisis|first=Roger|last=Harrabin|date=3 July 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate at which ocean acidification will occur may be influenced by the rate of surface ocean warming, because the chemical equilibria that govern seawater pH are temperature-dependent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=M.

==Calcification==

===Overview===
Changes in ocean chemistry can have extensive direct and indirect effects on organisms and their habitats. One of the most important repercussions of increasing ocean acidity relates to the production of shells and plates out of [[calcium carbonate]] ({{chem|CaCO|3}}).&lt;ref name=raven05/&gt; This process is called calcification and is important to the biology and survival of a wide range of marine organisms. Calcification involves the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of dissolved ions into solid {{chem|CaCO|3}} structures, such as [[coccolith]]s. After they are formed, such structures are vulnerable to [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] unless the surrounding seawater contains [[saturation (chemistry)|saturating]] concentrations of carbonate ions (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Mechanism===
[[File:Carbonate system of seawater.svg|thumb|[[Bjerrum plot]]: Change in carbonate system of seawater from ocean acidification.]]
Of the extra carbon dioxide added into the oceans, some remains as dissolved carbon dioxide, while the rest contributes towards making additional bicarbonate (and additional carbonic acid). This also increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, and the percentage increase in hydrogen is larger than the percentage increase in bicarbonate,&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mitchell|first=M. J.|year=2010 |title=A model of carbon dioxide dissolution and mineral carbonation kinetics |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/12/04/rspa.2009.0349.full | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=466 |issue= 2117|pages=1265–1290 |doi= 10.1098/rspa.2009.0349|pmid= |bibcode=2010RSPSA.466.1265M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating an imbalance in the reaction HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. To maintain chemical equilibrium, some of the carbonate ions already in the ocean combine with some of the hydrogen ions to make further bicarbonate. Thus the ocean's concentration of carbonate ions is reduced, creating an imbalance in the reaction Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and making the dissolution of formed {{chem|CaCO|3}} structures more likely.

The increase in concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, and reduction in carbonate, are shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]].

===Saturation state===
The [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] state (known as Ω) of seawater for a mineral is a measure of the thermodynamic potential for the mineral to form or to dissolve, and for calcium carbonate is described by the following equation:

:&lt;math chem&gt;{\Omega} = \frac{\left[\ce{Ca^2+}\right] \left[\ce{CO3^2-}\right]}{K_{sp}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here Ω is the product of the concentrations (or [[Activity (chemistry)|activities]]) of the reacting ions that form the mineral ({{chem|Ca||2+}} and {{chem|CO|3|2-}}), divided by the product of the concentrations of those ions when the mineral is at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] ({{chem|K|sp}}), that is, when the mineral is neither forming nor dissolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Atkinson | first1=M.J. |last2=Cuet | first2=P. | year=2008 | title=Possible effects of ocean acidification on coral reef biogeochemistry: topics for research | journal=[[Marine Ecology Progress Series]] | volume=373 | pages=249–256 | doi=10.3354/meps07867| ref=harv | bibcode=2008MEPS..373..249A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In seawater, a natural horizontal boundary is formed as a result of temperature, pressure, and depth, and is known as the saturation horizon.&lt;ref name=raven05/&gt; Above this saturation horizon, Ω has a value greater than 1, and {{chem|CaCO|3}} does not readily dissolve. Most calcifying organisms live in such waters.&lt;ref name=raven05/&gt; Below this depth, Ω has a value less than 1, and {{chem|CaCO|3}} will dissolve. However, if its production rate is high enough to offset dissolution, {{chem|CaCO|3}} can still occur where Ω is less than 1. The [[carbonate compensation depth]] occurs at the depth in the ocean where production is exceeded by dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Thurman | first1=H.V. | last2=Trujillo | first2=A.P. | title=Introductory Oceanography | year=2004 | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-143888-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decrease in the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; decreases Ω, and hence makes {{chem|CaCO|3}} dissolution more likely.

Calcium carbonate occurs in two common [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] (crystalline forms): [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]]. Aragonite is much more soluble than calcite, so the aragonite saturation horizon is always nearer to the surface than the calcite saturation horizon.&lt;ref name=raven05/&gt; This also means that those organisms that produce aragonite may be more vulnerable to changes in ocean acidity than those that produce calcite.&lt;ref name=orr05/&gt; Increasing {{chem|CO|2}} levels and the resulting lower pH of seawater decreases the saturation state of {{chem|CaCO|3}} and raises the saturation horizons of both forms closer to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Royal Society]]. Ocean Acidification Due To Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide, The Clyvedon Press Ltd. (2005): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in saturation state is believed to be one of the main factors leading to decreased calcification in marine organisms, as the inorganic precipitation of {{chem|CaCO|3}} is directly proportional to its saturation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Marubini | first1=F. | last2=Ferrier-Pagès | first2=C. | last3=Furla | first3=P. | last4=Allemand | first4=D. | year=2008 | title=Coral calcification responds to seawater acidification: a working hypothesis towards a physiological mechanism | journal=[[Coral Reefs (journal)|Coral Reefs]] | volume=27 | pages=491–499 | doi=10.1007/s00338-008-0375-6| issue=3 |bibcode = 2008CorRe..27..491M| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts on oceanic calcifying organisms===
Although the [[solubility pump|natural absorption of {{chem|CO|2}}]] by the world's oceans helps mitigate the [[climate change|climatic]] effects of anthropogenic emissions of {{chem|CO|2}}, it is believed that the resulting decrease in pH will have negative consequences, primarily for oceanic [[calcification|calcifying]] organisms. These span the [[food chain]] from [[autotroph]]s to [[heterotroph]]s and include organisms such as [[coccolithophore]]s, [[coral]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[crustacea]]ns and [[mollusca|molluscs]].&lt;ref name="Mora"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As described above, under normal conditions, calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at [[supersaturation|supersaturating]] concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, the concentration of carbonate ions required for saturation to occur increases, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution. Therefore, even if there is no change in the rate of calcification, the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Nienhuis |first1 = S. |last2 = Palmer |first2 = A. |last3 = Harley |first3 = C. |year = 2010 |title = Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affects shell dissolution rate but not calcification rate in a marine snail |journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume = 277 |issue = 1693 |pages = 2553–2558 |pmc = 2894921 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0206 |pmid = 20392726 |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluid in the internal compartments where corals grow their [[exoskeleton]] is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater is lower than the ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance in the internal compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=A. |last2=Holcomb |first2=M. |year=2009 |title=Why Corals Care About Ocean Acidification: Uncovering the Mechanism |journal=Oceanography |volume=24 |pages=118–127 |url=http://coralreef.noaa.gov/education/oa/resources/22-4_cohen.pdf |doi=10.5670/oceanog.2009.102 |issue=4 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106020339/http://coralreef.noaa.gov/education/oa/resources/22-4_cohen.pdf |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the current progression of carbon emissions, around 70% of North Atlantic cold-water corals will be living in corrosive waters by 2050-60.&lt;ref name="Perez2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pérez|first1= F.|last2= Fontela|first2= M.|last3= García-Ibañez|first3= M.|last4= Mercier|first4= H.|last5= Velo|first5=A.|last6= Lherminier|first6=P.|last7= Zunino|first7= P.|last8= de la Paz|first8= M.|last9= Alonso|first9= F.|last10= Guallart|first10=E.|last11= Padín|first11= T.|title=Meridional overturning circulation conveys fast acidification to the deep Atlantic Ocean|journal=Nature|volume= 554|date= 2018-02-22|pages= 515–518|doi= 10.1038/nature25493|bibcode= 2018Natur.554..515P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in January 2018 showed that the skeletal growth of corals under acidified conditions is primarily affected by a reduced capacity to build dense exoskeletons, rather than affecting the  linear extension of the exoskeleton. Using Global Climate Models, they show that the density of some species of corals could be reduced by over 20% by the end of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mollica|first1=Nathaniel R.|last2=Guo|first2=Weifu|last3=Cohen|first3=Anne L.|last4=Huang|first4=Kuo-Fang|last5=Foster|first5=Gavin L.|last6=Donald|first6=Hannah K.|last7=Solow|first7=Andrew R.|title=Ocean acidification affects coral growth by reducing skeletal density|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=20 February 2018|volume=115|issue=8|pages=1754–1759|doi=10.1073/pnas.1712806115|bibcode=2018PNAS..115.1754M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places carbon dioxide bubbles out from the sea floor, locally changing the pH and other aspects of the chemistry of the seawater. Studies of these carbon dioxide seeps have documented a variety of responses by different organisms.&lt;ref name="pmid18536730" /&gt;  Coral reef communities located near carbon dioxide seeps are of particular interest because of the sensitivity of some corals species to acidification.  In [[Papua New Guinea]], declining pH caused by carbon dioxide seeps is associated with declines in coral species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Losers and winners in coral reefs acclimatized to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations|last = Fabricius|first = Katharina|date = 2011|journal = Nature Climate Change|doi = 10.1038/nclimate1122|pmid = |access-date =|volume=1|pages=165–169|bibcode =2011NatCC...1..165F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in [[Palau]] carbon dioxide seeps are not associated with reduced species diversity of corals, although bioerosion of coral skeletons is much higher at low pH sites.

===Other biological impacts===
Aside from the slowing and/or reversing of calcification, organisms may suffer other adverse effects, either indirectly through negative impacts on food resources,&lt;ref name=raven05/&gt; or directly as reproductive or physiological effects. For example, the elevated oceanic levels of {{CO2}} may produce {{chem|CO|2}}-induced acidification of body fluids, known as [[hypercapnia]]. Also, increasing ocean acidity is believed to have a range of direct consequences. For example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid;&lt;ref name=Rosa /&gt; depress the immune responses of blue mussels;&lt;ref name=Bibby /&gt; and make it harder for juvenile [[clownfish]] to tell apart the smells of non-predators and predators,&lt;ref name=Dixson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixson |first=D.

===Ecosystem impacts amplified by ocean warming and deoxygenation===
While the full implications of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on marine ecosystems are still being documented, there is a substantial body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature, driven mainly by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions, have a compounded effect on marine life and the ocean environment. This effect far exceeds the individual harmful impact of either.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeker, et al.

(2002) "Pteropods on the edge: Cumulative effects of ocean acidification, warming, and deoxygenation."

===Impact on human industry===
The threat of acidification includes a decline in [[Commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] and in the Arctic tourism industry and economy. Commercial fisheries are threatened because acidification harms calcifying organisms which form the base of the Arctic food webs.

[[Pteropoda|Pteropods]] and [[brittle star]]s both form the base of the Arctic [[food web]]s and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells dissolve with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Ocean Acidification on Marine Species &amp; Ecosystems|url=http://oceana.org/en/our-work/climate-energy/ocean-acidification/learn-act/effects-of-ocean-acidification-on-marine-species-ecosystems|work=Report|publisher=OCEANA|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium.

Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators.

The effects on the calcifying organisms at the base of the food webs could potentially destroy fisheries.

===Impact on indigenous peoples===
Acidification could damage the Arctic tourism economy and affect the way of life of indigenous peoples. A major pillar of Arctic tourism is the sport fishing and hunting industry. The sport fishing industry is threatened by collapsing food webs which provide food for the prized fish. A decline in tourism lowers revenue input in the area, and threatens the economies that are increasingly dependent on tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx0938xPA-PolarTourismEN.pdf | title=Tourism in the Polar Regions: The Sustainability Challenge | publisher=UNEP, The International Ecotourism Society | work=Report | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Snyder, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid decrease or disappearance of marine life could also affect the diet of [[Indigenous peoples]].

== Ocean Acidification in the Arctic Ocean ==
[[File:Annual Arctic Sea Ice Minimum.jpg|thumb|Annual Arctic Sea Ice Minimum]]
The [[Arctic ocean]] has experienced drastic change over the years due to [[global warming]]. It has been known that the Arctic ocean acidity levels have been increasing and at twice the rate compared to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Di |last2=Chen |first2=Liqi |last3=Chen |first3=Baoshan |last4=Gao |first4=Zhongyong |last5=Zhong |first5=Wenli |last6=Feely |first6=Richard A. |last7=Anderson |first7=Leif G. |last8=Sun |first8=Heng |last9=Chen |first9=Jianfang |last10=Chen |first10=Min |last11=Zhan |first11=Liyang |last12=Zhang |first12=Yuanhui |last13=Cai |first13=Wei-Jun |title=Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic Ocean |journal=Nature Climate Change |date=27 February 2017 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1038/nclimate3228 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3228 |language=en |issn=1758-678X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of [[sea ice]] has been connected to a decrease in pH levels in the ocean water.

With less water completely exposed to the atmosphere, the levels of carbon dioxide gas in the water remain low. The Arctic ocean should have low carbon dioxide levels due to intense cooling, run off of fresh water and photosynthesis from marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Ref 3" /&gt; However, the decrease of sea ice over the years due to global warming has limited freshwater runoff and has exposed a higher percentage of the ocean surface to the atmosphere. The increase of carbon dioxide in the water decreases the pH of the ocean causing [[ocean acidification]]. The decrease in sea ice has also allowed more Pacific water to flow into in the Arctic ocean during the winter, this is called Pacific winter water.&lt;ref name="Ref 1" /&gt; The Pacific water flows into the Arctic ocean carrying additional amounts of carbon dioxide by being exposed to the atmosphere and absorbing carbon dioxide from decaying organic matter and from sediments.&lt;ref name="Ref 1" /&gt;

The Arctic ocean pH levels are rapidly decreasing because not only is the ocean water absorbing more carbon dioxide due to increased surface area exposure as a result of a decrease in sea ice. It also has large amounts of carbon dioxide being transferred to the Arctic from the Pacific ocean.
 
Cold water is able to absorb higher amounts of carbon dioxide compared to warm water. The solubility of gases decreases in relation to increasing temperature. Cold water bodies are absorbing the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and becoming known as carbon sinks.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacGilchrist |first1=G.A |last2=Naveria Garabato |first2=A.C |last3=Tsubouchi |first3=T |last4=Bacon |first4=S |last5=Torres-Valdés |first5=S |last6=Azetsu-Scott |first6=K |title=The Arctic Ocean carbon sink |journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers |date=1 April 2014 |volume=86 |pages=39–55 |doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2014.01.002 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063714000065 |language=en |issn=0967-0637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the water is putting many organisms at risk as they are affected by the increase of acidity in the ocean water.

== Effects of Ocean Acidification on Arctic Organisms ==
Organisms in Arctic waters are already challenged with stressors of living in the arctic ocean, such as dealing with cold temperatures, and it is thought that because of this, additional stressors such as ocean acidification, will cause ocean acidification effects on marine organisms to appear first in the Arctic. There exists a significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms to increased ocean acidification. Calcifying organisms generally exhibit larger negative responses from ocean acidification than non‐calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected.&lt;ref name="ref 5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comeau |first1=S. |last2=Gorsky |first2=G. |last3=Jeffree |first3=R. |last4=Teyssié |first4=J.-L. |last5=Gattuso |first5=J.-P. |title=Impact of ocean acidification on a key Arctic pelagic mollusc (Limacina helicina) |journal=Biogeosciences |date=4 September 2009 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=1877–1882 |doi=10.5194/bg-6-1877-2009 |language=en |issn=1726-4170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acidification of the Arctic ocean will impact these marine calcifiers in several different ways.

The uptake of CO₂ by seawater increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, which lowers pH and, in changing the chemical equilibrium of the inorganic carbon system, reduces the concentration of carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻).&lt;ref name="ref 6"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boggs, Jr. |first1=Sam |title=Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages=145-150 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbonate ions are required by marine calcifying organisms such as plankton, shellfish, and fish to produce calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) shells and skeletons.[[File:Arctic Council map.png|thumb|Arctic Council map]] For either aragonite or calcite, the two polymorphs of CaCO₃ produced by marine organisms, the saturation state of CaCO₃ in ocean water is expressed by the product of the concentrations of CO₂²⁻ and Ca²⁺ in seawater relative to the stoichiometric solubility product at a given temperature, salinity, and pressure.&lt;ref name="ref 7"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yamamoto-Kawai |first1=Michiyo |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Fiona A. |last3=Carmack |first3=Eddy C. |last4=Nishino |first4=Shigeto |last5=Shimada |first5=Koji |title=Aragonite Undersaturation in the Arctic Ocean: Effects of Ocean Acidification and Sea Ice Melt |journal=Science |date=20 November 2009 |volume=326 |issue=5956 |pages=1098–1100 |doi=10.1126/science.1174190 |language=en |issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters which are saturated in CaCO₃ are favourable to precipitation and formation of CaCO₃ shells and skeletons, but waters which are undersaturated are corrosive to CaCO₃ shells, and in the absence of protective mechanisms, dissolution of calcium carbonate will occur. Because colder arctic water absorbs more CO₂, the concentration of CO₃²⁻ is reduced, therefore the saturation of calcium carbonate is lower in high-latitude oceans than it is in tropical or temperate oceans.&lt;ref name="ref 7" /&gt; In model simulations of the Arctic Ocean, it is predicted that aragonite saturation will decrease, because of an increased amount of freshwater input from melting sea ice and increased carbon uptake as a result of sea ice retreat. This simulation predicts that Arctic surface waters will become undersaturated with aragonite within a decade.&lt;ref name="ref 7" /&gt; The undersaturation of aragonite will cause the shells of organisms which are constructed from aragonite to dissolve. This would have a profound effect on a large variety of marine organisms and has the potential to do devastating damage to keystone species and to the marine food web in the arctic ocean. Laboratory experiments on various marine biota in an elevated CO₂ environment show that changes in aragonite saturation cause substantial changes in overall calcification rates for many species of marine organisms, including [[coccolithophore]], [[foraminifera]], [[pteropods]], [[mussels]], and [[clams]].&lt;ref name="ref 7" /&gt;

Although the undersaturation of arctic water has been proven to have an effect on the ability of organisms to precipitate their shells, recent studies have shown that the calcification rate of calcifiers, such as [[corals]], coccolithophores, foraminiferans and bivalves, decrease with increasing pCO₂, even in seawater supersaturated with respect to CaCO₃. Additionally, increased pCO₂  has been found to have complex effects on the physiology, growth and reproductive success of various marine calcifiers.&lt;ref name="ref 8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kurihara |first1=Haruko |title=Effects of CO2-driven ocean acidification on the early developmental stages of invertebrates |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |date=23 December 2008 |volume=373 |pages=275–284 |doi=10.3354/meps07802 |language=en |issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO₂ tolerance seems to differ between various marine organisms, as well as differences in CO₂ tolerance at different life cycle stages (e.g. larva and adult). The first stage in the life cycle of marine calcifiers which are at a serious risk by high CO2 content is the planktonic larval stage. The larval development of several marine species, primarily sea urchins and bivalves, are highly affected by elevations of seawater pCO₂.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt; In laboratory tests, numerous sea urchin embryos were reared under different CO₂ concentrations until they developed to the larval stage. It was found that once reaching this stage, larval and arm sizes were significantly smaller, as well as abnormal skeleton morphology was noted with increasing pCO₂.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt;
[[File:Pterapod shell dissolved in seawater adjusted to an ocean chemistry projected for the year 2100.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Pterapod shell dissolved in seawater adjusted to an ocean chemistry projected for the year 2100]]
Similar findings have been found in CO₂ treated-mussel larvae, which showed a larval size decrease of about 20% and showed morphological abnormalities such as convex hinges, weaker and thinner shells and protrusion of mantle.&lt;ref name="ref 9"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gaylord |first1=Brian |last2=Hill |first2=Tessa M. |last3=Sanford |first3=Eric |last4=Lenz |first4=Elizabeth A. |last5=Jacobs |first5=Lisa A. |last6=Sato |first6=Kirk N. |last7=Russell |first7=Ann D. |last8=Hettinger |first8=Annaliese |title=Functional impacts of ocean acidification in an ecologically critical foundation species |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1 August 2011 |volume=214 |issue=15 |pages=2586–2594 |doi=10.1242/jeb.055939 |language=en |issn=0022-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larval body size also impacts the encounter and clearance rates of food particles, and if larval shells are smaller or deformed, these larvae are more prone to starvation. In addition, CaCO₃ structures also serve vital functions for calcified larvae, such as defence against predation, as well as roles in feeding, buoyancy control and pH regulation.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt; Another example of a species which may be seriously impacted by ocean acidification is Pteropods, which are shelled pelagic molluscs which play an important role in the food-web of various ecosystems. Since they harbour an aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions.Laboratory tests showed that calcification exhibits a 28% decrease at the pH value of the Arctic ocean expected for the year 2100, compared to the present pH value. This 28% decline of calcification in the lower pH condition is within the range reported also for other calcifying organisms such as corals.&lt;ref name="ref 5" /&gt; In contrast with sea urchin and bivalve larvae, corals and marine shrimps are more severely impacted by ocean acidification after settlement, while they developed into the polyp stage. From laboratory tests, the morphology of the CO₂-treated polyp endoskeleton of corals was disturbed and malformed compared to the radial pattern of control polyps.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt;

This variability in the impact of ocean acidification on different life cycle stages of different organisms can be partially explained by the fact that most echinoderms and mollusks start shell and skeleton synthesis at their larval stage, whereas corals start at the settlement stage.  Hence, these stages are highly susceptible to the potential effects of ocean acidification.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt; Most calcifiers, such as corals, echinoderms, bivalves and crustaceans, play important roles in coastal ecosystems as keystone species, bioturbators and ecosystem engineers.&lt;ref name="ref 8" /&gt; The [[food web]] in the arctic ocean is somewhat truncated, meaning it is short and simple. Any impacts to key species in the food web can cause exponentially devastating effects on the rest on the food chain as a whole, as they will no longer have a reliable food source. If these larger organisms no longer have any source of nutrients, they too will eventually die off, and the entire Arctic ocean ecosystem will be affected. This would have a huge impact on the arctic people who catch arctic fish for a living, as well as the economic repercussions which would follow such a major shortage of food and living income for these families.

===Reducing {{CO2}} emissions===
Members of the [[InterAcademy Panel]] recommended that by 2050, global anthropogenic {{CO2}} emissions be reduced less than 50% of the 1990 level.&lt;ref name="iap statement"/&gt; The 2009&lt;ref name="iap statement"/&gt; statement also called on world leaders to:&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Acknowledge that ocean acidification is a direct and real consequence of increasing atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations, is already having an effect at current concentrations, and is likely to cause grave harm to important marine ecosystems as {{CO2}} concentrations reach 450 [parts-per-million (ppm)] and above;
*... Recognise that reducing the build up of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere is the only practicable solution to mitigating ocean acidification;
*... Reinvigorate action to reduce stressors, such as [[overfishing]] and [[marine pollution|pollution]], on [[marine ecosystem]]s to increase resilience to ocean acidification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stabilizing atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations at 450 [[parts per million|ppm]] would require near-term emissions reductions, with steeper reductions over time.{{sfnp|Clarke|others|2007|loc=Technical Summary, Table TS.2 (p. 9) and Figure TS.10 (p. 20)}}

The [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]]&lt;ref name="wbgu ocean acidification"&gt;{{harvp|WBGU|2006|loc=Summary for Policymakers, Halting ocean acidification in time, p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to prevent disruption of the calcification of marine organisms and the resultant risk of fundamentally altering marine food webs, the following guard rail should be obeyed: the pH of near surface waters should not drop more than 0.2 units below the pre-industrial average value in any larger ocean region (nor in the global mean).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One policy target related to ocean acidity is the magnitude of future global warming. Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) adopted a target of limiting warming to below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, relative to the pre-industrial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| date=15 March 2011 | author=UNFCCC | title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010.

Limiting global warming to below 2&amp;nbsp;°C would imply a reduction in surface ocean pH of 0.16 from pre-industrial levels. This would represent a substantial decline in surface ocean pH.{{sfnp|Good|others|2010|loc=Executive Summary}}

===Climate engineering===
[[Climate engineering]] (mitigating temperature or pH effects of emissions) has been proposed as a possible response to ocean acidification. The IAP (2009)&lt;ref name="iap statement"/&gt; statement cautioned against climate engineering as a policy response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mitigation approaches such as adding chemicals to counter the effects of acidification are likely to be expensive, only partly effective and only at a very local scale, and may pose additional unanticipated risks to the marine environment. There has been very little research on the feasibility and impacts of these approaches. Substantial research is needed before these techniques could be applied.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reports by the WGBU (2006),&lt;ref name="wbgu ocean acidification"/&gt; the UK's [[Royal Society]] (2009),{{sfnp|UK Royal Society|2009|loc=Summary, pp. ix-xii}} and the [[US National Research Council]] (2011){{sfnp|US NRC|2011|loc=[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12781&amp;page=51 Ch 5: Key Elements of America's Climate Choices], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12781&amp;page=52 Box 5.1: Geoengineering, pp. 52–53]}} warned of the potential risks and difficulties associated with climate engineering.

====Iron fertilization====
[[Iron fertilization]] of the ocean could stimulate photosynthesis in [[phytoplankton]] (see [[Iron hypothesis]]). The phytoplankton would convert the ocean's dissolved carbon dioxide into [[carbohydrate]] and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing. More than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases [[photosynthesis]] in phytoplankton by up to 30 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trujillo|first=Alan|title=Essentials of Oceanography|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780321668127|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean acidification problem, mitigation of surface ocean acidification might increase acidification in the less-inhabited deep ocean.&lt;ref name=cao&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Cao | first=L. | author2=Caldeira, K. | year=2010 | title=Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification? | journal=[[Climatic Change]] | volume=99 | pages=303–311 | doi=10.1007/s10584-010-9799-4 | issue=1–2| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the UK's Royal Society (2009){{sfnp|UK Royal Society|2009|loc=Ch 2: Carbon dioxide removal techniques,Sec 2.3.1 Ocean fertilisation methods, pp. 16–19}} reviewed the approach for effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety. The rating for affordability was "medium", or "not expected to be very cost-effective". For the other three criteria, the ratings ranged from "low" to "very low" (i.e., not good). For example, in regards to safety, the report found a "[high] potential for undesirable ecological side effects", and that ocean fertilization "may increase anoxic regions of ocean ('[[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]s')".{{sfnp|UK Royal Society|2009|loc=Ch 2: Carbon dioxide removal techniques, Sec 2.3.1 Ocean fertilisation methods, Table 2.8, p. 18}}

The Pacific Northwest region, which is listed with a 2-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) of 17, has an approximate size of {{convert|302,334|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}}, and consists of 12 subregions, which are listed with the 4-digit HUCs 1701 through 1706.&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC_name&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units |url=https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html|publisher=[[USGS]] |website=water.usgs.gov |accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region includes the drainage within the United States that ultimately discharges into: (a) the [[Strait of Georgia]] and of [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], and (b) the [[Pacific Ocean]] within the states of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; and that part of the [[Great Basin]] whose discharge is into the state of [[Oregon]].

'''Photoionization''' is the physical process in which an ion is formed from the interaction of a [[photon]] with an atom or molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=photoionization|file=P04620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross section==
Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the [[Photoionisation cross section|photoionization cross-section]], which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} of infrared or visible light), [[non-perturbative]] phenomena such as ''barrier suppression ionization''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Delone | first1=N. B. | last2=Krainov | first2=V. P. | year=1998 | title=Tunneling and barrier-suppression ionization of atoms and ions in a laser radiation field | journal=[[Physics-Uspekhi]] | volume=41 | issue=5 | pages=469–485 | doi=10.1070/PU1998v041n05ABEH000393 |bibcode = 1998PhyU...41..469D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rescattering ionization''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Dichiara |first1=A. |display-authors=etal |year=2005 |title=Cross-shell multielectron ionization of xenon by an ultrastrong laser field |booktitle=Proceedings of the Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference |volume=3 |pages=1974–1976 |publisher=[[Optical Society of America]] |doi=10.1109/QELS.2005.1549346 |isbn=1-55752-796-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are observed.

==Multi-photon ionization==
Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing ''N'' photons depends on the laser-light intensity ''I'' as ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Deng|first1=Z. |last2=Eberly|first2=J. H. |year=1985 |title=Multiphoton absorption above ionization threshold by atoms in strong laser fields |journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America B]] |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=491 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.2.000486 |bibcode = 1985JOSAB...2..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; For higher intensities, this dependence becomes invalid due to the then occurring AC [[Stark effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Protopapas|first1=M|last2=Keitel|first2=C H|last3=Knight|first3=P L|title=Atomic physics with super-high intensity lasers|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=1 April 1997|volume=60|issue=4|pages=389–486|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/60/4/001|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/60/4/001|accessdate=19 August 2013|bibcode=1997RPPh...60..389P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization]] (REMPI) is a technique applied to the [[spectroscopy]] of [[atom]]s and small [[molecule]]s in which a [[tunable laser]] can be used to access an [[Excited state|excited intermediate state]].

[[Above threshold ionization]] (ATI) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Agostini |first1=P. |display-authors=etal |year=1979 |title=Free-Free Transitions Following Six-Photon Ionization of Xenon Atoms |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=42 |issue=17 |pages=1127–1130 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.1127 |bibcode=1979PhRvL..42.1127A }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of multi-photon ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher [[kinetic energy]] than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, The system will have multiple peaks in its [[photoelectron spectrum]] which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Tunnel ionization==
When either the laser intensity is further increased or a longer wavelength is applied as compared with the regime in which multi-photon ionization takes place, a quasi-stationary approach can be used and results in the distortion of the atomic potential in such a way that only a relatively low and narrow barrier between a [[bound state]] and the continuum states remains. Then, the electron can [[tunnel effect|tunnel]] through or for larger distortions even overcome this barrier. These phenomena are called [[tunnel ionization]] and [[over-the-barrier ionization]], respectively.

'''Plastination''' is a technique or process used in [[anatomy]] to preserve bodies or body parts, first developed by [[Gunther von Hagens]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/plastination/idea_plastination.html |title=The Idea behind plastination |publisher=Institute for Plastination |accessdate=1 May 2012 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water and [[fat]] are replaced by certain [[plastic]]s, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or [[bacterial decay|decay]], and even retain most properties of the original sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. H. |last=Weiglein |title=Overview &amp; General Principles of the Plastination Procedures |journal=8th Interim Conf Plast |year=2005 |url=http://www.uqtr.uquebec.ca/plastination/Abstracts-2005.html#Weiglein-01-2005 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:PlastinationProcess EN.svg|thumb|The centerpiece of plastination: "forced impregnation"]]

Four steps are used in the standard process of plastination: fixation, [[dehydration]], forced impregnation in a [[vacuum]], and hardening.&lt;ref name=hagans1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gunther |last=von Hagens |authorlink=Gunther von Hagens |author2=Klaus Tiedemann |author3=Wilhelm Kriz |title=The current potential of plastination |journal=Anatomy and Embryology |volume=175 |issue=4 |pages=411–21 |year=1987 |pmid=3555158 |doi=10.1007/BF00309677 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and [[lipid]] tissues are replaced by curable polymers, which include [[silicone]], [[epoxy]], and [[polyester]]-[[copolymer]].&lt;ref name=hagans1987/&gt;

The first step of plastination, fixation,&lt;ref name=henry1997&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert W. |last=Henry |author2=Larry Janick |author3=Francis Paul Salmos |date=February 1997 |title=Specimen preparation for silicone plastination |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol12/1_Henry_13a17.pdf |volume=12 |issue=1 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  frequently uses a [[formaldehyde]]-based solution, and serves two functions. Dissecting the specimen to show specific anatomical elements can be time consuming. Formaldehyde or other preserving solutions help prevent [[decomposition]] of the tissues. They may also confer a degree of rigidity. This can be beneficial in maintaining the shape or arrangement of a specimen. A stomach might be inflated or a leg bent at the knee, for example.

After any necessary [[dissection]]s have taken place, the specimen is placed in a bath of [[acetone]] (freezing point −95°&amp;nbsp;C) at −20° to −30°&amp;nbsp;C. The volume of the bath should be 10 times that of the specimen. The acetone is renewed two times over the course of six weeks. The acetone draws out all the water and replaces it inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=bickley1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harmon C. |last=Bickley |author2=Robert S. Conner, Anna N. Walker and R. Lamar Jackson |date=January 1987 |title=Preservation of tissue by silicone rubber impregnation |url=http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624022306/http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-24|dead-url=no |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=30–39 |accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third step, the specimen is then placed in a bath of liquid polymer, such as [[silicone rubber]], [[polyester]], or [[epoxy resin]]. By creating a [[vacuum]], the acetone is made to boil at a low temperature. As the acetone [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and leaves the cells, it draws the liquid polymer in behind it, leaving a cell filled with liquid plastic.&lt;ref name=bickley1987/&gt;

The plastic must then be cured with gas, heat, or [[ultraviolet light]],  to harden it.&lt;ref name=henry1997/&gt;

A specimen can vary from a full [[human body]] to a small piece of an animal organ, and they are known as 'plastinates'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Once plastinated, the specimens and bodies are further manipulated and positioned prior to curing (hardening) of the polymer chains.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==History==
In November 1979, [[Gunther von Hagens]] applied for a German patent, proposing the idea of preserving animal and vegetable tissues permanently by synthetic resin impregnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=DE |number=2710147 |status=patent |title=Präparat aus biologischen verweslichen Objekten und Verfahren zu ihrer Herstellung |gdate=14 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, von Hagens has applied for further US patents regarding work on preserving biological tissues with polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4205059 |status=patent |title=Animal and vegetal tissues permanently preserved by synthetic resin  |gdate=27 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4320157 |status=patent |title=Method for preserving large sections of biological tissue with polymers  |gdate=16 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of his patents, von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993.  The Institute for Plastination, along with von Hagens, made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. The institute maintains three international centres of plastination, in Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodurproducts.com/en/plastination/preservation_plastination.html |title=Preservation by Plastination |publisher=BIODUR |accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related preservation methods==
Other methods have been in place for thousands of years to halt the decomposition of the body. [[Mummy|Mummification]] used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is a widely-known method which involves the removal of body fluid and wrapping the body in linens. Prior to mummification, Egyptians would lay the body in a shallow pit in the desert and allow the sun to dehydrate the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Rymer |url=http://historylink101.net/egypt_1/religion_mummification_history.htm |title=History of Burial Beliefs in Ancient Egypt |publisher=History Link 101 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formalin]], an important solution to body preservation, was introduced in 1896 to help with body preservation. Soon to follow formalin, color-preserving embalming solutions were developed to preserve life-like color and flexibility to aid in the study of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306094856/http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2005 |title=Formaldehyde: Its Development And History Since 1868 |publisher=[[Museum of Funeral Customs]] |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paraffin wax|Paraffin]] impregnation was introduced in 1925, and the embedding of organs in plastic was developed in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Body preservation methods current to the 21st century are [[cryopreservation]], which involves the cooling of the body to very low temperatures to preserve the body tissues, plastination, and [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=5089288 |status=patent |title=Method for Impregnating Tissue Samples in Paraffin |gdate=18 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used in modern times include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room temperature procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure.&lt;ref name=Other&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |title=Other Plastination Methods |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |date=20 October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515122825/http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicone S 10 is the procedure most often used in plastination and creates opaque, natural-looking specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/silicone.html |title=The Silicone S 10 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dow Corning Corporation]]'s Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow plastination of specimen at [[room temperature]] to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, [[crosslinker]], and [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/cortech.html |title=The COR-TECH Room Temperature |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Society for Plastination, the Epoxy E 12 procedure is used "for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves "semitransparent and firm brain slices".&lt;ref name=Other/&gt; Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by deep freezing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/epoxy.html |title=The Epoxy E 12 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second method works best following 4–6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/polyester.html |title=The Polyester P35/P40 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of plastinated specimens==
Plastination is useful in anatomy, serving as models and teaching tools.&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nyu.edu/dental/nexus/issues/fall2004/vonhagens.html |title=Life, Death, and One Man's Quest to Demystify the Inner Realms of the Human Body |journal=Nexus |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used at more than 40 [[medical school|medical]] and [[dental school]]s throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection.
[[File:Histological section of bovine tongue.jpg|thumb|Histological section of bovine tongue, epoxy technique]]
Students enrolled in introductory [[animal science]] courses at many universities learn animal science through collections of multispecies large-animal specimens. Plastination allows students to have hands-on experience in this field, without exposure to chemicals such as formalin. For example, plastinated [[dog|canine]] [[gastrointestinal]] tracts are used to help in the teaching of [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] technique and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Janick |author2=R. C. DeNovo |author3=R. W. Henry |year=1997 |title=Plastinated Canine Gastrointestinal Tracts Used to Facilitate Teaching of Endoscopic Technique and Anatomy |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=158 |page=48 |doi=10.1159/000147910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastinated specimens retain their dilated conformation by a [[positive pressure]] air flow during the curing process, which allows them to be used to teach both endoscopic technique and gastrointestinal anatomy.

With the use of plastination as a teaching method of animal science, fewer animals have to be [[animal research|killed for research]], as the plastination process allows specimens to be studied for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/depts/ap/tour/labs/plastination.htm |title=KSUCVM Plastination Laboratory |publisher=Vet.ksu.edu |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Carolina State University]]'s College of Veterinary Medicine in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], uses both plastic coating (PC) and plastination (PN) to investigate and compare the difference in the two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the PN specimens were more flexible, durable, and life-like than those preserved by the PC method. The use of plastination allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, [[ligaments]], and [[central nervous system]] to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holladay SD, Hudson LC |title=Use of plastinated brains in teaching neuroanatomy at the North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |year=1989 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol3/Holladay_15a17.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] was the first school in the United States to use this technique to prepare gross organ specimens for use in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathology.uthscsa.edu/parc/index.shtml |title=Pathology Academic Resource Center: UT Health Science Center - Graduate School of Biomedical Science |publisher=pathology.uthscsa.edu |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York University College of Dentistry]].,&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004/&gt; [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometopcom.com/tours/phl-anatomy.php |title=Virtual Campus Tour: PCOM Anatomy Lab |publisher=PCOM.edu |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University of Warwick]], and University of Northumbria &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-hospital.com/topics/article/4657.html |title=First University to Acquire von Hagens Plastinations for University Teaching |publisher=European-hospital.com |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; use collections of plastinates as teaching aids. The [[University of Vienna]] has its own plastination laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/plastination/ |title=Vienna University Plastination Facility |publisher=Meduniwien.ac.at |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns==
Concern over consent of bodies being used in the plastination process has arisen. Over 20 years ago, von Hagens set up a [[body donation]] program in [[Germany]] and has signed over 9,000 donors into the plastinate program: 531 have already died. The program has reported an average of one body a day being released to the plastination process. About 90% of the donors registered are German. Although von Hagens says he follows strict consent procedures for whole-body specimens, he maintains, "consent is not important for body parts".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Von Hagens' body donations are now being managed by the Institute for Plastination (IfP)&lt;ref name="bodyworlds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/institute_for_plastination/mission_objectives.html |title=Institute |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1993.&lt;ref name="pmid12609939"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Debashis |last=Singh |title=Scientist or showman? |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7387 |page=468 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12609939 |pmc=1125369 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7387.468 |url= |last2=Von Hagens |first2=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastination exhibitions==
For the first 20 years, plastination was used to preserve small specimens for medical study. In the early 1990s, the equipment was developed to make plastinating whole body specimens possible, each specimen taking up to 1,500 man-hours to prepare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/leonardopodcast/TheLeonardoPodcast1.mp3 |title=TheLeonardo Podcast no. 1 |format=[[MP3]] |date=19 September 2008 |first=Ross |last=Chambless |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first exhibition of whole bodies was displayed by von Hagens in Japan in 1995.

Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the ''Körperwelten'' ([[Body Worlds]]) public exhibitions, showing whole bodies plastinated in life-like poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. The earliest exhibitions were presented in the [[Far East]] and in Germany, and Gunther von Hagens'  exhibitions have subsequently been hosted by museums and venues in more than 50 cities worldwide, attracting more than 29 million visitors.{{Citation needed|reason=a specific page with this specific information needs to be cited, not just the main body worlds website|date=May 2009}}.

Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds exhibitions are the original, precedent-setting public anatomical exhibitions of real human bodies, and the only anatomical exhibits that use donated bodies, willed by donors to the Institute for Plastination for the express purpose of serving the Body Worlds mission to educate the public about health and anatomy. To date, more than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination.&lt;ref name="bodyworlds1"/&gt;

In 2004, [[Premier Exhibitions]] began their "Bodies Revealed" exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]], which ran from August through October 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In 2005 and 2006, the company opened their "Bodies Revealed" and "Bodies...The Exhibition" in [[Seoul]], [[Tampa]], and [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The West Coast exhibition site opened on 22 June 2006 at the Tropicana Resort and Casino Las Vegas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} {{As of|2009|06}}, [[BODIES... The Exhibition]] is showing at the [[Ambassador Theatre (Dublin)]] in Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodiesdublin.ie]..&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was in Istanbul, Turkey, until the end of March 2011.

Plastination galleries are offered in a few college medical schools, including [[University of Michigan]] (said to be the nation's largest such lab)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/anatomy/plastinate/index.html |title=Plastination |publisher=Med.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/plastination/ |title=Plastination at the Vienna University |publisher=Meduniwien.ac.at |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{World geologic provinces}}
In geology, a '''platform''' is a continental area covered by relatively flat or gently tilted, mainly [[sediment]]ary [[stratum|strata]], which overlie a [[basement (geology)|basement]] of consolidated [[igneous]] or [[metamorphic rocks]] of an earlier deformation. Platforms, [[Shield (geology)|shields]] and the [[Basement (geology)|basement rocks]] together constitute [[craton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Sybil P. (Ed.). 1997. ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Geology and Mineralogy''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Platform sediments can be classified into the following groups: a "protoplatform" of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] sediments at the bottom, a "quasiplatform" of slightly deformed sediments, a "cataplatform", and a "orthoplatform" at the top. The [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Jotnian|Jotnian sediments]] of the  [[Geology of the Baltic Sea|Baltic area]] are examples of a "quasiplatform".&lt;ref name=Nago&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagornji |first=M.A. |last2=Nikolaev |first2=V.G. |date=2005 |title=The quasiplatform sediments of the East European Platform |url=|journal=[[Russian Journal of Earth Sciences]] |publisher= |volume=7 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.2205/2005ES000171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-[[Ordovician]] rocks of the South American Platform are examples of an orthoplatform.&lt;ref name="BrazilOrtho"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ppegeo.igc.usp.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-38791976000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=The Upper Precambrian of South America | author=de Almeida, F.

'''Products of conception''', abbreviated '''POC''', is a medical term used for the tissue derived from the union of an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and a [[sperm]]. It encompasses [[anembryonic gestation]] (blighted ovum) which does not have a viable [[embryo]].

In the context of tissue from a [[dilation and curettage]], the presence of POC essentially excludes an [[ectopic pregnancy]].

==Retained products of conception==
''Retained products of conception'' is where products of conception remain in the uterus after [[childbirth]], [[medical abortion]] or [[Miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] (colloquially known as miscarriage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=19611 Definition: 'Retained Products Of Conception'] from MediLexicon. Retrieved Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Miscarriage with retained products of conception is termed ''delayed'' when no or very little products of conception have been passed, and ''incomplete'' when some products have been passed but some still remain ''[[in utero]]''.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchon|first=DJ|title=Missed abortion versus delayed miscarriage.|journal=British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=June 1997|volume=104|issue=6|pages=753|pmid=9197887|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11994.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, quantitative [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]], ultrasound, and pathologic evaluation. A solid, heterogeneous, echogenic mass has a positive predictive value of 80%, but is present in only a minority of cases. A thickened endometrium of &gt; 10&amp;nbsp;mm is usually considered abnormal, though no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoff. A cut-off of 8&amp;nbsp;mm or more has 34% positive rate, while a cut off of 14&amp;nbsp;mm or more has 85% sensitivity, 64% specificity for the diagnosis. Color Doppler flow in the endometrial canal can increased confidence in the diagnosis, though its absence does not exclude it, as 40% of cases of retained products have little or no flow. The differential in suspected cases includes uterine atony, blood clot, gestational trophoblastic disease, and normal post partum appearance of the uterus. Post partum blood clot is more common, reported in up to 24% of postpartum patients, and tends to be more hypoechoic than retained products with absent color flow on Doppler, and resolving spontaneously on follow up scans. The presence of gas raises the possibility of post partum endometritis, though this can also be seen in up to 21% of normal post pregnancy states. The normal post partum uterus is usually less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm in thickness, and continues to involute on follow up scans to 7&amp;nbsp;mm or less over time. Retained products are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, though it more common following abortions, either elective or spontaneous. There is significant overlap between appearance of a normal post partum uterus and retained products.  If there is no endometrial canal mass or fluid, and endometrial thickness is less than 10&amp;nbsp;mm and without increased flow, retained products are statistically unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=NK|last2=Kim|first2=S|last3=Lee|first3=JW|last4=Sol|first4=YL|last5=Kim|first5=CW|last6=Hyun Sung|first6=K|last7=Jang|first7=HJ|last8=Suh|first8=DS|title=Postpartum hemorrhage: Clinical and radiologic aspects.|journal=European journal of radiology|date=April 2010|volume=74|issue=1|pages=50–9|pmid=19477095|doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.04.062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolman|first1=I|last2=Altman|first2=E|last3=Faith|first3=G|last4=Har-Toov|first4=J|last5=Amster|first5=R|last6=Gull|first6=I|last7=Jaffa|first7=AJ|title=Combined clinical and ultrasonographic work-up for the diagnosis of retained products of conception.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=September 2009|volume=92|issue=3|pages=1162–4|pmid=19249022|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamaya|first1=A|last2=Ro|first2=K|last3=Benedetti|first3=NJ|last4=Chang|first4=PL|last5=Desser|first5=TS|title=Imaging and diagnosis of postpartum complications: sonography and other imaging modalities.|journal=Ultrasound quarterly|date=September 2009|volume=25|issue=3|pages=151–62|pmid=19730078|doi=10.1097/ruq.0b013e3181b5451e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===After medical abortion===
According to the 2006 WHO ''Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion'',&lt;ref name="WHO FAQs 2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=International Consensus Conference on Non-surgical (Medical) Abortion in Early First Trimester on Issues Related to Regimens and Service Delivery |year=2006 |title=Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=92-4-159484-5 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241594845_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of remaining products of conception in the uterus (as detected by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]) after a [[medical abortion]] is ''not'' an indication for surgical intervention (that is, [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[dilation and curettage]]). Remaining products of conception will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes [[anemia]], or if there is evidence of [[endometritis]].

===In delayed miscarriage===
In delayed miscarriage (also called missed abortion), the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:&lt;ref name=thewomens&gt;[http://www.thewomens.org.au/uploads/downloads/HealthProfessionals/CPGs/Miscarriage/CPGMiscarriageManagement_07102010.pdf Clinical Practice Guideline: Miscarriage: Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312134833/http://www.thewomens.org.au/uploads/downloads/HealthProfessionals/CPGs/Miscarriage/CPGMiscarriageManagement_07102010.pdf |date=2011-03-12 }} from [[Royal Women's Hospital]]. Publication date: 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gestational sac]] greater than 30-35mm, embryo larger than ~25mm (corresponding to 9+0 weeks of [[gestational age]]): Surgery is recommended. It poses a high risk of pain and bleeding with passage of products of conception. Alternative methods may still be considered.
* Gestational sac 15-35mm, embryo smaller than 25mm (corresponding to between 7 and 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Medication is recommended. Surgery or expectant management may be considered.
* Gestational sac smaller than 15-20mm, corresponding to a gestational age of less than 7 weeks: Expectant management or medication is preferable. The products of conception may be difficult to find surgically with a considerable risk of failed surgical procedure.

===In incomplete miscarriage===
In incomplete miscarriage, the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:&lt;ref name=thewomens/&gt;
* Retained products of conception smaller than 15mm: Expectant management is generally preferable. There is a high chance of spontaneous expulsion. 
* Retained products of conception measuring between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are recommended. Surgery should only be considered upon specific indication. 
* At retained products of conception measuring over 35 to 50mm, the following measures are recommended:
:*Administration of [[misoprostol]] to hasten passage of products of conception.
:*Admission to [[inpatient]] care for observation for a few hours or overnight until the majority of the products of conception has passed and bleeding subsided.
:*After apparent failure of misoprostol, a gynecologic examination should be done prior to considering surgical evacuation of the uterus or the patient leaving the

[[Hydroelectric power]] is currently the largest producer of renewable electricity in the country, generating around 6.5% of the nation's total electricity in 2016 as well as 45.71% of the total renewable electricity generation.&lt;ref name=EIAmonthlyElectricity /&gt; 
The United States is the [[Hydroelectricity#World hydroelectric capacity|fourth largest producer]] of hydroelectricity in the world after China, Canada and Brazil.

The next largest share of renewable power was provided by [[wind power]] at 5.55% of total power production, amounting to 226.5 [[Terawatt-hour|terawatt-hours]] during 2016.&lt;ref name=EIAmonthlyElectricity /&gt; By January 2017, the United States [[Nameplate capacity|nameplate generating capacity]] for [[Wind power in the United States|wind power]] was 82,183 megawatts (MW).&lt;ref name="aweaQ4_2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/pressreleasev2.aspx?ItemNumber=9812|title=AWEA 2016 Fourth Quarter Market Report|website=AWEA|publisher=American Wind Energy Association|accessdate=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080812/http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/pressreleasev2.aspx?ItemNumber=9812|archive-date=2017-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]] remained firmly established as the leader in wind power deployment, followed by Iowa and Oklahoma as of year end 2016.&lt;ref name="AWE"&gt;American Wind Energy Association, [http://www.awea.org/newsroom/releases/Annual_US_Wind_Power_Rankings_041107.html Annual U.S. wind power rankings track industry's rapid growth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619041553/http://www.awea.org/newsroom/releases/Annual_US_Wind_Power_Rankings_041107.html|date=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Solar power provides a growing share of electricity in the country, with over 50 GW of installed capacity generating about 1.3% of the country's total electricity supply in 2017, up from 0.9% the previous year.
As of 2016, more than 260,000 people worked in the solar industry and 43 states deployed [[net metering]], where energy utilities bought back excess power generated by [[solar array]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/opinion/sunday/the-koch-attack-on-solar-energy.html?_r=0|title=The Koch Attack on Solar Energy|author=Editorial Board|date=26 April 2014|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/national/|title=National Solar Jobs Census|publisher=The Solar Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large [[photovoltaic power plant]]s in the United States include [[Solar Star]] (579 MW), near [[Rosamond, California]], the [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]], a 550 MW [[solar power]] plant in [[Riverside County, California]]&lt;ref name="rew11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects|title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects|date=30 September 2011|work=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Topaz Solar Farm]], a 550 MW [[photovoltaic]] power plant, in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]].&lt;ref name="re11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/12/billionaire-buffett-bets-on-solar-energy|title=Billionaire Buffett Bets on Solar Energy|author=Steve Leone|date=7 December 2011|work=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the United States pioneered [[solar thermal power]] technology in the 1980s with [[The Solar Project|Solar One]], several more such power stations have been built.  
The largest of these solar thermal power stations are the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] (392 MW), southwest of Las Vegas, and the [[SEGS]] group of plants in the Mojave Desert, with a total generating capacity of 354 MW.&lt;ref name="segs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |title=SEGS I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII &amp; IX |website=fplenergy.com |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805074758/http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other renewable energy sources include [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], with [[The Geysers]] in Northern California the largest geothermal complex in the world. 

The development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marked "a new era of energy exploration" in the United States, according to the former President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12475 |title=President Obama Touts Clean Energy on Earth Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429191826/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id%3D12475 |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[joint address to the Congress]] on February 24, 2009, President Obama called for doubling renewable energy within the following three years. Renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011, when it contributed 11.7 % of total national energy production (2.245 quadrillion BTU of energy), surpassing energy production from nuclear power (2.125 quadrillion BTU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanedge.com/sites/default/files/Clean%20Tech%20Nation%20Introduction%20for%20Website.pdf?attachment=true |title=Clean Tech Nation |author=[[Ron Pernick]] and [[Clint Wilder]] |year=2012 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|url=http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0102 |title=Total Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 2012 [[State of the Union]] address, President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Morris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2012/01/obama-sticking-to-promise-of-clean-energy |title=Obama: Sticking to "Promise of Clean Energy" |author=Lindsay Morris |date=25 January 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewables==
Renewable energy technologies encompass a broad, diverse array of technologies, including [[photovoltaics|solar photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal power]] plants and heating/cooling systems, [[wind farm]]s, [[hydroelectricity]], [[geothermal power]] plants, and [[Wave power|ocean power systems]] and the use of [[biomass]].

The report ''[[Outlook On Renewable Energy In America]]'' explains that America needs renewable energy, for many reasons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
America needs energy that is secure, reliable, improves public health, protects the environment, addresses climate change, creates jobs, and provides technological leadership. America needs renewable energy. If renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential, America will need coordinated, sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets; promote and deploy new technology; and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors: wholesale and distributed electricity generation, thermal energy applications, and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;American Council On Renewable Energy, (2007). [http://www.acore.org/pdfs/dl-jointoutlook.pdf ''The Outlook on Renewable Energy in America volume II: Joint Summary Report'']{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 7&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another benefit of some renewable energy technologies, like wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric (fossil fuel based) power plants require vast amounts of water for operation.

In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]] called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of [[energy security]] and [[climate change]]. Those were the first references ever to the nation's energy use, to renewable resources, and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a United States president. President Obama looked to the near future, saying that as a nation, the United States will "harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."&lt;ref name="apps1.eere.energy.gov"&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12194 President Obama Calls for Greater Use of Renewable Energy]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827041912/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id%3D12194 |date=August 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president's ''[[New Energy For America]]'' plan calls for a federal investment of $150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future. Specifically, the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10% of the nation's electricity by 2012, rising to 25% by 2025.&lt;ref name="apps1.eere.energy.gov"/&gt;

In his [[joint address to Congress]] in 2009, Obama stated that: "We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st. century....Thanks to our [[obama recovery plan|recovery plan]], we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years... It is time for America to lead again".&lt;ref name="joint2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress/|title=Remarks of President Barack Obama -- Address to Joint Session of Congress|date=24 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Clean Edge]], there's little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner. The transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood, coal, and oil to natural gas and renewables, is well underway. For much of the developed world, and for developing nations, the "future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency, renewables, the electrification of transport, and lower carbon fuels like natural gas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanedge.com/sites/default/files/CETrends2012_Final_Web.pdf?attachment=true |title=Clean Energy Trends 2012|author=[[Ron Pernick]] |year=2012 |publisher=Clean Edge |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear plant]] have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for “next generation” nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=November 16, 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy accounted for 14.94% of the domestically produced electricity in 2016 in the United States.&lt;ref name=epm&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/pdf/epm.pdf |title=Electric Power Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This proportion has grown from just 7.7% in 2001, although the trend is sometimes obscured by large yearly variations in hydroelectric power generation. 
Most of the growth since 2001 can be seen in the expansion of wind generated power, and more recently, in the growth in solar generated power.
California is a leading state with around 29% of electricity coming from [[Renewable Portfolio Standard|RPS]]-eligible renewable sources (including hydropower).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewables Portfolio Standard Quarterly Report 1st and 2nd Quarter 2012|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/2060A18B-CB42-4B4B-A426-E3BDC01BDCA2/0/2012_Q1Q2_RPSReport.pdf|publisher=California Public Utilities Commission|accessdate=26 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203235208/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/2060A18B-CB42-4B4B-A426-E3BDC01BDCA2/0/2012_Q1Q2_RPSReport.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, with the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation's energy demand. 
A quarter of the country's land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal.&lt;ref name="Cost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4526|title=Renewables Becoming Cost-Competitive With Fossil Fuels in the U.S. |publisher=Worldwatch Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the new technologies that harness renewables — including wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels — are, or soon will be, economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85% of United States energy needs. 
Dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies.&lt;ref name="Cost" /&gt; 
Wind power and solar power are becoming increasingly important relative to the older and more established hydroelectric power source. 
By 2016 wind power covered 37.23% of total renewable electricity production against 43.62 % for hydroelectric power. 
The remaining share of power was generated by biomass at 10.27%, solar power at 6.03% and geothermal with 2.86 % of total renewable generation.

In 2015, [[Georgetown, Texas]] became one of the first American cities to be powered entirely by renewable energy, choosing to do so for financial stability reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/03/07/519064002/texas-city-leads-the-way-on-renewable-energy|title=Texas City Leads The Way On Renewable Energy|website=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States consumed about 4,000 TWh of electricity in 2012, and about 98 quadrillion BTU (30,000 TWh) of primary energy. 
Efficiency improvements are expected to reduce usage to 15,000 TWh by 2050.

Looking only at the renewable fuel sources, a total of 206.2 Gigawatts of renewable would be available by 2019.  This is up 36 Gigawatts (+21.1%) from 2014. Using this generating capability and the capacity factors from 2014 data will result in a total of 627.7 [[terawatt-hour]]s (TWh) of renewable electric energy in 2019. This would be up 89.4 TWh (+16.7%) from 2014.

[[Hydroelectric power]] is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the United States. 
It produced around 6.52% of the nation's total electricity in 2016 which was 43.62% of the total renewable power in the country.&lt;ref name=EIAmonthlyElectricity /&gt; 
The United States is the [[Hydroelectricity#World hydroelectric capacity|fourth largest producer]] of hydroelectricity in the world after China, Canada and Brazil. 
The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] is the 5th [[List of largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydroelectric power station]] in the world and another six U.S. hydroelectric plants are among the 50 largest in the world. 
The amount of hydroelectric power generated is strongly affected by changes in precipitation and surface runoff.
Hydroelectricity projects such as [[Hoover Dam]], Grand Coulee Dam, and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] have become iconic large construction projects.

The United States is one of the world's largest producers of solar power.
The country pioneered solar farms and many key developments in concentrated solar and photovoltaics came out of national research.

In 2016, utility scale solar contributed 36.76 TWh to the grid, with 33.367 TWh from photovoltaics and 3.39 TWh from thermal systems.&lt;ref name="EIAmonthlyElectricity" /&gt; 
In 2014, 2015, and 2016, EIA estimated that distributed solar generated 11.233 TWh, 14.139 TWh and 19.467 TWh respectively.&lt;ref name="EIAmonthlyElectricity" /&gt; 
While utility-grade systems have well documented generation, distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled. 
Therefore, quantitative evaluation of distributed solar to the country's electric power sector has been lacking. 
Recently, the Energy Information Administration has begun estimating that contribution.&lt;ref name=EIAannualElectricity&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|url=http://eia.gov/electricity/annual|title=Electric Power Annual|accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAmonthlyElectricity" /&gt; 
Before 2008, most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems, however by 2011 photovoltaics had overtaken thermal. [[File:2007-2016 Solar Electric Energy with 2014-2015 Estimated Distributed Solar.jpg|thumb|2007-2016 Solar Electric Energy with 2014-2015 Estimated Distributed Solar&lt;ref name=EIAmonthlyElectricity /&gt;]]

Many schools and businesses have [[Building-integrated photovoltaic|building-integrated photovoltaic solar]] panels on their roof. 
Most of these are grid connected and use [[net metering]] laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime. 
New Jersey leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/40483.pdf Million Solar Roofs Initiative] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402135417/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/40483.pdf |date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California decided that it is not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a [[Feed-in Tariff#California|feed-in tariff]].

Tesla and a handful of other companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale [[grid energy storage]] including very large batteries.

Beginning with the 2014 data year,  Energy Information Administration has estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation and distributed solar photovoltaic capacity.&lt;ref name=EIAannualElectricity /&gt;

====Concentrated solar power====
At the end of 2016 there were 1.76 GW total installed capacity of solar thermal power across the United States.&lt;ref name="EIAmonthlyElectricity" /&gt;
Solar thermal power is generally utility-scale.
Prior to 2012, in six southwestern states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) the US Bureau of Land Management owned nearly {{convert|98|e6acre}} (an area larger than the state of Montana) that was open to proposals for solar power installations. 
To streamline consideration of applications, the BLM produced a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). 
By the subsequent Record of Decision in October 2012, the BLM withdrew 78% of its land from possible solar development, leaving {{convert|19|e6acre}} still open to applications for solar installations, an area nearly as large as South Carolina. Of the area left open to solar proposals, the BLM has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls Solar Energy Zones.&lt;ref&gt;US Bureau of Land Management, [http://blmsolar.anl.gov/program/ Solar Energy Program], 29 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solareis.anl.gov/sez/ |title=Solar Energy Zones |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=solareis.anl.gov/sez |publisher=Solar Energy Development PEIS Information Center |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anl.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solareis.anl.gov/maps/|title=Solar PEIS Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anl.gov" /&gt;

Solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. 
Using thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base-load needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf |title=Spain pioneers grid-connected solar-tower thermal power |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184114/http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that utility-scale solar power plants directly disturb an average of 2.7 to 2.9 acres per gigawatt-hour/year, and use from 3.5 to 3.8 acres per gW-hr/year for the entire sites. 
According to a 2009 study, this intensity of land use is less than that of the country's average power plant using surface-mined coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2013/2269 NREL report firms up land-use requirements for solar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907070924/http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2013/2269 |date=2015-09-07 }}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 30 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the land in the eastern portion of the Mojave Desert is to be preserved, but the solar industry is more interested in areas of the western desert, "where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-desert26-2009dec26,0,3513775.story A Mojave power failure A shortfall in Mojave protection bill], ''Los Angeles Times'', editorial, December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the largest solar thermal power plants in the United States are in the south-west of the country, especially in the [[Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert|Mojave Desert]].
[[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS) is the name given to nine [[solar power plants]] in the [[Mojave Desert]] commissioned between 1984 and 1991.&lt;ref name="segs" /&gt;
The installation uses [[parabolic trough]] [[solar thermal]] technology along with [[natural gas]] to generate electricity. 
The facility has a total of 400,000 mirrors and covers 1,000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²).
The plants have a total generating capacity of 354 MW.&lt;ref name="segs" /&gt;

[[Nevada Solar One]] generates 64MW of power and in [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]], [[Nevada]], and was built by the [[U.S. Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]], [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), and Solargenix Energy. Nevada Solar One started producing electricity in June 2007.
Nevada Solar One uses [[Trough concentrator|parabolic troughs]] as [[Solar thermal energy|thermal solar concentrators]], heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers. These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel.  About 19,300 of these 4 metre long tubes are used in the newly built power plant. Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts.  This energy can then be drawn on at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8O1U2D80.htm Nevada: Solar energy advances discussed] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110523081918/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8O1U2D80.htm |date=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal power===
{{Main|Geothermal energy in the United States}}
The United States is the world leader in online capacity and the generation of electricity from geothermal energy.&lt;ref name="Geothermal"&gt;Geothermal Energy Association,  [http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/partner/story?id=48465 6 Million American Households to be Powered by Geothermal Energy, New Survey Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527134625/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/partner/story?id=48465 |date=2007-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to 2014 state energy data, geothermal energy provided approximately 16 [[terawatt-hour]]s (TWh) of electricity, or 0.31% of the total electricity consumed in the country. 
As of May 2007, geothermal electric power was generated in five states: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah.  
According to the [[Geothermal Energy Association]]'s recent report, there were 75 new geothermal power projects underway in 12 states as of May 2007.
This is an increase of 14 projects in an additional three states compared to a survey completed in November 2006.&lt;ref name="Geothermal" /&gt;

The most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the ''[[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]''. 
This Act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit, previously available only to wind power projects. 
It also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and gave the Bureau of Land Management new legal guidance and secure funding to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits.&lt;ref name="Geothermal" /&gt;

===Biomass===
[[File:2016 Profile of US Electric Energy produced by BIOMASS.jpg|thumb|Electricity produced by biomass in 2016]]
In 2015, [[biomass energy|biomass]] generated 63.63 [[terawatt-hour]]s (TWh) of electricity, or 1.56% of the country's total electricity production. 
Biomass was the largest source of renewable primary energy in the US, and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the US, after hydropower and wind.&lt;ref name=EIAmonthlyElectricity /&gt;

Biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories:
# Wood and wood derived fuels including wood/wood waste solids (including paper pellets, railroad ties, utility poles, wood chiips, bark and wood waste solids), wood waste liquids (red liquor, sludge wood, spent sulfite liquor, and other wood based liquids), and black liquor;
# Other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste, [[landfill gas]], sludge waste agricultural byproducts, other biomass solids, other biomass liquids, and other biomass gases (including digester gases, methane, and other biomass gases)

The contribution from these two categories over the last thirteen years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total US power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for 2016. 
This shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs.

===Wave power===
{{Main|Wave Power in the United States}}

Wave power in the United States is under development in several locations off the east and west coasts as well as Hawaii. It has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy. Its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such, the power output is currently modest. But major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Solar water heating==
The U.S. Department of Energy stated (in 2006) that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using [[solar water heating]] in the United States, representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of thermal energy generation. It predicted that another 400 MW was likely to be installed over the next 3–5 years.

Assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the United States have adequate access to sunlight, 29 million solar water heaters could be installed.&lt;ref name="SWH"&gt;Environmental and Energy Study Institute, [http://www.eesi.org/solar_water_0506 Solar water heating]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar water heaters can operate in any climate. Performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site, as well as how cold the water coming into the system is. The colder the water, the more efficiently the system operates.&lt;ref name="SWH" /&gt; 
 
Solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings. Compared to those with electric water heaters, Florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills, according to the Florida Solar Energy Center.&lt;ref name="SWH" /&gt;

==Biofuels==
[[Image:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California.]]

{{Main|Biofuel in the United States}}
Many cars sold in the U.S. since 2001 are able to run on blends of up to 15% [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol Fuel Basics [https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/ethanol_fuel_basics.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Older cars in the United States can run on blends of up to 10% [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]]. Motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million E85-compatible vehicles on the road.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Worldwatch Institute and Center for American Progress (2006). [http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf ''American energy: The renewable path to energy security'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety-five percent of gasoline sold in the U.S.(2016) is blended with 10% ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol Opportunities and Challenges: A State-by-State Look at Higher Blends [https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/ethanol-opportunities-and-challenges-a-state-by-state-look-at-higher-blends]&lt;/ref&gt; There are challenges in moving to higher blends, however. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The ''[[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]]'', which calls for {{convert|15.2|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; The USDA in 2015 began offering grants to help gasoline retailers install blender pumps for dispensing mid-level ethanol blends.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-blender-pump-grants-aimed-at-increasing-availability-of-mid-level-blen USDA Blender Pump Grants Aimed at Increasing Availability of Mid-Level Blends]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expanding ethanol and [[biodiesel]] industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; On the other hand, in 2010, the biofuel industry received $6.64 billion in federal government support.&lt;ref name="EIA2010"&gt;{{cite web

==Renewable energy research==
There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 |author1=S.C.E. Jupe |author2=A. Michiorri |author3=P.C. Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), both of which are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and supported by various corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/redmesa/|title=Defense-scale supercomputing comes to renewable energy research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|title=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170422/http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NREL has a budget of $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;*Chakrabarty, Gargi, April 16th, 2009. "Stimulus leaves NREL in cold" ''Denver Post"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. [[British Petroleum]] was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chumley|first=Cheryl|title=BP Gives Up on Solar Power|url=http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2012/02/02/bp-gives-solar-power|work=Heartlander Magazine|publisher=Heartlander Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_12151611|title= Stimulus leaves NREL in cold|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and develops research projects in the areas of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/solar/|title=Solar Research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The budget for Sandia’s solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s $2.4 billion budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=2727 |title=Photovoltaics|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at [[University of North Carolina]] (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology.  In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining. 
In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation [[Siemens]], announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/breakthrough-worlds-most-efficient-solar-panel/12800 |title=Breakthrough: World’s most efficient solar panel|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=SmartPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when [[NASA]] developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/technologies/wind_turbines.html |title=Wind energy research reaps rewards|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have programs dedicated to wind research. Sandia’s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials, aerodynamics, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=344 |title=Wind energy |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production, reducing their capital costs, and making wind energy more cost effective overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrel.gov/wind |title=Wind research|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) at [[Caltech]] was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost, size, and environmental impact of wind energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|title=Wind resource evaluation at the Caltech Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE)|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Caltech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030309/http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. On the Federal level, the [[USDA]] conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of [[cellulosic ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |title=Research Advantages: Cellulosic Ethanol |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125101249/http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cellulosic ethanol]] has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Net energy of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | pages = 464–469 |author1=M.R.

==Public opinion==

A 2010 survey conducted by [[Applied Materials]] shows that two-thirds of Americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the country's energy needs. In addition, "three-quarters of Americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil are the country's top energy priorities". According to the survey, "67 percent of Americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/06/americans-willing-to-pay-more-for-solar Americans Willing To Pay More for Solar] ''Renewable Energy World'', 25 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] public opinion survey, an overwhelming 91 percent believed "investing in renewable energy" is important for the United States to remain economically competitive with other countries, with 62 percent considering this very important. The same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports. Eight in ten (80 percent) favored tax incentives, 47 percent strongly, and only 17 percent were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |title=Large Majorities in US and Europe Endorse Focus on Renewable Energy |date=January 18, 2012 |work=World Public Opinion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315003300/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] ( 2010 ) in the public opinion survey also found that approximately 65% of the Americans supported increased [[Fuel efficiency|'''fuel efficiencies''']] of the products of the auto makers , irrespective of the price escalation that would be associated with the implementation .

Public Surveys conducted by [http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/ '''WPO'''] in 2008 also revealed that 79% of the Americans were of the notion that a major shift to alternative sources of energy is economically beneficial in the long run .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org:80/content/publications/attachments/2011_USPOPCH13bEnergy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy and promotion==
Energy technologies receive government subsidies. 
In 2013, federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear power were $15.043 billion, $3.431 billion and $1.66 billion respectively. 
The subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to $11.678 billion, $1.591 billion and $1.66 billion respectively.&lt;ref name="EIA2013" /&gt;
All but a few U.S. states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy, while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years.{{when|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref name="Cost" /&gt; 
Renewable energy suffered a political setback in the United States in September 2011 with the bankruptcy of [[Solyndra]], a company that had received a $535 million federal loan guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html|title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production|author=John Broder|date=October 10, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-09-12/u-s-rejected-solyndra-restructuring-before-company-s-shutdown-memo-says|title=U.S. Rejected Solyndra Restructuring Before Shutdown, Memo Says|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] requires all [[public electric utility|public electric utilities]] to facilitate [[net metering]].&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/states/alternatives/net_metering.cfm |title=Net Metering|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521131550/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/states/alternatives/net_metering.cfm|archivedate= 21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows homes and businesses performing [[distributed generation]] to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid: electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid.  For intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps.

Some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted [[feed-in tariff]], which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally.

From 2006-14, US households received more than $18 billion in federal income [[tax credit]]s for [[weatherization|weatherizing]] their homes, installing solar panels, buying hybrid and electric vehicles, and other "clean energy" investments. These tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income Americans. The bottom three income quintiles received about 10% of all credits, while the top quintile received about 60%. The most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles, where the top income quintile received about 90% of all credits. Market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Working Paper Abstract 257 – Energy Institute at Haas - University of California Berkeley, Haas School of Business|url = http://ei.haas.berkeley.edu/research/abstracts/abstract_wp262.html|website = ei.haas.berkeley.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] included more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for [[clean energy]] and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in United States history for [[renewable energy]], advanced transportation, and [[energy conservation]] initiatives. These new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;[[Clean Edge]] (2009).

In his January 24, 2012, [[State of the Union]] address, President [[Barack Obama]] restated his commitment to renewable energy, stating that he “will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.” Obama called for a commitment by the [[Defence minister|Defense Department]] to purchase 1,000 MW of renewable energy. He also mentioned the long-standing [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] commitment to permit 10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Morris" /&gt;

Some [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] facilities in the United States use renewable energy for all or part of their supply at the following facilities.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/energy/renewtech.htm Onsite Renewable Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiatives ===

==== SunShot ====
In February 2011, the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) launched its SunShot initiative, a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/1724131/forget-the-moonshot-the-does-sunshot-program-aims-to-reach-cost-competitive-solar-by-2020 DOE's SunShot Program Aims to Reach Competitive Solar By 2020.]  Fast Company, Feb. 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity and get [[grid parity]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/about.html |title=SunShot Initiative About page, Accessed Jan. 20, 2012 |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SunShot initiative included a crowdsourced innovation program run in partnership with [[TopCoder|Topcoder]], during which 17 different solar energy application solutions were developed in 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crowdsourcing.topcoder.com/project/us-department-of-energy-sunshot/|title=Sunshot Catalyst Challenge Series on Topcoder|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the price was $4/W, and the SunShot goal of $1/W by 2020 was reached in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Sunshot-1-Per-Watt-Solar-Cost-Goal-Mission-Accomplished-Years-Ahead-of-S |title=SunShot $1 per Watt Solar Cost Goal: Mission Accomplished, Years Ahead of Schedule|publisher= |date=2017-01-25 |accessdate=2017-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind Powering America====
[[Wind Powering America Initiative|Wind Powering America]] (WPA) is another DOE initiative that seeks to increase the use of wind energy. WPA collaborates with state and regional stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, Native Americans, rural electric cooperatives, consumer-owned utilities and schools.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

WPA has focused on states with strong potential for wind energy generation but with few operational projects. WPA provides information about the challenges, benefits, and impacts of wind technology implementation.

==== Solar America Initiative ====
The [[Solar power in the United States|Solar America Initiative]] (SAI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/ EERE: Solar Energy Technologies Program Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;][ {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219172335/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/ |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a part of the Federal [[Advanced Energy Initiative]] to accelerate the development of advanced photovoltaic materials with the goal of making it cost-competitive with other forms of [[renewable electricity]] by 2015.

The DOE Solar Energy Technology Program (SETP) intended to achieve the goals of the SAI through partnerships and strategic alliances by focusing primarily on four areas:

*[[market transformation|Market Transformation]] — activities that address marketplace barriers
*Device and Process Proof of Concept — R&amp;D activities that address novel devices or processes with significant performance or cost advantages
*Component Prototype and Pilot-Scale Production — R&amp;D activities emphasizing development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) components or systems at pilot-scale with demonstrated cost, reliability or performance advantages
*System Development and Manufacturing — collaborative R&amp;D activities among industry and university partners

====California Solar Initiative====
{{Main|California Solar Initiative}}

As part of former Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s Million Solar Roofs Program, California set a goal to create 3,000 megawatts of new, solar-produced electricity by 2017, with funding of $2.8 billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;California Public Utilities Commission, [http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/puc/energy/solar/aboutsolar.htm The California Solar Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307050146/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Solar/aboutsolar.htm |date=2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Solar Initiative]] offers cash incentives on solar PV systems of up to $2.50 a watt. These incentives, combined with federal tax incentives, can cover up to 50% of the total cost of a solar panel system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; Financial incentives to support renewable energy are available in some other US states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, [http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentivenew.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=3&amp;EE=0&amp;RE=1 Financial Incentives in the USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109180330/http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentivenew.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=3&amp;EE=0&amp;RE=1 |date=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Green Power Partnership ====
{{main|Green Power Partnership}}
The EPA named the top 20 partners in its Green Power Partnership that are generating their own renewable energy on-site. Combined, they generate more than 736 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy on-site each year, enough to power more than 61,000 average U.S. homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacsd.org/|title=LACSD Website - Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renewable portfolio standards====
A [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]] refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates. Electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity (portfolio) from renewable generation sources. Liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market.

==Renewable energy organizations==
The [[American Council on Renewable Energy]] (ACORE), is a non-profit organization with headquarters in [[Washington DC]].  It was founded in 2001 as a unifying forum for bringing renewable energy into the mainstream of American’s economy and lifestyle. In 2010 ACORE had over 700 member organizations.&lt;ref&gt;American Council on Renewable Energy, [http://www.acore.org/membership/membership_benefits Member Benefits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204092045/http://www.acore.org/membership/membership_benefits |date=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ACORE published [[Outlook On Renewable Energy In America]], a two volume report about the future of renewable energy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;American Council On Renewable Energy, (2007).

'''Rutilated quartz''' is a variety of [[quartz]] which contains [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] (needle-like) [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s of [[rutile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?mineral=Rutilquarz |title=Rutilquarz |editor=Mineralienatlas – Fossilienatlas |accessdate=September 21, 2017 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for [[gemstone]]s. These inclusions mostly look golden, but they also can look silver, copper red or deep black. They can be distributed randomly or in bundles, which sometimes are arranged star-like, and they can be sparse or dense enough to make the quartz body nearly opaque.

'''Solid surface''' is a man-made material usually composed of a combination of alumina trihydrate (ATH), [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]], [[Epoxy resin|epoxy]] or [[polyester]] [[resin]]s and [[pigment]]s.  It is most frequently used for seamless [[countertop]] installations.

[[File:Solid Surface Top Seamless Integral Kitchen Sink.JPG|thumb|Solid Surface Top Seamless Integral Kitchen Sink]] [[File:Integral Cove Slash with Wall Panel.JPG|thumb|Integral Cove Slash with Wall Panel]]

Solid surface was first introduced by [[DuPont]] in 1967 under the name of [[Corian]]. Since the expiration of their patent, other manufacturers have also introduced their brands as well. 

==Performance characteristics==
Solid surface is a non-porous low-maintenance material used for surfaces such as countertops. It can mimic the appearance of [[granite]], [[marble]], [[stone]], and other naturally occurring materials, and can be joined nearly  invisibly by a trained craftsman. Typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops, solid surface can also be cast into a variety of shapes, including [[sink]]s, [[shower]] pans and [[bathtub]]s. Sheet goods can also be heated and bent into three-dimensional shapes using a process called [[thermoforming]], which adds to the versatility of the product. Color and design flexibility are key factors when choosing engineered composites over natural stone.

In a residential setting, solid surface can be used as [[kitchen]] countertops, [[bathroom]] vanity tops, and shower and tub surrounds. Countertop fabricators typically join solid surface sheets into desired shapes using a two-part [[adhesive]], after which the cured joint is machined flat. The same method is used to build up edge thickness, which can be profiled using tools and techniques similar to those used to work [[hardwood]]s.

A major appeal of solid surface is its impermeability. Solid surface sinks can be joined to the countertop surface with no gaps, which eliminates areas for water to collect and [[bacteria]] to grow. Integral backsplashes can also be created that follow the contours of the wall “seamlessly” and without gaps.

Should the material become scratched or broken, solid surface can, in most cases, be repaired quickly by a certified solid surface repair company or trained fabricator. Cracked sinks can be replaced as well.  Because the surface is solid throughout, a countertop that has undergone years of [[wear and tear]] can be refinished. The installed product is available in a variety of finishes, ranging from [[Matte finish|matte]] to high-gloss, although most manufacturers recommend a matte or satin finish for ease of maintenance.

==Availability==
Solid surface is available in hundreds of colors and visual textures, ranging from solid colors to sparkling, [[Marbleizing|marbleized]], or [[granite]] effect. Dozens of multinational companies manufacture solid surface sheet goods and sinks for the world market; and hundreds of smaller, regional manufacturers produce for local markets. 

Although solid surface faces competition from [[natural stone]] and [[engineered stone|engineered stone/quartz]] surfacing, the material is popular in [[Asia]], particularly in residential new construction. An emerging market for solid surface is in commercial and industrial settings, where its non-porous characteristics, combined with durability, renewability and formability make it the material of choice for many [[designer]]s and [[architect]]s. Also appealing, is the wide range of colors and textures, as well as the ability to custom-color the material for large projects. [[Hospital]]s, in particular, employ large amounts of solid surface for sinks, showers, [[nursing station]]s and wall [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], because its seamless properties eliminate gaps and crevices that harbor harmful bacteria.

== Manufacture ==

Solid surface is manufactured by mixing [[acryl]]ic, [[epoxide]] or [[polyester]] [[resin]] with powdered [[bauxite]] [[Filler (materials)|filler]] and [[pigments]]. The material chemically cures and is heated to 60°C or more. Cured material is then cut in sheets or shapes and [[Sanding|sanded]] on one or both sides depending the brand used. Sometimes the material is brought to 160°C and cooled, to improve its heat resistance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.berndorfband-group.com/en/products/belt-systems/steel-belt-caster/artificial-marble/ | title = Steel belt casting and drying system for the production of solid surface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be mixed one sheet at a time using different formulations, effects and appearances. Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be injected into molds to produce various solid decorative design figures.

Solid-surface manufacturing companies may be members of the [[trade organization]]s [[American Composites Manufacturers Association]], ISFA (International Surface Fabricators Association, and ICPA (International Cast Polymer Association).&lt;ref&gt;[http://theicpa.com/ International Cast Polymer Association]&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations identify the product under the "brand" of MasterCast Engineered Composites.

Solid surface can also be moulded using dedicated moulds. For example free standing baths are manufactured using a 2-part mould tool which creates a cavity for the material to be poured into. Once the mould has been prepared for casting, the material is mixed and degassed in an automated casting machine. It is then injected into the cavity of the mould. Many finishes are available including, gel coated, matte, gloss, metallic and textured.

==Fabrication==
A ''surface fabricator'' shapes and installs functional and decorative surfaces, usually in buildings.  Surface fabrication, as a distinct professional enterprise, usually involves complex tasks of surface shaping. A leading case is [[countertop]] fabrication.

===Materials===
For interior spaces, surfaces include solid coverings or decking for floors or walls, and countertops for kitchens, bathrooms, and workspaces. Natural surfaces are composed of naturally occurring materials like wood, stone, mineral, clay, gum and resin. Synthetic surfaces contain, in addition to any natural materials, man-made substances such as metal alloys or polymers. Solid surfaces are synthetic surfaces manufactured from polymeric materials.

=== Tools ===
Tools of surface fabrication include [[Router (woodworking)|routers]], [[drill]]s, [[:wikt:template|template]]s, [[Clamp (tool)|clamps]], [[oven]]s, [[Suction cup|suction cup grips]], and [[table saw]]s. Larger surface fabricators may also use [[CNC Router|CNC routers]].  For all but the simplest jobs, surface fabrication usually takes place in the workshop, after which the finished product is assembled and installed at the work site. Installation of multi-part surfaces, such as "L" and "U" shaped countertops, often involves complex work with specialized tools, to create a seamless result.

==Applications==
Solid surfaces is used in the following environment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://extremehowto.com/creative-use-of-solid-surface/| title = Creative use of solid surface}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
*'''Kitchen/Bathroom''': kitchen worktops with integrated sink, vanity countertop, bath tub etc.
*'''Hospitality/Catering''': bars, tables, [[reception desk]]s etc.
*'''Shop Fitting''': displays, counters, wall cladding etc.
*'''Airports''': check-in counters
*'''Public buildings''': displays in [[museum]]s, facades, meeting tables etc.
*'''Hospitals''': laboratory countertops, [[decontamination]] sinks, [[endoscopy]] etc.

Solid surface is priced to compete with natural stone or quartz surfacing. It is available in  many colors and  patterns.  The material can be formed to shape, which makes it  appealing to commercial and [[industrial design]]ers. Specialist fabricators possess the skills and knowledge necessary to provide advice and customer service. 

Certain high-heat applications (anything above 400 F /200 C) are discouraged, due to the danger of cracking. Because scratches in solid surface appear white to the human eye, most dark colors are not recommended for high use areas.

==Related materials==
*[[Engineered stone]] uses quartz powder and pigments and generally requires different tools from those used with solid surface materials.
*[[Epoxy granite]]

[[File:The life cycle of a Sun-like star.ogv|thumb|300px|The life cycle of a Sun-like star]]
[[Image:The life of Sun-like stars.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's depiction of the life cycle of a Sun-like star, starting as a main-sequence star at lower left then expanding through the [[subgiant]] and [[giant star|giant]] phases, until its outer envelope is expelled to form a [[planetary nebula]] at upper right]]
[[File:Star Life Cycle Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|Complete chart of stellar evolution]]
'''Stellar evolution''' is the process by which a [[star]] changes over the course of time. Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the [[age of the universe]]. The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlos A. | last=Bertulani |authorlink=Carlos Bertulani | title=Nuclei in the Cosmos | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4417-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All stars are born from [[Gravitational collapse|collapsing]] clouds of gas and dust, often called [[nebula]]e or [[molecular cloud]]s. Over the course of millions of years, these [[protostar]]s settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star.

[[Nuclear fusion]] powers a star for most of its life. Initially the energy is generated by the fusion of [[hydrogen atoms]] at the core of the main-sequence star. Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes [[helium]], stars like the [[Sun]] begin to fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell surrounding the core. This process causes the star to gradually grow in size, passing through the [[subgiant]] stage until it reaches the [[red giant]] phase. Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to generate energy through the fusion of helium at their core, whereas more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric shells. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core collapses into a dense [[white dwarf]] and the outer layers are expelled as a [[planetary nebula]]. Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun can explode in a [[supernova]] as their inert iron cores collapse into an extremely dense [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]. Although the [[universe]] is not old enough for any of the smallest [[red dwarf]]s to have reached the end of their lives, [[stellar model]]s suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter before running out of hydrogen fuel and becoming low-mass white dwarfs.&lt;ref name=endms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laughlin | first1 = Gregory | last2 = Bodenheimer | first2 = Peter | last3 = Adams | first3 = Fred C. | date = 1997 | title = The End of the Main Sequence | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 482 | pages = 420–432 | doi = 10.1086/304125 | bibcode=1997ApJ...482..420L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stellar evolution is not studied by observing the life of a single star, as most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, even over many centuries. Instead, [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]] come to understand how stars evolve by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating [[stellar structure]] using [[computer model]]s.

==Birth of a star==
[[File:Starlifesimple.png|thumb|400px|Simplistic representation of the stages of stellar evolution]]
[[Image:Stellar evolution L vs T.png|thumb|300px|Schematic of stellar evolution.]]
{{Main|Star formation}}

===Protostar===
{{Main|Protostar}}
Stellar evolution starts with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a [[giant molecular cloud]]. Typical giant molecular clouds are roughly {{convert|100|ly|km}} across and contain up to {{convert|6000000|solar mass|kg|lk=on}}. As it collapses, a giant molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas releases [[Gravitational_potential|gravitational potential energy]] as heat. As its temperature and pressure increase, a fragment condenses into a rotating sphere of superhot gas known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prialnik|2000|loc=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protostar continues to grow by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of gas and dust from the molecular cloud, becoming a [[pre-main-sequence star]] as it reaches its final mass. Further development is determined by its mass. Mass is typically compared to the mass of the [[Sun]]: {{convert|1.0|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}} means 1 solar mass.

[[Protostar]]s are encompassed in dust, and are thus more readily visible at [[infrared]] wavelengths.
Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been especially important for unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their parent [[star cluster]]s.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/ |title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma2013&gt;Majaess, D. (2013). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Ap%26SS.344..175M ''Discovering protostars and their host clusters via WISE''], ApSS, 344, 1 ([http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J%2Fother%2FApSS%2F344%2E175 ''VizieR catalog''])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brown dwarfs and sub-stellar objects===
{{main|Brown dwarf}}
Protostars with masses less than roughly {{convert|0.08|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}} never reach temperatures high enough for [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen to begin. These are known as [[brown dwarf]]s. The [[International Astronomical Union]] defines brown dwarfs as stars massive enough to [[deuterium burning|fuse deuterium]] at some point in their lives (13 [[Jupiter mass]]es ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}), 2.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, or {{Solar mass|0.0125}}). Objects smaller than {{Jupiter mass|13}} are classified as sub-brown dwarfs (but if they orbit around another stellar object they are classified as planets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets: Definition of a "Planet" |work=IAU position statement |date=2003-02-28 |url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |accessdate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204173630/http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |archivedate=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types, deuterium-burning and not, shine dimly and die away slowly, cooling gradually over hundreds of millions of years.

[[Image:Sagittarius Star Cloud.jpg|thumb|left|A dense starfield in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]]]

===Main sequence===
{{main|Main sequence}}
For a more-massive protostar, the core temperature will eventually reach 10 million [[kelvin]], initiating the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] and allowing [[hydrogen]] to fuse, first to [[deuterium]] and then to [[helium]]. In stars of slightly over {{convert|1|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}}, the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen fusion reaction ([[CNO cycle]]) contributes a large portion of the energy generation. The onset of nuclear fusion leads relatively quickly to a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] in which energy released by the core maintains a high gas pressure, balancing the weight of the star's matter and preventing further gravitational collapse. The star thus evolves rapidly to a stable state, beginning the [[main sequence|main-sequence]] phase of its evolution.

A new star will sit at a specific point on the main sequence of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], with the main-sequence [[spectral type]] depending upon the mass of the star. Small, relatively cold, low-mass [[red dwarf]]s fuse hydrogen slowly and will remain on the main sequence for hundreds of billions of years or longer, whereas massive, hot [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type stars]] will leave the main sequence after just a few million years. A mid-sized [[G-type main-sequence star|yellow dwarf]] star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years. The Sun is thought to be in the middle of its main sequence lifespan.

==Mature stars==
Eventually the core exhausts its supply of hydrogen and the star begins to evolve off of the [[main sequence]],  without the outward [[pressure]] generated by the fusion of hydrogen to counteract the force of [[gravity]] the core contracts until either [[electron degeneracy pressure]] becomes sufficient to oppose gravity or the core becomes hot enough (around 100 MK) for [[helium fusion]] to begin. Which of these happens first depends upon the star's mass.

===Low-mass stars===
What happens after a low-mass star ceases to produce energy through fusion has not been directly observed; the [[universe]] is around 13.8 billion years old, which is less time (by several orders of magnitude, in some cases) than it takes for fusion to cease in such stars.

Recent astrophysical models suggest that [[red dwarf]]s of {{Solar mass|0.1}} may stay on the main sequence for some six to twelve trillion years, gradually increasing in both [[temperature]] and [[luminosity]], and take several hundred billion more to collapse, slowly, into a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T 22"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Smallest Stars Stay Small| journal=Sky &amp; Telescope|date=November 1997| issue=22| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Astronomische Nachrichten| volume= 326| issue=10| pages= 913–919| date= 2005| title=M dwarfs: planet formation and long term evolution| first=F.

Laughlin|bibcode=2005AN....326..913A|doi=10.1002/asna.200510440| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such stars will not become red giants as they are fully convective and will not develop a degenerate helium core with a shell burning hydrogen.  Instead, hydrogen fusion will proceed until almost the whole star is helium.

To the left a '''low-mass''' [[red dwarf]], in the center a '''mid-sized''' [[yellow dwarf]] and at the right a '''massive''' blue-white main-sequence star.]]

Slightly more [[massive star]]s do expand into [[red giant]]s, but their helium cores are not massive enough to reach the temperatures required for helium fusion so they never reach the tip of the red giant branch.  When hydrogen shell burning finishes, these stars move directly off the red giant branch like a post-[[Asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] (AGB) star, but at lower luminosity, to become a white dwarf.&lt;ref name="endms" /&gt;  A star with an initial mass above about {{Solar mass|0.8}} will be able to reach temperatures high enough to fuse helium, and these "mid-sized" stars go on to further stages of evolution beyond the red giant branch.&lt;ref name="lejeune"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lejeune|first1=T|last2=Schaerer|first2=D|year=2001|title=Database of Geneva stellar evolution tracks and isochrones for &lt;math&gt;(UBV)_\mathsf{J}(RI)_\mathsf{C} JHKLL'M&lt;/math&gt;, HST-WFPC2, Geneva and Washington photometric systems|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=366|issue=2|pages=538|bibcode=2001A&amp;A...366..538L|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000214|arxiv=astro-ph/0011497}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

===Mid-sized stars===
[[File:Evolutionary track 1m.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|The evolutionary track of a solar mass, solar metallicity, star from main sequence to post-AGB]]
Stars of roughly {{Solar mass|0.8–10}} become [[red giant]]s, which are large non-[[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars of [[stellar classification]] K or M. Red giants lie along the right edge of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram due to their red color and large luminosity. Examples include [[Aldebaran]] in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Arcturus]] in the constellation of [[Boötes]].

Mid-sized stars are red giants during two different phases of their post-main-sequence evolution: red-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of helium and hydrogen-burning shells, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of carbon and helium-burning shells inside the hydrogen-burning shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between these two phases, stars spend a period on the [[horizontal branch]] with a helium-fusing core.  Many of these helium-fusing stars cluster towards the cool end of the horizontal branch as K-type giants and are referred to as [[red clump]] giants.

====Subgiant phase====
{{main|Subgiant}}
When a star exhausts the hydrogen in its core, it leaves the main sequence and begins to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the core.  The core increases in mass as the shell produces more helium.  Depending on the mass of the helium core, this continues for several million to one or two billion years, with the star expanding and cooling at a similar or slightly lower luminosity to its main sequence state.  Eventually either the core becomes degenerate, in stars around the mass of the sun, or the outer layers cool sufficiently to become opaque, in more massive stars.  Either of these changes cause the hydrogen shell to increase in temperature and the luminosity of the star to increase, at which point the star expands onto the red giant branch.&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryan|Norton|2010|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red-giant-branch phase====
{{main|Red giant branch}}
[[File:Stellar Evolution (0.8-8 M☉).jpg|thumb|400px|right|Typical stellar evolution for 0.8-8 M☉]]
The expanding outer layers of the star are [[convection|convective]], with the material being mixed by turbulence from near the fusing regions up to the surface of the star.  For all but the lowest-mass stars, the fused material has remained deep in the stellar interior prior to this point, so the convecting envelope makes fusion products visible at the star's surface for the first time. At this stage of evolution, the results are subtle, with the largest effects, alterations to the [[isotopes]] of hydrogen and helium, being unobservable. The effects of the [[CNO cycle]] appear at the surface during the first [[dredge-up]], with lower &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios and altered proportions of carbon and nitrogen. These are detectable with [[spectroscopy]] and have been measured for many evolved stars.

The helium core continues to grow on the red giant branch.  It is no longer in thermal equilibrium, either degenerate or above the [[Schoenberg-Chandrasekhar limit]], so it increases in temperature which causes the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell to increase.  The star increases in luminosity towards the [[tip of the red-giant branch]].  Red giant branch stars with a degenerate helium core all reach the tip with very similar core masses and very similar luminosities, although the more massive of the red giants become hot enough to ignite helium fusion before that point.

====Horizontal branch====
{{main|Horizontal branch|Red clump}}
In the helium cores of stars in the 0.8 to 2.0 solar mass range, which are largely supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], helium fusion will ignite on a timescale of days in a [[helium flash]]. In the nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryan|Norton|2010|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very large, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115" /&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]) for a few seconds.&lt;ref name="Prialnik151"&gt;{{harvtxt|Prialnik|2000|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the energy is consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star.&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prialnik151" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deupree1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1=R.

The star contracts, although not all the way to the main sequence, and it migrates to the [[horizontal branch]] on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing its surface temperature.

Core helium flash stars evolve to the red end of the horizontal branch but do not migrate to higher temperatures before they gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning.  These stars are often observed as a [[red clump]] of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants. Higher-mass stars with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch to higher temperatures, some becoming unstable pulsating stars in the yellow [[instability strip]] ([[RR Lyrae variables]]), whereas some become even hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the horizontal branch. The morphology of the horizontal branch depends on parameters such as metallicity, age, and helium content, but the exact details are still being modelled.&lt;ref name=parameters&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gratton | first1 = R.

====Asymptotic-giant-branch phase====
{{main|Asymptotic giant branch}}
After a star has consumed the helium at the core, hydrogen and helium fusion continues in shells around a hot core of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. The star follows the [[asymptotic giant branch]] on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, paralleling the original red giant evolution, but with even faster energy generation (which lasts for a shorter time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sackmann | first1 = I. -J. | last2 = Boothroyd | first2 = A.

Helium from these hydrogen burning shells drops towards the center of the star and periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases dramatically.  This is known as a [[thermal pulse]] and they occur towards the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, sometimes even into the post-asymptotic-giant-branch phase. Depending on mass and composition, there may be several to hundreds of thermal pulses.

There is a phase on the ascent of the asymptotic-giant-branch where a deep convective zone forms and can bring carbon from the core to the surface.  This is known as the second dredge up, and in some stars there may even be a third dredge up.  In this way a [[carbon star]] is formed, very cool and strongly reddened stars showing strong carbon lines in their spectra.  A process known as hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and nitrogen before it can be dredged to the surface, and the interaction between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra of carbon stars in particular clusters.&lt;ref name=hbb&gt;{{cite journal|author1=van Loon|author2=Zijlstra|author3=Whitelock|author4=Peter te Lintel Hekkert|author5=Chapman|author6=Cecile Loup|author7=Groenewegen|author8=Waters|author9=Trams|title=Obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars in the Magellanic Clouds IV.

Another well known class of asymptotic-giant-branch stars are the [[Mira variables]], which pulsate with well-defined periods of tens to hundreds of days and large amplitudes up to about 10 magnitudes (in the visual, total luminosity changes by a much smaller amount). In more-massive stars the stars become more luminous and the pulsation period is longer, leading to enhanced mass loss, and the stars become heavily obscured at visual wavelengths.  These stars can be observed as [[OH/IR star]]s, pulsating in the infra-red and showing OH [[maser]] activity.  These stars are clearly oxygen rich, in contrast to the carbon stars, but both must be produced by dredge ups.

====Post-AGB====
{{main|Post-AGB}}
[[Image:NGC6543.jpg|thumb|The [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], a [[planetary nebula]] formed by the death of a star with about the same mass as the Sun]]
These mid-range stars ultimately reach the tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning. They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly [[oxygen]] or [[carbon]] enriched, depending on the type of the star. The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a [[circumstellar envelope]] and cools as it moves away from the star, allowing [[Circumstellar dust|dust particles]] and molecules to form. With the high infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for [[Astrophysical maser|maser]] excitation.

It is possible for thermal pulses to be produced once post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution has begun, producing a variety of unusual and poorly understood stars known as born-again asymptotic-giant-branch stars.&lt;ref name=bornagain&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1991IAUS..145..363H|title=Atmospheres and Abundances of Blue Horizontal Branch Stars and Related Objects|journal=Evolution of Stars: the Photospheric Abundance Connection: Proceedings of the 145th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union|volume=145|pages=363|author1=Heber|first1=U.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may result in extreme [[horizontal-branch]] stars ([[subdwarf B star]]s), hydrogen deficient post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, variable planetary nebula central stars, and [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s.

===Massive stars===
{{main|Supergiant}}
[[Image:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed image of [[Antares]], a red supergiant]]
In massive stars, the core is already large enough at the onset of the hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent. Thus, when these stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as much as lower-mass stars; however, they were much brighter than lower-mass stars to begin with, and are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less-massive stars. These stars are unlikely to survive as red [[supergiant]]s; instead they will destroy themselves as [[type II supernova]]s.

Extremely massive stars (more than approximately {{Solar mass|40}}), which are very luminous and thus have very rapid stellar winds, lose mass so rapidly due to radiation pressure that they tend to strip off their own envelopes before they can expand to become red supergiants, and thus retain extremely high surface temperatures (and blue-white color) from their main-sequence time onwards. The largest stars of the current generation are about {{Solar mass|100-150}} because the outer layers would be expelled by the extreme radiation. Although lower-mass stars normally do not burn off their outer layers so rapidly, they can likewise avoid becoming red giants or red supergiants if they are in binary systems close enough so that the companion star strips off the envelope as it expands, or if they rotate rapidly enough so that convection extends all the way from the core to the surface, resulting in the absence of a separate core and envelope due to thorough mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D. Vanbeveren | title=Massive stars | journal=The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review | date=1998 | volume=9 | issue=1–2 | pages=63–152 | doi=10.1007/s001590050015 | last2=De Loore | first2=C. | last3=Van Rensbergen | first3=W. | bibcode = 1998A&amp;ARv...9...63V | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core grows hotter and denser as it gains material from fusion of hydrogen at the base of the envelope. In all massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt collapse by itself, so as each major element is consumed in the center, progressively heavier elements ignite, temporarily halting collapse. If the core of the star is not too massive (less than approximately {{Solar mass|1.4}}, taking into account mass loss that has occurred by this time), it may then form a white dwarf (possibly surrounded by a planetary nebula) as described above for less-massive stars, with the difference that the white dwarf is composed chiefly of oxygen, [[neon]], and [[magnesium]].

[[Image:Evolved star fusion shells.svg|right|320px|thumb|The onion-like layers of a massive, evolved star just before core collapse. (Not to scale.)]]

Above a certain mass (estimated at approximately {{Solar mass|2.5}} and whose star's progenitor was around {{Solar mass|10}}), the core will reach the temperature (approximately 1.1 gigakelvins) at which neon [[Neon-burning process|partially breaks down]] to form oxygen and helium, the latter of which immediately fuses with some of the remaining neon to form magnesium; then [[Oxygen-burning process|oxygen fuses]] to form [[sulfur]], [[silicon]], and smaller amounts of other elements. Finally, the temperature gets high enough that any nucleus can be [[Photodisintegration|partially broken down]], most commonly releasing an alpha particle (helium nucleus) which [[Alpha process|immediately fuses with another nucleus]], so that several nuclei are effectively rearranged into a smaller number of heavier nuclei, with net release of energy because the addition of fragments to nuclei exceeds the energy required to break them off the parent nuclei.

A star with a core mass too great to form a white dwarf but insufficient to achieve sustained conversion of neon to oxygen and magnesium, will undergo core collapse (due to [[electron capture]]) before achieving fusion of the heavier elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | title=Evolution of 8–10 {{Solar mass}} stars toward electron capture supernovae.

====Supernova====
{{Main|Supernova}}
[[Image:Crab Nebula.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[Crab Nebula]], the shattered remnants of a star which exploded as a supernova, the light of which reached Earth in 1054 AD]]
Once the [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] process arrives at [[iron-56]], the continuation of this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If the mass of the core exceeds the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], [[electron degeneracy pressure]] will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a [[neutron star]] or (in the case of cores that exceed the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]]), a [[black hole]]. Through a process that is not completely understood, some of the [[gravitational potential energy]] released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II [[supernova]]. It is known that the core collapse produces a massive surge of [[neutrino]]s, as observed with supernova [[SN 1987A]]. The extremely energetic [[neutrinos]] fragment some nuclei; some of their energy is consumed in releasing [[nucleons]], including [[neutrons]], and some of their energy is transformed into heat and [[kinetic energy]], thus augmenting the [[shock wave]] started by rebound of some of the infalling material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2001/highlight0102_e.html How do Massive Stars Explode?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030627124651/http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2001/highlight0102_e.html |date=2003-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier [[nuclear reactions]], the abundance of elements heavier than [[iron]] (and in particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in the [[Solar System]], so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and [[isotopes]] thereof.

The energy transferred from collapse of the core to rebounding material not only generates heavy elements, but provides for their acceleration well beyond [[escape velocity]], thus causing a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova. Note that current understanding of this energy transfer is still not satisfactory; although current computer models of Type Ib, Type Ic, and Type II supernovae account for part of the energy transfer, they are not able to account for enough energy transfer to produce the observed ejection of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2003/highlight0306_e.html|title=Supernova Simulations Still Defy Explosions|date=June 2003|author=Robert Buras|display-authors=etal|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik|work=Research Highlights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803015427/http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2003/highlight0306_e.html|archivedate=2003-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neutrino oscillations may play an important role in the energy transfer problem as they not only affect the energy available in a particular flavour of neutrinos but also through other general-relativistic effects on neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/B:GERG.0000038633.96716.04|title=Addendum to: Gen.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence gained from analysis of the mass and orbital parameters of binary neutron stars (which require two such supernovae) hints that the collapse of an oxygen-neon-magnesium core may produce a supernova that differs observably (in ways other than size) from a supernova produced by the collapse of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=E.

The most massive stars that exist today may be completely destroyed by a supernova with an energy greatly exceeding its [[gravitational binding energy]].

==Stellar remnants==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Planet]] --&gt;
After a star has burned out its fuel supply, its remnants can take one of three forms, depending on the mass during its lifetime.

===White and black dwarfs===
{{Main|White dwarf|Black dwarf}}
For a star of {{Solar mass|1}}, the resulting white dwarf is of about {{Solar mass|0.6}}, compressed into approximately the volume of the Earth. White dwarfs are stable because the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the [[degeneracy pressure]] of the star's electrons, a consequence of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Electron degeneracy pressure provides a rather soft limit against further compression; therefore, for a given chemical composition, white dwarfs of higher mass have a smaller volume. With no fuel left to burn, the star radiates its remaining heat into space for billions of years.

A white dwarf is very hot when it first forms, more than 100,000 K at the surface and even hotter in its interior. It is so hot that a lot of its energy is lost in the form of neutrinos for the first 10 million years of its existence, but will have lost most of its energy after a billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/tastgal_05.html Fossil Stars (1): White Dwarfs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical composition of the white dwarf depends upon its mass. A star of a few solar masses will ignite [[Carbon burning process|carbon fusion]] to form magnesium, neon, and smaller amounts of other elements, resulting in a white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that it can lose enough mass to get below the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] (see below), and provided that the ignition of carbon is not so violent as to blow the star apart in a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | title=Evolution of 8–10 {{Solar mass}} stars toward electron capture supernovae. I – Formation of electron-degenerate O + Ne + Mg cores | volume=277 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1984 | series=Part 1 | pages=791–805 | bibcode=1984ApJ...277..791N | doi=10.1086/161749 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A star of mass on the order of magnitude of the Sun will be unable to ignite carbon fusion, and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon and oxygen, and of mass too low to collapse unless matter is added to it later (see below). A star of less than about half the mass of the Sun will be unable to ignite helium fusion (as noted earlier), and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of helium.

In the end, all that remains is a cold dark mass sometimes called a [[black dwarf]]. However, the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to exist yet.

If the white dwarf's mass increases above the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], which is {{Solar mass|1.4}} for a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon, oxygen, neon, and/or magnesium, then electron degeneracy pressure fails due to [[electron capture]] and the star collapses. Depending upon the chemical composition and pre-collapse temperature in the center, this will lead either to collapse into a [[neutron star]] or runaway ignition of carbon and oxygen. Heavier elements favor continued core collapse, because they require a higher temperature to ignite, because electron capture onto these elements and their fusion products is easier; higher core temperatures favor runaway nuclear reaction, which halts core collapse and leads to a [[Type Ia supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | author2=Yoji Kondo | last-author-amp=yes | title=Conditions for accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs | series=367 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1991 | volume=Part 2 | pages=L19–L22 | bibcode=1991ApJ...367L..19N | doi=10.1086/185922 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; These supernovae may be many times brighter than the Type II supernova marking the death of a massive star, even though the latter has the greater total energy release. This instability to collapse means that no white dwarf more massive than approximately {{Solar mass|1.4}} can exist (with a possible minor exception for very rapidly spinning white dwarfs, whose [[centrifugal force]] due to rotation partially counteracts the weight of their matter). Mass transfer in a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] may cause an initially stable white dwarf to surpass the Chandrasekhar limit.

If a white dwarf forms a close binary system with another star, hydrogen from the larger companion may accrete around and onto a white dwarf until it gets hot enough to fuse in a runaway reaction at its surface, although the white dwarf remains below the Chandrasekhar limit. Such an explosion is termed a [[nova]].

===Neutron stars===
{{Main|Neutron star}}
[[Image:CygnusLoopSmall.jpg|thumb|right|Bubble-like shock wave still expanding from a supernova explosion 15,000 years ago.]]
Ordinarily, atoms are mostly electron clouds by volume, with very compact nuclei at the center (proportionally, if atoms were the size of a football stadium, their nuclei would be the size of dust mites). When a stellar core collapses, the pressure causes electrons and protons to fuse by [[electron capture]]. Without electrons, which keep nuclei apart, the neutrons collapse into a dense ball (in some ways like a giant atomic nucleus), with a thin overlying layer of [[degenerate matter]] (chiefly iron unless matter of different composition is added later). The neutrons resist further compression by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in a way analogous to electron degeneracy pressure, but stronger.

These stars, known as neutron stars, are extremely small—on the order of radius 10&amp;nbsp;km, no bigger than the size of a large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D'Amico, N. | author2=Stappers, B. W. | author3=Bailes, M. | author4=Martin, C. E. | author5=Bell, J. F. | author6=Lyne, A. G. | author7=Manchester, R.

Timing of long-period pulsars | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called [[pulsar]]s, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Courtland, Rachel |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14968-first-pulsar-identified-by-its-gamma-rays-alone.html |title=Pulsar Detected by Gamma Waves Only |work=New Scientist |date=17 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402053638/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14968-first-pulsar-identified-by-its-gamma-rays-alone.html |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black holes===
{{Main|Black hole}}
If the mass of the stellar remnant is high enough, the neutron degeneracy pressure will be insufficient to prevent collapse below the [[Schwarzschild radius]]. The stellar remnant thus becomes a black hole. The mass at which this occurs is not known with certainty, but is currently estimated at between 2 and {{Solar mass|3}}.

Black holes are predicted by the theory of [[general relativity]]. According to classical general relativity, no matter or information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer, although [[quantum mechanics|quantum effect]]s may allow deviations from this strict rule. The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported, both theoretically and by astronomical observation.

Because the core-collapse mechanism of a supernova is, at present, only partially understood, it is still not known whether it is possible for a star to collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova, or whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then collapse into black holes; the exact relation between the initial mass of the star and the final remnant is also not completely certain. Resolution of these uncertainties requires the analysis of more supernovae and supernova remnants.

==Models==
&lt;!-- Note: Stellar evolutionary model links here --&gt;
A stellar evolutionary model is a [[mathematical model]] that can be used to compute the evolutionary phases of a star from its formation until it becomes a remnant. The mass and chemical composition of the star are used as the inputs, and the luminosity and surface temperature are the only constraints. The model formulae are based upon the physical understanding of the star, usually under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Extensive computer calculations are then run to determine the changing state of the star over time, yielding a table of data that can be used to determine the [[evolutionary track]] of the star across the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], along with other evolving properties.&lt;ref name=aass316_1_31&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Demarque | first1=P. | last2=Guenther | first2=D.

'''Sunshine duration''' or '''sunshine hours''' is a [[climatological]] indicator, measuring duration of [[sunshine]] in given period (usually, a day or a year) for a given location on Earth, typically expressed as an averaged value over several years. It is a general indicator of [[cloud]]iness of a location, and thus differs from [[insolation]], which measures the total [[energy]] delivered by sunlight over a given period.

Sunshine duration is usually expressed in hours per year, or in (average) hours per day. The first measure indicates the general sunniness of a location compared with other places, while the latter allows for comparison of sunshine in various seasons in the same location.&lt;ref name=cimo&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |chapter=8. Measurement of Sunshine Duration |title=Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation |publisher=WMO |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E9CzPWoA?url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another often-used measure is percentage ratio of recorded bright sunshine duration and [[#daylight duration|daylight duration]] in the observed period.

An important use of sunshine duration data is to characterize the climate of sites, especially of health resorts. This also takes into account the psychological effect of strong solar light on human well-being. It is often used to promote tourist destinations.&lt;ref name=cimo/&gt;

==Daytime duration==
[[File:Refracción.png|thumb|Diagram showing displacement of the Sun's image at sunrise and sunset]]
{{main|Daytime (astronomy)}}
If the Sun were to be above the horizon 50% of the time for a standard year consisting of 8,760 hours, apparent maximal daytime duration would be 4,380 hours for any point on Earth. However, there are physical and astronomical effects that change that picture. Namely, [[atmospheric refraction]] allows the Sun to be still visible even when it physically sets below the [[horizon]]. For that reason, average daytime (disregarding cloud effects) is longest in polar areas, where the apparent Sun spends the most time around the horizon. Places on the [[Arctic Circle]] have the longest total annual daytime, 4,647 hours, while the [[North Pole]] receives 4,575. Because of elliptic nature of the [[Earth's orbit]], the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is not symmetrical: the [[Antarctic Circle]], with 4,530 hours of daylight, receives five days less of sunshine than its [[antipodes]]. The [[Equator]] has a total daytime of 4,422 hours per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-15/the-sunniest-and-darkest-places-on-earth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027044102/http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-15/the-sunniest-and-darkest-places-on-earth |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-27 |title=The Sunniest and Darkest Places on Earth |publisher=Scilogs |author=Gerhard Holtkamp |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and measurement==
[[File:Campbell-Stokes recorder.jpg|thumb|Campbell–Stokes recorder measures sunshine]]

Given the theoretical maximum of daytime duration for a given location, there is also a practical consideration at which point the amount of daylight is sufficient to be treated as a "sunshine hour". "Bright" sunshine hours represent the total hours when the sunlight is stronger than a specified threshold, as opposed to just "visible" hours. "Visible" sunshine, for example, occurs around sunrise and sunset, but is not strong enough to excite the sensor. Measurement is performed by instruments called [[sunshine recorders]]. For the specific purpose of sunshine duration recording, [[Campbell–Stokes recorder]]s are used, which use a spherical glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the sun rays on a specially designed tape. When the intensity exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the tape burns. The total length of the burn trace is proportional to the number of bright hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/cdo/about/definitionsother.shtml |title=Definitions for other daily elements |publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of recorder is the [[Jordan sunshine recorder]]. Newer, electronic recorders have more stable sensitivity than that of the paper tape.

In order to harmonize the data measured worldwide, in 1962 the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) defined a standardized design of the Campbell–Stokes recorder, called an Interim Reference Sunshine Recorder (IRSR).&lt;ref name=cimo/&gt; In 2003, the sunshine duration was finally defined as the period during which direct solar [[irradiance]] exceeds a threshold value of 120&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name=cimo/&gt;

Sunshine duration follows a general geographic pattern: [[horse latitude|subtropical latitudes]] (about 25° to 40° north/south) have the highest sunshine values, because these are the locations of the eastern sides of the [[subtropical high|subtropical high pressure system]]s, associated with the large-scale descent of air from the upper-level tropopause. Many of the world's driest climates are found adjacent to the eastern sides of the subtropical highs, which create stable atmospheric conditions, little convective overturning, and little moisture and cloud cover. Desert regions, with nearly constant high pressure aloft and rare condensation—like [[North Africa]], the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Western Australia]], and the [[Middle East]]—are examples of hot, sunny, dry climates where sunshine duration values are very high.

The two major areas with the highest sunshine duration, measured as annual average, are the central and the eastern [[Sahara Desert]]—covering vast, mainly desert countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Chad]], and [[Niger]]—and the Southwestern United States ([[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]]).&lt;ref name=sunniest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php |title=Sunniest places in the world |publisher=Current Results.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city claiming the official title of the sunniest in the world is [[Yuma, Arizona]], with over 4,000&amp;nbsp;hours (about 91% of daylight time) of bright sunshine annually,&lt;ref name=sunniest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ccd-data/pctposrank.txt |title=Ranking of cities based on % annual possible sunshine |year=2004 |publisher=[[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many climatological books suggest there may be sunnier areas in North Africa.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In the belt encompassing northern Chad and the [[Tibesti Mountains]], northern Sudan, southern Libya, and [[Upper Egypt]], annual sunshine duration is estimated at over 4,000 hours. There is also a smaller, isolated area of sunshine maximum in the heart of the western section of the Sahara Desert around the Eglab Massif and the [[Erg Chech]], along the borders of [[Algeria]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Mali]] where the 4,000-hour mark is exceeded, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDDajR_i1sYC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9 |title=Les climats: Mécanismes, variabilité et répartition |first1=Alain |last1=Godard |first2=Martine |last2=Tabeaud |publisher=Armand Colin |year=2009 |isbn=9782200246044 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some places in the interior of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] receive 3,600–3,800&amp;nbsp;hours of bright sunshine annually. The largest sun-baked region in the world (over 3,000&amp;nbsp;hours of yearly sunshine) is North Africa. The sunniest month in the world is December in Eastern Antarctica, with almost 23 hours of bright sun daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aari.aq/data/data.asp?lang=0&amp;station=6#sun_dur.txt |title=Antarctic climatic data |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507070713/http://www.aari.aq/data/data.asp?lang=0&amp;station=6#sun_dur.txt |archivedate=2008-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, higher latitudes (above 50° north/south) lying in stormy westerlies have much cloudier and more unstable and [[rain]]y weather, and often have the lowest values of sunshine duration annually. Temperate oceanic climates like those in [[northwestern Europe]], the western coast of [[Canada]], and areas of New Zealand's [[South Island]] are examples of cool, cloudy, wet, humid climates where cloudless sunshine duration values are very low. The areas with the lowest sunshine duration annually lie mostly over the polar oceans, as well as parts of northern Europe, southern Alaska, northern Russia, and areas near the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]. The cloudiest place in the United States is [[Cold Bay, Alaska]], with an average of 304 days of heavy overcast (covering over 3/4 of the sky).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/cloudiest.php |title=Cloudiest places in the United States |publisher=Current Results.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these polar oceanic climates, certain low-latitude basins enclosed by mountains, like the [[Sichuan Basin|Sichuan]] and [[Taipei Basin]]s, can have sunshine duration as low as 1,000 hours per year, as cool air consistently sinks to form fogs that winds cannot dissipate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Manfred |last1=Domrös |first2=Gongbing |last2=Peng |title=The Climate of China |pages=75–78 |isbn=9783540187684}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tórshavn]] in the [[Faroe Islands]] is among the cloudiest places in the world with yearly only 840 sunshine hours.

[[File:Supercapacitor types overview.svg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram that shows a hierarchical classification of supercapacitors and capacitors of related types.]]

A '''supercapacitor''' ('''SC''') (also called a '''supercap''', '''ultracapacitor''' or '''Goldcap'''&lt;ref name="industrial-panasonic"/&gt;) is a high-capacity [[capacitor]] with capacitance values much higher than other capacitors (but lower voltage limits) that bridge the gap between [[electrolytic capacitor]]s and [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. They typically store 10 to 100 times more [[specific energy|energy per unit volume or mass]] than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]].

Supercapacitors are used in applications requiring many rapid charge/discharge cycles rather than long term compact energy storage: within cars, buses, trains, cranes and elevators, where they are used for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], short-term energy storage or burst-mode power delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Large-area printed supercapacitor technology for low-cost domestic green energy storage|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216316243|journal=Energy|language=en|volume=118|pages=1313–1321|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.019|issn=0360-5442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller units are used as memory backup for [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).

Unlike ordinary capacitors, supercapacitors do not use the conventional solid [[dielectric]], but rather, they use [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] [[Double layer (interfacial)|double-layer capacitance]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[Pseudocapacitor|pseudocapacitance]], both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor, with a few differences:

* '''Electrostatic double-layer capacitors''' ('''EDLCs''') use [[carbon]] [[electrode]]s or derivatives with much higher electrostatic double-layer capacitance than electrochemical pseudocapacitance, achieving separation of charge in a [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] at the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the surface of a conductive electrode and an [[electrolyte]]. The separation of charge is of the order of a few [[ångström]]s (0.3–0.8&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]), much smaller than in a conventional capacitor.
* Electrochemical pseudocapacitors use [[metal oxide]] or [[conducting polymer]] electrodes with a high amount of electrochemical pseudocapacitance additional to the double-layer capacitance. Pseudocapacitance is achieved by [[Faradaic current|Faradaic]] [[electron transfer|electron]] [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]] with [[Redox|redox reactions]], [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] or [[wikt:electrosorption|electrosorption]].
* Hybrid capacitors, such as the [[lithium-ion capacitor]], use electrodes with differing characteristics: one exhibiting mostly electrostatic capacitance and the other mostly electrochemical capacitance.

The electrolyte forms an ionic conductive connection between the two electrodes which distinguishes them from conventional electrolytic capacitors where a dielectric layer always exists, and the so-called electrolyte (e.g., MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or conducting polymer) is in fact part of the second electrode (the cathode, or more correctly the positive electrode). Supercapacitors are polarized by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied during manufacture.

==History==
Development of the double layer and pseudocapacitance models (see [[Double layer (interfacial)]]).

===Evolution of components===
In the early 1950s, [[General Electric]] engineers began experimenting with porous carbon electrodes, in the design of capacitors, from the design of [[fuel cell]]s and [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. [[Activated carbon|Activated charcoal]] is an [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductor]] that is an extremely porous "spongy" form of carbon with a high [[specific surface area]]. In 1957 H. Becker developed a "Low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country=US| number=2800616| title=Low voltage electrolytic capacitor|gdate=1957-07-23|invent1=Becker, H.I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;{{cite journal| first1=J.| last1=Ho| first2=R.| last2=Jow| first3=S.| last3=Boggs|title=Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology|journal=IEEE Elect. Insul. Mag.|volume=26|issue=1|pages=20–25|publisher=IEEE|date=Jan 2010| url=http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/spr/spr08/spr08_p34-37.pdf|doi=10.1109/mei.2010.5383924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of supercapacitors AUTUMN 2007 [http://www.cantecsystems.com/ccrdocs/brief-history-of-supercapacitors.pdf Batteries &amp; Energy Storage Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032318/http://www.cantecsystems.com/ccrdocs/brief-history-of-supercapacitors.pdf |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the energy was stored as a charge in the carbon pores as in the pores of the etched foils of electrolytic capacitors. Because the double layer mechanism was not known by him at the time, he wrote in the patent: "It is not known exactly what is taking place in the component if it is used for energy storage, but it leads to an extremely high capacity."

General Electric did not immediately pursue this work. In 1966 researchers at [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] (SOHIO) developed another version of the component as "electrical energy storage apparatus", while working on experimental [[fuel cell]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country=US|number=3288641|title=Electrical energy storage apparatus| gdate=1966-11-29| invent1=Rightmire, Robert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schindall"&gt;J. G. Schindall, The Change of the Ultra-Capacitors, IEEE Spectrum, November 2007 [http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/nov07/5636/2 The Charge of the Ultra – Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of electrochemical energy storage was not described in this patent. Even in 1970, the electrochemical capacitor patented by Donald L. Boos was registered as an electrolytic capacitor with activated carbon electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country=US|number=3536963|title=Electrolytic capacitor having carbon paste electrodes| gdate=1970-10-27|invent=D. L. Boos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early electrochemical capacitors used two aluminum foils covered with activated carbon—the electrodes—which were soaked in an electrolyte and separated by a thin porous insulator. This design gave a capacitor with a capacitance on the order of one [[farad]], significantly higher than electrolytic capacitors of the same dimensions. This basic mechanical design remains the basis of most electrochemical capacitors.

SOHIO did not commercialize their invention, licensing the technology to [[NEC]], who finally marketed the results as "supercapacitors" in 1971, to provide backup power for computer memory.&lt;ref name="Schindall" /&gt;

[[File:Bockris Group At Imperical College, London 1947.png|thumb|left|The [[John Bockris]] Group at Imperial College, London 1947. Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Brian Evans Conway]] seated in the front row, second from the right.]]
Between 1975 and 1980 [[Brian Evans Conway]] conducted extensive fundamental and development work on [[ruthenium oxide]] electrochemical capacitors. In 1991 he described the difference between "Supercapacitor" and "Battery" behavior in electrochemical energy storage. In 1999 he coined the term supercapacitor to explain the increased capacitance by surface redox reactions with faradaic charge transfer between electrodes and ions.&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Brian Evans |author-last=Conway |author-link=Brian Evans Conway |title=Transition from 'Supercapacitor' to 'Battery' Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |journal=J. Electrochem. Soc. |volume=138 |number=6 |date=May 1991 |pages=1539–1548 |doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "supercapacitor" stored electrical charge partially in the Helmholtz double-layer and partially as result of faradaic reactions with "pseudocapacitance" charge transfer of electrons and protons between electrode and electrolyte. The working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] and electrosorption (adsorption onto a surface). With his research, Conway greatly expanded the knowledge of electrochemical capacitors.

The market expanded slowly. That changed around 1978 as [[Panasonic]] marketed its Goldcaps brand.&lt;ref name="industrial-panasonic"&gt;Panasonic, Electric Double Layer Capacitor, Technical guide,1. Introduction,[http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABC0000/ABC0000TE1.pdf Panasonic Goldcaps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109235659/http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABC0000/ABC0000TE1.pdf |date=2014-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This product became a successful energy source for memory backup applications.&lt;ref name="Schindall" /&gt; Competition started only years later. In 1987 [[Elna (Japanese company)|ELNA]] "Dynacap"s entered the market.&lt;ref name="Elna_DynaCap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/double_layer/index.html|title=Electric double-layer capacitors|publisher=ELNA|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; First generation EDLC's had relatively high [[internal resistance]] that limited the discharge current. They were used for low current applications such as powering [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] chips or for data backup.

At the end of the 1980s, improved electrode materials increased capacitance values. At the same time, the development of electrolytes with better conductivity lowered the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) increasing charge/discharge currents. The first supercapacitor with low internal resistance was developed in 1982 for military applications through the Pinnacle Research Institute (PRI), and were marketed under the brand name "PRI Ultracapacitor". In 1992, Maxwell Laboratories (later [[Maxwell Technologies]]) took over this development. Maxwell adopted the term Ultracapacitor from PRI and called them "Boost Caps"&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite techreport|author=Adam Marcus Namisnyk|title=A survey of electrochemical supercapacitor technology|url=http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf|accessdate=2015-02-21|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to underline their use for power applications.

Since capacitors' energy content increases with the square of the voltage, researchers were looking for a way to increase the electrolyte's [[breakdown voltage]]. In 1994 using the [[anode]] of a 200V high voltage [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitor]], David A. Evans developed an "Electrolytic-Hybrid Electrochemical Capacitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=5369547|title=Containers with anodes and cathodes with electrolytes|gdate=1994-11-29|invent1=David A. Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Evans (Evans Company): ''[http://www.evanscap.com/pdf/carts14.pdf High Energy Density Electrolytic-Electrochemical Hybrid Capacitor]'' In: ''Proceedings of the 14th Capacitor &amp; Resistor Technology Symposium.'' 22 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; These capacitors combine features of electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors. They combine the high dielectric strength of an anode from an electrolytic capacitor with the high capacitance of a pseudocapacitive [[metal oxide]] ([[ruthenium]] (IV) oxide) [[cathode]] from an electrochemical capacitor, yielding a hybrid electrochemical capacitor. Evans' capacitors, coined Capattery,&lt;ref&gt;Evans Capacitor Company 2007 [http://www.evanscap.com/the_capattery.htm Capattery series]&lt;/ref&gt; had an energy content about a factor of 5 higher than a comparable tantalum electrolytic capacitor of the same size.&lt;ref name="Evans5-2"&gt;David A.

Recent developments include [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s. These hybrid capacitors were pioneered by FDK in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdk.com/company_e/ayumi2000-e.html |title=FDK, Corporate Information, FDK History 2000s |publisher=FDK |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They combine an electrostatic carbon electrode with a pre-doped lithium-ion electrochemical electrode. This combination increases the capacitance value. Additionally, the pre-doping process lowers the anode potential and results in a high cell output voltage, further increasing specific energy.

==Basics==
===Basic design===
[[File:Electric double-layer capacitor (2 models) -1 NT.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Typical construction of a supercapacitor: (1)&amp;nbsp;power source, (2)&amp;nbsp;collector, (3)&amp;nbsp;polarized electrode, (4)&amp;nbsp;Helmholtz double layer, (5)&amp;nbsp;electrolyte having positive and negative ions, (6)&amp;nbsp;separator.]]

[[Electrochemistry|Electrochemical]] capacitors (supercapacitors) consist of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane ([[Separator (electricity)|separator]]), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers of opposite polarity to the electrode's polarity. For example, positively polarized electrodes will have a layer of negative ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface along with a charge-balancing layer of positive ions adsorbing onto the negative layer. The opposite is true for the negatively polarized electrode.

Additionally, depending on electrode material and surface shape, some ions may permeate the double layer becoming specifically adsorbed ions and contribute with pseudocapacitance to the total capacitance of the supercapacitor.

===Capacitance distribution===
The two electrodes form a series circuit of two individual capacitors ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The total capacitance ''C''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{total} = \frac{C_1 \cdot C_2}{C_1 + C_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Supercapacitors may have either symmetric or asymmetric electrodes. Symmetry implies that both electrodes have the same capacitance value, yielding a total capacitance of half the value of each single electrode (if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;½&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). For asymmetric capacitors, the total capacitance can be taken as that of the electrode with the smaller capacitance (if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Storage principles===
Electrochemical capacitors use the double-layer effect to store electric energy; however, this double-layer has no conventional solid dielectric to separate the charges. There are two storage principles in the electric double-layer of the electrodes that contribute to the total capacitance of an electrochemical capacitor:&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Elzbieta |last1=Frackowiak |first2=Francois |last2=Béguin |title=Carbon materials for the electrochemical storage of energy in capacitors |journal=Carbon |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=937–950 |publisher=Pergamon |date=May 2001 |doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(00)00183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Double-layer capacitance]], [[electrostatic]] storage of the electrical energy achieved by separation of charge in a Helmholtz double layer.&lt;ref name="Halper" /&gt;
* [[Pseudocapacitance]], [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] storage of the electrical energy achieved by faradaic [[redox]] reactions with charge-transfer.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;

Both capacitances are only separable by measurement techniques. The amount of charge stored per unit voltage in an electrochemical capacitor is primarily a function of the electrode size, although the amount of capacitance of each storage principle can vary extremely.

Practically, these storage principles yield a capacitor with {{cn span|text=a [[capacitance]] value in the order of 1 to 100 [[farad]].|reason=A reference is required to support this range.  It differs from the range in the article lead.|date=November 2015}}

====Electrostatic double-layer capacitance====
{{main|Double-layer capacitance}}
[[File:EDLC-simplified-principle.png|thumb|right|200px| Simplified view of a double-layer of negative ions in the electrode and solvated positive ions in the liquid electrolyte, separated by a layer of polarized solvent molecules.]]

Every electrochemical capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically separated by a separator, which are ionically connected to each other via the [[electrolyte]]. The electrolyte is a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a solvent such as water. At each of the two electrode surfaces originates an area in which the liquid electrolyte contacts the conductive metallic surface of the electrode. This interface forms a common boundary among two different [[Phase (matter)|phases]] of matter, such as an insoluble [[solid]] electrode surface and an adjacent [[liquid]] electrolyte. In this interface occurs a very special phenomenon of the [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer effect]].&lt;ref name="EDL"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The electrical double layer |year=2011 |url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm |accessdate=2014-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531014449/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm |archivedate=2011-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying a voltage to an electrochemical capacitor causes both electrodes in the capacitor to generate [[Double layer (interfacial)|electrical double-layers]]. These double-layers consist of two layers of charges: one electronic layer is in the surface lattice structure of the electrode, and the other, with opposite polarity, emerges from [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissolved]] and [[Solvation|solvated]] ions in the electrolyte. The two layers are separated by a monolayer of solvent [[molecule]]s, e. g. for [[water]] as [[solvent]] by water molecules, called inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Solvent molecules adhere by [[Physisorption|physical adsorption]] on the surface of the electrode and separate the oppositely polarized ions from each other, and can be idealised as a molecular dielectric. In the process, there is no transfer of charge between electrode and electrolyte, so the forces that cause the adhesion are not chemical bonds but physical forces (e.g. electrostatic forces). The adsorbed molecules are polarized but, due to the lack of transfer of charge between electrolyte and electrode, suffered no chemical changes.

The amount of charge in the electrode is matched by the magnitude of counter-charges in outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). This double-layer phenomena stores electrical charges as in a conventional capacitor. The double-layer charge forms a static electric field in the molecular layer of the solvent molecules in the IHP that corresponds to the strength of the applied voltage.

[[File:EDLC-Charge-Distribution.png|thumb|right|250px|Structure and function of an ideal double-layer capacitor. Applying a voltage to the capacitor at both electrodes a Helmholtz double-layer will be formed separating the ions in the electrolyte in a mirror charge distribution of opposite polarity]]

The double-layer serves approximately as the dielectric layer in a conventional capacitor, albeit with the thickness of a single molecule. Thus, the standard formula for conventional plate capacitors can be used to calculate their capacitance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Srinivasan |first=S. |title=Fuel Cells: From Fundamentals to Applications |publisher=Springer eBooks |year=2006 |chapter=2. Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces: Structure and Kinetics of Charge Transfer |url=https://www.springer.com/chemistry/electrochemistry/book/978-0-387-25116-5 |isbn=978-0-387-35402-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C= \varepsilon\frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;.

Accordingly, capacitance ''C'' is greatest in capacitors made from materials with a high [[permittivity]] ''ε'', large electrode plate surface areas ''A'' and small distance between plates ''d''. As a result, double-layer capacitors have much higher capacitance values than conventional capacitors, arising from the extremely large surface area of activated carbon electrodes and the extremely thin double-layer distance on the order of a few [[ångström]]s (0.3-0.8&amp;nbsp;nm), of order of the [[Debye length]].&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Halper" /&gt;

The main drawback of carbon electrodes of double-layer SCs is small values of quantum capacitance&lt;ref name=Despotuli&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Despotuli |first1=A.L. |last2=Andreeva |first2=A.V. |title= Advanced Carbon Nanostructures" for "Advanced Supercapacitors:" What Does it Mean? |journal=Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Lett.|volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=119–124 |date= February 2011 |doi=10.1166/nnl.2011.1130}}&lt;/ref&gt; which act in series&lt;ref name= GeimNovoselov&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yu |first1= G.L.|last2= Jalil |first2= R.|last3= Belle |first3= B.|last4= Mayorov |first4= A.S. |last5= Blake |first5= P.|last6= Schedin |first6= F.|last7= Morozov |first7= S.V.|last8= Ponomarenko |first8= L.A.|last9= Chiappini |first9= F. |last10= Wiedmann |first10= S. |last11= Zeitler |first11= U. |last12= Katsnelson |first12= M.I. |last13= Geim |first13= A.K. |last14= Novoselov |first14= K.S. |last15= Elias |first15= D.C. |title= Interaction phenomena in graphene seen through quantum capacitance|journal=PNAS|volume=110 |issue=9 |pages=3282–3286|date= February 2013 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1300599110 |pmid=23401538 |pmc=3587260|arxiv= 1302.3967|bibcode= 2013PNAS..110.3282Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; with capacitance of ionic space charge. Therefore, further increase of density of capacitance in SCs can be connected with increasing of quantum capacitance of carbon electrode nanostructures.&lt;ref name=" Despotuli" /&gt;

The amount of charge stored per unit voltage in an electrochemical capacitor is primarily a function of the electrode size. The electrostatic storage of energy in the double-layers is linear with respect to the stored charge, and correspond to the concentration of the adsorbed ions. Also, while charge in conventional capacitors is transferred via electrons, capacitance in double-layer capacitors is related to the limited moving speed of ions in the electrolyte and the resistive porous structure of the electrodes. Since no chemical changes take place within the electrode or electrolyte, charging and discharging electric double-layers in principle is unlimited. Real supercapacitors lifetimes are only limited by electrolyte evaporation effects.

====Electrochemical pseudocapacitance====
{{main|Pseudocapacitance}}
[[File:Pseudocapacitance-Priciple.png|thumb|right|200px|Simplified view of a double-layer with specifically adsorbed ions which have submitted their charge to the electrode to explain the faradaic charge-transfer of the pseudocapacitance.]]

Applying a voltage at the electrochemical capacitor terminals moves electrolyte ions to the opposite polarized electrode and forms a double-layer in which a single layer of [[solvent]] molecules acts as separator. Pseudocapacitance can originate when specifically adsorbed ions out of the electrolyte pervade the double-layer. This pseudocapacitance stores [[Electric energy|electrical energy]] by means of reversible [[Faradaic current|faradaic]] [[Redox|redox reactions]] on the surface of suitable electrodes in an electrochemical capacitor with an [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double-layer]].&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halper"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Halper |first1=Marin S. |last2=Ellenbogen |first2=James C. |title=Supercapacitors: A Brief Overview |work=MITRE Nanosystems Group |date= March 2006 |url=http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/06_0667.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frackowiak |first1=Elzbieta |last2=Jurewicz |first2=K. |last3=Delpeux |first3=K. |last4=Béguin |first4= Francois |title=Nanotubular Materials For Supercapacitors|journal=J.

This faradaic charge transfer originates by a very fast sequence of reversible redox, [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] or [[Capacitive deionization|electrosorption]] processes. The adsorbed ion has no [[chemical reaction]] with the atoms of the electrode (no chemical bonds arise&lt;ref name="Garthwaite"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garthwaite |first=Josie |title=How ultracapacitors work (and why they fall short) |url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/how-ultracapacitors-work-and-why-they-fall-short/ |work=Earth2Tech |publisher=GigaOM Network |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) since only a charge-transfer take place.

[[File:Voltagram-Engl.png|thumb|left|225px|A cyclic voltammogram shows the fundamental differences between static capacitance (rectangular) and pseudocapacitance (curved)]]
The electrons involved in the faradaic processes are transferred to or from [[valence electron]] states ([[Atomic orbital|orbitals]]) of the redox electrode reagent. They enter the negative electrode and flow through the external circuit to the positive electrode where a second double-layer with an equal number of anions has formed. The electrons reaching the positive electrode are not transferred to the anions forming the double-layer, instead they remain in the strongly ionized and "electron hungry" transition-metal ions of the electrode's surface. As such, the storage capacity of faradaic pseudocapacitance is limited by the finite quantity of [[reagent]] in the available surface.

A faradaic pseudocapacitance only occurs together with a static [[double-layer capacitance]], and its magnitude may exceed the value of double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by factor 100, depending on the nature and the structure of the electrode because all the pseudocapacitance reactions take place only with de-solvated ions, which are much smaller than solvated ion with their solvating shell.&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conway2"/&gt; The amount of pseudocapacitance has a linear function within narrow limits determined by the [[Electric potential|potential-dependent]] degree of surface coverage of the adsorbed anions.

The ability of electrodes to accomplish pseudocapacitance effects by redox reactions, intercalation or electrosorption strongly depends on the chemical affinity of electrode materials to the ions adsorbed on the electrode surface as well as on the structure and dimension of the electrode pores. Materials exhibiting redox behavior for use as electrodes in pseudocapacitors are transition-metal oxides like RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inserted by doping in the conductive electrode material such as active carbon, as well as conducting polymers such as [[polyaniline]] or derivatives of [[polythiophene]] covering the electrode material.

The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in a pseudocapacitance is linearly proportional to the applied [[voltage]]. The unit of pseudocapacitance is [[farad]].

===Potential distribution===
[[File:Fixed capacitors-charge storage principles-2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Charge storage principles of different capacitor types and their internal potential distribution]]
[[File:EDLC-Voltage distribution.png|thumb|right|upright=1.05| Basic illustration of the functionality of a supercapacitor, the voltage distribution inside of the capacitor and its simplified equivalent DC circuit]]
[[File:Charge-Discharge-Supercap-vs-Battery.png|thumb|right|The voltage behavior of supercapacitors and batteries during charging/discharging differs clearly]]

Conventional [[capacitor]]s (also known as electrostatic capacitors), such as [[ceramic capacitor]]s and [[film capacitor]]s, consist of two electrodes which are separated by a [[dielectric]] material. When charged, the energy is stored in a [[Static electricity|static]] [[electric field]] that permeates the dielectric between the electrodes. The total energy increases with the amount of stored charge, which in turn correlates linearly with the potential (voltage) between the plates. The maximum potential difference between the plates (the maximal voltage) is limited by the dielectric's [[Dielectric breakdown|breakdown field strength]]. The same static storage also applies for [[electrolytic capacitor]]s in which most of the potential decreases over the [[anode]]'s thin oxide layer. The somewhat resistive liquid electrolyte ([[cathode]]) accounts for a small decrease of potential for "wet" electrolytic capacitors, while electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolyte this voltage drop is negligible.

In contrast, [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[capacitors]] (supercapacitors) consists of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and electrically connected via an electrolyte. Energy storage occurs within the double-layers of both electrodes as a mixture of a double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. When both electrodes have approximately the same [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] ([[#Internal resistance|internal resistance]]), the potential of the capacitor decreases symmetrically over both double-layers, whereby a voltage drop across the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the electrolyte is achieved. For asymmetrical supercapacitors like hybrid capacitors the voltage drop between the electrodes could be asymmetrical. The maximum potential across the capacitor (the maximal voltage) is limited by the electrolyte decomposition voltage.

Both electrostatic and electrochemical energy storage in supercapacitors are linear with respect to the stored charge, just as in conventional capacitors. The voltage between the capacitor terminals is linear with respect to the amount of stored energy. Such linear voltage gradient differs from rechargeable electrochemical batteries, in which the voltage between the terminals remains independent of the amount of stored energy, providing a relatively constant voltage.

===Comparison with other storage technologies===
Supercapacitors compete with electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries especially [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. The following table compares the major parameters of the three main supercapacitor families with electrolytic capacitors and batteries.

Electrolytic capacitors feature unlimited charge/discharge cycles, high dielectric strength (up to 550&amp;nbsp;V) and good frequency response as AC resistance in the lower frequency range. Supercapacitors can store 10 to 100 times more energy than electrolytic capacitors but they do not support AC applications.

With regards to rechargeable batteries supercapacitors feature higher peak currents, low cost per cycle, no danger of overcharging, good reversibility, non-corrosive electrolyte and low material toxicity, while batteries offer, lower purchase cost, stable voltage under discharge, but they require complex electronic control and switching equipment, with consequent energy loss and spark hazard given a short.

==Styles==
Supercapacitors are made in different styles such as flat with a single pair of electrodes, wound in a cylindrical case or stacked in a rectangular case. Because they cover a broad range of capacitance values the size of the cases can vary.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Supercapacitors are constructed with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which serve as the power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material is a very large surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]] to protect the electrodes against [[short circuit]]s. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.

==Supercapacitor types==
[[File:Supercaps-family.png|thumb|left|300px|Family tree of supercapacitor types. Double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors as well as hybrid capacitors are defined over their electrode designs.]]

Electrical energy is stored in supercapacitors via two storage principles: static [[double-layer capacitance]] and electrochemical [[pseudocapacitance]]; and the distribution of the two types of capacitance depends on the material and structure of the electrodes. There are three types of supercapacitors based on storage principle:&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Halper" /&gt;
* '''Double-layer capacitors''' ('''EDLCs''') – with [[activated carbon]] electrodes or derivatives with much higher electrostatic double-layer capacitance than electrochemical pseudocapacitance
* '''Pseudocapacitors''' – with [[transition metal]] oxide or [[conducting polymer]] electrodes with a high electrochemical pseudocapacitance
* '''Hybrid capacitors''' – with asymmetric electrodes, one of which exhibits mostly electrostatic and the other mostly electrochemical capacitance, such as [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s

Because double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance both contribute inseparably to the total capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor, a correct description of these capacitors only can be given under the generic term. The concepts of supercapattery and supercabattery have been recently proposed to better represent those hybrid devices that behave more like the supercapacitor and the rechargeable battery, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = L. P. | last2 = Chen | first2 = G. Z. | year = 2016 | title = Redox electrode materials for supercapatteries | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.095 | journal = J.

The [[capacitance]] value of a supercapacitor is determined by two storage principles:

* [[Double layer (interfacial)|Double-layer capacitance]]&amp;nbsp;– [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] storage of the electrical [[energy]] achieved by separation of [[electric charge|charge]] in a [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] double layer at the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the [[surface science|surface]] of a conductor [[electrode]] and an electrolytic solution [[electrolyte]]. The separation of charge distance in a double-layer is on the order of a few [[ångström]]s (0.3–0.8&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) and is [[static electricity|static]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"/&gt;
* [[Pseudocapacitor|Pseudocapacitance]]&amp;nbsp;– Electrochemical storage of the electrical energy, achieved by [[redox|redox reactions]], electrosorption or [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] on the surface of the electrode by specifically adsorbed [[ion]]s, that results in a reversible [[faradaic current|faradaic]] [[charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]] on the electrode.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"/&gt;

Double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance both contribute inseparably to the total capacitance value of a supercapacitor.&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"/&gt;  However, the ratio of the two can vary greatly, depending on the design of the electrodes and the composition of the electrolyte. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as a factor of ten over that of the double-layer by itself.&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conway2"/&gt;

Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) are electrochemical capacitors in which energy storage predominantly is achieved by double-layer capacitance. In the past, all electrochemical capacitors were called "double-layer capacitors". Contemporary usage  sees  double-layer capacitors, together with pseudocapacitors, as part of a larger family of electrochemical capacitors&lt;ref name="conway1"&gt;{{citation |author-first=Brian Evans |author-last=Conway |author-link=Brian Evans Conway |title=Electrochemical Supercapacitors: Scientific Fundamentals and Technological Applications |publisher=[[Springer Nature|Springer]] |publication-place=Berlin, Germany |year=1999 |at=pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8 |isbn=0306457369 |language=German |url={{Google books|8yvzlr9TqI0C|page=1|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway2"&gt;{{cite |url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-c03-elchem-cap.htm |author-first=Brian Evans |author-last=Conway |author-link=Brian Evans Conway |title=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia |chapter=Electrochemical Capacitors — Their Nature, Function and Applications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813020215/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-c03-elchem-cap.htm |archivedate=2012-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; called supercapacitors. They are also known as ultracapacitors.

==Materials==
The properties of supercapacitors come from the interaction of their internal materials. Especially, the combination of electrode material and type of electrolyte determine the functionality and thermal and electrical characteristics of the capacitors.

===Electrodes===
[[File:ActivatedCharcoalPowder BrightField.jpg|thumb|right|A [[micrograph]] of activated carbon under [[bright field microscopy|bright field]] illumination on a [[light microscope]]. Notice the [[fractal]]-like shape of the particles hinting at their enormous surface area. Each particle in this image, despite being only around 0.1 mm across, has a surface area of several square meters.{{Citation needed|reason=Extraordinary claim|date=April 2018}}]]

Supercapacitor electrodes are generally thin coatings applied and electrically connected to a conductive, metallic [[Electric current|current]] collector. Electrodes must have good conductivity, high temperature stability, long-term chemical stability ([[Chemically inert|inert]]ness), high corrosion resistance and high surface areas per unit volume and mass. Other requirements include environmental friendliness and low cost.

The amount of double-layer as well as pseudocapacitance stored per unit voltage in a supercapacitor is predominantly a function of the electrode surface area. Therefore, supercapacitor electrodes are typically made of porous, [[Sponge|spongy]] material with an extraordinarily high [[specific surface area]], such as [[activated carbon]]. Additionally, the ability of the electrode material to perform faradaic charge transfers enhances the total capacitance.

Generally the smaller the electrode's pores, the greater the capacitance and [[specific energy]]. However, smaller pores increase [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) and decrease [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]]. Applications with high peak currents require larger pores and low internal losses, while applications requiring high specific energy need small pores.

====Electrodes for EDLCs====
The most commonly used electrode material for supercapacitors is carbon in various manifestations such as [[activated carbon]] (AC), carbon fibre-cloth (AFC), [[carbide-derived carbon]] (CDC), carbon [[aerogel]], [[graphite]] ([[graphene]]), [[graphane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Could hemp nanosheets topple graphene for better supercapacitor electrodes? |publisher=Kurzweil Accelerating Intelligence |date=August 14, 2014 | url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/could-hemp-nanosheets-topple-graphene-for-better-supercapacitor-electrodes |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs).&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pandolfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinoshita1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kim Kinoshita |title=Electrochemical Oxygen Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m22CvObj80C |date=June 1992 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-57043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon-based electrodes exhibit predominantly static double-layer capacitance, even though a small amount of pseudocapacitance may also be present depending on the pore size distribution. Pore sizes in carbons typically range from [[microporous material|micropores]] (less than 2&amp;nbsp;nm) to [[mesoporous material|mesopores]] (2-50&amp;nbsp;nm),&lt;ref name="Y-Carbon" /&gt; but only micropores (&lt;2&amp;nbsp;nm) contribute to pseudocapacitance. As pore size approaches the solvation shell size, solvent molecules are excluded and only unsolvated ions fill the pores (even for large ions), increasing ionic packing density and storage capability by faradaic {{chem|H|2}} intercalation.&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"/&gt;

=====Activated carbon=====
[[Activated carbon]] (AC) was the first material chosen for EDLC electrodes. Even though its electrical conductivity is approximately 0.003% that of metals ([[Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Resistivity and conductivity of various materials|1,250 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;S/m]]), it is sufficient for supercapacitors.&lt;ref name="Halper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Namisnyk " /&gt;

Activated carbon is an extremely porous form of carbon with a high [[specific surface area]] — a common approximation is that 1 gram (0.035&amp;nbsp;oz) (a pencil-eraser-sized amount) has a surface area of roughly {{convert|1000|to| 3000|m2|ft2}}&lt;ref name=Pandolfo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pandolfo |first1=A.G. |last2=Hollenkamp |first2=A.F. |title=Carbon properties and their role in supercapacitors |journal=J. Power Sources |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=11–27 |date=June 2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.065|bibcode=2006JPS...157...11P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Y-Carbon"&gt;{{cite web |title=EnterosorbU, FAQ |publisher=Carbon-Ukraine|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; — about the size of 4 to 12 [[tennis court]]s. The bulk form used in electrodes is low-density with many pores, giving high double-layer capacitance.

Solid activated carbon, also termed ''consolidated [[amorphous carbon]]'' (CAC) is the most used electrode material for supercapacitors and may be cheaper than other carbon derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6787235 |title=Consolidated amorphous carbon materials, their manufacture and use |gdate=2004-09-07 |invent1=Nesbitt, C.C. |invent2= Sun, X. |assign1=Reticle, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced from activated carbon powder pressed into the desired shape, forming a block with a wide distribution of pore sizes. An electrode with a surface area of about 1000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g results in a typical double-layer capacitance of about 10&amp;nbsp;μF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a specific capacitance of 100&amp;nbsp;F/g.

{{As of|2010}} virtually all commercial supercapacitors use powdered activated carbon made from coconut shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laine |first1=J. |last2=Yunes |first2=S. |title=Effect of the preparation method on the pore size distribution of activated carbon from coconut shell |journal=Carbon |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=601–604 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0008-6223(92)90178-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coconut shells produce activated carbon with more micropores than does charcoal made from wood.&lt;ref name="Y-Carbon" /&gt;

=====Activated carbon fibres=====
Activated carbon fibres (ACF) are produced from activated carbon and have a typical diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;µm. They can have micropores with a very narrow pore-size distribution that can be readily controlled. The surface area of ACF woven into a textile is about {{val|2500|u=m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g}}. Advantages of ACF electrodes include low electrical resistance along the fibre axis and good contact to the collector.&lt;ref name="Pandolfo" /&gt;

As for activated carbon, ACF electrodes exhibit predominantly double-layer capacitance with a small amount of pseudocapacitance due to their micropores.

=====Carbon aerogel=====
[[File:Aerogel hand.jpg|thumb|right|A block of silica aerogel in hand]]

Carbon [[aerogel]] is a highly porous, [[Manufacturing|synthetic]], [[ultralight material]] derived from an organic gel in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with a gas.

Aerogel electrodes are made via [[pyrolysis]] of [[resorcinol]]-[[formaldehyde]] aerogels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=U. |last1=Fischer |first2=R. |last2=Saliger |first3=V. |last3=Bock |first4=R. |last4=Petricevic |first5=J. |last5=Fricke |title=Carbon aerogels as electrode material in supercapacitors |journal=J. Porous Mat. |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=October 1997 |pages=281–285 |doi=10.1023/A:1009629423578}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are more conductive than most activated carbons. They enable thin and mechanically stable electrodes with a thickness in the range of several hundred [[micrometre]]s (µm) and with uniform pore size. Aerogel electrodes also provide mechanical and vibration stability for supercapacitors used in high-vibration environments.

Researchers have created a carbon aerogel electrode with [[gravimetry|gravimetric]] densities of about 400–1200&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g and volumetric capacitance of 104&amp;nbsp;F/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, yielding a specific energy of {{val|325|u=kJ/kg}} ({{val|90|u=Wh/kg}}) and specific power of {{val|20|u=W/g}}.&lt;ref name = "AIP"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lerner |first=E.J. |title=Less is more with aerogels: A laboratory curiosity develops practical uses |work=The Industrial Physicist |pages=26–30 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=October 2004 |url=http://www.shivershield.com/docs/AmericanInstituteofPhysics.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=LaClair |first=M. |title=Replacing energy storage with carbon aerogel supercapacitors |work=Power Electronics |publisher=Penton |date=Feb 1, 2003 |url=http://powerelectronics.com/content/replacing-energy-storage-carbon-aerogel-supercapacitors |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard aerogel electrodes exhibit predominantly double-layer capacitance. Aerogel electrodes that incorporate [[composite material]] can add a high amount of pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultrahigh Specific Capacitances for Supercapacitors Achieved by Nickel Cobaltite/Carbon Aerogel Composites|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201201176/abstract|journal = Advanced Functional Materials|date = 2012-12-05|issn = 1616-3028|pages = 5038–5043|volume = 22|issue = 23|doi = 10.1002/adfm.201201176|first = Hsing-Chi|last = Chien|first2 = Wei-Yun|last2 = Cheng|first3 = Yong-Hui|last3 = Wang|first4 = Shih-Yuan|last4 = Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Carbide-derived carbon=====
[[File:Figure4CDC.jpg|thumb|right|Pore size distributions for different carbide precursors.]]

[[Carbide-derived carbon]] (CDC), also known as tunable nanoporous carbon, is a family of carbon materials derived from [[carbide]] precursors, such as binary [[silicon carbide]] and [[titanium carbide]], that are transformed into pure carbon via physical (e.g., [[thermal decomposition]]) or chemical (e.g., [[halogenation]]) processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Presser |first1=V. |last2=Heon |first2=M. |last3=Gogotsi |first3=Y. |title=Carbide-derived carbons – From porous networks to nanotubes and graphene |journal=Adv.

Carbide-derived carbons can exhibit high surface area and tunable pore diameters (from micropores to mesopores) to maximize ion confinement, increasing pseudocapacitance by faradaic {{chem|H|2}} adsorption treatment. CDC electrodes with tailored pore design offer as much as 75% greater specific energy than conventional activated carbons.

{{As of|2015}}, a CDC supercapacitor offered a specific energy of 10.1&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg, 3,500&amp;nbsp;F capacitance and over one million charge-discharge cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skeletontech.com/datasheets/skelcap-energy-en.pdf |format=PDF |title=SkelCap High Energy Ultracapacitors - Data Sheet |publisher=Skeleton Technologies |access-date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphene has a theoretical specific surface area of 2630&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g which can theoretically lead to a capacitance of 550&amp;nbsp;F/g.

In one embodiment, a graphene-based supercapacitor uses curved graphene sheets that do not stack face-to-face, forming mesopores that are accessible to and wettable by ionic electrolytes at voltages up to 4&amp;nbsp;V.

The two-dimensional structure of graphene improves charging and discharging. Charge carriers in vertically oriented sheets can quickly migrate into or out of the deeper structures of the electrode, thus increasing currents.

[[Carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs), also called buckytubes, are [[carbon]] [[molecule]]s with a [[cylindrical]] [[nanostructure]]. They have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphite. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, and the combination of chiral angle and radius controls properties such as electrical conductivity, electrolyte wettability and ion access. Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). The latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian [[matryoshka doll]]s. SWNTs have diameters ranging between 1 and 3&amp;nbsp;nm. MWNTs have thicker [[coaxial]] walls, separated by spacing (0.34&amp;nbsp;nm) that is close to graphene's interlayer distance.

Nanotubes can grow vertically on the collector substrate, such as a silicon wafer. Typical lengths are 20 to 100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=M.Sc. |first=S. |last=Akbulut |title=Optimization of Carbon Nanotube Supercapacitor Electrode |publisher=Graduate School of Vanderbilt University | location =Nashville, Tennessee |year=2011 |url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-07262011-155004/unrestricted/serkanakbulut.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SWNT-based supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte was systematically studied at University of Delaware in Prof. Bingqing Wei's group. Li et al., for the first time, discovered that the ion-size effect and the electrode-electrolyte wettability are the dominant factors affecting the electrochemical behavior of flexible SWCNTs-supercapacitors in different 1 molar aqueous electrolytes with different anions and cations. The experimental results also showed for flexible supercapacitor that it is suggested to put enough pressure between the two electrodes to improve the aqueous electrolyte CNT supercapacitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=X. |last1=Li |author2=J.

CNTs can store about the same charge as activated carbon per unit surface area, but nanotubes' surface is arranged in a regular pattern, providing greater wettability. SWNTs have a high theoretical specific surface area of 1315&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g, while that for MWNTs is lower and is determined by the diameter of the tubes and degree of nesting, compared with a surface area of about 3000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g of activated carbons. Nevertheless, CNTs have higher capacitance than activated carbon electrodes, e.g., 102&amp;nbsp;F/g for MWNTs and 180&amp;nbsp;F/g for SWNTs.&lt;ref&gt;Wen Lu, ADA Technologies Inc., [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/10024/InTech-Carbon_nanotube_supercapacitors.pdf Carbon Nanotube Supercapacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

MWNTs have mesopores that allow for easy access of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. As the pore size approaches the size of the ion solvation shell, the solvent molecules are partially stripped, resulting in larger ionic packing density and increased faradaic storage capability. However, the considerable volume change during repeated intercalation and depletion decreases their mechanical stability. To this end, research to increase surface area, mechanical strength, electrical conductivity and chemical stability is ongoing.&lt;ref name="Arepalli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway-Birss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = B.

MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are typical materials used as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, since they have the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode (linear dependence on current versus voltage curve) as well as exhibiting faradaic behavior. Additionally, the charge storage originates from electron-transfer mechanisms rather than accumulation of ions in the electrochemical double layer. Pseudocapacitors were created through faradaic redox reactions that occur within the active electrode materials. More research was focused on transition-metal oxides such as MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since transition-metal oxides have a lower cost compared to noble metal oxides such as RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, the charge storage mechanisms of transition-metal oxides are based predominantly on pseudocapacitance. Two mechanisms of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; charge storage behavior were introduced. The first mechanism implies the intercalation of protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or alkali metal cations (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the bulk of the material upon reduction followed by deintercalation upon oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Charge Storage Mechanism of MnO2 Electrode Used in Aqueous Electrochemical Capacitor|journal=Chem. Mater. |year=2004|volume=16| pages = 3184–3190|doi=10.1021/cm049649j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) +e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} MnOOH(C)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Novel Electrode Materials for Thin-Film Ultracapacitors: Comparison of Electrochemical Properties of Sol-Gel-Derived and Electrodeposited Manganese Dioxide|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=147 |issue=2| pages = 444–450 |year=2000|doi=10.1149/1.1393216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second mechanism is based on the surface adsorption of electrolyte cations on MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:(MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;surface&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;surface&lt;/sub&gt;

Not every material that exhibits faradaic behavior can be used as an electrode for pseudocapacitors, such as Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since it is a battery type electrode (non-linear dependence on current versus voltage curve).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Brousse| first=Thierry| last2=Bélanger|first2=Daniel|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey W.|date=2015-01-01|title=To Be or Not To Be Pseudocapacitive?| url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/5/A5185|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society| language=en|volume=162|issue=5|pages=A5185–A5189| doi=10.1149/2.0201505jes| issn=0013-4651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Metal oxides=====
Brian Evans Conway's research&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"/&gt; described electrodes of transition metal oxides that exhibited high amounts of pseudocapacitance. Oxides of transition metals including [[ruthenium]] ({{chem|RuO|2}}), [[iridium]] ({{chem|IrO|2}}), [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4}}), [[manganese]] ({{chem|MnO|2}}) or sulfides such as [[titanium sulfide]] ({{chem|TiS|2}}) alone or in combination generate strong faradaic electron–transferring reactions combined with low resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jayalakshmi | first1 = M. | last2 = Balasubramanian | first2 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Simple Capacitors to Supercapacitors - An Overview | url = http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol3/3111196.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Int.

Jow, [http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/142/8/2699.abstract Hydrous Ruthenium Oxide as an Electrode Material for Electrochemical Capacitors], ECS, February 8, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Charge/discharge takes place over a window of about 1.2&amp;nbsp;V per electrode. This pseudocapacitance of about 720&amp;nbsp;F/g is roughly 100 times higher than for double-layer capacitance using activated carbon electrodes. These transition metal electrodes offer excellent reversibility, with several hundred-thousand cycles. However, ruthenium is expensive and the 2.4&amp;nbsp;V voltage window for this capacitor limits their applications to military and space applications.
Das et al. reported highest capacitance value (1715 F/g) for ruthenium oxide based supercapacitor with electrodeposited ruthenium oxide onto porous single wall carbon nanotube film electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Engineered Macroporosity in Single-Wall Carbon Nanotube Films| url = | journal = Nano Lett. | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 677–683 | doi=10.1021/nl803168s| bibcode = 2009NanoL...9..677D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high specific capacitance of 1715 F/g has been reported which closely approaches the predicted theoretical maximum {{chem|RuO|2}} capacitance of 2000 F/g.

In 2014 a {{chem|RuO|2}} supercapacitor anchored on a [[graphene foam]] electrode delivered specific capacitance of 502.78 F/g and areal capacitance of 1.11 F/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) leading to a specific energy of 39.28 Wh/kg and specific power of 128.01&amp;nbsp;kW/kg over 8,000 cycles with constant performance. The device was a three-dimensional (3D) sub-5&amp;nbsp;nm hydrous ruthenium-anchored [[graphene]] and [[carbon nanotube]] (CNT) hybrid foam (RGM) architecture. The graphene foam was conformally covered with hybrid networks of {{chem|RuO|2}} nanoparticles and anchored CNTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep04452| title = Hydrous Ruthenium Oxide Nanoparticles Anchored to Graphene and Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Foam for Supercapacitors| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 4| year = 2014| last1 = Wang | first1 = W. | last2 = Guo | first2 = S. | last3 = Lee | first3 = I. | last4 = Ahmed | first4 = K. | last5 = Zhong | first5 = J. | last6 = Favors | first6 = Z. | last7 = Zaera | first7 = F. | last8 = Ozkan | first8 = M. | last9 = Ozkan | first9 = C.

Less expensive oxides of iron, vanadium, nickel and cobalt have been tested in aqueous electrolytes, but none has been investigated as much as manganese dioxide ({{chem|MnO|2}}). However, none of these oxides are in commercial use.&lt;ref name="Simon-Gogotsi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Y.Gogotsi | year = | title = Materials for electrochemical capacitors | url = http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v7/n11/full/nmat2297.html | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 845–854| doi=10.1038/nmat2297 | pmid=18956000 | date=November 2008| bibcode = 2008NatMa...7..845S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Conductive polymers=====
Another approach uses electron-conducting polymers as pseudocapacitive material. Although mechanically weak, [[conductive polymer]]s have high [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]], resulting in a low ESR and a relatively high capacitance. Such conducting polymers include [[polyaniline]], [[polythiophene]], [[polypyrrole]] and [[polyacetylene]]. Such electrodes also employ electrochemical doping or dedoping of the polymers with anions and cations. Electrodes made from or coated with conductive polymers have costs comparable to carbon electrodes.

Conducting polymer electrodes generally suffer from limited cycling stability.&lt;ref name="Volfkovich"&gt;Yu.M. Volfkovich, A.A. Mikhailin, D.A. Bograchev, V.E. Sosenkin and V.S.

====Electrodes for hybrid capacitors====
All commercial hybrid supercapacitors are asymmetric. They combine an electrode with high amount of [[pseudocapacitance]] with an electrode with a high amount of [[double-layer capacitance]]. In such systems the faradaic pseudocapacitance electrode with their higher capacitance provides high [[specific energy]] while the non-faradaic EDLC electrode enables high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]]. An advantage of the hybrid-type supercapacitors compared with symmetrical EDLC's is their higher specific capacitance value as well as their higher rated voltage and correspondingly their higher specific energy.&lt;ref&gt;Yu.M. Volfkovich, [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/26963/InTech-Studies_of_supercapacitor_carbon_electrodes_with_high_pseudocapacitance.pdf Studies of Supercapacitor Carbon Electrodes with High Pseudocapacitance]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Composite electrodes=====
Composite electrodes for hybrid-type supercapacitors are constructed from carbon-based material with incorporated or deposited pseudocapacitive active materials like metal oxides and conducting polymers. {{As of|2013}} most research for supercapacitors explores composite electrodes.

CNTs give a backbone for a homogeneous distribution of metal oxide or electrically conducting polymers (ECPs), producing good pseudocapacitance and good double-layer capacitance. These electrodes achieve higher capacitances than either pure carbon or pure metal oxide or polymer-based electrodes. This is attributed to the accessibility of the nanotubes' tangled mat structure, which allows a uniform coating of pseudocapacitive materials and three-dimensional charge distribution. The process to anchor pseudocapacitve materials usually uses a hydrothermal process. However, a recent researcher, Li et al., from the University of Delaware found a facile and scalable approach to precipitate MnO2 on a SWNT film to make an organic-electrolyte based supercapacitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.011 | volume=1 | title=Facile synthesis and super capacitive behavior of SWNT/MnO2 hybrid films | journal=Nano Energy | pages=479–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to enhance CNT electrodes is by doping with a pseudocapacitive dopant as in [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s. In this case the relatively small lithium atoms intercalate between the layers of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gualous et al.: ''[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/37/31/49/PDF/ESSCAP2008_Venet_2.pdf Lithium Ion capacitor characterization and modelling]'' ESSCAP’08 −3rd European Symposium on Supercapacitors and Applications, Rome/Italy 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The anode is made of lithium-doped carbon, which enables lower negative potential with a cathode made of activated carbon. This results in a larger voltage of 3.8-4 V that prevents electrolyte oxidation. As of 2007 they had achieved capacitance of 550 F/g.&lt;ref name="Schindall" /&gt; and reach a specific energy up to 14&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg ({{val|50.4|u=kJ/kg}}).&lt;ref name=FDK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/01/fdk-to-begin-ma.html |title=FDK To Begin Mass Production of High-Capacity Li-Ion Capacitors; Automotive and Renewable Energy Applications |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Battery-type electrodes=====
Rechargeable battery electrodes influenced the development of electrodes for new hybrid-type supercapacitor electrodes as for [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name="Nanohybrid"&gt;K. Naoi, W. Naoi, Sh. Aoyagi, J. Miyamoto, T. Kamino, [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar200308h New Generation "Nanohybrid Supercapacitor"], American Chemical Society, Chem. Res., Article ASAP, DOI: 10.1021/ar200308h, March 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a carbon EDLC electrode in an asymmetric construction offers this configuration higher specific energy than typical supercapacitors with higher specific power, longer cycle life and faster charging and recharging times than batteries.

=====Asymmetric electrodes (pseudo/EDLC)=====
Recently some asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors were developed in which the positive electrode were based on a real pseudocapacitive metal oxide electrode (not a composite electrode), and the negative electrode on an EDLC activated carbon electrode.

An advantage of this type of supercapacitors is their higher voltage and correspondingly their higher specific energy (up to 10-20&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg (36-72&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg)).&lt;ref&gt;Yu.M. Volfkovich, Studies of Supercapacitor Carbon Electrodes with High Pseudocapacitance [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/26963/InTech-Studies_of_supercapacitor_carbon_electrodes_with_high_pseudocapacitance.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as known no commercial offered supercapacitors with such kind of asymmetric electrodes are on the market.

===Electrolytes===
[[Electrolyte]]s consist of a [[solvent]] and [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] that dissociate into positive [[cation]]s and negative [[anion]]s, making the electrolyte electrically conductive. The more ions the electrolyte contains, the better its [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]]. In supercapacitors electrolytes are the electrically conductive connection between the two electrodes. Additionally, in supercapacitors the electrolyte provides the molecules for the separating monolayer in the Helmholtz double-layer and delivers the ions for pseudocapacitance.

The electrolyte determines the capacitor's characteristics: its operating voltage, temperature range, ESR and capacitance. With the same activated carbon electrode an aqueous electrolyte achieves capacitance values of 160&amp;nbsp;F/g, while an organic electrolyte achieves only 100&amp;nbsp;F/g.&lt;ref name="Simon-Burke"&gt;P. Simon, A. Burke, [http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/spr/spr08/spr08_p38-43.pdf Nanostructured Carbons: Double-Layer Capacitance and More]&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrolyte must be chemically inert and not chemically attack the other materials in the capacitor to ensure long time stable behavior of the capacitor's electrical parameters. The electrolyte's viscosity must be low enough to wet the porous, sponge-like structure of the electrodes. An ideal electrolyte does not exist, forcing a compromise between performance and other requirements.

====Aqueous====
[[Water]] is a relatively good solvent for [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] chemicals. Treated with [[acid]]s such as [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}), [[alkali]]s such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), or [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as quaternary [[phosphonium]] salts, [[sodium perchlorate]] ({{chem|NaClO|4}}), [[lithium perchlorate]] ({{chem|LiClO|4}}) or lithium hexafluoride [[arsenate]] ({{chem|LiAsF|6}}), water offers relatively high conductivity values of about 100 to 1000&amp;nbsp;m[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/cm. Aqueous electrolytes have a dissociation voltage of 1.15&amp;nbsp;V per electrode (2.3&amp;nbsp;V capacitor voltage) and a relatively low [[operating temperature]] range. They are used in supercapacitors with low specific energy and high specific power.

====Organic====
Electrolytes with [[Organic chemistry|organic]] solvents such as [[acetonitrile]], [[propylene carbonate]], [[tetrahydrofuran]], [[diethyl carbonate]], [[Gamma-Butyrolactone|γ-butyrolactone]] and solutions with quaternary [[ammonium salt]]s or alkyl ammonium salts such as tetraethylammonium [[tetrafluoroborate]] ({{chem|N(Et)|4|BF|4|}}&lt;ref&gt;Tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate - Compound Summary{{PubChem|2724277}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or triethyl (metyl) tetrafluoroborate ({{chem|NMe(Et)|3|BF|4}}) are more expensive than aqueous electrolytes, but they have a higher dissociation voltage of typically 1.35&amp;nbsp;V per electrode (2.7&amp;nbsp;V capacitor voltage), and a higher temperature range. The lower electrical conductivity of organic solvents (10 to 60&amp;nbsp;mS/cm) leads to a lower specific power, but since the specific energy increases with the square of the voltage, a higher specific energy.

===Separators===
Separators have to physically separate the two electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like [[polyacrylonitrile]] or [[Kapton]], woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.&lt;ref&gt;A. Schneuwly, R. Gallay, [http://www.garmanage.com/atelier/root/public/Contacting/biblio.cache/PCIM2000.pdf Properties and applications of supercapacitors, From the state-of-the-art to future trends], PCIM 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Laforgue et al. [http://www.emc-mec.ca/ev2011ve/proceedings/EV2011VE26EES4_Lucie%20Robitaille.pdf Development of New Generation Supercapacitors for Transportation Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collectors and housing===
Current collectors connect the electrodes to the capacitor's terminals. The collector is either sprayed onto the electrode or is a metal foil. They must be able to distribute peak currents of up to 100&amp;nbsp;A.

If the housing is made out of a metal (typically aluminum) the collectors should be made from the same material to avoid forming a corrosive [[galvanic cell]].

==Electrical parameters==

===Capacitance===
[[File:Superkondensator-Porenmodell-engl.png|thumb|right|Schematic illustration of the capacitance behavior resulting out of the porous structure of the electrodes]]
[[File:Supercapacitor-Equi-Circuit.png|thumb|Equivalent circuit with cascaded RC elements]]
[[File:EDLC-Cap-Frequency-dependent.png|thumb|right| Frequency depending of the capacitance value of a 50&amp;nbsp;F supercapacitor]]

Capacitance values for commercial capacitors are specified as "rated capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;". This is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. The value for an actual component must be within the limits given by the specified tolerance. Typical values are in the range of [[farad]]s (F), three to six [[orders of magnitude]] larger than those of electrolytic capacitors.

The capacitance value results from the energy &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; (expressed in [[Joule]]) of a loaded capacitor loaded via a [[Direct current|DC]] voltage V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;W=\frac{1}{2}\cdot C_\text{DC} \cdot V_\text{DC}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This value is also called the "DC capacitance".

====Measurement====
Conventional capacitors are normally measured with a small [[Alternating current|AC]] voltage (0.5&amp;nbsp;V) and a frequency of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kHz depending on the capacitor type. The AC capacitance measurement offers fast results, important for industrial production lines. The capacitance value of a supercapacitor depends strongly on the measurement frequency, which is related to the porous electrode structure and the limited electrolyte's ion mobility. Even at a low frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, the measured capacitance value drops from 100 to 20 percent of the DC capacitance value.

This extraordinary strong frequency dependence can be explained by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC [[time constant]]s. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.

[[File:EDLC-Capacitance-measuring.png|thumb|right|Illustration of the measurement conditions for measuring the capacitance of supercapacitors]]

Out of the reason of the very strong frequency dependence of the capacitance this electrical parameter has to be measured with a special constant current charge and discharge measurement, defined in [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards 62391-1 and -2.

Measurement starts with charging the capacitor. The voltage has to be applied and after the constant current/constant voltage power supply has achieved the rated voltage, the capacitor has to be charged for 30 minutes. Next, the capacitor has to be discharged with a constant discharge current I&lt;sub&gt;discharge&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for the voltage to drop from 80% (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to 40% (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the rated voltage is measured. The capacitance value is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{total} = I_\text{discharge} \cdot \frac{t_2-t_1}{V_1-V_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the discharge current is determined by the application. The IEC standard defines four classes:
# Memory backup, discharge current in mA = 1 • C (F)
# Energy storage, discharge current in mA = 0,4 • C (F) • V (V)
# Power, discharge current in mA = 4 • C (F) • V (V)
# Instantaneous power, discharge current in mA = 40 • C (F) • V (V)

The measurement methods employed by individual manufacturers are mainly comparable to the standardized methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capcomp.de/fileadmin/document_download/NESSCAP_Tech-Info/NESSCAP_Tech_Guide_2008.pdf ''Nesscap Ultracapacitor - Technical Guide'']{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} NESSCAP Co., Ltd. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maxwell_Product Guide"&gt;Maxwell BOOSTCAP [http://www.maxwell.com/products/ultracapacitors/docs/1014627_BOOSTCAP_PRODUCT_GUIDE.PDF ''Product Guide – Maxwell Technologies BOOSTCAP Ultracapacitors– Doc. No. 1014627.1''] Maxwell Technologies, Inc. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The standardized measuring method is too time consuming for manufacturers to use during production for each individual component. For industrial produced capacitors the capacitance value is instead measured with a faster low frequency AC voltage and a correlation factor is used to compute the rated capacitance.

This frequency dependence affects capacitor operation. Rapid charge and discharge cycles mean that neither the rated capacitance value nor specific energy are available. In this case the rated capacitance value is recalculated for each application condition.

===Operating voltage===
[[File:OneFarad5.5Velectrolyticcapacitor.jpg|thumb|right|A 5.5 volt supercapacitor is constructed out of two single cells, each rated to at least 2.75 volts, in series connection]]
Supercapacitors are low voltage components. Safe operation requires that the voltage remain within specified limits. The rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously and remain within the specified temperature range. Capacitors should never be subjected to voltages continuously in excess of the rated voltage.

The rated voltage includes a safety margin against the electrolyte's [[breakdown voltage]] at which the electrolyte [[Chemical decomposition|decomposes]]. The breakdown voltage decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. [[water]] splits into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxide]]. The solvent molecules then cannot separate the electrical charges from each other. Higher voltages than rated voltage cause hydrogen gas formation or a short circuit.

Standard supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte normally are specified with a rated voltage of 2.1 to 2.3&amp;nbsp;V and capacitors with organic solvents with 2.5 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;V. [[Lithium-ion capacitor]]s with doped electrodes may reach a rated voltage of 3.8 to 4&amp;nbsp;V, but have a lower voltage limit of about 2.2&amp;nbsp;V.

Operating supercapacitors below the rated voltage improves the long-time behavior of the electrical parameters. Capacitance values and internal resistance during cycling are more stable and lifetime and charge/discharge cycles may be extended.&lt;ref name="maxwell_Product Guide" /&gt;

Higher application voltages require connecting cells in series. Since each component has a slight difference in capacitance value and ESR, it is necessary to actively or passively balance them to stabilize the applied voltage. Passive balancing employs [[resistor]]s in parallel with the supercapacitors. Active balancing may include electronic voltage management above a threshold that varies the current.

===Internal resistance===
[[File:EDLC-Internal-resistance-measuring.png|thumb|right|The internal DC resistance can be calculated out of the voltage drop obtained from the intersection of the auxiliary line extended from the straight part and the time base at the time of discharge start]]

Charging/discharging a supercapacitor is connected to the movement of charge carriers (ions) in the electrolyte across the separator to the electrodes and into their porous structure. Losses occur during this movement that can be measured as the internal DC resistance.

With the electrical model of cascaded, series-connected RC (resistor/capacitor) elements in the electrode pores, the internal resistance increases with the increasing penetration depth of the charge carriers into the pores. The internal DC resistance is time dependent and increases during charge/discharge. In applications often only the switch-on and switch-off range is interesting. The internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated from the voltage drop ΔV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of discharge, starting with a constant discharge current I&lt;sub&gt;discharge&lt;/sub&gt;. It is obtained from the intersection of the auxiliary line extended from the straight part and the time base at the time of discharge start (see picture right). Resistance can be calculated by:
:&lt;math&gt; R_\text{i}= \frac{\Delta V_2}{I_\text{discharge}}&lt;/math&gt;
The discharge current I&lt;sub&gt;discharge&lt;/sub&gt; for the measurement of internal resistance can be taken from the classification according to IEC 62391-1.

This internal DC resistance R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; should not be confused with the internal AC resistance called [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) normally specified for capacitors. It is measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. ESR is much smaller than DC resistance. ESR is not relevant for calculating superconductor inrush currents or other peak currents.

R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; determines several supercapacitor properties. It limits the charge and discharge peak currents as well as charge/discharge times. R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and the capacitance C results in the [[time constant]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = R_\text{i} \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
This time constant determines the charge/discharge time. A 100&amp;nbsp;F capacitor with an internal resistance of 30&amp;nbsp;mΩ for example, has a time constant of 0.03 • 100 = 3&amp;nbsp;s. After 3 seconds charging with a current limited only by internal resistance, the capacitor has 63.2% of full charge (or is discharged to 36.8% of full charge).

Standard capacitors with constant internal resistance fully charge during about 5&amp;nbsp;τ. Since internal resistance increases with charge/discharge, actual times cannot be calculated with this formula. Thus, charge/discharge time depends on specific individual construction details.

===Current load and cycle stability===
Because supercapacitors operate without forming chemical bonds, current loads, including charge, discharge and peak currents are not limited by reaction constraints. Current load and cycle stability can be much higher than for rechargeable batteries. Current loads are limited only by internal resistance, which may be substantially lower than for batteries.

Internal resistance "R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;" and charge/discharge currents or peak currents "I" generate internal heat losses "P&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;" according to:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{loss} = R_\text{i} \cdot I^2&lt;/math&gt;

This heat must be released and distributed to the ambient environment to maintain operating temperatures below the specified maximum temperature.

Heat generally defines capacitor lifetime because of electrolyte diffusion. The heat generation coming from current loads should be smaller than 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] at maximum ambient temperature (which has only minor influence on expected lifetime). For that reason the specified charge and discharge currents for frequent cycling are determined by internal resistance.

The specified cycle parameters under maximal conditions include charge and discharge current, pulse duration and frequency. They are specified for a defined temperature range and over the full voltage range for a defined lifetime. They can differ enormously depending on the combination of electrode porosity, pore size and electrolyte. Generally a lower current load increases capacitor life and increases the number of cycles. This can be achieved either by a lower voltage range or slower charging and discharging.&lt;ref name="maxwell_Product Guide" /&gt;

Supercapacitors (except those with polymer electrodes) can potentially support more than one million charge/discharge cycles without substantial capacity drops or internal resistance increases. Beneath the higher current load is this the second great advantage of supercapacitors over batteries. The stability results from the dual electrostatic and electrochemical storage principles.

The specified charge and discharge currents can be significantly exceeded by lowering the frequency or by single pulses. Heat generated by a single pulse may be spread over the time until the next pulse occurs to ensure a relatively small average heat increase. Such a "peak power current" for power applications for supercapacitors of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;F can provide a maximum peak current of about 1000&amp;nbsp;A.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, [http://www.maxwell.com/products/ultracapacitors/docs/datasheet_k2_series_1015370.pdf K2 series]&lt;/ref&gt; Such high currents generate high thermal stress and high electromagnetic forces that can damage the electrode-collector connection requiring robust design and construction of the capacitors.

===Device capacitance and resistance dependence on operating voltage and temperature===
[[File:Variable capacitance vs device voltage.png|thumb|Measured device capacitance across an EDLC's operating voltage]]
Device parameters such as capacitance initial resistance and steady state resistance are not constant but are variable and dependent on the device's operating voltage. Device capacitance will have a measurable increase as the operating voltage increases. For example: a 100F device can be seen to vary 26% from its maximum capacitance over its entire operational voltage range. Similar dependence on operating voltage is seen in steady state resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;) and initial resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;).

Device properties can also be seen to be dependent on device temperature. As the temperature of the device changes either through operation of varying ambient temperature, the internal properties such as capacitance and resistance will vary as well. Device capacitance is seen to increase as the operating temperature increases.&lt;ref name="Marts_John_EDLC" /&gt;

===Energy capacity===

[[File:Supercapacitors-vs-batteries-chart.png|thumb|right|[[Ragone chart]] showing specific power vs. specific energy of various capacitors and batteries{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}]]

Supercapacitors occupy the gap between high power/low energy [[electrolytic capacitor]]s and low power/high energy rechargeable [[Rechargeable batteries|batteries]]. The energy W&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (expressed in [[Joule]]) that can be stored in a capacitor is given by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;W_\text{max}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot C_\text{total} \cdot V_\text{loaded}^2&lt;/math&gt;

This formula describes the amount of energy stored and is often used to describe new research successes. However, only part of the stored energy is available to applications, because the voltage drop and the time constant over the internal resistance mean that some of the stored charge is inaccessible. The effective realized amount of energy W&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced by the used voltage difference between V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and can be represented as:&lt;ref name="Wen Lu"&gt;Wen Lu, [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/10024/InTech-Carbon_nanotube_supercapacitors.pdf Carbon Nanotube Supercapacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;W_\text{eff}=\frac{1}{2}\ C \cdot\ ( V_\text{max}^2 - V_\text{min}^2 )&lt;/math&gt;

This formula also represents the energy asymmetric voltage components such as lithium ion capacitors.

===Specific energy and specific power===

The amount of energy that can be stored in a capacitor per mass of that capacitor is called its [[specific energy]]. Specific energy is measured [[Gravimetry|gravimetrically]] (per unit of [[mass]]) in [[Watt-hour per kilogram|watt-hours per kilogram]] (Wh/kg).

The amount of energy can be stored in a capacitor per volume of that capacitor is called its energy density. Energy density is measured [[volume]]trically (per unit of volume) in watt-hours per [[litre]] (Wh/l).

{{As of|2013}} commercial specific energies range from around 0.5 to {{val|15|u=Wh/kg}}. For comparison, an aluminum electrolytic capacitor stores typically 0.01 to {{val|0.3|u=Wh/kg}}, while a conventional [[lead-acid battery]] stores typically 30 to {{val|40|u=Wh/kg}} and modern [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] 100 to {{val|265|u=Wh/kg}}. Supercapacitors can therefore store 10 to 100 times more energy than electrolytic capacitors, but only one tenth as much as batteries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For reference, petrol fuel has a specific energy of 44.4 MJ/kg or {{val|12,300|u=Wh/kg}} (in vehicle propulsion, the efficiency of energy conversions should be considered resulting in {{val|3,700|u=Wh/kg}} considering a typical 30% internal combustion engine efficiency).

Commercial energy density (also called volumetric specific energy in some literature) varies widely but in general range from around 5 to {{val|8|u=Wh/l}}. Units of liters and dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be used interchangeably. In comparison, petrol fuel has an energy density of 32.4 MJ/l or {{val|9,000|u=Wh/l}}.

Although the specific energy of supercapacitors is insufficient compared with batteries, capacitors have the important advantage of the [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]]. Specific power describes the speed at which energy can be delivered to/absorbed from the [[Electrical load|load]]. The maximum power is given by the formula:&lt;ref name="Wen Lu" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_\text{max}=\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{V^2}{R_i} &lt;/math&gt;

with V = voltage applied and R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the internal DC resistance of the capacitor.

Specific power is measured either gravimetrically in kilowatts per kilogram (kW/kg, specific power) or volumetrically in kilowatts per litre (kW/l, power density).

The described maximum power P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; specifies the power of a theoretical rectangular single maximum current peak of a given voltage. In real circuits the current peak is not rectangular and the voltage is smaller, caused by the voltage drop. IEC 62391–2 established a more realistic effective power P&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; for supercapacitors for power applications:

: &lt;math&gt;P_\text{eff}=\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{V^2}{R_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Supercapacitor specific power is typically 10 to 100 times greater than for batteries and can reach values up to 15&amp;nbsp;kW/kg.

[[Ragone chart]]s relate energy to power and are a valuable tool for characterizing and visualizing energy storage components. With such a diagram, the position of specific power and specific energy of different storage technologies is easily to compare, see diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christen | first1 = T. | last2 = Ohler | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Optimizing energy storage components using Ragone plots | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775302002288 | journal = J.

===Lifetime===
[[File:EDLC-Life time curves.png|thumb|right|The lifetime of supercapacitors depends mainly on the capacitor temperature and the voltage applied]]

Since supercapacitors do not rely on chemical changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on the rate of evaporation of the liquid electrolyte. This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current load, current cycle frequency and voltage. Current load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature in the center of a capacitor body. The higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.

Evaporation generally results in decreasing capacitance and increasing internal resistance. According to IEC/EN 62391-2 capacitance reductions of over 30% or internal resistance exceeding four times its data sheet specifications are considered "wear-out failures", implying that the component has reached end-of-life. The capacitors are operable, but with reduced capabilities. Whether the aberration of the parameters have any influence on the proper functionality or not depends on the application of the capacitors.

Such large changes of electrical parameters specified in IEC/EN 62391-2 are usually unacceptable for high current load applications. Components that support high current loads use much smaller limits, e.g., 20% loss of capacitance or double the internal resistance.&lt;ref name="maxwell_lifetime"&gt;Maxwell Application Note [http://www.maxwell.com/images/documents/applicationnote_1012839_1.pdf ''Application Note - Energy Storage Modules Life Duration Estimation.''] Maxwell Technologies, Inc. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The narrower definition is important for such applications, since heat increases linearly with increasing internal resistance and the maximum temperature should not be exceeded. Temperatures higher than specified can destroy the capacitor.

The real application lifetime of supercapacitors, also called "[[service life]]", "life expectancy" or "load life", can reach 10 to 15 years or more at room temperature. Such long periods cannot be tested by manufacturers. Hence, they specify the expected capacitor lifetime at the maximum temperature and voltage conditions. The results are specified in datasheets using the notation "tested time (hours)/max. temperature (°C)", such as "5000&amp;nbsp;h/65&amp;nbsp;°C". With this value and expressions derived from historical data, lifetimes can be estimated for lower temperature conditions.

Datasheet lifetime specification is tested by the manufactures using an [[accelerated aging]] test called "endurance test" with maximum temperature and voltage over a specified time. For a "zero defect" product policy during this test no wear out or total failure may occur.

The lifetime specification from datasheets can be used to estimate the expected lifetime for a given design. The "10-degrees-rule" used for electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte is used in those estimations and can be used for supercapacitors. This rule employs the [[Arrhenius equation]], a simple formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. For every 10&amp;nbsp;°C reduction in operating temperature, the estimated life doubles.

:&lt;math&gt;L_x =L_0\cdot 2^\frac{T_0-T_x}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

With
*L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = estimated lifetime
*L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = specified lifetime
*T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = upper specified capacitor temperature
*T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = actual operating temperature of the capacitor cell

Calculated with this formula, capacitors specified with 5000&amp;nbsp;h at 65&amp;nbsp;°C, have an estimated lifetime of 20,000&amp;nbsp;h at 45&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lifetimes are also dependent on the operating voltage, because the development of gas in the liquid electrolyte depends on the voltage. The lower the voltage the smaller the gas development and the longer the lifetime. No general formula relates voltage to lifetime. The voltage dependent curves shown from the picture are an empirical result from one manufacturer.

Life expectancy for power applications may be also limited by current load or number of cycles. This limitation has to be specified by the relevant manufacturer and is strongly type dependent.

===Self-discharge===
Storing electrical energy in the double-layer separates the charge carriers within the pores by distances in the range of molecules. Over this short distance irregularities can occur, leading to a small exchange of charge carriers and gradual discharge. This self-discharge is called [[leakage current]]. Leakage depends on capacitance, voltage, temperature and the chemical stability of the electrode/electrolyte combination. At room temperature leakage is so low that it is specified as time to self-discharge. Supercapacitor self-discharge time is specified in hours, days or weeks. As an example, a 5.5&amp;nbsp;V/F Panasonic "Goldcapacitor" specifies a voltage drop at 20&amp;nbsp;°C from 5.5&amp;nbsp;V to 3&amp;nbsp;V in 600 hours (25 days or 3.6 weeks) for a double cell capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;Panasonic Electronic Devices CO., LTD.: ''[http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABC0000/ABC0000TE5.pdf Gold capacitors Characteristics data] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111004649/http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf/ABC0000/ABC0000TE5.pdf |date=2014-01-11 }}'' In: Technical Guide of Electric Double Layer Capacitors, Edition 7.4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post charge voltage relaxation===
[[File:Voltage Relaxation.png|thumb|A graph plotting voltage over time, after the application of a charge]]
It has been noticed that after the EDLC experiences a charge or discharge, the voltage will drift over time, relaxing toward its previous voltage level. The observed relaxation can occur over several hours and is likely due to long diffusion time constants of the porous electrodes within the EDLC. 
&lt;ref name="Marts_John_EDLC" /&gt;

===Polarity===
[[File:Polarität-EDLC-P1070160.JPG|thumb|right|A negative bar on the insulating sleeve indicates the cathode terminal of the capacitor]]

Since the positive and negative electrodes (or simply positrode and negatrode, respectively) of symmetric supercapacitors consist of the same material, theoretically supercapacitors have no true [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] and catastrophic failure does not normally occur. However reverse-charging a supercapacitor lowers its capacity, so it is recommended practice to maintain the polarity resulting from the formation of the electrodes during production. Asymmetric supercapacitors are inherently polar.

Pseudocapacitor and hybrid supercapacitors which have electrochemical charge properties may not be operated with reverse polarity, precluding their use in AC operation. However, this limitation does not apply to EDLC supercapacitors

A bar in the insulating sleeve identifies the negative terminal in a polarized component.

In some literature, the terms "anode" and "cathode" are used in place of negative electrode and positive electrode. Using anode and cathode to describe the electrodes in supercapacitors (and also rechargeable batteries including lithium ion batteries) can lead to confusion, because the polarity changes depending on whether a component is considered as a generator or as a consumer of current. In electrochemistry, cathode and anode are related to reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. However, in supercapacitors based on electric double layer capacitance, there is no oxidation and/or reduction reactions on any of the two electrodes. Therefore, the concepts of cathode and anode do not apply.

===Comparison of selected commercial supercapacitors===
The range of electrodes and electrolytes available yields a variety of components suitable for diverse applications. The development of low-ohmic electrolyte systems, in combination with electrodes with high pseudocapacitance, enable many more technical solutions.

The following table shows differences among capacitors of various manufacturers in capacitance range, cell voltage, internal resistance (ESR, DC or AC value) and volumetric and gravimetric specific energy.

In the table, ESR refers to the component with the largest capacitance value of the respective manufacturer. Roughly, they divide supercapacitors into two groups. The first group offers greater ESR values of about 20 milliohms and relatively small capacitance of 0.1 to 470&amp;nbsp;F. These are "double-layer capacitors" for memory back-up or similar applications. The second group offers 100 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;F with a significantly lower ESR value under 1 milliohm. These components are suitable for power applications. A correlation of some supercapacitor series of different manufacturers to the various construction features is provided in Pandolfo and Hollenkamp.&lt;ref name="Pandolfo"/&gt;

In commercial double-layer capacitors, or, more specifically, EDLCs in which energy storage is predominantly achieved by double-layer capacitance, energy is stored by forming an electrical double layer of electrolyte ions on the surface of conductive electrodes. Since EDLCs are not limited by the electrochemical charge transfer kinetics of batteries, they can charge and discharge at a much higher rate, with lifetimes of more than 1 million cycles. The EDLC energy density is determined by operating voltage and the specific capacitance (farad/gram or farad/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of the electrode/electrolyte system. The specific capacitance is related to the Specific Surface Area (SSA) accessible by the electrolyte, its interfacial double-layer capacitance, and the electrode material density.

Commercial EDLCs are based on two symmetric electrodes impregnated with electrolytes comprising tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate salts in organic solvents. Current EDLCs containing organic electrolytes operate at 2.7&amp;nbsp;V and reach energy densities around 5-8&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg and 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;Wh/l.  The specific capacitance is related to the specific surface area (SSA) accessible by the electrolyte, its interfacial double-layer capacitance, and the electrode material density. Graphene-based platelets with mesoporous spacer material is a promising structure for increasing the SSA of the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Bonaccorso, F., Colombo, L., Yu, G., Stoller, M., Tozzini, V., Ferrari, A., . . .

==Standards==
[[File:EDLC-Classes.png|thumb|right|300px|Classification of supercapacitors into classes regarding to IEC 62391-1, IEC 62567and BS EN 61881-3 standards]]

Supercapacitors vary sufficiently that they are rarely interchangeable, especially those with higher specific energy. Applications range from low to high peak currents, requiring standardized test protocols.&lt;ref name="cellvssystem"&gt;P. Van den Bossche et al.: ''[http://www.cars21.com/files/news/EVS-24-10439%20Bossche.pdf The Cell versus the System: Standardization challenges for electricity storage devices]'' EVS24 International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium, Stavanger/Norway 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Test specifications and parameter requirements are specified in the generic specification
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] 62391–1, ''Fixed electric double layer capacitors for use in electronic equipment''.

The standard defines four application classes, according to discharge current levels:
# Memory backup
# Energy storage, mainly used for driving motors require a short time operation,
# Power, higher power demand for a long time operation,
# Instantaneous power, for applications that requires relatively high current units or peak currents ranging up to several hundreds of amperes even with a short operating time

Three further standards describe special applications:
* IEC 62391–2, ''Fixed electric double-layer capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Blank detail specification - Electric double-layer capacitors for power application''
* IEC 62576, ''Electric double-layer capacitors for use in hybrid electric vehicles. Test methods for electrical characteristics''
* BS/EN 61881-3, ''Railway applications. Rolling stock equipment. Capacitors for power electronics. Electric double-layer capacitors''

==Applications==
Supercapacitors do not support AC applications.

Supercapacitors have advantages in applications where a large amount of power is needed for a relatively short time, where a very high number of charge/discharge cycles or a longer lifetime is required. Typical applications range from milliamp currents or milliwatts of power for up to a few minutes to several amps current or several hundred kilowatts power for much shorter periods.

The time t a supercapacitor can deliver a constant current I can be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;t=\frac{C\cdot (U_\text{charge}-U_\text{min}) }{I}&lt;/math&gt;

as the capacitor voltage decreases from U&lt;sub&gt;charge&lt;/sub&gt; down to U&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the application needs a constant power P for a certain time t this can be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;t=\frac{1}{2 P}\cdot C\cdot(U_\text{charge}^2-U_\text{min}^2).&lt;/math&gt;

wherein also the capacitor voltage decreases from U&lt;sub&gt;charge&lt;/sub&gt; down to U&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Consumer electronics====
In applications with fluctuating loads, such as [[laptop]] computers, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA's]], [[GPS navigation device|GPS]], [[portable media player]]s, [[Mobile device|hand-held devices]],&lt;ref&gt;Graham Pitcher [http://fplreflib.findlay.co.uk/articles/6610/if-the-cap-fits.pdf If the cap fits ..] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113004449/http://fplreflib.findlay.co.uk/articles/6610/if-the-cap-fits.pdf |date=2015-01-13 }}. New Electronics. 26 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[photovoltaic system]]s, supercapacitors can stabilize the power supply.

Supercapacitors deliver power for [[flash (photography)|photographic flashes]] in [[digital camera]]s and for [[LED]] life flashlights that can be charged in, e.g., 90 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/10/1821208 |title=Ultracapacitor LED Flashlight Charges In 90 Seconds - Slashdot |publisher=Tech.slashdot.org |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tools====
A cordless [[electric screwdriver]] with supercapacitors for energy storage has about half the run time of a comparable battery model, but can be fully charged in 90 seconds. It retains 85% of its charge after three months left idle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohgizmo.com/2007/10/01/coleman-flashcell-cordless-screwdriver-recharges-in-just-90-seconds/ |title=Coleman FlashCell Cordless Screwdriver Recharges In Just 90 Seconds |publisher=OhGizmo! |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grid power buffer====
A group of [[Electric vehicle|EVs]] and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|HEVs]] during their charging process draw very high current for a short duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid.&lt;ref&gt;M. Farhadi and O. Mohammed, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=6682588 Real-time operation and harmonic analysis of isolated and non-isolated hybrid DC microgrid], IEEE Trans. Ind. Appl., vol.50, no.4, pp.2900–2909, Jul./Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Power pulsation not only reduces the efficiency of the grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the high pulse power drawn from the charging station.&lt;ref&gt;M.

====Low-power equipment power buffer====
Supercapacitors provide backup or emergency shutdown power to low-power equipment such as [[Random-access memory|RAM]], [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]], micro-controllers and [[PC Card]]s. They are the sole power source for low energy applications such as [[automated meter reading]] (AMR)&lt;ref name="Gallay"&gt;R.

Supercapacitors buffer power to and from [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], mitigating the effects of short power interruptions and high current peaks. Batteries kick in only during extended interruptions, e.g., if the [[Mains electricity|mains power]] or a [[fuel cell]] fails, which lengthens battery life.

[[Uninterruptible power supplies]] (UPS), where supercapacitors have replaced much larger banks of electrolytic capacitors. This combination reduces the cost per cycle, saves on replacement and maintenance costs, enables the battery to be downsized and extends battery life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David A.

====Voltage stabilizer====
Supercapacitors can stabilize voltage for [[Overhead power line|powerlines]]. Wind and [[photovoltaic system]]s exhibit fluctuating supply evoked by gusting or clouds that supercapacitors can buffer within milliseconds. This helps stabilize grid voltage and frequency, balance supply and demand of power and manage real or reactive power.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency, Photovoltaic Power Systems Program, [http://www.iea-pvps-task11.org/HTMLobj-187/Act_24_Final.pdf The role of energy storage for mini-grid stabilization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514022501/http://www.iea-pvps-task11.org/HTMLobj-187/Act_24_Final.pdf |date=2013-05-14 }}, IEA PVPS Task 11, Report IEA-PVPS T11-02:2011, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

====Energy harvesting====
Supercapacitors are suitable temporary energy storage devices for [[energy harvesting]] systems. In energy harvesting systems, the energy is collected from the ambient or renewable sources, e.g. mechanical movement, light or [[electromagnetic fields]], and converted to electrical energy in an [[energy storage]] device. For example, it was demonstrated that energy collected from RF ([[radio frequency]]) fields (using an RF antenna as an appropriate [[rectifier]] circuit) can be stored to a printed supercapacitor. The harvested energy was then used to power an application-specific integrated circuit ([[ASIC]]) circuit for over 10 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.01.004 | title = Performance of printable supercapacitors in an RF energy harvesting circuit | volume=58 | journal=International Journal of Electrical Power | pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incorporation into batteries====
The [[UltraBattery]] is a hybrid rechargeable [[lead-acid battery]] and a supercapacitor invented by Australia's national science organisation [[CSIRO]]. Its cell construction contains a standard lead-acid battery positive electrode, standard sulphuric acid electrolyte and a specially prepared negative carbon-based electrode that store electrical energy with [[double-layer capacitance]]. The presence of the supercapacitor electrode alters the chemistry of the battery and affords it significant protection from sulfation in high rate partial state if charge use, which is the typical failure mode of [[VRLA battery|valve regulated lead-acid cells]] used this way. The resulting cell performs with characteristics beyond either a lead-acid cell or a supercapacitor, with charge and discharge rates, cycle life, efficiency and performance all enhanced. UltraBattery has been installed in kW and MW scale applications in Australia, Japan and the U.S.A. in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; Federal Energy Storage Technology Advancement Partnership (ESTAP)|url=http://www.cesa.org/assets/Uploads/ESTAP-Ecoult-Battery-Installation-Case-Study-Presentation.pdf|website=Clean Energy States Alliance|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sado City, in Japan's Niigata Prefecture, has street lights that combine a stand-alone power source with solar cells and LEDs. Supercapacitors store the solar energy and supply 2 LED lamps, providing 15&amp;nbsp;W power consumption overnight. The supercapacitors can last more than 10 years and offer stable performance under various weather conditions, including temperatures from +40 to below -20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/company/pdf/20100330-1.pdf ''Nippon Chemi-Con, Stanley Electric and Tamura announce: Development of "Super CaLeCS", an environment-friendly EDLC-powered LED Street Lamp.''] Press Release Nippon Chemi-Con Corp., 30.

===Transport===
====Aviation====
In 2005, aerospace systems and controls company [[Diehl Aerospace|Diehl Luftfahrt Elektronik]] GmbH chose supercapacitors to power emergency actuators for doors and [[evacuation slide]]s used in [[airliner]]s, including the [[Airbus 380]].&lt;ref name="Miller TMA" /&gt;

====Military====
Supercapacitors' low internal resistance supports applications that require short-term high currents. Among the earliest uses were motor startup (cold engine starts, particularly with diesels) for large engines in tanks and submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cantecsystems.com/|title=Cantec Systems|publisher=Cantec Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supercapacitors buffer the battery, handling short current peaks, reducing cycling and extending battery life.

Further military applications that require high specific power are phased array radar antennae, laser power supplies, military radio communications, avionics displays and instrumentation, backup power for airbag deployment and GPS-guided missiles and projectiles.&lt;ref&gt;Evans Capacitor Company, [http://www.evanscap.com/pdf/Hybrid_Caps_COTS.pdf High Energy Density Capacitors for Military Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tecate Group, [http://www.tecategroup.com/ultracapacitors-supercapacitors/military-applications.php Back-up power for military applications- Batteries optional!]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Automotive====
[[Toyota Yaris|Toyota's Yaris]] Hybrid-R concept car uses a supercapacitor to provide bursts of power. [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] has started using supercapacitors as part of its stop-start fuel-saving system, which permits faster initial acceleration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = First one up the drive: A new sort of storage device gives lithium-ion batteries a run for their money|date = July 12, 2014|url= https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21606715-new-sort-storage-device-gives-lithium-ion-batteries-run-their |work = [[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mazda's i-ELOOP system stores energy in a supercapacitor during deceleration and uses it to power on-board electrical systems while the engine is stopped by the stop-start system.

====Bus/tram====
[[Maxwell Technologies]], an American supercapacitor-maker, claimed that more than 20,000 hybrid buses use the devices to increase acceleration, particularly in China. Guangzhou, In 2014 China began using [[trams]] powered with supercapacitors that are recharged in 30 seconds by a device positioned between the rails, storing power to run the tram for up to 4&amp;nbsp;km — more than enough to reach the next stop, where the cycle can be repeated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Energy recovery===
A primary challenge of all transport is reducing energy consumption and reducing {{chem|CO|2}} emissions. Recovery of braking energy ([[Recuperation (recovery)|recuperation]] or [[Regenerative brake|regeneration]]) helps with both. This requires components that can quickly store and release energy over long times with a high cycle rate. Supercapacitors fulfill these requirements and are therefore used in a lot of applications in all kinds of transportation.

====Railway====

Supercapacitors can be used to supplement batteries in starter systems in [[Diesel engine|diesel]] railroad [[locomotives]] with [[diesel-electric transmission]]. The capacitors capture the braking energy of a full stop and deliver the peak current for starting the diesel engine and acceleration of the train and ensures the stabilization of catenary voltage. Depending on the driving mode up to 30% energy saving is possible by recovery of braking energy. Low maintenance and environmentally friendly materials encouraged the choice of supercapacitors.&lt;ref name="cdn.intechopen.com"&gt;L. Lionginas, L.

====Light-rails and trams====
{{main| Light rail| Tram}}

Supercapacitors make it possible not only to reduce energy but to replace [[overhead lines]] in historical city areas, so preserving the city's architectural heritage. This approach may allow many new LRV city lines to replace overhead wires that are too expensive to fully route.

[[File:Streetcar Straßenbahn Tram Mannheim RNV Rhein-Neckar-Verbund 25.JPG|thumb|right|Light rail vehicle in [[Mannheim]]]]

In 2003 [[Mannheim]] adopted a prototype [[light-rail]] vehicle (LRV) using the [[British Rail Class 377#MITRAC|MITRAC]] Energy Saver system from [[Bombardier Transportation]] to store mechanical braking energy with a roof-mounted supercapacitor unit.&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 2009 supercapacitors enabled LRV's to operate in the historical city area of [[Heidelberg]] without catenary overhead wires preserving the city's architectural heritage. The SC equipment cost an additional €270,000 per vehicle, which was expected to be recovered over the first 15 years of operation. The supercapacitors are charged at stop-over stations when the vehicle is at a scheduled stop. This approach may allow many LRV city lines to serve catenary overhead wires that are too expensive to fully route installation. In April 2011 German regional transport operator Rhein-Neckar, responsible for Heidelberg, ordered a further 11 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/rhein-neckar-verkehr-orders-more-supercapacitor-trams.html |title=Rhein-Neckar Verkehr orders more supercapacitor trams |publisher=Railway Gazette |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong's South Island metro line is to be equipped with two 2 MW energy storage units that are expected to reduce energy consumption by 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/supercapacitor-energy-storage-for-south-island-line.html |title=Supercapacitor energy storage for South Island Line |publisher=Railway Gazette |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 the [[Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works|CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive corporation]] of China presented a prototype two-car light metro train equipped with a roof-mounted supercapacitor unit. The train can travel up 2&amp;nbsp;km without wires, recharging in 30 seconds at stations via a ground mounted pickup. The supplier claimed the trains could be used in 100 small and medium-sized Chinese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/supercapacitor-light-metro-train-unveiled.html |title=Supercapacitor light metro train unveiled|publisher=Railway Gazette |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven trams (street cars) powered by supercapacitors were scheduled to go into operation in 2014 in [[Guangzhou]], China. The supercapacitors are recharged in 30 seconds by a device positioned between the rails. That powers the tram for up to {{convert|4|km}}.&lt;ref name=e14/&gt;
As of 2017, Zhuzhou's supercapacitor vehicles are also used on the new Nanjing streetcar system, and are undergoing trials in [[Wuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/interface/wifiKey/Chinafocus/2016-05/31/cd_25558058.html 武汉首列超级电容100%低地板有轨电车首发试乘] (Wuhan's first supercapacitor 100%-low-floor streetcar starts its first trial run), 中国新闻网, 2016-05-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in Lyon (France), the [[:fr:Sytral|SYTRAL]] (Lyon public transportation administration) started experiments of a "way side regeneration" system built by Adetel Group which has developed its own energy saver named ″NeoGreen″ for LRV, LRT and metros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adetelgroup.com/library/fiches-produits/4-NEO_GREEN_POWER.pdf# |title=4-Neo Green Power |access-date=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110231440/http://www.adetelgroup.com/library/fiches-produits/4-NEO_GREEN_POWER.pdf# |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stadtbus Nürnberg Bus 713 Btf. Schweinau.jpg|thumb|left|MAN Ultracapbus in Nuremberg, Germany]]

The first hybrid bus with supercapacitors in Europe came in 2001 in [[Nuremberg]], Germany. It was MAN's so-called "Ultracapbus", and was tested in real operation in 2001/2002. The test vehicle was equipped with a diesel-electric drive in combination with supercapacitors. The system was supplied with 8 Ultracap modules of 80&amp;nbsp;V, each containing 36 components. The system worked with 640&amp;nbsp;V and could be charged/discharged at 400&amp;nbsp;A. Its energy content was 0.4&amp;nbsp;kWh with a weight of 400&amp;nbsp;kg.

The supercapacitors recaptured braking energy and delivered starting energy. Fuel consumption was reduced by 10 to 15% compared to conventional diesel vehicles. Other advantages included reduction of {{chem|CO|2}} emissions, quiet and emissions-free engine starts, lower vibration and reduced maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vag.de/Busses/id124/The-Ultracapbus.html |title=The Ultracapbus - VAG Nürnberg - Öffentlicher Personennahverkehr in Nürnberg |publisher=Vag.de |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Kerschl, Eberhard Hipp, Gerald Lexen: ''[http://www.aachener-kolloquium.de/pdf/Vortr_Nachger/Kerschl.pdf Effizienter Hybridantrieb mit Ultracaps für Stadtbusse]'' 14.

{{as of|2002}} in [[Luzern]], [[Switzerland]] an electric bus fleet called TOHYCO-Rider was tested. The supercapacitors could be recharged via an inductive contactless high-speed power charger after every transportation cycle, within 3 to 4 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;V. Härri, S. Eigen, B. Zemp, D.

In early 2005 [[Shanghai]] tested a new form of [[electric bus]] called [[capabus]] that runs without powerlines (catenary free operation) using large onboard supercapacitors that partially recharge whenever the bus is at a stop (under so-called electric umbrellas), and fully charge in the [[bus terminus|terminus]]. In 2006, two commercial bus routes began to use the capabuses; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai. It was estimated that the supercapacitor bus was cheaper than a lithium-ion battery bus, and one of its buses had one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus with lifetime fuel savings of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton |first=Tyler |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/415773/next-stop-ultracapacitor-buses/?a=f |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 Le Mans race the two competing TS030s, one of which was in the lead for part of the race, both retired for reasons unrelated to the supercapacitors. The TS030 won three of the 8 races in the [[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season]]. In 2014 the [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]] used a supercapacitor to add 480 horsepower from two electric motors.&lt;ref name=e14/&gt;

The ability of supercapacitors to charge much faster than batteries, their stable electrical properties, broader temperature range and longer lifetime are suitable, but weight, volume and especially cost mitigate those advantages.

Supercapacitors lower specific energy makes them unsuitable for use as a stand-alone energy source for long distance driving.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pesaran, J.

====Gondolas====
[[File:Cablecar.zellamsee.500pix.jpg|thumb|Aerial lift in [[Zell am See]], [[Austria]]]]

In [[Zell am See]], [[Austria]], an [[aerial lift]] connects the city with [[Schmittenhöhe]] mountain. The gondolas sometimes run 24 hours per day, using electricity for lights, door opening and communication. The only available time for recharging batteries at the stations is during the brief intervals of guest loading and unloading, which is too short to recharge batteries. Supercapacitors offer a fast charge, higher number of cycles and longer life time than batteries.

[[Emirates Air Line (cable car)]], also known as the Thames cable car, is a 1-kilometre (0.62&amp;nbsp;mi) gondola line that crosses the [[Thames]] from the [[Greenwich Peninsula]] to the [[Royal Docks]].

{{note label|rounding|A|A}} Research into electrode materials requires measurement of individual components, such as an electrode or half-cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raut | first1 = A. | last2 = Parker | first2 = C. | last3 = Glass | first3 = J. | title = A method to obtain a Ragone plot for evaluation of carbon nanotube supercapacitor electrodes | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=E26509FCBD22C7014E2BA413E1FD5B7E.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7938762 | journal = Journal of Materials Research | volume = 25 | issue = 8| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using a counterelectrode that does not affect the measurements, the characteristics of only the electrode of interest can be revealed. Specific energy and power for real supercapacitors only have more or less roughly 1/3 of the electrode density.

==Market==
{{As of|2016}} worldwide sales of supercapacitors is about US$400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttieurope.com/object/me-zogbi-20161003.html |title=The Global Supercapacitor Market is Facing Unique Challenges in 2016 |publisher=MarketEYE |date=2016-03-10 |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for batteries (estimated by [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]]) grew from US$47.5 billion, (76.4% or US$36.3 billion of which was rechargeable batteries) to US$95 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Zogbi, Paumanok Group, 04.03.2013, [https://www.ttiinc.com/content/ttiinc/en/resources/marketeye/categories/passives/me-zogbi-20130403.html Supercapacitors the Myth, the Potential and the Reality]&lt;/ref&gt; The market for supercapacitors is still a small niche market that is not keeping pace with its larger rival.

In 2016, IDTechEx forecast sales to grow from $240 million to $2 billion by 2026, an annual increase of about 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/supercapacitor-technologies-and-markets-2016-2026-000486.asp |title=Supercapacitor Technologies and Markets 2016-2026 |publisher=IDTechEx |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercapacitor costs in 2006 were US$0.01 per farad or US$2.85 per kilojoule, moving in 2008 below US$0.01 per farad, and were expected to drop further in the medium term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://batteries.foresightst.com/resources/MarketOverviews/NET0007IO.pdf T2+2™ Market Overview], Ch. Ahern, Supercapacitors, December 10, 2009, Project Number NET0007IO&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trade or series names ==
Exceptional for electronic components like capacitors are the manifold different trade or series names used for supercapacitors like: ''APowerCap, BestCap, BoostCap, CAP-XX, C-SECH, DLCAP, EneCapTen, EVerCAP, DynaCap, Faradcap, GreenCap, Goldcap, HY-CAP, Kapton capacitor, Super capacitor, SuperCap, PAS Capacitor, PowerStor, PseudoCap, Ultracapacitor'' making it difficult for users to classify these capacitors. (Compare with [[#Comparison of technical parameters]])

[[File:Universe of Energy (23052612180).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Universe of Energy marquee]]
The '''Universe of Energy''' was a [[pavilion]] located in the eastern half of Future World at [[Epcot]]. The pavilion contained one attraction, '''Ellen's Energy Adventure,''' starring [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Bill Nye]], which was the second version of the show since the pavilion's 1982 opening. The attraction featured a combination of four separate large-format film presentations and a slow-moving [[dark ride]] through [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] filled sets. 

The Universe of Energy pavilion was previously sponsored by [[ExxonMobil]] (formerly [[Exxon]]) from opening day on October 1, 1982, through 2004. At [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo 2017, it was announced that the Universe of Energy pavilion would close to be replaced with a ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (Epcot Attraction)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''-themed [[roller coaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/business/media/disney-epcot-theme-parks.html|title=Disney Vows to Give Epcot a Magical, Long-Overdue Makeover|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=July 15, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715181742/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/business/media/disney-epcot-theme-parks.html|archive-date=July 15, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attraction closed permanently on August 13, 2017.

The original ''Universe of Energy'' pavilion itself was an innovation in energy technology, as the entire roof was covered in 80,000 [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic solar cells]] that partially powered the ride vehicles. Visitors were transported through the pavilion in large battery-powered "traveling theatre cars" that followed guide-wires embedded in the floor as opposed to riding along conventional ride tracks. The original attraction featured numerous films that presented information on the subject of energy in a serious fashion as well as a ride through a primeval [[diorama]] complete with audio-animatronic dinosaurs.

===Pre-show===
The original pre-show featured an eight-minute live-action film presentation about the various forms of energy found in nature and traced the history of how mankind harnessed these different forms of energy for his use. This unique film presentation was known as the ''Kinetic Mosaic'' and was invented by Czech film director [[Emil Radok]]. The mosaic screen consisted of 100 rotating prism-shaped flip screens (reminiscent of those on the classic game show ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]''), arranged in a twenty five wide by four high array. These flip screens rotated under computer control and were synchronized to the motion picture that was projected onto their surface via five synchronized motion picture projectors. Each flip screen contained three sides, with white projection surfaces on two sides and a matte black surface on the third. The combination of the film and the screens' rotation created undulating, sometimes three-dimensional-appearing images. During the conclusion of the pre-show, the song ''Energy (You Make The World Go ‘Round)'' was played.

===Theatre I film===
Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute hand-animated film that depicted the beginnings of life on earth and the formation of fossil fuels.

===Primeval diorama===
At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then raised to reveal a primeval diorama. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous animatronic dinosaurs including an ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'' and two ''[[Arthropleura]]'' fighting and a family of ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in a swamp (complete with realistic "swampy" smell), a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' fighting an ''[[Allosaurus]]'' on an overhead cliff, several ''[[Trachodon]]'' bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' watching helplessly as one of their own sank into a boiling [[tar pit]], an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' that lashed out of a tidal pool at guests, and numerous ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that were perched around an erupting [[volcano]] (complete with flowing lava and realistic "volcano" smell).

===Theatre II film===
Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered the ''EPCOT Energy Information Center'' where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. Here, guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens that took them on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources around the world.

===Theatre I finale film===
At the conclusion of the film, the screens raised and the entire seating area traveled beneath them into Theatre I and rotated back into its starting position facing the audience towards a large cylindrical-shaped screen. There, guests viewed a two-minute computer-animated film that was reflected off of mirrored walls within the theatre. The film depicted an ever-evolving landscape of colorful, laser-like imagery of the various ways mankind has benefited from harnessing energy for his use and was accompanied by an upbeat song entitled ''Universe of Energy''.

== Summer 1996 version ==
The Summer of 1996 saw many changes come to Future World East. [[World of Motion]] closed in January of that year to make way for [[Test Track]], and [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] was not operating consistently due to alleged structural issues with the pavilion. The updated films for the attraction were behind schedule and with that side of Future World set to only have [[Wonders of Life]] open for the summer peak season, the decision was made to reopen Universe of Energy after renovations had been made to the pavilion in preparation for the new show.

This version of the ride featured all of the original films from the 1982 version, but lacked some of the effects. Most notably, the Kinetic Mosaic screen from the original pre-show had been removed resulting in the film being projected onto static screens which resulted in the shape-shifting effect of the film being lost. Also removed were the maps and television monitors on the wall in the ''EPCOT Energy Information Center'' in Theatre II, having already been replaced by the KNRG radio tower backdrop for the new show. For this scene, a new narration played that covered much of the same information as the original narration minus any mention of the maps and monitors. In Theatre I, the mirrors on the walls had already been removed by this point, resulting in a much less dramatic version of the finale film.

During this period, some elements for the new show had already been installed in preparation for the new show and had to be hidden. This included the [[Audio-Animatronic]] figure of [[Ellen DeGeneres]] in the diorama. To solve this, temporary rockwork was placed in front of the figure hiding it from view. However, the Elasmosaurus figure had already been reprogrammed for the new show, leading to the awkward result of having it lunge at rocks instead of the ride vehicles as it had originally done.

This version of the show only ran during the summer of 1996. The pavilion was closed again soon after peak season to allow for the installation of the new films for the new version of the attraction.

Ellen's Energy Adventure starred [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Bill Nye]] "The Science Guy", [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Alex Trebek]], and [[Johnny Gilbert]]. It took a light-hearted look at various energy resources, how energy was produced, the history of energy production, and the search for new energy resources. In particular it focused on the origins of [[fossil fuels]] such as [[petroleum]], [[coal]] and [[natural gas]]. It also mentioned renewable sources such as [[solar energy|solar]] and [[hydroelectric]] power.  In 2011, ''Ellen's Energy Adventure'' surpassed the original ''Universe of Energy'' show as the longest running version of the attraction.

The second version of the attraction used the same traveling theater system that was used by the original ''Universe of Energy'' show. The primeval [[diorama]] used essentially the same sets and Audio-Animatronic dinosaurs as the original show, although during the renovation to the ''Ellen's Energy Adventure'' show, all of the dinosaurs were repainted in much brighter colors, and several [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] figures were added along with an upbeat musical score to help tie it into the new film footage.

===Pre-show theatre film===
Guests viewed an eight-minute film in which Ellen DeGeneres falls asleep and dreams that she is in an energy-themed version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', playing against an old college rival Judy Peterson (Curtis) and [[Albert Einstein]] (Benny Wasserman). Not knowing anything about energy, Ellen fell way behind Judy. At the end of the first round, [[Bill Nye|Bill Nye the Science Guy]] stepped in and offered to help teach Ellen about energy during the commercial break.

===Theatre I film===
Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute computer animated film in which Bill took Ellen back billions of years in time to witness the [[Big Bang]] and the formation of the earth. Finally, they ended up in a prehistoric jungle where he briefly explained how fossil fuels were formed.

===Primeval diorama===
[[File:Epcot woe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brontosaurus]] in the ''Universe of Energy'']]
At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then rose to reveal a [[Primeval World|primeval diorama]]. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous [[audio-animatronic]] [[dinosaur]]s including an ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'', two ''[[Arthropleura]]'' fighting and a family of ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in a swamp (one of whom sneezed water onto guests), a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' fighting an ''[[Allosaurus]]'' on an overhead cliff, several ''[[Trachodon]]'' bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' drinking from a pond (one of whom spit water at guests), an [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] Ellen standing near a tidal pool fighting off an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' with a tree branch, and numerous ''[[Pteranodon]]'' perched around an erupting [[volcano]]. After November 2014, the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen fighting off the ''Elasmosaurus'' with a tree branch stopped working and was removed. It was replaced with a group of smaller ''Pteranodons''.

===Theatre II film===
Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered a second theatre where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. After listening to a brief prehistoric broadcast from KNRG News Radio (which featured the voices of [[Willard Scott]] and [[Chris Berman]]), guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens in which Bill Nye took Ellen on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources across the United States. Actor [[Michael Richards]] made a brief cameo as a caveman near the beginning of the film.

===Theatre I finale film===
At the conclusion of the film, the screens rose and the entire seating area traveled beneath them back into Theatre I and rotated back into its original starting position facing the audience towards a large television-shaped screen. The final two minute film presented the end of Ellen's dream in which she used her new knowledge about energy in Round 2 to unseat Judy as ''Jeopardy!'' champion.

==Timeline==
[[File:Universe of Energy 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ride vehicle and track]]
* October 1, 1982 — The pavilion opens with the original ''Universe of Energy'' show.
* January 21, 1996 — The original ''Universe of Energy'' show and pavilion are closed for refurbishment.
* June 14, 1996 — The fully refurbished pavilion temporarily reopens in an effort to help handle the park’s busy summer crowds.  The old films from the original ''Universe of Energy'' show are used during this time as the new films with Bill Nye and Ellen DeGeneres had not yet been completed.
* September 2, 1996 — The pavilion closes and the new films are installed.
* September 15, 1996 — The pavilion re-opens with a new show entitled ''Ellen's Energy Crisis'', but for reasons unknown, is immediately renamed ''Ellen's Energy Adventure''.
* 2003 — The original Universe of Energy marquees at the entrance of the pavilion are replaced with all new signage to reflect the sponsor's new name, [[ExxonMobil]].
* 2004 — [[ExxonMobil]] drops its 22-year sponsorship of the pavilion, and all references to the company are removed from the signage and show.
* 2008 — The pavilion closes for an extensive refurbishment. During this time, numerous scenes within the diorama are refreshed, the audio systems are upgraded and the computer systems that operate the attraction are updated. Additionally, the exterior of the pavilion is repainted back to its original color scheme of reds, oranges and yellows (during the 1996 refurbishment, the exterior of the pavilion was repainted into a pastel rainbow color scheme) and the traveling theatre vehicles are repainted from their original purple color into a light blue color.
* March 28, 2009 — The pavilion re-opens after a lengthy refurbishment.
* July 15, 2017 — Disney confirms that the Universe of Energy pavilion will close and be replaced by a ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' themed attraction.
* August 13, 2017 — The Universe of Energy pavilion has its last day of operation. During the final show, the attraction breaks down forcing guests to evacuate mid-show. However, cast members make up for this by allowing guests to linger in the primeval diorama during the ride evacuation and take photos with the dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosebloom|first1=Matt|title=Last ever Ellen ride ended with an evacuation, and fans loved it|url=http://attractionsmagazine.com/last-ever-universe-of-energy-ride-ended-with-an-evacuation-and-the-fans-loved-it/|website=Attractions Magazine|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
