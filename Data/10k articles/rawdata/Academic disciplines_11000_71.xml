'''Amelogenin, X isoform''' is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ''AMELX'' (amelogenin, X isoform) [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: amelogenin (amelogenesis imperfecta 1| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=265| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protein Amelogenin, X isoform is an isoform of [[amelogenin]] that comes from the [[X chromosome]].&lt;ref name="urlAceView"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;l=AMELX | title = AceView: Gene:AMELX, a comprehensive annotation of human, mouse and worm genes with mRNAs or ESTsAceView | author = | authorlink = | date = | format = | website = | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, United States National Institutes of Health | pages = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1734713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salido EC, Yen PH, Koprivnikar K, Yu LC, Shapiro LJ | title = The human enamel protein gene amelogenin is expressed from both the X and the Y chromosomes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 303–16 | date = Feb 1992 | pmid = 1734713 | pmc = 1682460 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein Amelogenin is a type of extracellular matrix protein, and is involved in the process of [[amelogenesis]], the formation of enamel on teeth. Amelogenin X is a member of the amelogenin family of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins.  When alternative splicing occurs, it results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms, which in humans results in amelogenin genes on both the X and Y chromosomes.&lt;ref name="urlAceView"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1734713"/&gt;

== Function ==

AMELX is involved in [[biomineralisation|biomineralization]] during [[tooth enamel]] development.&lt;ref name="pmid11406633"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson CW, Yuan ZA, Hall B, Longenecker G, Chen E, Thyagarajan T, Sreenath T, Wright JT, Decker S, Piddington R, Harrison G, Kulkarni AB | title = Amelogenin-deficient mice display an amelogenesis imperfecta phenotype | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 34 | pages = 31871–5 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11406633 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M104624200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMELX gene encodes for the structural modeling protein, amelogenin, which works with other amelogenesis-related proteins to direct the mineralisation of enamel. This process involves the organization of [[enamel rods]], the basic unit of tooth enamel, as well as the inclusion and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals.

== Clinical significance ==

Mutations in the AMELX gene can result in [[amelogenesis imperfecta]], which refers to the collection of enamel defects resulting from either genetic or environmental causes.&lt;ref name="pmid16838342"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JT | title = The molecular etiologies and associated phenotypes of amelogenesis imperfecta | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A | volume = 140 | issue = 23 | pages = 2547–55 | date = Dec 2006 | pmid = 16838342 | pmc = 1847600 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.31358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that mice with a knocked-out AMELX gene will present disorganized and hypoplastic enamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Y, Suggs C, Wright JT, Yuan ZA, Aragon M, Fong H, Simmons D, Daly B, Golub EE, Harrison G, Kulkarni AB, Gibson CW | title = Partial rescue of the amelogenin null dental enamel phenotype | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 22 | pages = 15056–15062 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18390542 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M707992200 | pmc=2397487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[urologic]] [[pathology]], '''atypical small [[acinus|acinar]] proliferation''', [[abbreviated]] '''ASAP''', is a collection of small prostatic [[gland]]s, on [[prostate]] [[biopsy]], whose significance is uncertain and cannot be determined to be [[benign]] or [[prostate adenocarcinoma|malignant]].

ASAP, generally, is ''not'' considered a pre-malignancy, or a [[carcinoma in situ]]; it is an expression of diagnostic [[uncertainty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flury SC, Galgano MT, Mills SE, Smolkin ME, Theodorescu D |title=Atypical small acinar proliferation: biopsy artefact or distinct pathological entity |journal=BJU International |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=780–5 |date=January 2007 |pmid= 17378841|doi= 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06703.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118508438/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[analogous]] to the diagnosis of [[ASCUS]] (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) on the [[Pap test]].

==Association with adenocarcinoma==
On a subsequent [[biopsy]], given the diagnosis of ASAP, the chance of finding prostate [[adenocarcinoma]] is approximately 40%; this is higher than if there is [[high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia]] (HGPIN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leite KR, Camara-Lopes LH, Cury J, Dall'oglio MF, Sañudo A, Srougi M |title=Prostate cancer detection at rebiopsy after an initial benign diagnosis: results using sextant extended prostate biopsy |journal=Clinics |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=339–42 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18568243 |doi= 10.1590/S1807-59322008000300009|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1807-59322008000300009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |pmc=2664245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''budget''' is a financial plan for a defined period, often one year. It may also include planned sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities, costs and expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Companies, governments, families and other organizations use it to express strategic plans of activities or events in measurable terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIMA Official Terminology |url=http://www1.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810055251/http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A budget is the sum of money allocated for a particular purpose and the summary of intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them. It may include a budget surplus, providing money for use at a future time, or a deficit in which expenses exceed income.
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Comme Sisyphe - Honoré Daumier.jpg|thumb|''Comme Sisyphe'' - Honoré Daumier (Brooklyn Museum)]] 

==Etymology==
A budget (derived from the old [[French language|French]] word meaning purse) is a quantified financial plan for a forthcoming accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A budget is an important concept in [[microeconomics]], which uses a [[budget line]] to illustrate the trade-offs between two or more [[good (economics)|goods]]. In other terms, a budget is an organizational plan stated in monetary terms.

In summary, the purpose of budgeting tools:
# Tools provide a forecast of revenues and expenditures, that is, construct a model of how a business might perform financially if certain strategies, events and plans are carried out.
# Tools enable the actual financial operation of the business to be measured against the forecast.
# Lastly, tools establish the cost constraint for a [[project]], program, or [[Business operations|operation]].

==Corporate==
The budget of a [[company (law)|company]] is often compiled annually, but may not be a finished budget, usually requiring considerable effort, is a plan for the short-term future, typically allows hundreds or even thousands of people in various departments (operations, human resources, IT, etc.) to list their expected revenues and expenses in the final budget.

If the actual figures delivered through the budget period come close to the budget, this suggests that the managers understand their business and have been successfully driving it in the intended direction. On the other hand, if the figures diverge wildly from the budget, this sends an 'out of control' signal, and the share price could suffer. Campaign planners incur two types of cost in any campaign: the first is the cost of human resource necessary to plan and execute the campaign. The second type of expense that campaign planners incur is the hard cost of the campaign itself.

==Event management==
A budget is a fundamental tool for an [[event management|event director]] to predict with a reasonable accuracy whether the event will result in a profit, a loss or will break-even. A budget can also be used as a [[Pricing science|pricing tool]].

There are two basic approaches or philosophies, when it comes to budgeting. One approach is telling you on mathematical models, and the other on people.

The first school of thought believes that financial models, if properly constructed, can be used to predict the future. The focus is on variables, inputs and outputs, drivers and the like. Investments of time and money are devoted to perfecting these models, which are typically held in some type of financial spreadsheet application.

The other school of thought holds that it's not about models, it's about people. No matter how sophisticated models can get, the best information comes from the people in the business. The focus is therefore in engaging the managers in the business more fully in the [[budget process]], and building accountability for the results. The companies that adhere to this approach have their managers develop their own budgets. While many companies would say that they do both, in reality the investment of time and money falls squarely in one approach or the other.

==Government==
{{details|Government budget}}
The budget of a [[government]] is a summary or plan of the intended revenues and expenditures of that government. There are three types of government budget : the operating or current budget, the capital or investment budget, and the cash or cash flow budget.&lt;ref&gt;Cliche, P. (2012). “Budget,” in L. Côté and J.-F. Savard (eds.), Encyclopedic Dictionary of Public Administration, [online], http://www.dictionnaire.enap.ca/Dictionnaire/en/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The budget is prepared by the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] team led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and is presented to Parliament by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on Budget Day. It is customary for the Chancellor to stand on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street with his or her team for the media to get photographic shots of the [[Red box (government)|Despatch Box]], immediately prior to them going to the [[House of Commons]].  Once presented in the House of Commons it is debated and then voted on.  Minor changes may be made however with the budget being written and presented by the party with the majority in the House of Commons (the Government), the [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] will ensure that it is passed as written by the Chancellor. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===United States===
{{main|United States federal budget}}
The federal budget is prepared by the [[Office of Management and Budget]], and submitted to Congress for consideration. Invariably, Congress makes many and substantial changes. Nearly all American states are required to have [[balanced budget]]s, but the federal government is allowed to run deficits. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===[[India]]===
{{main|Union budget of India}}
The budget is prepared by the Budget Division  Department of Economic Affairs of the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] annually. The Finance Minister is the head of the budget making committee. The present Indian Finance minister is [[Arun Jaitley]]. The Budget includes supplementary excess grants and when a proclamation by the [[President of India|President]] as to failure of Constitutional machinery is in operation in relation to a State or a Union Territory, preparation of the Budget of such State.{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

The first budget of India was submitted on 18 February 1869 by James Wilson. James Wilson is known as the father of Indian budget.

===Philippines===
The Philippine budget is considered the most complicated in the world, incorporating multiple approaches in one single budget system: line-item (budget execution), performance (budget accountability), and [[zero-based budgeting]]. The [[Department of Budget and Management]] (DBM) prepares the National Expenditure Program and forwards it to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives to come up with a General Appropriations Bill (GAB). The GAB will go through budget deliberations and voting; the same process occurs when the GAB is transmitted to the [[Philippine Senate]].

After both houses of Congress approves the GAB, the President signs the bill into a General Appropriations Act (GAA); also, the President may opt to veto the GAB and have it returned to the legislative branch or leave the bill unsigned for 30 days and lapse into law. There are two types of budget bill veto: the [[line-item veto]] and the veto of the whole budget. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

==Personal or family==
{{details|Personal budget}}
A personal budget or home budget is a [[finance plan]] that allocates future personal [[income]] towards [[expense]]s, [[savings]] and [[debt]] repayment. Past spending and [[consumer debt|personal debt]] are considered when creating a personal budget. There are several methods and tools available for creating, using and adjusting a personal budget. For example, jobs are an income source, while bills and rent payments are expenses.    A third category (other than income and expenses) may be assets (such as property, investments or other savings or value) representing a potential reserve for funds in case of budget shortfalls.

There are many informational sites and software available for use in personal and family problems.

==Types==
* '''Sales budget''' – an estimate of future sales, often broken down into both units. It is used to create company and sales goals.
* '''[[Production budget]]''' - an estimate of the number of units that must be manufactured to meet the sales goals. The production budget also estimates the various costs involved with manufacturing those units, including labor and material. Created by product oriented companies.
* '''[[Capital budget]]''' - used to determine whether an organization's long-term investments such as new machinery, replacement machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth pursuing.
* '''Cash flow/cash budget''' – a prediction of future cash receipts and expenditures for a particular time period. It usually covers a period in the short-term future. The cash flow budget helps the business to determine when income will be sufficient to cover expenses and when the company will need to seek outside financing.
* '''[[Conditional budgeting]]''' is a [[budget]]ing approach designed for companies with fluctuating income, high [[fixed cost]]s, or income depending on [[sunk costs]], as well as [[Non-profit organization|NPOs]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. 
* '''Marketing budget''' – an estimate of the funds needed for promotion, advertising, and public relations in order to market the product or service.
* '''Project budget''' – a prediction of the costs associated with a particular company project. These costs include labour, materials, and other related expenses. The project budget is often broken down into specific tasks, with task budgets assigned to each. A cost estimate is used to establish a project budget.
* '''Revenue budget''' – consists of revenue receipts of government and the expenditure met from these revenues. Tax revenues are made up of taxes and other duties that the government levies.
* '''Expenditure budget''' – includes spending data items..
* '''Flexibility budget''' - it is established for fixed cost and variable rate is determined per activity measure for variable cost.
* '''Appropriation budget''' - a maximum amount is established for certain expenditure based on management judgment.
*'''Performance budget''' - it is mostly used by organization and ministries involved in the development activities. This process of budget takes into account the end results.
* '''Zero based budget''' - A budget type where every item added to the budget needs approval and no items are carried forward from the prior years budget. This type of budget has a clear advantage when the limited resources are to be allocated carefully and objectively. Zero based budgeting takes more time to create as all pieces of the budget need to be reviewed by management.
*'''Personal budget''' - A budget type focusing on expenses for self or for home, usually involves an income to budget.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''CITBOK''') is the project sponsored and undertaken by [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS) to define and outline the [[body of knowledge]] that defines a Canadian [[Information Systems Professional]] (ISP).

CIPS recognizes that in order to strengthen the criteria of the ISP designation successfully while still maintaining high standards, the association needs to develop a Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge (CITBOK) that will set standards for knowledge.  The CITBOK is an outline of the knowledge bases that form the intellectual basis for the IT profession.  CIPS has identified a core CITBOK that all professionals would be expected to master and specialty bodies of knowledge that would depend on your area of practice.  When setting this Canadian standard for Information Technology (IT) knowledge, CIPS looked to other organizations and internationally for standards and bodies of knowledge that CIPS could adopt or adapt, especially for the specialty areas.  For example, in 2004, CIPS adopted the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) Professional Examination Study Guide Syllabus Diploma level (Core and 11 specialist modules) as the initial Body of Knowledge for CIPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |title=Moving towards a Canadian IT Body of Knowledge |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230307/http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITBOK aims to:

* be an industry structure model that can be used to define the set of performance, training and development standards for all IT practitioners (CIPS members and non-members) in [[Canada]];
* create alternate paths to certification based on concepts of CITBOK;
* establish guidelines for accreditation criteria based on concepts of CITBOK; and
* create a professional development model that sets the standards criteria for the knowledge base including knowledge, skills, and professional activities for IT practitioners.

'''ChaCha''' was a [[human search engine|human-guided]] [[search engine]].  It provided free, real-time answers to any question, through its website, or by using one of the company's [[mobile app]]s.

The company, founded in 2006 by [[Scott A. Jones]] and Brad Bostic, was based in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], [[Indiana]], United States, part of the [[Indianapolis]] [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].  Its name comes from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word ''cha'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:查|查]]|t=[[wikt:查|查]]|p=''chá''|w=''ch'a''}}), which means "to search." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://www.chacha.com/question/how-did-your-company-get-the-name-chacha |accessdate= 2009-05-24 |publisher= chacha.com |title=How did your company get the name ChaCha?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guides ==
ChaCha answered questions through the use of [[Freelancer|independent contractors]] called Guides. Guides were paid $0.02 per answer.

==History==
The [[alpha version]] of ChaCha was launched on September 1, 2006. A [[beta version]] was introduced on November 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005649&amp;newsLang=en ChaCha press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194225/http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005649&amp;newsLang=en# |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[BusinessWire]], November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ChaCha said 20,000 guides had registered by year's end and that it had raised US$6 million in development funds, including support from Bezos Expeditions, a personal investment firm owned by [[Jeff Bezos]], the [[entrepreneur]] behind Amazon.com.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070221035245/http://www.chacha.com/press/chacha_funding-01-08-07.pdf "ChaCha secures $6 million in private funding from Jeff Bezos, Rod Canion, Jack Gill and others"], ChaCha press release (January 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2008, ChaCha had 5,000 freelance guides with at least 500 working at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323569,00.html|title=Review: ChaCha's Text-Message Search Engine|date=17 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MogoNews.com reported that ChaCha's first round of equity financing was $14 million plus a $2 million grant from 21st Century Technology Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Duryee, Tricia.

In July 2010, ChaCha Inc. was recognized as one of the “Hottest Companies in the [[Midwest]]” by Lead411.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lead411.com/midwest-companies.html |title=Lead411 launches 'Hottest Companies in the Midwest' awards |publisher=Lead411.com |date= July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, ChaCha launched its [[Text Engine|text messaging-based service]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Fixed Mobile Convergence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixed-mobile-convergence.tmcnet.com/topics/mobile-communications/articles/209000-learn-teach-earn-with-chachas-human-guide-program.htm |title=Learn, Teach, Earn with ChaCha's Human Guide Program |publisher= tmcnet.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate= 2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month the company  reported having answered over 1.7 billion questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://about.chacha.com/2011/08/16/proven-leader-in-%E2%80%9Cwork-from-home%E2%80%9D-opportunities-launching-in-uk/ | title= Proven Leader in Work From Home Opportunities Launching in UK | work= Corporate Press Release | date= August 16, 2011| publisher= ChaCha.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2012, ChaCha shut down operations in the United Kingdom; the company stated the reason for ending UK operations was that ''"adoption rates for new price-competitive services are quite low in the UK."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/27/qa-site-chacha-cans-uk-expansion-after-poor-user-take-up/ | title= Q&amp;A Site ChaCha Cancels UK Business After Poor User Take-Up | date= April 27, 2012 | publisher= TechCrunch.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2016, ChaCha discontinued the guide program due to having insufficient funds available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guideblog.chacha.com/2016/11/23/apollo-guide-program-retirement|title=Apollo Guide Program Retirement|last=bwigley|first=|date=23 November 2016|website=ChaCha|publisher=ChaCha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2016, ChaCha shut down operations due to declining advertising revenue, which left it unable to service its debt.&lt;ref name="IBJ.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/61651-chacha-unable-to-find-financial-answers-shuts-down-operations|title=ChaCha, unable to find financial answers, shuts down operations|work=Indianapolis Business Journal|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desktop search===
ChaCha was founded with the intention to offer human-guided search from within a web browser and for the search engine to learn from the results provided by their freelancers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2006-09-06-google-chacha_x.htm |title=One day searchers may quit Googling and start ChaCha-ing |publisher=USA Today |date=2006-09-06 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system offered a chat on the left side of the page where users could [[Online chat|chat]] with the guides and conclude their search.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com" /&gt; The center of the page contained results that a guide could add or remove (later users could also add or remove these results).  The right side of the page contained ads that were relevant to the search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srajaram.com/images/chacha_m.jpg JPG screenshot]. srajaram.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Desktop search was phased out in April 2008 in favor of mobile products.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/31/chacha-ditches-guided-search-model-i-love-to-hate-this-startup/ | title=ChaCha Ditches Guided Search Model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Chandrasekhar number''' is a [[dimensionless quantity]] used in magnetic [[convection]] to represent ratio of the [[Lorentz force]] to the [[viscosity]]. It is named after the [[India]]n [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].

The number's main function is as a measure of the [[magnetic field]], being proportional to the square of a characteristic magnetic field in a system.

== Definition ==

The Chandrasekhar number is usually denoted by the letter &lt;math&gt;\ Q&lt;/math&gt;, and is motivated by a dimensionless form of the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] in the presence of a magnetic force in the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]]:

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\frac{\partial^{}\mathbf{u}}{\partial t^{}}\ +\ (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}\right)\ =\ - {\mathbf \nabla }p\ +\ \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}\ +\frac {\sigma}{\zeta} {Q}\ ({\mathbf \nabla} \wedge \mathbf{B}) \wedge\mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl number]], and &lt;math&gt;\ \zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic Prandtl number. 

The Chandrasekhar number is thus defined as:&lt;ref&gt;N.E. Hurlburt, P.C. Matthews and A.M. Rucklidge, "Solar Magnetoconvection," ''Solar Physics'', 192, p109-118 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; {Q}\ =\ \frac{{B_0}^2 d^2}{\mu_0 \rho \nu \lambda} &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\ \mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic permeability]], &lt;math&gt;\ \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;\ \nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]], and &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic diffusivity]]. &lt;math&gt;\ B_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt; are a characteristic magnetic field and a length scale of the system respectively.

It is related to the [[Hartmann number]], &lt;math&gt;\ H&lt;/math&gt;, by the relation:

:: &lt;math&gt; Q\ {=}\ H^2\ &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration from ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', a medieval handbook on wellness.]]
In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the '''consummation of a marriage''', often called simply ''consummation'', is the first (or first officially credited) act of [[sexual intercourse]] between two people, either following their [[marriage]] to each other or after a prolonged romantic attraction. The definition of consummation usually refers to penile-vaginal sexual penetration, but some religious doctrines hold that there is an additional requirement that there must ''not'' be any [[contraception]] used.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hardon, S.J. | first=John | authorlink=John Hardon | isbn=0-385-23238-1 | title=Pocket Catholic Dictionary | page=91 | publisher=Image Books | contribution=Consummated Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious, cultural, or legal significance of consummation may arise from theories of marriage as having the purpose of producing legally recognized descendants of the partners, or of providing sanction to their sexual acts together, or both, and its absence may amount to treating a marriage ''ceremony'' as falling short of ''completing'' the state of being married, or as creating a marriage which may later be repudiated. Thus in some legal systems a marriage may be [[annulled]] if it has not been consummated. Consummation is also relevant in the case of a [[common law marriage]]. The importance of consummation has led to the development of various [[bedding ritual]]s.

In addition to these formal and literal usages, the term also exists in informal and less precise usage to refer to a sexual landmark in relationships of varying intensity and duration.

==Legislation==

===Civil marriage===

The relevance of consummation in a [[civil marriage]] varies by jurisdiction. For example, under section 12 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], a refusal or inability to consummate a marriage is a ground of [[Annulment#Annulment in England and Wales|annulment in England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent#section-12 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c. 18), s. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511201916/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent |date=2018-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this only applies to heterosexual marriage, because Paragraph 4 of schedule 4 of the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] specifically excludes non-consummation as a ground for the annulment of a [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315132422/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|archivedate=2016-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]], have abolished the legal concept of consummation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527114938/http://familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |archivedate=2015-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Note''': in Australia non-consummation as ground of annulment was abolished in 1975; see Dickey, A. (2007) ''Family Law'' (5th Ed) Also in 1975, Australia introduced no-fault divorce, so specific grounds of divorce such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, have all been abolished.{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232908/http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law marriage===

{{Main article|Common-law marriage|Common-law marriage in the United States}}
In this case, usually, consummation, as well as cohabitation, are important, they are needed - together with the presentation of the parties to society as spouses - in order to create the marriage itself.

===Religious marriage===

A religious marriage without civil registration may or may not be legally binding. However, in some (mostly [[Muslim]]-majority) countries such as Israel, Egypt, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019190012/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | archivedate = 2012-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |title=Marriage in Jordan |publisher=Jordan embassy |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010415/http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | archivedate = 2011-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, Mauritania and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110920040604/http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | archivedate = 2011-09-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  religious marriage is the only legally binding marriage.

Consummation is in particular relevant in a [[Marriage in  the Catholic Church|Catholic marriage]]. Within the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], if a matrimonial celebration takes place (ratification) but the spouses have not yet engaged in intercourse (consummation), then the marriage is said to be a marriage ''[[ratum sed non consummatum]]''. Such a marriage, regardless of the reason for non-consummation, can be dissolved by the [[pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105060902/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|archivedate=2007-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an inability or an intentional refusal to consummate the marriage is probable grounds for an [[Declaration of nullity|annulment]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] defines a marriage as consummated when the "spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;canon 1061 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some theologians, such as [[John Hardon|Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.]], state that intercourse with [[contraception]] does not consummate a marriage.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

==Traditions==
Traditionally, in many cultures, for example in Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures (where Islam and Hinduism is followed and sex before marriage is not allowed), consummation was an important act because it was the act which proved the bride's [[virginity]]; the presence of blood was erroneously taken as definitive confirmation that the woman was indeed a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons'', by George Monger, pp 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the [[family law]] defining [[civil marriage]] in some jurisdictions, particularly those where the civil [[marriage law]]s remain influenced by [[religion]] (albeit they are officially secular) non-consummation of a marriage may be a ground for [[annulment]] (an annulment is different from a [[divorce]] because it usually acts retrospectively). This stipulation has been in recent years heavily criticized on a wide variety of grounds, ranging from the mixing of religious doctrine into secular law, to being degrading to women given its negative historical connotations of ownership of the wife.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the purpose of this ground is not clear: it is neither procreation (the act need not end in pregnancy, and neither is there a need of the ''possibility'' of it, given the fact the consummation is legally valid even if one or both parties is sterile), neither is it the expectation of sexual satisfaction in marriage (one single act of sexual intercourse is sufficient, even if the spouse following the consummation says he/she will never again engage in intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Bainham argues that this law (in [[England and Wales]]) is outdated and must be abolished "in a modern society committed to equality and human rights in personal relationships".&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 report, the Law Society’s Law Reform Committee of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] advocated abolishing the concept of a [[voidable marriage]] altogether (since divorce had been introduced in 1996) and criticized the consummation ground, writing the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.lawsociety.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092125/https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The rationale behind this ground is not immediately apparent. It is not concerned with the capacity of either or both parties to procreate, still less with the ability of the parties to satisfy each other sexually during the marriage. [...] It remains a rather curious anomaly in the law, a relic perhaps of medieval times, when the first act of intercourse was thought to 'mark' a new bride as the 'property' of her husband. Whatever its origins, it is not entirely clear what modern purpose this ground serves and it is suggested that it should be dispensed with.

Another concern is [[sexual violence]], especially since in most countries the criminalization of [[marital rape]] is recent, having occurred from the 1970s onwards; the maintaining in law of the concept of consummation is argued to foster cultural and societal attitudes and understandings of marriage that make it more difficult to acknowledge these violations; and to be a remainder of an oppressive tradition.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|title=Case in point - Is consummation a legal oddity? - Solicitors Journal|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100405/http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the case of ''R v R'', which criminalised marital rape in England and Wales, Harris-Short and Miles write:

:[A] historical view again throws useful light on the matter: until 1991, husbands were permitted to have sexual intercourse with their wives regardless of whether they were then actually consenting, the husband to sexual relations thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=R. v R [1991] UKHL 12 (23 October 1991)|website=Bailii.org|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017: many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' or ''[[Homo habilis]]'' may not have been separate species at all. Rather, they may have been a single evolving [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]].&lt;ref name=nature /&gt;

== Discovery of the skull ==
[[File:Dmanissi, Georgia ; Homo georgicus 1999 discovery map.png|thumb|[[Dmanisi]] geographical localization in the middle of the [[Caucasus]]]]
In 1991, Georgian scientist [[David Lordkipanidze]] found traces of early human occupation in the cave at [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]: a hamlet and an [[archaeological site]] about {{convert|90|km|mi}} southwest of the country's capital, [[Tbilisi]]. Since then, five early hominin skulls have been discovered at the site. '''Skull 5''', found in 2005, is the most complete specimen of them all. After further analysis, it was coupled with its [[mandible]] (D2600) found 5 years earlier. The final analysis of the discovery took many years and was only published in 2013.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

== Description of the skull ==
[[File:Amb. Bass-with D.Lordkipanidze at Dmanisi.JPG|thumb|[[David Lordkipanidze]] (centre) on the archeological site at [[Dmanisi]], 2010]]
Despite a brain volume the size of a large [[Australopithecus]] male, ({{convert|546|cm3|in3}}) all the characteristics of [[Homo erectus]] are clearly visible on '''Skull 5'''. The [[Neurocranium|braincase]] sizes of the other Dmanisi skulls are between {{convert|601|cm3|in3}} and {{convert|730|cm3|in3}}.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

The cranial superstructures of '''Skull 5''', which are prominent and massive, suggest that it was probably a male. Its face is one of the largest of any human ancestor discovered to date.&lt;ref name=article/&gt; The [[zygomatic arch]]es are massive with the right one displaying many traces of deformations, probably due to fractures and injuries. Researchers estimate that the height of the individual was between {{convert|146|cm|ft}} and {{convert|166|cm|ft}} and his weight between {{convert|47|kg|lb}} and {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=article /&gt;

== Dating ==
[[File:Dmanisi_stone_tool_1.jpg|thumb|Stone tools found on the [[Dmanisi]] [[paleontological]] site]]
Until the 1980s, scientists assumed that [[hominins]] had been restricted to the African continent for the whole of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (until about 0.8 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), only migrating out during a phase named [[Out of Africa I]]. Thus, the vast majority of archaeological effort was disproportionately focused on Africa.&lt;ref name = "Lahr 2010"&gt;Lahr, M.M., 2010. “Saharan Corridors and Their Role in the Evolutionary Geography of ‘Out of Africa I’”. In: A. Baden et al. (Eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia. Springer Netherlands, 27–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Dmanisi archeological site is the earliest hominin site out of Africa and the analysis of its [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] showed that some hominins, chiefly the ''[[Homo erectus#Homo erectus georgicus|Homo erectus georgicus]]'' had left [[Africa]] as far back as 1.85 million years ago. All of the 5 skulls are roughly the same age.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Consequently, the paleontological significance of the [[Radiocarbon dating|dating]] of the Dmanisi skulls is major. It is worth noting that it was not associated with the discovery of skull 5, but with another specimen found at the same site, the [[D2700|Dmanisi Skull 3]], also known as D2700.

== Controversy and significance of the discovery==

The Dmanisi skulls, especially '''Skull 5''' with its comparatively tiny {{convert|546|cm3|in3}} brain compared to other skulls found at the site, suggests that the earliest species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' were actually subspecies of the species ''erectus''.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; The variation in [[Morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] of all the Dmanisi skulls is so large that had they been discovered on different archaeological sites, they most likely would have been classified as different species. However, all Dmanisi skulls have the same age and have been found at exactly the same place.

Faced with the wide variation between '''Skull 5''' and the other Dmanisi skulls, Georgian and University of Zurich researchers were prompted to examine normal variations in modern human skulls and chimpanzees skulls. They found that while they looked different from one another, the great variations among all Dmanisi skulls were no greater than those seen among modern people and among chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; Consequently, it was entirely possible that such a discrepancy could be found in ''Homo erectus''.

This discovery led the scientists to suggest that two species of early hominins, ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' and  ''[[Homo habilis]]'', were actually both ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; This is an ongoing debate among the scientific community.&lt;ref name=National_Geographic&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=17 October 2013 |title= Beautiful Skull Spurs Debate on Human History |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131017-skull-human-origins-dmanisi-georgia-erectus/ |newspaper= National Geographic |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dolos.jpg|thumb|250px|Dolosse forming a protective structure against a [[shoreline]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa]]
A '''dolos''' (plural: '''dolosse''') is a [[reinforced concrete]] block in a complex geometric shape weighing up to {{convert|80|t|ST|abbr=off|lk=on}}, used in great numbers as a form of [[coastal management]] to build [[revetment]]s for protection against the erosive force of [[Ocean wave|waves]] from a body of water.&lt;ref name="Coastal Engineering 2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jane McKee|title=Coastal Engineering 2006|date=April 2007|publisher=[[World Scientific Publishing]]|isbn=978-9812706362|pages=4806, 4810, 4812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JizyCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=dolos&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dolos was invented in 1963 by [[South Africa]]n harbour [[draughtsman]], Aubrey Kruger, and were first deployed in 1964 on the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] of [[East London, South Africa|East London]], a South African port city.&lt;ref name="Aubrey Kruger"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Terry Hutson|title=The full story behind the dolos and its SA creator|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/the-mercury/20160810/282767765993843|website=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|accessdate=26 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226092908/https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/the-full-story-behind-the-dolos-and-its-sa-creator-2055577|archivedate=26 February 2018|date=10 August 2016|quote=The drawings for the first dolos were completed in 1963, based on the shape devised in wood by Aubrey Kruger.

==Construction==
[[Image:Dolos-construction.jpg|thumb|Dolos construction yard - [[Yzerfontein]], South Africa]] [[Image:Dolosse-molds.jpg|thumb|A man stands next to a dolos, showing its relative size. Dolosse moulds are in the foreground - [[Durban]], South Africa]]
Dolosse are normally made from un-reinforced concrete, poured into a steel mould.  The concrete will sometimes be mixed with small steel fibers, to strengthen it in the absence of reinforcing. Construction is done as close as possible to the site of installation because the dolosse are very heavy.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Image:Dolosse-wall.jpg|thumb|Durban's South Pier with a line of interlocking dolosse, South Africa]]
They are used to protect harbour walls, [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and shore earthworks. In [[Dania Beach, Florida]], dolosse are used as an artificial reef known as the Dania Beach Erojacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dania Beach Erojacks|url=http://sinkfloridasink.com/south-florida-dive-sites/south-florida-beach-dives/dania-beach-erojacks-south-florida-scuba-diving-beach-dive-site/|work=Sink, Florida, Sink!|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used to trap sea-sand to prevent erosion.  An order of 10,000 dolosse are required for a kilometre of coastline.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

They work by dissipating, rather than blocking, the energy of waves.  Their design deflects most wave action energy to the side, making them more difficult to dislodge than objects of a similar weight presenting a flat surface. Though they are placed into position on top of each other by cranes, over time they tend to get further entangled as the waves shift them. Their design ensures that they form an interlocking but porous wall. However, they are not indestructible. Under extreme storm conditions they will hammer one another and be pounded into rubble. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The individual units are often numbered so that their movements can be tracked. This helps engineers gauge whether they need to add more dolosse to the pile.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Dolosse are also being used in rivers in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States of America]], to control erosion, prevent channel migration and to create and restore salmon habitat. Examples are engineered [[log jams]], or ELJs, that may aid in efforts to save stocks of salmon.  Local, county, state, federal and private industry experts in [[engineering design]], [[fluvial geomorphology]] and [[fisheries conservation]] are working together to protect important public infrastructure such as roads and commercial and residential developments, while maintaining, improving, restoring, or creating aquatic habitat.  The sheer mass of the dolosse provides ballast for logs and slash ("wrack" or "rack" organic debris) to create a stable, complex habitat structure, all the while precluding the need for excessive, environmentally-invasive and costly excavation for their placement into substrate.  Such ELJs are of a new, innovative design that are on the leading edge of engineering and science technologies in aiding the recovery of Pacific Northwest (particularly [[Endangered Species Act]]-listed) [[salmonids]], while protecting important public and private works and thus helping to balance the needs of  [[Man]] and [[Nature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Credit for invention==
The design of the dolos is usually credited to the South African [[Eric Mowbray Merrifield]], one-time East London Harbour Engineer (from 1961–1976). In the late 1990s the claim of [[Aubrey Kruger]]&lt;ref name="disp_SAwo"&gt;{{Cite web | title = SA world-famous dolos designer dies in home city | last = Hollands | first = Barbara | work = DispatchLIVE | date = 26 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-27 | url = http://www.dispatchlive.co.za/sa-world-famous-dolos-designer-dies-home-city/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; gained more prominence. Kruger's claim is that he and Merrifield had considered the shape of concrete blocks to be used to protect East London's extensive breakwaters for the City's non-natural harbour, following a major storm in 1963. Merrifield wished to design a block that did not break up or shift when struck by the sea; that was cheap; and that did not require precise placement.  He said in later years that he wanted a block designed in such a way that it could be ''"sprinkled like children's [[Knucklebones|jacks]]"''. Kruger stated that he went home for lunch, cut three sections from a broomstick, and fastened them with nails into an H-shape with one leg turned through 90 degrees to create the distinctive ''dolos'' shape.  Merrifield was intrigued by the object and had Kruger draw a plan. Kruger never formally received credit for the invention.  Merrifield won the [[Shell Design Award]] and the [[Associated Science and Technology Societies of South Africa]]'s Gold Medal. The death of Merrifield (in 1982) has put this controversy beyond proof either way.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
Aubrey Kruger died in East London on 19 July 2016.

==Design protection==
The design of the dolos is not protected by any form of patent. Merrifield did not take the necessary steps to protect the concept. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} 

The reason for this is uncertain. Two reasons for this have been put forward: one by Merrifield; the other by Kruger.  Merrifield stated that he did not protect them as he wished them to benefit humanity.  Kruger alleges that Merrifield received incorrect legal advice: to wit, that as the blocks had been designed during office hours while he was employed by the State ([[South African Railways and Harbours Administration]]), he was unable by law to protect their design.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Origin of name==
The name is derived from the [[Afrikaans]] word ''dolos''- plural dolosse.  This word has two given derivations.  {{harvtxt|Rosenthal|1961}} states it to be a contraction of 'dobbel osse', or 'gambling' (Afrikaans) 'bones' (from Latin). Boshof and Nienaber state it to be a contraction of 'dollen os', or 'play' (old Dutch) 'oxen' (Afrikaans).  The first is a meaning-shifted reference to ox knuckle-joint bones used in divination practices by ''[[sangomas]]'', Southern African traditional healers.  They somewhat resemble these bones. The second is a reference to ox or lamb knuckle bones used by African children at play.  

The name was attached to the objects when Kruger's father, Joe Kruger, who also worked in the harbour, came upon his son and others playing with small models of the objects and asked him ''Wat speel julle met die dolos?'' (English: ''What are you playing at with the dolos?'').{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} There is a very ancient game called [[knucklebones]], a modern version of which uses playing pieces as shown in the adjacent photograph. The similarity between these and dolos is beyond question.

{{lake stratification topics}}
The '''epilimnion''' or '''surface layer''' is the top-most layer in a thermally [[Lake stratification|stratified]] [[lake]], occurring above the deeper [[hypolimnion]]. It is warmer and typically has a higher [[pH]] and higher [[dissolved oxygen]] concentration than the hypolimnion.

Being exposed at the surface, it typically becomes turbulently mixed as a result of surface wind-mixing. It is also free to exchange dissolved gases such as [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] with the atmosphere. Because this layer receives the most sunlight it contains the most [[phytoplankton]]. As they grow and reproduce they absorb nutrients from the water, when they die they sink into the hypolimnion resulting in the epilimnion becoming depleted of nutrients.

'''Europium(III) oxide''' (Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is a chemical compound of [[europium]] and [[oxygen]]. It is widely used as a red or blue [[phosphor]] in [[Cathode ray tube|television sets]] and [[fluorescent lamps]], and as an activator for [[yttrium]]-based phosphors. It is also an agent for the manufacture of fluorescent glass. Europium fluorescence is used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in [[Euro]] banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smarterscience.com/eurosandeuropium.html  Europium and the Euro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Europium oxide has two common structures: [[Monoclinic]] ([[Pearson symbol|mS30]], SpaceGroup = C2/m, No. 12) and cubic ([[Pearson symbol|cI80]], SpaceGroup = Ia-3, No. 206). The cubic structure is similar to that of [[manganese(III) oxide]]. 

It may be formed by ignition of [[europium]] metal.

It can react with acids to form the corresponding europium(III) salts.

'''Fascinating Aïda''' is a British comedy singing group and [[satire|satirical]] [[cabaret]] act founded in March 1983. The line-up consists of founder member [[Dillie Keane]]; [[Adèle Anderson]], who joined in 1984, and [[Liza Pulman]], who first joined in 2004. The group received a [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]] nomination at the 1984 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]], and went on to be nominated three times for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment|Olivier Award for Best Entertainment]] (1995, 2000 and 2004), and twice for the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue]] (2005 and 2010). Keane and Anderson were also nominated for the 2010 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]].

==History==
[[File:Barefaced Chic Photo.JPG|thumb|left|(from left to right) [[Adèle Anderson]], [[Dillie Keane]] and Marilyn Cutts performing in ''Barefaced Chic!'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]].]]
Fascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by [[Dillie Keane]],&lt;ref name="BTG-DK"/&gt; along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been [[Adèle Anderson]] — who joined the group in 1984 — and Keane. The trio started performing in a [[West End of London|West End]] [[wine bar]], but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Over the years, they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] nominations for ''[[Laurence Olivier Award for  Best Entertainment|Best Entertainment]]'', in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted ''Most Popular Act 1985'' by [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] magazine and also earned a [[if.comedy award|Perrier Comedy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp |title=Best comedy show |work=Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group broke up in 1989&lt;ref name="GBA-FA"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently reformed in 1994, and performed for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, ''One Last Flutter'', ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time.&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COM-FA"&gt;

[[Liza Pulman]] joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show ''Absolutely Fabulous'' twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan. The show earned them a 2005 [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue|Outstanding revue]].&lt;ref name="BTG-DK"&gt;

The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as [[Stop The Week|Stop the Week]], After Hours, [[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]] and [[TV-am]].&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;
Some of their most famous songs include ''Shattered Illusions'', ''Herpes Tango'', ''Lieder'' and ''Taboo''.  They were the subject of several [[BBC]] documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine for ten years, and written two books, ''The Joy of Sequins'' in 1995 and ''Fascinating Who?'' in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time "juggling acting, cabaret and writing". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred [[Irish setter]] called "Dillie", born in 1999.

After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director, [[Russell Churney]],&lt;ref name="NYT040601"/&gt; plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228012309/http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm |date=28 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nathan@bluekitedesigns.com for Jermyn Street Theatre |url=http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/ |title=Jermyn Street Theatre, the official online home of London's leading Off-West-End venue |publisher=Jermynstreettheatre.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |title=COLE KITCHENN LTD – Producers – General Management – Personal Management |publisher=Colekitchenn.com |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they performed at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]], followed by three nationwide tours.

[[Image:Glasmacherfamilie Familie Friedrich mit Kreuz 1596.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Votive portrait]] of the Northern Bohemian Glassworks Master '''Martin Friedrich the Younger''' and his Family (about 1596).]]

== History ==
From as early as 750 years ago, the shadowy picture of the oldest German-Bohemian glass-maker family Friedrich emerges, who contributed greatly towards the creation of the world-famous [[Bohemian glass]] (also called ''Bohemian [[Lead crystal|Crystal]]''). In pre-[[Hussite]] times they produced amazing works of vitreous art near Daubitz, nowadays called [[Doubice]]. During the 16th and 17th centuries, as a result of the family’s development of their glass factory in Oberkreibitz, today [[Horní Chribská]], Bohemian glass art enjoyed its first heyday.

The expansion of this glass-maker family over many European countries is unparalleled. Its hut master dynasties made glass history in [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Austria]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Slovenia]]. Its glass-makers proved their artistic skills and technological experience in [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Styria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]] and so on. The well-known glass artist [[Friedrich Egermann]] also ranked among the family’s descendants as the  natural historian and explorer of South America [[Thaddäus Haenke]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4919">'''Function Representation''' (FRep&lt;ref&gt;Shape Modeling and Computer Graphics with Real Functions, [http://www.hyperfun.org/F-rep.html FRep Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; or F-Rep) is used in [[solid modeling]], volume modeling and [[computer graphics]]. FRep was introduced in "Function representation in geometric modeling: concepts, implementation and applications" &lt;ref&gt;A. Pasko, V. Adzhiev, A. Sourin, V. Savchenko, "Function representation in geometric modeling: concepts, implementation and applications", The Visual Computer, vol.11, no.8, 1995, pp.429-446.&lt;/ref&gt; as a uniform representation of multidimensional geometric objects (shapes). An object as a point set in multidimensional space is defined by a single continuous real-valued function of point coordinates &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2, ..., x_n)&lt;/math&gt; which is evaluated at the given point by a procedure traversing a tree structure with primitives in the leaves and operations in the nodes of the tree. The points with &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2, ..., x_n) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; belong to the object, and the points with &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2, ..., x_n) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; are outside of the object. The point set with &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2, ..., x_n)=0&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[isosurface]].

== Geometric domain ==
The geometric domain of FRep in 3D space includes solids with [[non-manifold model]]s and lower-dimensional entities (surfaces, curves, points) defined by zero value of the function. A primitive can be defined by an equation or by a "black box" procedure converting point coordinates into the function value. Solids bounded by algebraic surfaces, skeleton-based implicit surfaces, and convolution surfaces, as well as procedural objects (such as solid noise), and voxel objects can be used as primitives (leaves of the construction tree). In the case of a voxel object (discrete field), it should be converted to a continuous real function, for example, by applying the trilinear or higher-order interpolation. 

Many operations such as set-theoretic, blending, offsetting, projection, non-linear deformations, metamorphosis, sweeping, hypertexturing, and others, have been formulated for this representation in such a manner that they yield continuous real-valued functions as output, thus guaranteeing the closure property of the representation. [[R-function]]s originally introduced in V.L. Rvachev's "On the analytical description of some geometric objects",&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Rvachev, "On the analytical description of some geometric objects", Reports of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, vol. 153, no. 4, 1963, pp. 765-767 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; provide &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; [[Smooth_function|continuity]] for the functions exactly defining the set-theoretic operations (min/max functions are a particular case). Because of this property, the result of any supported operation can be treated as the input for a subsequent operation; thus very complex models can be created in this way from a single functional expression. FRep modeling is supported by the special-purpose language [[HyperFun]].

== Shape Models ==
FRep combines and generalizes different shape models like
* algebraic surfaces
* skeleton based "implicit" surfaces
* set-theoretic solids or CSG ([[Constructive Solid Geometry]])
* sweeps
* volumetric objects
* parametric models
* procedural models

A more general "constructive hypervolume"&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasko, V. Adzhiev, B. Schmitt, C. Schlick, "Constructive hypervolume modelling", Graphical Models, 63(6), 2001, pp. 413-442.&lt;/ref&gt; allows for modeling multidimensional point sets with attributes (volume models in 3D case). Point set geometry and attributes have independent representations but are treated uniformly. A point set in a geometric space of an arbitrary dimension is an FRep based geometric model of a real object. An attribute that is also represented by a real-valued function (not necessarily continuous) is a mathematical model of an object property of an arbitrary nature (material, photometric, physical, medicine, etc.). The concept of "implicit complex" proposed in "Cellular-functional modeling of heterogeneous objects"&lt;ref&gt;V. Adzhiev, E. Kartasheva, T. Kunii, A. Pasko, B. Schmitt, "Cellular-functional modeling of heterogeneous objects", Proc. 7th ACM Symposium on Solid Modeling and Applications, Saarbrücken, Germany, ACM Press, 2002, pp. 192-203. 3-540-65620-0&lt;/ref&gt; provides a framework for including geometric elements of different dimensionality by combining polygonal, parametric, and FRep components into a single cellular-functional model of a heterogeneous object.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4707">Genetic testing is the analysis of human genes, proteins, and certain metabolites, in order to detect inherited disease-related propensities. These tests can predict the risk of disease in adults, as well as establish prenatal and infant prognoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic testing and public policy|pmc=1112777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits can be substantial, but so can the risks. The possible adverse consequences of genetic tests include discrimination in employment and health insurance, and breaches of privacy. Government policies are therefore needed to assure the proper use of genetic tests. The first piece of federal legislation came into effect in 2000.

A second federal law, the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA), has two parts. Title I prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance. Title II prohibits employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is genetic discrimination?|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/discrimination|accessdate=14 January 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal legislation==
The first of two pieces of federal legislation to directly address the use of genetic information in the United States was the '''Executive Order Protecting Federal Employees'''. Signed into law by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] on February 8, 2000, the [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] prohibited all federal agencies and departments from using genetic information to discriminate in the hiring or promoting of federal employees. The Executive Order was endorsed by the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American College of Medical Genetics]], the [[National Society of Genetic Counselors]], and the [[Genetic Alliance]]. The Executive Order also provided explicit [[genetic privacy]] regulations within the federal government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/legislat.shtml#I Genetics Legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second piece of federal legislation to address the use of genetic information and discrimination in the United States was the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) of 2008. GINA protects U.S. citizens from [[genetic discrimination]] in employment as well as in [[health care]] and [[health insurance]]. The bill was signed into law on May 21, 2008 by President [[George W. Bush]]. Prior to the introduction of GINA in 2003, several bills of similar intent were introduced: the Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/s1416 Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995 (1995; 104th Congress S. 1416) - GovTrack.us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Genetic Fairness Act of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://votereports.org/bills/104-s1600 "Genetic Fairness Act of 1996" - Bills - VoteReports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr2748 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1995 (1995; 104th Congress H.R. 2748) - GovTrack.us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnapolicy.org/gina/gina.history.html Genetics &amp; Public Policy Center || GINA || About GINA || History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

GINA laws do not protect people from genetic discrimination in every circumstance. It does not apply when an employer has fewer than 15 employees. It does not cover people in the U.S. military or those receiving health benefits through the Veterans Health Administration or Indian Health Service. GINA also does not protect against genetic discrimination in forms of insurance other than health insurance, such as life, disability, or long-term care insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The GINA Legislation and Regulations|url=http://ginahelp.org/|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State legislation==
Currently, legislation pertaining to the use of genetic information and genetic discrimination at the state level varies by state. The first state laws regarding genetic information were typically designed to prohibit genetic discrimination, including prohibiting employers from demanding workers and applicants to provide genetic information as a condition of their employment. More recent laws have permitted individuals to undergo genetic testing when that individual is filing a compensation claim or has requested the test to demonstrate susceptibility to potentially toxic substances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''international trade in parrots''' is a lucrative enterprise, and forms an important part of the international [[wildlife trade]]. As [[parrot]]s have become increasingly endangered, many countries have placed restrictions on the trade and/or prohibited the trade altogether. Despite the restriction on trade in many countries however, the market still operates both legally and illegally.

Approximately 2,600 of the more than 9,600 species of birds in existence are subject to trade,&lt;ref name=Latin&gt;
'''[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]].''' 2011. ''[http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i0708e/i0708e00.pdf Trade in Wild Birds and Related Bird Movements in Latin America and the Caribbean]'' Animal Production and Health Paper No. 166. Rome.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and 20% of these species belong to the order Psittaciformes (parrots).&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt;{{rp|3}} In 2009, 3.9% of households in the United States owned birds, which equated to 11,199,000 pet birds in total,&lt;ref name=Weston&gt;

===Top exporters===
The greatest number of parrots came from [[Latin America]]n countries (mostly [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[Argentina]]).&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;

===Top importers===
The largest importers of parrots are:&lt;ref name = Latin/&gt;
* The [[European Union]]
* The United States
* [[Singapore]]
* [[Central America]]
* The [[Caribbean]]

Prior to 1992, the United States was the largest importer, but after the Wild Bird Conservation Act was passed in 1992, the European Union emerged as the leading importer.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt; In the 2000-2003 period, the EU imported 2.8 million wild bird species, accounting for 93% of imports worldwide.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt;

The chart below graphs the gross exports of true parrots, belonging to the family Psittacidae, a sub-taxa of the Psittaciformes order.

However, the statistics greatly underestimate the quantity of birds channeled into the pet trade. Mortalities that occur prior to export are excluded.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt; An estimated 60% of the birds taken from the wild for trade may perish before reaching the market and many die in transport.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legal rules and restrictions regarding Psittacidae trade==
The Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA)&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Wild Bird Conservation Act

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted on October 23, 1992, to protect exotic bird species from international trade. The Act maintains that wild-caught birds may only be imported into the United States if they are produced in accordance with service-approved management plans for sustainable use of the species.&lt;ref name = US/&gt; After the WBCA, the number of parrots imported in the US declined from over 100,000 annually to only hundreds annually.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

The [[European Union]] placed a temporary ban on wild bird imports in October 2005 after imported birds died from the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 bird flu]]. The ban was made permanent in 2007, allowing only captive-bred birds from approved countries to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on International Trade protects certain endangered species by law, and prohibits them from being traded internationally. Several true parrots from the genus [[Ara (genus)|''Ara'']] ([[great green macaw]], [[blue-throated macaw]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[military macaw]]), are all protected under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.&lt;ref&gt;“Appendices 1,2, and 3” Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade in Mexico==
Although it is difficult to account for the exact number of birds trafficked each year, a comprehensive survey of parrot trappers by [[Defenders of Wildlife]], a national nonprofit organization in Mexico, estimates that anywhere from 65,000 to 78,500 birds are captured and traded annually. The same report indicates that [[Psittacidae]] populations have declined as much as 30% in Mexico over the past century due to a combination of habitat loss and overexploitation of the trade of these animals.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

===History===
Although declining parrot populations in Mexico are a modern worry, the [[Psittacine]] trade is deeply rooted in the country’s history and culture. The [[Aztecs]] often kept parrots and macaws as pets, and their feathers were used to make ceremonial tokens. Smaller tribes taken over by the Aztec empire often provided their conquerors with Macaw feathers as a form of tribute and a symbol of submission.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1990s two major factors prompted the decrease of the flow of these birds into the U.S. First, the passage of the Wild Bird Conservation Act in the United States in 1992 led to a dramatic increase in the regulation of exotic birds entering the United States, naturally followed by a decrease in trade.&lt;ref name="Cornell University Law School"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Wild Bird Conservation Act authorized the creation of captive breeding centers in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cornell University Law School"/&gt; Although captive bred birds are usually more expensive due to the costs of being raised in captivity, Americans looking for exotic pets are generally able to afford these higher prices. The sale of captive bred parrots has largely overtaken that of illegal exotics in the U.S.&lt;ref name = Pires&gt;

However, it has been determined that internal trade of Psittacines within Mexico is now actually far more detrimental and widespread than international [[smuggling]].&lt;ref name = Guzman1&gt;

===Illegal Trade Within Mexico===

The regulation of the parrot trade in Mexico has proven to be a problematic process. Until 2003, the parrot trade was authorized on a species by species basis. The number of species that could be legally trapped and sold had steadily declined since 1979, and in 2003 the [[Mexican government]] banned the trade of all Psittacines. However, in 2006 permits were once again issued for the capture and trade of select species. Although some trade in Psittacines was legal between 2006 and 2008, the absence of law enforcement for wildlife crimes meant that even trade in authorized species was usually perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman22&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2008, many parrots were captured and sold by bird trapper and salesman unions. These unions were often registered with the state, and agreed to terms that attempted to protect parrot populations in return for official trapping authorizations. Although these stipulations aimed to protect Psittacine populations, they proved to be largely ineffective in practice.&lt;ref name = Guzman33&gt;

The law also set quotas and other specific rules for trappers within these UMA’s. However, the Mexican wildlife law enforcement agency, PROFEPA, was too understaffed and underfunded to enforce these laws. It was not capable of monitoring each UMA for illicit activity. Instead, it visited a select group of predetermined UMA’s each year, and performed inspections of UMA’s where illegal activity had been reported.&lt;ref name = Guzman3&gt;

An absence of a concrete body of knowledge regarding Psitaccine populations and the activity of trappers within these areas meant that quotas were often exceeded and authorizations were bypassed. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that as much as 75% of the parrot trade, even in authorized species, was being perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman43&gt;

A 2006 report by Cantu et al. report demonstrated that the illegal trade of Psittacines actually ''increased'' when [[trapping]] was authorized by government agencies. This was because illegal activity was much more easily concealed under the auspices of legal trade.&lt;ref name = Guzman4&gt;

PROFEPA attempts to combat the illegal parrot trade using several methods including directly attending to reports regarding illegal activity; making scheduled inspections of markets, pet shops, zoos, and UMA’s; pinpointing identified locations for sale and transport; and patrolling ports, airports, and borders. However, these efforts do not make a significant impact. Much of PROFEPA’s enforcement activity is concentrated on the point of sale, but the high rate of mortality in trafficked parrots means that intervention efforts often occur too late to save the smuggled birds. The agency also lacks the resources to conduct raids on warehouses and markets that are used to store and sell parrots. Even when these operations can be implemented, PROFEPA is hindered by insiders who tip off the bird traders so that they can hide their animals before the raids occur. (new info, defenders, 54) Because of its ineffective system of management, it has been estimated that PROFEPA’s seizures of wildlife represent only 2% of the total annual Psittacine trade.&lt;ref name="Guzman53"&gt;{{cite report

A 2006 report by Cantu. et al. is one of the only comprehensive and concentrated bodies of knowledge regarding the extent of the Psittacine trade in Mexico. This report is largely based on interviews with bird traders and union leaders, and attempts to organize data collected by a variety of Mexican agencies regarding the issue. However, the document is limited by a lack of concrete evidence specifically regarding the number of birds taken from the wild each year, and relies on interviews and speculation to fill in the gaps left by the absence of scientific data. It advocates for an increase in Psittacine [[population studies]] to regulate trade and to be able to formulate effective measures for reducing the exploitation of Psittacine populations.&lt;ref name="Clarkeandpires1"&gt;{{cite journal

Alternative forms of prevention were suggested in several different studies. A 2011 report by Pires and Moreto advocates a system of situational crime prevention in which enforcement is targeted on a community basis. They write, “…in areas where parrot poaching is concentrated, possible solutions to poaching include: removing ladders from trees, keeping a watch out by citizens/police during breeding periods, shutting down illegal pet markets, and [[CCTV]] for the most poached species.”&lt;ref name = Moreto1&gt;

A similar study by Pires and Clarke suggests that campaigns to build national pride for the Psitaccines of Mexico could be effective in lowering trafficking rates, but they acknowledge that the campaign may not be successful due to [[Mexico]]’s large urban population and diversity of parrot species. A more comprehensive and concrete suggestion, also by Pires and Clarke, is to promote and invest in ecotourist lodges that partner with local communities in order to conserve Psittacine populations by using them to attract tourists who stimulate the local economy. If these lodges were effective in providing adequate support to surrounding communities, it is foreseeable that the parrot trade in those areas would decrease as opportunistic trappers realize the value of psittacines as a [[natural resource]]. Need based trapping would decline as primary or secondary incomes would become dependent on the [[ecotourism]] business.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite report

In [[astronomy]], the '''intracluster medium''' ('''ICM''') is the superheated [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] that permeates a [[galaxy cluster]]. The gas consists mainly of [[ionized hydrogen]] and [[helium]] and accounts for most of the [[baryon]]ic material in galaxy clusters. The ICM is heated to temperatures on the order of 10 to 100 [[Orders of magnitude (temperature)|megakelvins]], emitting strong [[X-ray]] radiation.

Although the ICM on the whole contains the bulk of a cluster's baryons, it is not very dense, with typical values of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cubic centimeter. The [[mean free path]] of the particles is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m, or about one lightyear. The density of the ICM rises towards the centre of the cluster with a relatively strong peak. In addition, the temperature of the ICM typically drops to 1/2 or 1/3 of the outer value in the central regions. Once the density of the plasma reaches a critical value, enough interactions between the ions ensures cooling via X-ray radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=J.

==Observing the intracluster medium==
As the ICM is at such high temperatures, it emits [[X-ray]] radiation, mainly by the [[bremsstrahlung]] process and X-ray [[emission lines]] from the heavy elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These X-rays can be observed using an [[X-ray telescope]] and through analysis of this data, it is possible to determine the physical conditions, including the temperature, density, and metallicity, of the plasma.

Measurements of the temperature and density profiles in galaxy clusters allow for a determination of the mass distribution profile of the ICM through [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;modeling. The mass distributions determined from these methods reveal masses that far exceed the luminous mass seen and are thus a strong indication of dark matter in galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kotov|first=O.|last2=Vikhlinin|first2=A.|year=2006|title=Chandra Sample of Galaxy Clusters at z = 0.4-0.55: Evolution in the Mass-Temperature Relation|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/641/i=2/a=752|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=641|issue=2|pages=752-755|doi=10.1086/500553|issn=0004-637X|bibcode=2006ApJ...641..752K|arxiv = astro-ph/0511044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverse Compton Scattering of low energy photons through interactions with the relativistic electrons in the ICM cause distortions in the spectrum of the [[Cosmic microwave background|cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB)]], known as the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]]. These temperature distortions in the CMB can be used by telescopes such as the [[South Pole Telescope]] to detect dense clusters of galaxies at high redshifts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staniszewski|first=Z.|last2=Ade|first2=P.

== Cooling flows ==
Plasma in regions of the cluster, with a cooling time shorter than the age of the system, should be cooling due to strong X-ray radiation where emission is proportional to the density squared. Since the density of the ICM is highest towards the center of the cluster, the radiative cooling time drops a significant amount.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fabian|first=A. C.|date=2003-06-01|title=Cluster cores and cooling flows|journal=Galaxy Evolution: Theory &amp; Observations (Eds. Vladimir Avila-Reese|bibcode=2003RMxAC..17..303F|volume=17|pages=303–313|arxiv = astro-ph/0210150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central cooled gas can no longer support the weight of the external hot gas and the pressure gradient drives what is known as a [[cooling flow]] where the hot gas from the external regions flows slowly towards the center of the cluster. This inflow would result in regions of cold gas and thus regions of new star formation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fabian|first=A.

These new images do not indicate signs of new star formation on the order of what was historically predicted, motivating research into the mechanisms that would prevent the central ICM from cooling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23237">'''Isogenic human disease models''' are a family of cells that are selected or engineered to accurately model the [[genetics]] of a specific patient population, ''[[in vitro]]''. They are provided with a genetically matched 'normal cell' to provide an isogenic system to research disease biology and novel therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Torrance CJ, Agrawal V, Vogelstein B, Kinzler KW |title=Use of isogenic human cancer cells for high-throughput screening and drug discovery |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=940–5 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11581659 |doi=10.1038/nbt1001-940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used to model any disease with a genetic foundation. [[Cancer]] is one such disease for which isogenic human disease models have been widely used.

==Historical models==
Human isogenic disease models have been likened to 'patients in a test-tube', since they incorporate the latest research into human genetic diseases and do so without the difficulties and limitations involved in using non-human models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disease models of breast cancer |journal=Drug Discovery Today  |volume=1 |pages=9–16 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.ddmod.2004.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, cells obtained from animals, typically mice, have been used to model cancer-related pathways. However, there are obvious limitations inherent in using animals for modelling genetically determined diseases in humans. Despite a large proportion of genetic conservation between humans and mice, there are significant differences between the biology of mice and humans that are important to cancer research. For example, major differences in [[telomere]] regulation enable murine cells to bypass the requirement for [[telomerase]] upregulation, which is a rate-limiting step in human cancer formation. As another example, certain ligand-receptor interactions are incompatible between mice and humans. Additionally, experiments have demonstrated important and significant differences in the ability to transform cells, compared with cells of murine origin. For these reasons, it remains essential to develop models of cancer that employ human cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirata R, Chamberlain J, Dong R, Russell DW |title=Targeted transgene insertion into human chromosomes by adeno-associated virus vectors |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=735–8 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12089561 |doi=10.1038/nbt0702-735 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeting vectors==
Isogenic cell lines are created via a process called homologous gene-targeting. Targeting vectors that utilize homologous recombination are the tools or techniques that are used to knock-in or knock-out the desired disease-causing mutation or SNP ([[single nucleotide polymorphism]]) to be studied. Although disease mutations can be harvested directly from cancer patients, these cells usually contain many background mutations in addition to the specific mutation of interest, and a matched normal cell line is typically not obtained. Subsequently, targeting vectors are used to '[[Gene knockin|knock-in]]' or '[[Gene knockout|knock out]]' gene mutations enabling a switch in both directions; from a normal to cancer genotype; or vice versa; in characterized human cancer cell lines such as [[HCT116 cells|HCT116]] or Nalm6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Masters JR |title=Human cancer cell lines: fact and fantasy |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=233–6 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11252900 |doi=10.1038/35043102 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v1/n3/full/nrm1200_233a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several gene targeting technologies used to engineer the desired mutation, the most prevalent of which are briefly described, including key advantages and limitations, in the summary table below.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
! Technique !! Gene Knock-In !! Gene Knock-out
|-
| rAAV (recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Engelhardt JF |title=AAV hits the genomic bull's-eye |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=949–50 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16900138 |doi=10.1038/nbt0806-949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; || Targeted insertions or modifications are created within endogenous genes; and so are subject to:
# The correct gene-regulation mechanisms; and
# Accurately reflect the disease events found in real patients.
rAAV can introduce subtle point mutations, SNPs as well as small insertions with high efficiency. Moreover, many peer reviewed studies have shown that rAAV does not introduce any confounding off target genomic events.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Appears to be the preferred method being adopted in academia, Biotech and Pharma on a precision versus time versus cost basis.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}|
| Gene knockouts are at the endogenous locus, and thus are definitive, stable and patient relevant. No confounding off-target effects are elicited at other genomic loci. It requires a 2- step process:
# Generate a heterozygous KO
# Generate a bi-allelic knockout by targeting the second allele.
This process can therefore generate 3 genotypes (+/+; -/+ and -/-); enabling therefore the analysis of haplo-insufficient gene function.

Current limitation is the need to sequentially target single alleles making generation of knock-out cell lines a two-step process.|
|-
| Plasmid-based homologous recombination || Insertion is at the endogenous locus and has all the above benefits, but it is very inefficient. It also requires a promoterless drug selection strategy entailing bespoke construct generation. A large historical bank of cell lines has been generated using this method which has been displaced by other methods since the mid-1990s.|| Deletion is at endogenous locus and has all the above benefits, but it is inefficient. It also requires a promoterless drug selection strategy that entails bespoke construct generation
|-
| Flip-in || This is an efficient technique that allows the directed insertion of 'ectopic' transgenes at a single pre-defined genomic locus (integration via a [[FLP-FRT recombination|FLP recombinase]] site). This is not a technique for modifying an endogenous locus. Transgenes will usually be under the control of an exogenous promoter, or a partially defined promoter-unit in the incorrect genomic location. Their expression will therefore not be under the same genomic and epigenetic regulation as the endogenous loci, which limits the utility of these systems for studying gene-function. They are however, good for eliciting rapid and stable exogenous gene expression.|| Not applicable
|-
| [[Zinc finger nuclease|Zinc-Finger Nucleases]] (ZFNs)|| ZFNs have been reported to achieve high rates of genetic knock-outs within a target endogenous gene. If ZFNs are co-delivered with a transgene construct homologous to the target gene, genetic knock-in's or insertions can also be achieved.&lt;ref name=Urnov2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Urnov | first1 = Fyodor D. | last2 = Rebar | first2 = Edward J. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = Michael C. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = H.

Off target deletions or insertions elsewhere in the genome are a significant concern. The speed advantage of obtaining a biallelic KO in one step is also partially mitigated if one still needs to derive a clonal cell line to study gene function in a homogenous cell-population.
|-
| Meganucleases || Meganucleases are operationally analogous to ZFN's. There are limitations inherent in their use such as the meganuclease vector design which can take up to 9 months and cost tens of thousands of dollars.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This makes meganucleases more attractive in high-value applications such as gene therapy, agrobiotechnology and engineering of bioproducer lines.|||

==Homologous recombination in cancer cell disease models==
Homologous recombination (HR) is a kind of genetic recombination in which genetic sequences are exchanged between two similar segments of DNA. HR plays a major role in eukaryotic cell division, promoting genetic diversity through the exchange between corresponding segments of DNA to create new, and potentially beneficial combinations of genes.

HR performs a second vital role in DNA repair, enabling the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA which is a common occurrence during a cell's lifecycle. It is this process which is artificially triggered by the above technologies and bootstrapped in order to engender 'knock-ins' or 'knockouts' in specific genes5, 7.

A recent key advance was discovered using AAV-homologous recombination vectors, which increases the low natural rates of HR in differentiated human cells when combined with gene-targeting vectors-sequences.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Commercialization==
Factors leading to the recent commercialization of isogenic human cancer cell disease models for the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories are twofold.

Firstly, successful patenting of enhanced targeting vector technology has provided a basis for commercialization of the cell-models which eventuate from the application of these technologies.

Secondly, the trend of relatively low success rates in pharmaceutical RnD and the enormous costs have created a real need for new research tools that illicit how patient sub-groups will respond positively or be resistant to targeted cancer therapeutics based upon their individual genetic profile.

There are several companies working to address this need, a list of the key players and their technology offering is provided below.

'''Joseph Franz Schacht''' (15 March 1902 – 1 August 1969) was a British-German professor of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Islam]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York.  He was the leading Western scholar on [[Sharia|Islamic law]], whose ''Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950) is still considered a centrally important work on the subject.  The author of many articles in the first and second editions of the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Schacht also edited the second edition of ''The Legacy of Islam'' for the [[Legacy series|''Legacy'' series]] of Oxford University Press and authored a textbook under the title ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964).

==Life and career==
{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2016}}
Schacht was born into a Catholic family but, with a zeal for study, became at an early age a student in a Hebrew school. In Breslau and Leipizig he studied Semitic languages, Greek, and Latin, under professors including [[Gotthelf Bergsträsser|Gotthelf Bergsträßer]]. In 1925 he obtained his first academic position at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg]] in Breisgau. In 1927 he became there a professor extraordinarius, making him the youngest professor in all of Germany, and in 1929 a professor ordinarius of [[Semitic language]]s. In 1932 he was appointed a professor at the [[University of Königsberg]]. But in 1934, without being directly threatened or persecuted, Schacht, as a strong opponent of the Nazi regime, went to [[Cairo]], where he taught until 1939 as a professor. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he happened to be in England, where he offered his services to the British government and worked for the [[BBC]]. In 1947 he became a British citizen.

Schacht taught at [[Oxford University]] from 1946. In 1954 he moved to the [[Netherlands]] and taught at the [[University of Leiden]]. In the academic year 1957–1958, he taught at [[Columbia University]], where, in 1959 he became a full professor of Arabic and [[Islamic studies]]. He remained at Columbia until his retirement in 1969 as professor emeritus.

One of Schacht's major contributions to the history of early Islam is the recognition that [[Hadith]] probably stems from those in whom the different traditions of the past converge, and this convergence Schacht describes as "common link". This concept was later used productively by many other [[Oriental studies|orientalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, Jeanette: [http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/ilsp/publications/wakin.pdf ''Remembering Joseph Schacht (1902–1969)''].

==Thought==
===Theory of Islamic law===
Schacht argued that Islamic law was not as classical Islamic jurisprudence taught,  
*the product of an ordered following of four sources/components (in the following order) — 
##the [[Quran]], 
##the [[Sunnah]] (the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community), 
##''[[Qiyas]]'' (the process of deductive analogy ), and 
##''[[Ijma]]'' (the consensus/agreement of Muslim scholars) ; 
*neither did its chronology  follow a direct path of [[Allah]]-&gt; [[Muhammad]]-&gt; [[Sahabah|Companions]]-&gt; [[Tabi‘un|Followers]]-&gt; [[Fiqh]],&lt;ref name="Maghen-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maghen|first1=Ze'ev|title=Dead Tradition: Joseph Schacht and the Origins of "Popular Practice"|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2003|volume=10|issue=3|pages=276–347|jstor=3399422}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*nor was fiqh development centered shortly after Muhammad's death in the city ([[Medina]]) where he had established his state and where memory and traditions of him were the strongest. 
Rather the law arose from historical development of three different "sunnas" — bodies of custom, rules and law — operating in parallel during the period of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. 
#The "pre-Islamic sunna of Arabia, 
#the mixed custom-administrative law sunna of the distant provinces" of the Umayyads, and later 
#the "living traditions" of the newly formed Islamic schools. 
Unification of Islamic legal thought (so that only one sunna remained) occurred under the legal scholar [[Al-Shafi‘i]] (767-820), when the ahadith of Muhammad became pre-eminent (except for the Quran).  The most important of the schools of Islamic law developed in [[Kufa]] in [[Mesopotamia]], according to Schacht's research, and its legal precepts spread to other cities such as Medina."&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950), supra note 5, at 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964), supra note 5, at 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-9-11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=11 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 100 A.H. (720 CE), ahadith of Muhammad "began to be fabricated", forming the Islamic Sunnah as it is known today. While scholars recognized that many ahadith were false and attempted to weed these out with [[Hadith studies|ʻilm al-ḥadīth]], this was in vane as most if not all are inauthentic.  According to Schacht, with the exception of "a few modifications dictated by the Qur'an", the Islamic "Sunna" is the same as the "sunna" of "pre-Mohammed Arabia".&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-9-10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|pages=9–10 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One  example of the power of traditional law was that under the caliphate, theft was punished by flogging, even though the Qur'an had prescribed maiming/amputation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964),  supra note 5, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schacht argues that in part the fabrication of ahadith came from "a literary convention, which found particular favor in Iraq", whereby authors/scholars would put their "own doctrine or work under the aegis of an ancient authority."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=12 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate prestigious "ancient authority" in this context was Muhammad and "around 120 A.H." scholars in Kufa, "followed in a few years by the Medinese" began falsely ascribing "their new doctrines back to earlier jurists", and over time extended them back to Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Schacht also blames the religious fervor of those who "detested" use of ''Qiyas'' and ''Ijma''. Providing suspicious justification for the "Traditionist" fabricators were ahadith such as, "sayings attributed to me which agree with the Qur'an go back to me, whether I actually said them or not."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schacht, "Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Though false, the forgeries could also be justified as recognizing the "final legitimacy of what the prophet Muhammad did and said.&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964), supra note 5, at 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of late creation===
As evidence that most ahadith were created after 100 A.H., Schacht notes that: 
#all authentic early writings of Islamic law are virtually devoid of any mention of ahadith of Muhammad;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950), supra note 5, at 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the early doctrines of the schools of law were "almost always traced" to an earlier jurist or to the ''[[Sahabah]]'' ("companions" of Muhammad) but "virtually never" to Muhammad;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964),  supra note 5, at 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950),  supra note 5, at 21, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
#but "the best way of proving that a tradition did not exist at a certain time" according to Schacht, was "to show that it is not used as a legal argument in a discussion which would have made reference to it imperative, if it had existed."&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950),  supra note 5, at 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reply to the argument that jurists, etc. may not have used a legal argument in a discussion because they had not known about it, Schacht states:
::a. communications in the Islamic empire at that time were good enough for "doctrines and views" to "spread easily and quickly from one juristic center to another";
::b. if the behavior and utterances of Muhammad were the basis of Islamic law from the beginning of Islamic society, it is unlikely those involved in matters of law — "among the most learned and pious men of Islam" — would not know them;
::c. there were not dozens but "hundreds of examples in which the disparity between an early decision and a later tradition took place". According to David F. Forte, "it goes beyond rational belief to think that these men would have been so consistently ignorant of contrary actions by the Prophet."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte |first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=14 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
===Debate===
Some have argued against Schacht that while the ahadith are fabricated as Schacht claims, the substance of the rules of law that the ahadith were invented to support were promulgated by the Prophet while at Medina." 
--&gt;

===''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (book)===

As a whole, ''Origins'' critiques the methods and standards of ḥadīth verification as they were first articulated by [[Al-Shafi‘i]] and subsequently developed by his students in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, an early and centrally important stage in the formation of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. His research builds upon the work of important figures in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century study of Islamic law in Europe, such as [[Gustav Weil]] and [[Ignác Goldziher]]. In particular, Schacht advocates a skeptical approach to medieval forms of 'isnād criticism, which he views as fabricated and comprising the greater part of [[Sunni]] approaches to verifying Prophetic traditions of a legal nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Argument and Method ====

Schacht locates the origins of '''ilm al-ḥadīth'' in the eight and ninth centuries CE, a moment in the development of Islamic legal reasoning coinciding with the professionalization of the traditionalist (''muḥaddith'') and jurist (''[[faqīh]]'') classes in the urban centers of the [[Middle East]].

Schacht credits Imām [[Al-Shafi‘i|al-Shāfiʻī]], the founder of an [[Shafi'i|eponymous school of Islamic jurisprudence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "creating" "the essentials" of the theory of [[fiqh]] (the system of Islamic jurisprudence), made up of four principles/sources/components mentioned above: the [[Qurʾān]], the ḥadīth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muḥammad]] and his [[Sahabah|Companions]], scholarly consensus ([[Ijma|ijmāʿ]]), analogical reasoning ([[Qiyas|qiyās]]).&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snouck Hurgronje, C. ''Verspreide Geschriften. v.ii. 1923-7, page 286-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Étude sur la théorie du droit musulman'' (Paris : Marchal et Billard, 1892-1898.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth, D.S., ''The Early Development of Mohammedanism'', 1914, page 65ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Joseph in ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', 1913 v.IV, sv ''Usul''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Quran has relatively few verses pertaining to fiqh, Al-Shafi‘i's system meant that "the great bulk" of the rules of the Islamic law were derived from ahadith.&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte|first1=David F. |title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=2 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Schacht states that Shafi'i repeatedly insisted that "nothing" could override the authority of the Prophet, even if it was "attested only by an isolated tradition", and that if a hadith was "well-authenticated" (''[[Hadith terminology#Ṣaḥīḥ|Ṣaḥīḥ]]'') going back to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, it had "precedence over the opinions of his [[Sahabah|Companions]], their successors, and later authorities".&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-11&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of Goldziher before him, Schacht argues that it was al-Shāfiʻī who first elevated the sunna and its constituent traditions to great legal prominence. The material importance of the Qurʾān and ḥadīth thereafter enjoyed a status comparable to that of juristic consensus, though for al-Shāfiʻī traditions credibly attributed to the Prophet were to be considered more authoritative than those of his Companions, and indeed could supersede all other sources of legal authority. Moreover, an already-existing legal standard based on such a tradition could be overturned only upon the emergence of a ḥadīth that could be more credibly attributable to the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=2–5; 11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Treatise III, Ikhtilāf Mālik wal-Shāfiʻī|pages=177–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Al-Shāfiʻī goes as far as to claim that such well-established traditions invite no debate as to their validity; their truth simply imposes itself upon the human mind, leaving no room for doubt or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Ikhtilāf al-ḥadīth|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Schacht points out, however, that al-Shāfiʻī  inconsistently applies this rule in his own work, alleging that in some cases the jurist favored 'aḥādīth transmitted from Companions that openly contradicted those attributable to the Prophet. These traditions usually included those which validated ritual practices that were either universally agreed upon or else independently verifiable (such as [[salat|daily prayer]]), and those which disputed the legal positions of al-Shāfiʻī's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Ikhtilāf al-ḥadīth|page=57 &amp; 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on this lattermost point, Schacht contends that far from constructing the standards of a legitimate epistemic enterprise al-Shāfiʻī's science of ḥadīth amounts to little more than an uncritical acceptance of Prophetic traditions which justified his own legal preferences. These same traditions, claims Schacht, could not survive a stronger program of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the technical evaluation of traditions would continue to evolve across many generations of Muslim scholars, it seems to have largely proceeded along the lines of the deficient form of ’isnād criticism first articulated here by al-Shāfiʻī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law|year=1966|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=35–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in Origins Schacht presents evidence which in his estimation suggests that there was in fact a large scale fabrication of Prophetic ’isnāds in the generation preceding the life of al-Shāfiʻī's own teacher, [[Malik ibn Anas|Mālik ibn ’Anas]] (d. 795 CE). Even in Mālik's esteemed golden narrative chain there are suspicious gaps and obvious substitutions, sowing significant doubts as to credibility of the relationships he was said to have had with certain key transmitters. For these reasons modern scholars cannot be nearly as optimistic about the historical-analytic value of ḥadīth literature as were their medieval Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht 163-4. compares the unique matn of al-Muw. i.371 with the same in al-Bukhārī, who has Abū Hurayra relate the tradition and not ‘Urwa. At 165-6 Schacht compares al-Shāf‘ī Tr. II with Muw. Al-Shay. 166 and Muw. ii.II.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====

Schacht's views on this matter have come under criticism from scholars in recent decades. His notable critics include [[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami|M. Muṣṭafā al-Aʻẓamī]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Aʻẓamī|first=M. Muṣṭafā|title=On Schacht's Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1985|publisher=King Saud University|location=Riyadh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Wael Hallaq]]. Al-A'zami's work ''On Schacht's Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' is a systematic response to Schacht's thesis. Hallaq argues that Schacht mistakenly assumes that medieval Muslims scholars held ḥadīth to be [[Apodicticity|apodictically true]]. According to Hallaq, it is more likely the case — and indeed apparent to the careful reader upon inspecting the literature — that at least where matters of law were concerned medieval Muslim scholars judged the majority of ḥadīth as only probabilistically true. It was the epistemic sum of probable traditions, and not the assured truth of any one tradition in particular, upon which they built their legal rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|title=The Authenticity of Prophetic Ḥadîth: A Pseudo-Problem|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1999|volume=No. 89|pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Scholarly reaction to Schacht's work has produced "three camps of scholars" according to Mohsen Haredy citing  [[Wael Hallaq]]. Those (such as [[John Wansbrough]], and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]) who seek to "reconfirm his conclusions", and at times going beyond them; those who endeavor to refute them (Nabia Abbott, F. Sezgin, M. Azami, Gregor Schoeler and Johann Fück) and a those "seeking to create a middle, perhaps synthesized, position between the two" (Motzki, D. Santillana, G.H. Juynboll, Fazlur Rahman and James Robson).&lt;ref&gt;Wael B. Hallaq, “[https://archive.org/stream/TheAuthenticityOfPropheticHadithAPseudoProblemWaelB.Hallaq/The%20Authenticity%20of%20Prophetic%20Hadith%20A%20Pseudo-Problem%20(Wael%20B.%20Hallaq)_djvu.txt The Authenticity of Prophetic Hadith: A Pseudo-problem]”, in ''Studia Islamica'', 89 (1999), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haredy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haredy|first1=Mohsen|title=Hadith Textual Criticism: A Reconsideration *|url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=5986|website=Islam Online Archive|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Forte, "nearly all Western Islamic scholars agree that Schacht's evidence against the authenticity of the traditions is virtually unassailable."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=15 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the supporters of his these include Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes, who rights that many ahadith, "are apocryphal and were invented in the 8th century in order to justify innovations and tendencies which were very foreign to the intentions of the Prophet."&lt;ref&gt;M. Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Muslim Institutions 62 (1950), supra note 40, at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; J. N. D. Anderson, who states most ahadith were, "beyond question, fabricated,"&lt;ref&gt;J. N. D.

Khadduri and H. Liebesny eds. 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Earl Wilber II''' (born January 31, 1949) is an American writer on [[transpersonal psychology]] and his own [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Forman, ''A guide to integral psychotherapy: complexity, integration, and spirituality in practice,'' [[SUNY Press]] 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic philosophy which suggests the synthesis of all human knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro" /&gt;

==Biography==
Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] student at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]], ''What Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America'', Bantam, 1996, {{ISBN|0-553-37492-3}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; He became inspired, like many of his generation, by Eastern literature, particularly the [[Tao Te Ching]]. He left Duke and enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska at Lincoln]], but after a few years dropped out of university to devote all his time to studying his own curriculum and writing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|title=Ken Wilber – Teachers – Spirituality &amp; Practice|work=spiritualityandpractice.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131218/http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber stated in 2011 that he has long suffered from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], possibly caused by [[RNase]] enzyme deficiency disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilber |first=Ken |title=Ken Wilber Writes About His Horrific, Near-Fatal Illness |url=http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |accessdate=26 May 2011 |newspaper=New Heaven New Earth |date=December 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724141023/http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=RNase Enzyme Deficiency Disease: Wilber's statement about his health|url=http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|work=IntegralWorld.net|publisher=October 22, 2002|accessdate=26 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605120119/http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_spectrum_of_consciousness.html?id=Wvw9pzzp1C0C | title = The Spectrum of Consciousness | isbn = 9780835606950 | author1 = Wilber | first1 = Ken | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than twenty publishers it was finally accepted in 1977 by [[Quest Books]], and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing. He also helped to launch the journal ''ReVision'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 New Science Library published his anthology ''The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes'',&lt;ref&gt;The Holographic Paradigm and other paradoxes, 1982, {{ISBN|0-87773-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of essays and interviews, including one by [[David Bohm]]. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how [[holography]] and the [[holographic paradigm]] relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983 Wilber married Terry "Treya" Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book ''Grace and Grit''.

In 1987 Wilber moved to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and oversaw the work of the [[Integral Institute]]. Wilber now lives in [[Denver]], Colorado.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Subsequently, Wilber wrote ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]'' (1995), the first volume of his ''Kosmos Trilogy''. ''A Brief History of Everything'' (1996) was the popularised summary of ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'' in interview format. ''The Eye of Spirit'' (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal ''ReVision'' on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as ''One Taste'', a term for [[Cosmic consciousness|unitary consciousness]]. Over the next two years his publisher, [[Shambhala Publications]], released eight re-edited volumes of his ''Collected Works''. In 1999, he finished ''Integral Psychology'' and wrote ''[[A Theory of Everything]]'' (2000). In ''A Theory of Everything'' Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as [[Spiral Dynamics]]. His novel, ''[[Boomeritis]]'' (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the [[egotism]] of the [[baby boomers|baby boom generation]].

In 2012 Wilber joined the [[Advisory board|Advisory Board]] of [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]] which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.&lt;ref name="About Simpol-UK"&gt;About Simpol-UK: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 uk.simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– About Simpol-UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729182456/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endorsements"&gt;Endorsements: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 Simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– Endorsements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729191229/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL), pronounced "ah-qwul", is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro"&gt;Rentschler, Matt. [http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf "AQAL Glossary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228172258/http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf |date=2017-12-28 }} "AQAL: Journal of Integral Theory and Practice," Fall 2006, Vol. 1, No. 3. Retrieved on Dec. 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which do not fit into these four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiandt | first1 = K. | last2 = Forman | first2 = J. | last3 = Erickson Megel | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2003 | title = Integral nursing: an emerging framework for engaging the evolution of the profession | url = http://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(03)00080-0/abstract | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 130–137 | doi=10.1016/s0029-6554(03)00080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. "Lines" of development are various domains which may progress unevenly through different stages .{{refn|group=note|This interpretation is at odds with [[structural stage theory]], which posits an overall follow-up of stages, instead of variations over several domains.}} "States" are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a temporal experience of a higher developmental stage.{{refn|group=note|This too is at odds with structural stage theory, but in line with Wilber's philosophical idealism, which sees the phenomenal world as a concretisation, or immanation, of a "higher," transcendental reality, which can be "realized" in "religious experience."}} "Types" is a rest-category, for phenomena which do not fit in the other four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;"Integral Psychology" In: Weiner, Irving B. &amp; Craighead, W. Edward (ed.), ''The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology'', Vol. 2, 4. ed., Wiley 2010, pp. 830 ff. {{ISBN|978-0-470-17026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Excerpt C: The Ways We Are In This Together | work=Ken Wilber Online | url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm | accessdate=December 26, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223205255/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm/ | archivedate=December 23, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model's apex is formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories&amp;nbsp;— quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types&amp;nbsp;– describe the relative truth of the [[two truths doctrine]] of [[Buddhism]]. According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", exists absolutely.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Madhyamaka]] two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every-"thing" is empty, [[sunyata]] of an unchanging "essence". It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and ''do'' posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.}}

==Other ideas==

===Mysticism and the great chain of being===
One of Wilber's main interests is in mapping what he calls the "neo-perennial philosophy", an integration of some of the views of mysticism typified by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]''  with an account of cosmic [[evolution]] akin to that of the Indian mystic [[Sri Aurobindo]]. He rejects most of the tenets of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]] and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or [[yuga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"I have not identified myself with the perennial philosophy in over fifteen years ... Many of the enduring perennial philosophers—such as [[Nagarjuna]]—were already using postmetaphysical methods, which is why their insights are still quite valid. But the vast majority of perennial philosophers were caught in metaphysical, not critical, thought, which is why I reject their methods almost entirely, and accept their conclusions only to the extent they can be reconstructed"{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322225146/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm |archivedate=2006-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he embraces a more traditionally [[Western world|Western]] notion of the [[great chain of being]]. As in the work of [[Jean Gebser]], this great chain (or "nest") is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber "... the 'Great Nest' is actually just a vast [[Morphic field|morphogenetic field]] of potentials ..." In agreement with Mahayana Buddhism, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], he believes that reality is ultimately a [[nondual]] union of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] and [[substantial form|form]], with form being innately subject to development over time.

===Theory of truth===
{{See also|Esoteric_Buddhism#Two_Truths_Doctrine|l1=Two Truths}}

Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a transcendental reality which is [[Perennial philosophy|perennial]], being the same throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption.{{refn|group=note|The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. See also [[Mysticism|Perennialism versus constructionism]].}} Wilber juxtaposites this generalisation to plain materialism, presenting this as the main paradigma of regular science.&lt;ref name="mystics" /&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "Are the mystics and sages insane? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with the All, in a timeless and eternal and infinite fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine fools. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace of the entire Kosmos—a [[cosmic consciousness|Kosmic consciousness]] that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the [[scientific materialism]] story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"&lt;ref name="mystics"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', p.42–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or "quadrant", has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wilber  | first = Ken  | title = The Eye of Spirit | publisher = [[Shambhala]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1998  | pages = 12–18  | isbn = 1-57062-345-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre/trans fallacy===
Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls "pre-rational" and "trans-rational" stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber's view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm Introduction to the third volume of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615012815/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/ |date=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wilber claims that Freud and Jung commit this fallacy. [[Freud]] considered mystical realization to be a [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to [[infantile]] oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that [[Jung]] commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken. ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality''. Shambhala Publications, 2000, pp 211 f. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The introduction to Volume 1 of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber |work=Ken Wilber Online |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319023750/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm/ |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilber on science===
Wilber describes the current state of the "hard" sciences as limited to "narrow science", which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the [[wikt:sensorimotor|sensorimotor]] (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:&lt;ref name="RothbergKelly1998-p12"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Rothberg|author2=Sean M. Kelly|author3=Sean Kelly|title=Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1GUlPmlPD0C&amp;pg=PA12|date=1 February 1998|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0766-7|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2005-p2-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lew Howard|title=Introducing Ken Wilber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svCgg2VVR5oC&amp;pg=PA2|date=17 May 2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4634-8193-3|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* specifying an experiment,
* performing the experiment and observing the results, and
* checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.
He has presented these as "three strands of valid knowledge" in Part III of his book ''[[The Marriage of Sense and Soul]]''.&lt;ref name="Wilber2011-p187"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber|title=The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQGmVyPN6rUC&amp;pg=PT187|date=3 August 2011|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79956-2|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Wilber calls "broad science" would include evidence from [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and from the [[symbol]]ic, [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], and other realms of [[consciousness]]. Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of [[meditation|meditators]] and [[spiritual practice|spiritual practitioners]]. Wilber's own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using [[electroencephalogram]] machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls "integral science".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

According to Wilber's theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of [[reality]] than any of the particular [[exoteric]] religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Wilber has referred to [[Stuart Kauffman]], [[Ilya Prigogine]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and others in order to articulate his [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] and [[Teleology|teleological]] understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "I am not alone in seeing that chance and natural selection by themselves are not enough to account for the emergence that we see in evolution. Stuart Kaufman{{sic}} and many others have criticized mere change and natural selection as not adequate to account for this emergence (he sees the necessity of adding self-organization). Of course I understand that natural selection is not acting on mere randomness or chance—because natural selection saves previous selections, and this reduces dramatically the probability that higher, adequate forms will emerge. But even that is not enough, in my opinion, to account for the remarkable emergence of some of the extraordinarily complex forms that nature has produced. After all, from the big bang and dirt to the poems of William Shakespeare is quite a distance, and many philosophers of science agree that mere chance and selection are just not adequate to account for these remarkable emergences. The universe is slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes, and these processes—as Prigogine was the first to elaborate—escape present-level turmoil by jumping to higher levels of self-organization, and I see that "pressure" as operating throughout the physiosphere, the biosphere, and the noosphere. And that is what I metaphorically mean when I use the example of a wing (or elsewhere, the example of an eyeball) to indicate the remarkableness of increasing emergence. But I don't mean that as a specific model or actual example of how biological emergence works! Natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again that just isn't enough to account for creative emergence (or what Whitehead called "the creative advance into novelty," which, according to Whitehead, is the fundamental nature of this manifest universe)."&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''[http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 Re: Some Criticisms of My Understanding of Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907151307/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 |date=2011-09-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Current work===
In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the [[Integral Institute]], Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Integral Spirituality? |work=Integral Spiritual Center |url=http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%20Spirituality.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125133004/http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%2BSpirituality.pdf |archivedate=November 25, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (1.3 MB [[portable document format|PDF]] file)&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is entitled "What is Integral Spirituality?", and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published "Integral Spirituality", in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and  the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

"Integral post-metaphysics" is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world's [[spirituality|spiritual]]-[[religion|religious]] traditions in a way that accounts for the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[post-modern]] criticisms of those traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of [[consciousness]] developed by Wilber and [[Allan Combs]]. It is a grid with sequential [[states of consciousness]] on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or [[Overlapping hierarchy|levels]], of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top). This lattice illustrates how each structure of consciousness interprets experiences of different states of consciousness, including mystical states, in different ways.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Since then, Wilber has drawn back from public life, due to a severe illness.

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting [[Marc Gafni]]. Gafni was accused in the media of sexually assaulting a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|title='I Was 13 When Marc Gafni's Abuse Began'|author=|date=|website=forward.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204000533/https://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|archivedate=4 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilber has in fact publicly supported Gafni on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206165122/https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |archivedate=2016-02-06 |df= }}?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|title=+kenwilber.com - blog|author=|date=|website=www.kenwilber.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028230143/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition begun by a group of Rabbis has called for Wilber to publicly dissociate from Gafni.

==Influences on Wilber==
Wilber's philosophy has been influenced by [[Madhyamaka]] [[Buddhism]], particularly as articulated in the philosophy of [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Kosmos According to Ken Wilber: A Dialogue with Robin Kornman | date=September 1996 | work=Shambhala Sun | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | accessdate=2006-06-14 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813160309/http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | archivedate=2006-08-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including [[Dainin Katagiri]], [[Taizan Maezumi]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]] [[Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Penor Rinpoche]] and [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]]. [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Ramana Maharshi]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]] can be mentioned as further influences.  Wilber has on several occasions singled out [[Adi Da]]'s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |title=The Case of Adi Da |accessdate= |work=Ken Wilber Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213072728/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |archive-date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adidawilber.com/ |title=Adi Da and The Case of Ken Wilber |accessdate= |quote=I mention Master Da (along with Christ, Krishna) as being the Divine Person as World Event. - Ken Wilber, Up From Eden, 1981 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124109/http://www.adidawilber.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'', Wilber refers extensively to [[Plotinus]]' philosophy, which he sees as nondual. While Wilber has practised [[Buddhist]] meditation methods, he does not identify himself as a Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;# ''Kosmic Consciousness'' (12 hour audio interview on ten CDs), 2003, {{ISBN|1-59179-124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing movement that considers Wilber as following a long tradition of western psychologists that have liberally appropriated and repackaged Eastern, especially Hindu, thought.

According to Frank Visser, Wilber's conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to [[E. F. Schumacher]]'s conception of four fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 194&lt;/ref&gt; Visser finds Wilber's conception of levels, as well as Wilber's critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in [[Huston Smith]]'s ''Forgotten Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 78&lt;/ref&gt; Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber's theory are based on the philosophy of [[Sri Aurobindo]] as well as other theorists including [[Adi Da]].&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Wilber has been categorized as [[New Age]] due to his emphasis on a [[transpersonal]] view&lt;ref&gt;[[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, pp.70 (''"Ken Wilber ... defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'"'').&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, as a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education'', Dordrecht: Springer 2006, p.93. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4803-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' has called him "the Hegel of Eastern spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053719/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59030-151-7 |date=2014-04-30 }} "The Simple Feeling of Being: Visionary, Spiritual and Poetic Writings"],  publishersweekly.com, June 4, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber is credited with broadening the appeal of a "perennial philosophy" to a much wider audience. Cultural figures as varied as [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/227746/page/2 Planetary Problem Solver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212230857/http://www.newsweek.com/id/227746/page/2 |date=2010-02-12 }}, [[Newsweek]], January 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Gore]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Richard Rohr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cac.org/the-perennial-tradition-2015-12-20/|title=The Perennial Tradition - Center for Action and Contemplation|date=2015-12-20|work=Center for Action and Contemplation|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and musician [[Billy Corgan]] have mentioned his influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/04/28/ken_wilber/|title=You are the river: An interview with Ken Wilber|author=Steve Paulson|work=salon.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703072657/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/04/28/ken_wilber/|archivedate=2009-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wilber's approach has been criticized as excessively categorizing and [[objectification|objectifying]], [[masculine|masculinist]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Coming into Being: Artifacts and Texts in the Evolution of Consciousness'' pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelfer, J.

[[Steve McIntosh]] praises Wilber's work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish "philosophy" from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', Paragon House, St Paul Minnesota, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55778-867-2}} pp.227f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bache]] is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber's work, but calls Wilber's writing style glib.&lt;ref&gt;Notes to Chapter 6 of ''Dark Night Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind'' SUNY Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Stanislav Grof]] has praised Wilber's knowledge and work in the highest terms;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Ken has produced an extraordinary work of highly creative synthesis of data drawn from a vast variety of areas and disciplines ... His knowledge of the literature is truly encyclopedic, his analytical mind systematic and incisive, and the clarity of his logic remarkable. The impressive scope, comprehensive nature, and intellectual rigor of Ken's work have helped to make it a widely acclaimed and highly influential theory of transpersonal psychology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanislav Grof, [http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm "Ken Wilber's Spectrum Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209054241/http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm |date=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Grof has criticized the omission of the [[Pre- and perinatal psychology|pre- and peri-natal domains]] from Wilber's spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber's neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Grof, ''Beyond the Brain'', 131–137&lt;/ref&gt; Grof has described Wilber's writings as having an "often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded ''[[ad personam]]'' attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf Grof, "A Brief History of Transpersonal Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716130649/http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber's response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecology, a '''light gap''' is a break in [[Canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] or similar barrier that allows young [[plant]]s to grow where they would be otherwise inhibited by the lack of light reaching the seedbed. Light gaps form predominantly when a tree falls, and thus produces an opening in the forest canopy. Light gaps are important for maintaining diversity in species-rich ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubbell|first=S. P.|last2=Foster|first2=R. B.|last3=O'Brien|first3=S. T.|last4=Harms|first4=K. E.|last5=Condit|first5=R.|last6=Wechsler|first6=B.|last7=Wright|first7=S. J.|last8=Lao|first8=S.

==Occurrence==
There are many ways in which light gaps can form. A major occurrence is through previously mentioned [[treefall gap]]s. The death of a full-grown tree initiates a treefall gap, where light is exposed to the soil and creates resources for seeds and younger trees. Treefall gaps have been proven to maintain tree diversity by increasing stem density, which in turn can lead to species richness {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Juvenile stems, or [[saplings]], do an exceptional job at increasing stem density which increases [[species diversity]] as a result. Species compete for resources in order to regenerate. Succession can begin when treefall occurs because the newly lit area provides an area for a new population to grow. Trees that will grow in a treefall gap are not necessarily the most suited for that particular environment, but rather, grow by chance.&lt;ref name="Brokaw"/&gt; Therefore, different organisms may experience a greater attraction to certain environments over others, which can also have an effect on the extent to which an area flourishes.

An interesting example of gap formation comes from Japanese Black Bears&lt;ref name="Takahashi"/&gt; and their effects on the forest canopy. When Japanese Black Bears are looking for fruit, they break off branches when climbing trees and as a result, small light gaps form in the canopies. Therefore, their search for food is improving the light conditions of [[understory]] plants, which in return benefits the bears, as this helps fruit they eat to grow more abundantly.

==Selected areas==
On a report done in a Neotropical forest, the process of gap-phase regeneration is studied.&lt;ref name="Hubbell"/&gt; Through conducted experiments, conclusions are confirmed about the gap-phase regeneration process. A tree fall forms a light gap, which stimulated growth, resulting in an increase in the stem density on the forest floor. Thus, in turn, allows multiple trees to grow back and ecosystems to prosper. Studies of [[gap dynamics]] have provided evidence for understanding many small disturbances in an ecosystem.
[[File:Conifer forest edit.jpg|thumb|Conifer forest]]

In a uniform and discontinuous conifer forest canopy, solar energy is projected at certain angles in the light gaps, which determine soil conditions and amount of snow accumulation.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt; Depending on the time of year, the variety of tree species and the size of the light gap will determine how much light hits the forest floor and what kind of temporal and spatial [[heterogeneity]] will form.

In the coastal areas of south-eastern Australia, large [[Macrocystis|brown kelp]], another kind of canopy, formed by ''[[Ecklonia radiata]]'', dominates the existing temperate reefs. [[Climate change]] in the area poses a direct effect on the underwater canopy cover, reducing its overall quality.&lt;ref name="Flukes"/&gt; Climate change is causing patches in the canopy layer and because of this loss of coverage, the understory becomes a prime place for [[benthic]] [[algae]] to grow. This affects other organisms, such a sponges and encrusting algae that are trying to grow on the reefs. This discovery has shown that although light gaps oftentimes produce positive outcomes, they can also negatively effect some members of the biotic community. 
[[File:Kelp at Middle Bank P2277214.JPG|thumb|Ecklonia radiata at Middle Bank, Tsistikamma National Park]]

In the [[Amazon rainforest]], light gaps are extensively studied. However, ways in which the [[understory]] is affected by light gaps there, remains mostly a mystery. Overall [[biomass]] in the light gap areas is directly impacted by the size of the light opening, the type of roots that pre-existed its formation, and the type of tree that fell to create the light gap.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; The quality of biomass determines the level of regrowth in the environment.

All types of canopy structures rely on the quality that [[seed]]s experience when developing. Seeds can grow better when they are protected, however, they also flourish to a greater extent when they are not in a shaded environment. In fact, some seeds are so sensitive that even a slight change in light can prevent it from surviving.&lt;ref name="Sork"/&gt;

==Light gap herbivores==
[[File:Chauves-souris-Jardin botanique de Kandy (1).jpg|thumb|Fruit Bats hanging in the trees of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Sri Lanka (1)]]
'''Light gap herbivores''' are animals that contribute to the creation of light gaps by feeding on the older plants. Some herbivorous animals include algae and bacteria. Insect [[herbivore]]s target the shade-tolerant tree species. They cause a substantial amount of damage to the leaves of plants. There is more herbivory in tropical forests than in temperate forests.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

==Effects on organisms and their ecosystems==
[[File:Faun of a mountain rainforest in Central Sulawesi (4715888885).jpg|thumb|Faun of a mountain rainforest in Central Sulawesi]]
Many organisms are directly affected by the formation of light gaps. In a tropical forest, butterflies, which are great [[biodiversity]] indicators, exemplify this notion.&lt;ref name="Pryke"/&gt; Out of twenty various species, each has ecological and behavioral requirements that can be found in both opened and closed canopy gaps. Males will claim certain gaps as their territory to protect the patch from other males, in hopes to attract their female counterpart. Twelve species of butterflies had a positive [[Phototaxis|phototactic response]], while four species had a negative response and the remaining four did not express any sort of preference. Overall, butterfly species in a [[tropical rainforest]] were, on average, occupying open canopy gaps more frequently. Butterfly assemblage is determined by the amount of light and temperature that penetrates the canopy.

Newly created light gaps are avoided in a lot of situations by species that would normally replenish them through [[seed dispersal]]. However, the aid of the wind for seed dispersal in the light gap has a positive effect on plants, taking them further from the parent plant and decreasing predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schupp|first=Eugene W.|date=1988-01-01|title=Seed and Early Seedling Predation in the Forest Understory and in Treefall Gaps|journal=Oikos|volume=51|issue=1|pages=71–78|doi=10.2307/3565808|jstor=3565808}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frugivores]] such as birds and bats find recently created gaps dangerous because they pose a hazard on their overall well-being. Birds find no place to perch, and bats are more susceptible to predators when they fly in this area. Large monkeys, toucans, and guans perch in the tops of the canopy, and therefore release their seeds under the canopy and as a result, the seeds do not get dispersed where most needed. Wind initiates seed movement into the canopy gap.&lt;ref name="Schupp"/&gt; As the gap matures, it begins to grow trees that bear fruit, and growth of shrubs draw in more animals as they provide better protection from the open canopy above.

Overall, there are many advantages and disadvantages of a light gap disturbance. Some species benefit, and others are threatened. Through more research and investigation, scientists hope to uncover all aspects of the occurrence. It is only then that laws may be implemented to reduce harmful outcomes and increase further ecological sustainability.

The effect was first observed by a German physicist  Warburg (1881)&lt;ref name="WARBURG, E. G p. 141-164"&gt;WARBURG, E. G. Magnetische Untersuchungen über einige Wirkungen der Coerzitivkraft. Annalen der Physik (Leipzig), v. 13, p. 141-164, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently by French physicist [[Pierre Weiss|P. Weiss]] and Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard|A.

Debye]] (1926) and [[William Giauque|W. Giauque]] (1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zemansky | first = Mark W. | title = Temperatures very low and very high | publisher = Dover | date = 1981 | location = New York | page = 50 | isbn = 978-0-486-24072-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first working magnetic refrigerators were constructed by several groups beginning in 1933.  Magnetic refrigeration was the first method developed for cooling below about 0.3K (a temperature attainable by [[Helium-3|{{chem|3|He}}]] refrigeration, that is pumping on the {{chem|3|He}} vapors).

== The magnetocaloric effect ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE, from ''[[magnet]]'' and ''[[calorie]]'') is a magneto-[[thermodynamic]] phenomenon in which a temperature change of a suitable material is caused by exposing the material to a changing magnetic field. This is also known by low temperature physicists as ''[[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] demagnetization''. In that part of the refrigeration process, a decrease in the strength of an externally applied magnetic field allows the magnetic domains of a magnetocaloric material to become disoriented from the magnetic field by the agitating action of the thermal energy ([[phonon]]s) present in the material.  If the material is isolated so that no energy is allowed to (re)migrate into the material during this time, (i.e., an adiabatic process) the temperature drops as the domains absorb the thermal energy to perform their reorientation.  The randomization of the domains occurs in a similar fashion to the randomization at the [[curie temperature]] of a [[ferromagnetic]] material, except that [[magnetic dipole]]s overcome a decreasing external magnetic field while energy remains constant, instead of magnetic domains being disrupted from internal [[ferromagnetism]] as energy is added.

One of the most notable examples of the magnetocaloric effect is in the chemical element [[gadolinium]] and some of its [[alloys]]. Gadolinium's temperature increases when it enters certain magnetic fields. When it leaves the magnetic field, the temperature drops. The effect is considerably stronger for the gadolinium [[alloy]] ({{chem|Gd|5|Si|2|Ge|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Gschneidner, Jr. |author2=Kerry Gibson |last-author-amp=yes |title=Magnetic Refrigerator Successfully Tested |website=Ames Laboratory News Release |publisher=Ames Laboratory |date=December 7, 2001 |url=http://www.external.ameslab.gov/news/release/01magneticrefrig.htm |accessdate=2006-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323011159/http://www.external.ameslab.gov/news/release/01magneticrefrig.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praseodymium]] alloyed with [[nickel]] ({{chem|Pr|Ni|5}}) has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach to within one milliKelvin, one thousandth of a degree of [[absolute zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Emsley | first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |date= 2001 | page = 342 | isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equation ===

The magnetocaloric effect can be quantified with the equation below:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{ad}=-\int_{H_0}^{H_1}\Bigg(\frac {T}{C(T,H)}\Bigg)_H{\Bigg(\frac {\partial M(T,H)}{\partial T}\Bigg)}_H dH&lt;/math&gt;

where T is the temperature, H is the applied magnetic field, C is the heat capacity of the working magnet (refrigerant) and M is the magnetization of the refrigerant.

From the equation we can see that magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced by:

* applying a large field
* using a magnet with a small heat capacity
* using a magnet with a large change in magnetization vs. temperature, at a constant magnetic field

=== Thermodynamic cycle ===

[[Image:MCE.gif|right|thumb|400px|Analogy between magnetic refrigeration and vapor cycle or conventional refrigeration. ''H'' = externally applied magnetic field; ''Q'' = heat quantity; ''P'' = pressure; Δ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; = adiabatic temperature variation]]

The cycle is performed as a [[refrigeration cycle]] that is analogous to the [[Carnot cycle|Carnot refrigeration cycle]], but with increases and decreases in magnetic field strength instead of increases and decreases in pressure.  It can be described at a starting point whereby the chosen working substance is introduced into a [[magnetic field]], i.e., the magnetic flux density is increased.  The working material is the refrigerant, and starts in thermal equilibrium with the refrigerated environment.

*''Adiabatic magnetization:'' A magnetocaloric substance is placed in an insulated environment.  The increasing external magnetic field (+''H'') causes the magnetic dipoles of the atoms to align, thereby decreasing the material's magnetic [[entropy]] and [[heat capacity]]. Since overall energy is not lost (yet) and therefore total entropy is not reduced (according to thermodynamic laws), the net result is that the substance is heated (''T'' + Δ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;).
*''Isomagnetic enthalpic transfer:'' This added heat can then be removed (-''Q'') by a fluid or gas—gaseous or liquid [[helium]], for example.  The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the dipoles from reabsorbing the heat.  Once sufficiently cooled, the magnetocaloric substance and the coolant are separated.
* ''Adiabatic demagnetization:''  The substance is returned to another adiabatic (insulated) condition so the total entropy remains constant.  However, this time the magnetic field is decreased (''H'' = 0), the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments to overcome the field, and thus the sample cools, i.e., an adiabatic temperature change.  Energy (and entropy) transfers from thermal entropy to magnetic entropy, measuring the disorder of the magnetic dipoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Statistical Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=João Paulo |last1=Casquilho |first2=Paulo Ivo Cortez |last2=Teixeira |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-05378-6 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp-TBQAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp-TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 Extract of page 99]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Isomagnetic entropic transfer:''  The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the material from reheating. The material is placed in thermal contact with the environment to be refrigerated. Because the working material is cooler than the refrigerated environment (by design), heat energy migrates into the working material (+''Q'').

Once the refrigerant and refrigerated environment are in thermal equilibrium, the cycle can restart.

=== Applied technique ===

The basic operating principle of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) is the use of a strong magnetic field to control the entropy of a sample of material, often called the "refrigerant". Magnetic field constrains the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the refrigerant. The stronger the magnetic field, the more aligned the dipoles are,  corresponding to lower entropy and [[specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] because the material has (effectively) lost some of its internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. If the refrigerant is kept at a constant temperature through thermal contact with a [[heat]] sink (usually [[liquid helium]]) while the magnetic field is switched on, the refrigerant must lose some energy because it is [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrated]] with the heat sink. When the magnetic field is subsequently switched off, the heat capacity of the refrigerant rises again because the degrees of freedom associated with orientation of the dipoles are once again liberated, pulling their share of [[equipartition of energy|equipartitioned]] energy from the [[kinetic energy|motion]] of the [[molecule]]s, thereby lowering the overall temperature of a [[system]] with decreased energy. Since the system is now [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] when the magnetic field is switched off, the process is adiabatic, i.e., the system can no longer exchange energy with its surroundings (the heat sink), and its temperature decreases below its initial value, that of the heat sink.

The operation of a standard ADR proceeds roughly as follows.  First, a strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. The heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off, increasing the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink. In practice, the magnetic field is decreased slowly in order to provide continuous cooling and keep the sample at an approximately constant low temperature. Once the field falls to zero or to some low limiting value determined by the properties of the refrigerant, the cooling power of the ADR vanishes, and heat leaks will cause the refrigerant to warm up.

== Working materials ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is an intrinsic property of a magnetic solid. This thermal response of a solid to the application or removal of magnetic fields is maximized when the solid is near its magnetic ordering temperature. Thus, the materials considered for magnetic refrigeration devices should be magnetic materials with a magnetic phase transition temperature near the temperature region of interest.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/aenm.201200167| title = Materials Challenges for High Performance Magnetocaloric Refrigeration Devices| journal = Advanced Energy Materials| volume = 2| issue = 11| pages = 1288| year = 2012| last1 = Smith | first1 = A. | last2 = Bahl | first2 = C.

K. | last6 = Pryds | first6 = N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For refrigerators that could be used in the home, this temperature is room temperature. The temperature change can be further increased when the order-parameter of the phase transition changes strongly within the temperature range of interest.&lt;ref name="doi10.1088/0022-327/38/23/R01"/&gt;

The magnitudes of the magnetic entropy and the adiabatic temperature changes are strongly dependent upon the magnetic ordering process. The magnitude is generally small in [[antiferromagnet]]s, [[ferrimagnet]]s and [[spin glass]] systems but can be much larger for ferromagnets that undergo a magnetic phase transition. First order phase transitions are characterized by a discontinuity in the magnetization changes with temperature, resulting in a latent heat.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"/&gt; Second order phase transitions do not have this latent heat associated with the phase transition.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"/&gt;

In the late 1990s Pecharksy and Gschneidner reported a magnetic entropy change in {{chem|Gd|5|(Si|2|Ge|2|)}} that was about 50% larger than that reported for Gd metal, which had the largest known magnetic entropy change at the time.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.4494| title = Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in Gd_{5}(Si_{2}Ge_{2})| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 78| issue = 23| pages = 4494| year = 1997| last1 = Pecharsky | first1 = V.

Current research has been used to describe alloys with a significant magnetocaloric effect in terms of a thermodynamic system. Literature says that Gd5(Si2Ge2) for example may be described as a thermodynamic system provided it satisfies the condition of being “a quantity of matter or region in space chosen for study”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cengel, Yunus A. |author2= Michael A.

{{chem|Ni|2|Mn-X}} (X = Ga, Co, In, Al, Sb) Heusler alloys are also promising candidates for magnetic cooling applications because they have Curie temperatures near room temperature and, depending on composition, can have martensitic phase transformations near room temperature.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; These materials exhibit the [[magnetic shape memory]] effect and can also be used as actuators, energy harvesting devices, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adma.201002753| pmid = 20957766| title = Size Effects on Magnetic Actuation in Ni-Mn-Ga Shape-Memory Alloys| journal = Advanced Materials| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 216–32| year = 2011| last1 = Dunand | first1 = D.

The development of this technology is very material-dependent and will likely not replace vapor-compression refrigeration without significantly improved materials that are cheap, abundant, and exhibit much larger magnetocaloric effects over a larger range of temperatures. Such materials need to show significant temperature changes under a field of two tesla or less, so that permanent magnets can be used for the production of the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/68/6/R04| title = Recent developments in magnetocaloric materials| journal = Reports on Progress in Physics| volume = 68| issue = 6| pages = 1479| year = 2005| last1 = Gschneidnerjr | first1 = K.

=== Paramagnetic salts ===

The original proposed refrigerant was a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]].  The active magnetic dipoles in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.

In a paramagnetic salt ADR, the heat sink is usually provided by a pumped {{chem|4|He}} (about 1.2&amp;nbsp;K) or {{chem|3|He}} (about 0.3&amp;nbsp;K) [[cryostat]].  An easily attainable 1&amp;nbsp;T magnetic field is generally required for initial magnetization. The minimum temperature attainable is determined by the self-magnetization tendencies of the refrigerant salt, but temperatures from 1 to 100 mK are accessible.  [[Dilution refrigerator]]s had for many years supplanted paramagnetic salt ADRs, but interest in space-based and simple to use lab-ADRs has remained, due to the complexity and unreliability of the dilution refrigerator

Eventually paramagnetic salts become either [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] or ferromagnetic, limiting the lowest temperature that can be reached using this method.

=== Nuclear demagnetization ===

One variant of adiabatic demagnetization that continues to find substantial research application is nuclear demagnetization refrigeration (NDR).  NDR follows the same principles, but in this case the cooling power arises from the [[spin (physics)#Spin and magnetic moment|magnetic dipoles of the nuclei]] of the refrigerant atoms, rather than their electron configurations.  Since these dipoles are of much smaller magnitude, they are less prone to self-alignment and have lower intrinsic minimum fields.  This allows NDR to cool the nuclear spin system to very low temperatures, often 1 µK or below. Unfortunately, the small magnitudes of nuclear magnetic dipoles also makes them less inclined to align to external fields.  Magnetic fields of 3 teslas or greater are often needed for the initial magnetization step of NDR.

In NDR systems, the initial heat sink must sit at very low temperatures (10–100 mK).  This precooling is often provided by the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator or a paramagnetic salt.

== Commercial development ==

Research and a demonstration proof of concept device in 2001 succeeded in applying commercial-grade materials and permanent magnets at room temperatures to construct a magnetocaloric refrigerator&lt;ref name="Ames Lab-2001"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ameslab.gov/news/ins01-11Magnetic.htm | last = Gibson | first = Kerry | work = INSIDER Newsletter for employees of Ames Laboratory | title = Magnetic Refrigerator Successfully Tested: Ames Laboratory developments help push boundaries of new refrigeration technology | date = November 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527140630/http://www.ameslab.gov/news/ins01-11Magnetic.htm | archivedate = 2010-05-27 | df =  }}(Vol. 112, No.10 )&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2007, the [[Risø National Laboratory]] (Denmark) at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], claimed to have reached a milestone in their magnetic cooling research when they reported a temperature span of 8.7 K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risoe.dk/News_archives/News/2007/0820_magnetisk_koeling.aspx Milestone in magnetic cooling, Risø News, August 20, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905023927/http://www.risoe.dk/News_archives/News/2007/0820_magnetisk_koeling.aspx |date=September 5, 2007 }}. Retrieved August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They hoped to introduce the first commercial applications of the technology by 2010.

As of 2013 this technology had proven commercially viable only for ultra-low temperature [[cryogenic]] applications available for decades. Magnetocaloric refrigeration systems are composed of pumps, motors, secondary fluids, heat exchangers of different types, magnets and magnetic materials. These processes are greatly affected by irreversibilities and should be adequately considered.
At year-end, Cooltech Applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooltech-applications.com |title=Cooltech Applications |publisher=Cooltech Applications |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that its first commercial refrigeration equipment would enter the market in 2014. Cooltech Applications launched their first commercially available magnetic refrigeration system on 20 June 2016.
At the 2015 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, a consortium of [[Haier]], [[Astronautics Corporation of America]] and [[BASF]] presented the first cooling appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiere of cutting-edge magnetocaloric cooling appliance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnl9m0rSE7U|publisher=BASF|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASF claim of their technology a 35% improvement over using compressors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basf-new-business.com/en/projects/e-power-management/solid-state-cooling/|title=BASF New Business GmbH|author=|date=|website=basf-new-business.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current and future uses ===

Thermal and magnetic [[hysteresis]] problems remain to be solved for first-order phase transition materials that exhibit the GMCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One potential application is in [[spacecraft]].

[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]] units typically achieve performance coefficients of 60% of that of a theoretical ideal Carnot cycle, much higher than current MR technology. Small domestic refrigerators are however much less efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/40784-UgOxYh/webviewable/40784.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 giant anisotropic behaviour of the magnetocaloric effect was found in {{chem|HoMn|2|O|5}} at 10 K. The anisotropy of the
magnetic entropy change gives rise to a large rotating MCE offering the possibility to build simplified, compact, and efficient magnetic cooling systems by rotating it in a constant magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balli|first=M. |last2=Jandl |first2=S. |last3=Fournier   |first3=P.  |last4=Gospodinov |first4=M.

In 2015 Aprea ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Aprea, C., Greco, A., Maiorino, A. GeoThermag: A geothermal magnetic refrigerator (2015) International Journal of Refrigeration, 59, pp. 75-83.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a new refrigeration concept, GeoThermag, which is a combination of magnetic refrigeration technology with that of low-temperature geothermal energy. To demonstrate the applicability of the GeoThermag technology, they developed a pilot system that consists of a 100-m deep geothermal probe; inside the probe, water flows and is used directly as a regenerating fluid for a magnetic refrigerator operating with gadolinium. The GeoThermag system showed the ability to produce cold water even at 281.8 K in the presence of a heat load of 60 W. In addition, the system has shown the existence of an optimal frequency f AMR, 0.26&amp;nbsp;Hz, for which it was possible to produce cold water at 287.9 K with a thermal load equal to 190 W with a COP of 2.20. Observing the temperature of the cold water that was obtained in the tests, the GeoThermag system showed a good ability to feed the cooling radiant floors and a reduced capacity for feeding the fan coil systems.

== History ==

The effect was discovered first observed by a German physicist  Warburg (1881)&lt;ref name="WARBURG, E. G p. 141-164"/&gt; Subsequently by French physicist [[Pierre Weiss|P. Weiss]] and Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard|A. Piccard]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="Weiss 103–109"/&gt;

Major advances first appeared in the late 1920s when cooling via adiabatic demagnetization was independently proposed by chemistry [[Nobel Laureates]] [[Peter Debye]] in 1926 and  [[William F. Giauque]]  in 1927.

It was first demonstrated experimentally by Giauque and his colleague D. P. MacDougall in 1933 for cryogenic purposes when they reached 0.25&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giauque |first=W. F. |last2=MacDougall |first2=D.

In 1997, the first near room-temperature [[proof of concept]] magnetic refrigerator was demonstrated by Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. by the [[Iowa State University]] at [[Ames Laboratory]]. This event attracted interest from scientists and companies worldwide who started developing new kinds of room temperature materials and magnetic refrigerator designs.&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;

A major breakthrough came 2002 when a group at the University of Amsterdam demonstrated the giant magnetocaloric effect in MnFe(P,As) alloys that are based on abundant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tegus |first=O. |last2=Brück |first2=E. |last3=de Boer |first3=F.

Refrigerators based on the magnetocaloric effect have been demonstrated in laboratories, using magnetic fields starting at 0.6&amp;nbsp;T up to 10&amp;nbsp;T. Magnetic fields above 2&amp;nbsp;T are difficult to produce with permanent magnets and are produced by a [[superconducting magnet]] (1&amp;nbsp;T is about 20,000 times the [[Earth's magnetic field]]).

In one example, Prof. Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. unveiled a [[proof of concept]] magnetic refrigerator near room temperature on February 20, 1997. He also announced the discovery of the GMCE in {{chem|Gd|5|Si|2|Ge|2}} on June 9, 1997.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Since then, hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have been written describing materials exhibiting magnetocaloric effects.

[[Image:VFPt Earths Magnetic Field Confusion.svg|300px|thumbnail|right|'''A sketch of Earth's magnetic field''' representing the source of Earth's magnetic field as a magnet The [[north pole]] of Earth is near the top of the diagram, the south pole near the bottom. Notice that the south pole of that magnet is deep in Earth's interior below Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]].  Earth's magnetic field is produced in the outer liquid part of its core due to a [[dynamo]] that produce electrical currents there.]]

The [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] interacting with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] generally follow its [[magnetic field lines]].  These represent the force that a north magnetic pole would experience at any given point.  (Denser lines indicate a stronger force.)  Plasmas exhibit more complex second-order behaviors, studied as part of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|300px|thumb|right|A simulation of a charged particle being deflected from the Earth by the magnetosphere.]]

Thus in the "closed" model of the magnetosphere, the [[magnetopause]] boundary between the magnetosphere and the [[solar wind]] is outlined by field lines. Not much plasma can cross such a stiff boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piddington|first=J. H.|year=1979|title=The Closed Model of the Earth's Magnetosphere|url=|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=84|pages=8|via=|doi=10.1029/ja084ia01p00093|bibcode=1979JGR....84...93P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only "weak points" are the two polar cusps, the points where field lines closing at noon (-z axis GSM) get separated from those closing at midnight (+z axis GSM); at such points the field intensity on the boundary is zero, posing no barrier to the entry of plasma. (This simple definition assumes a noon-midnight plane of symmetry, but closed fields lacking such symmetry also must have cusps, by the [[fixed point theorem]].)

The amount of solar wind energy and plasma entering the actual magnetosphere depends on how far it departs from such a "closed" configuration, i.e. the extent to which [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]] field lines manage to cross the boundary. As discussed further below, that extent depends very much on the direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, in particular on its southward or northward slant.

[[Image:Currents.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere]]
Trapping of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], e.g. of the [[ring current]], also follows the structure of field lines. A particle interacting with this B field experiences a [[Lorentz Force]] which is responsible for many of the particle motion in the magnetosphere.  Furthermore, [[Birkeland currents]] and heat flow are also channeled by such lines — easy along them, blocked in perpendicular directions.  Indeed, field lines in the magnetosphere have been likened to the grain in a log of wood{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, which defines an "easy" direction along which it easily gives way.

==  Motion of charged particles ==

[[Image:Earth ElectronParticle thru magnetosphere small.JPG|thumb|right|A simulated charged particle, its trajectory determined primarily by the Earth's magnetosphere.]]

The simplest magnetic field '''B''' is a constant one– straight parallel field lines and constant field intensity. In such a field, if an ion or electron enters perpendicular to the field lines, it can be shown to move in a circle (the field only needs to be constant in the region covering the circle). If q is the charge of the particle, m its mass, v its velocity and R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;  the radius of the circle ([[gyroradius|"gyration radius"]]), all one needs do is notice that the centripetal force mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;   must equal the magnetic force qvB. One gets
&lt;CENTER&gt;
R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;  = mv/(qB)
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
If the initial velocity of the particle has a different direction, one only needs resolve it into a component '''v'''&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;perpendicular to B and a component '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parallel to B, and replace v in the above formula with v&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;.

If W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;=m v&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/2 is the energy associated with the perpendicular motion in electron-volts (all calculations here are non-relativistic), in a field of B nT (nanotesla), then R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; in kilometers is

&lt;CENTER&gt;
For protons &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; =  (144/B) {{radic|W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;}}

For electrons &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; =  (3.37/B) {{radic|W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;}}
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
			
The velocity parallel to the field '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is not affected by the field, because no magnetic force exists in that direction. That velocity just stays constant (as long as the field does), and adding the two motions together gives a spiral around a central guiding field line. If the field curves or changes, the motion is modified, but the general character of spiraling around a central field line persists: hence the name "[[guiding center|guiding center motion]]."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, it performs no work and requires no energy—nor does it provide any. Thus magnetic fields (like the Earth's) can profoundly affect particle motion in them, but need no energy input to maintain their effect.  Particles may also get steered around, but their total energy remains the same.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==  Magnetic Mirroring and Magnetic Drift ==

The spacing between field lines is an indicator of the relative strength of the magnetic field. Where magnetic field lines converge the field grows stronger, and where they diverge, weaker.

Now, it can be shown that in the motion of gyrating particles, the "magnetic moment" μ = W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;/B (or relativistically, p&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/2mγB) stays very nearly constant. The "very nearly" qualifier sets it apart from true constants of motion, such as energy, reducing it to merely an "adiabatic invariant." For most plasmas in the magnetosphere, the deviation from constancy is negligible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The conservation of μ is tremendously important (in laboratory plasmas as well as in space). Suppose the field line guiding a particle, the axis of its spiral path, belongs to a converging bundle of lines, so that the particle is led into an increasingly larger B. To keep μ constant, W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt; must also grow.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

However, as noted before, the total energy of a particle in a "purely magnetic" field remains constant. What therefore happens is that energy is converted, from the part associated with the parallel motion '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the perpendicular part.  As v&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decreases, the angle between v and B then increases, until it reaches 90°. At that point W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt; contains all the available energy, it can grow no more and no further advance into the stronger field can occur.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The result is known as [[magnetic mirror]]ing. The particle briefly gyrates perpendicular to its guiding field line, and then retreats back to the weaker field, the spiral unwinding again in the process.  It may be noted that such motion was first derived by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1895, for a charged particle in the field of a magnetic monopole, whose field lines are all straight and converge to a point. The conservation of μ was only pointed by [[Hannes Alfvén|Alfvén]] about 50 years later, and the connection to adiabatic invariant was only made afterwards.

Magnetic mirroring makes possible the "trapping" in the dipole-like field lines near Earth of particles in the radiation belt and in the ring current. On all such lines the field is much stronger at their ends near Earth, compared to its strength when it crosses the equatorial plane. Assuming such particles are somehow placed in the equatorial region of that field, most of them stay trapped, because every time their motion along the field line brings them into the strong field region, they "get mirrored" and bounce back and forth between hemispheres. Only particles whose motion is very close to parallel to the field line, with near-zero μ, avoid mirroring—and these are quickly absorbed by the atmosphere and lost. Their loss leaves a bundle of directions around the field line which is empty of particles—the "loss cone".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In addition to gyrating around their guiding field lines and bouncing back and forth between mirror points, trapped particles also drift slowly around Earth, switching guiding field lines but staying at approximately the same distance (another adiabatic invariant is involved, "the second invariant"). [[Guiding center|This motion]] was mentioned earlier in connection with the ring current.

One reason for the drift is that the intensity of '''B''' increases as Earth is approached. The gyration around the guiding field line is therefore not a perfect circle, but curves a little more tightly on the side closer to the Earth, where the larger B gives a smaller R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. This change in curvature makes ions advance sideways, while electrons, which gyrate in the opposite sense, advance sideways in the opposite direction.  The net result, as already noted, produces the ring current, though additional effects (like non-uniform distribution of plasma density) also affect the result.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Plasma fountain==
[[Image:plasma fountain.gif|thumb|200px|right|The Earth's "[[plasma fountain]]", showing oxygen, helium, and hydrogen ions which gush into space from regions near the Earth's poles. The faint yellow area shown above the north pole represents gas lost from Earth into space; the green area is the [[aurora borealis]]-or plasma energy pouring back into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Plasma fountain  [http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9812/solar1.html Source], press release: [http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9812/solarwind.html Solar Wind Squeezes Some of Earth's Atmosphere into Space]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
{{main|Plasma fountain}}

In the 1980s, a "plasma fountain" of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions was discovered flowing from the Earth's north pole.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Mating in fungi''' is a complex process governed by [[mating type]]s. Research on [[Fungus|fungal]] mating has focused on several model species with different behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Turgeon B.G. -1998- Application of mating type gene technology to problems in fungal biology. Annual Review of Phytopathology. 36:115–137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gladfelter, A. |author2=Berman, J. |year=2009|title=Dancing genomes: fungal nuclear positioning|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=7|issue=875–886|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2249|pmc=2794368|pages=875–886|pmid=19898490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all fungi reproduce sexually and many that do are [[isogamy|isogamous]]; thus, the terms "male" and "female" do not apply to many members of the fungal [[Kingdom (taxonomy)|kingdom]]. [[Homothallism|Homothallic]] species are able to mate with themselves, while in [[Heterothallism|heterothallic]] species only isolates of opposite mating types can mate.

Mating between isogamous fungi may consist only of a transfer of nuclei from one cell to another. Vegetative incompatibility within species often prevent a fungal isolate from mating with another isolate. Isolates of the same incompatibility group do not mate or mating does not lead to successful offspring. High variation has been reported including same chemotype mating, [[sporophyte]] to gametophyte mating and biparental transfer of mitochondria.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Mating in Zygomycota==
A [[zygomycete]] hypha grows towards a compatible mate and they both form a bridge, called a [[progametangia]], by joining at the hyphal tips via [[plasmogamy]]. A pair of [[septum|septa]] forms around the merged tips, enclosing nuclei from both isolates. A second pair of septa forms two adjacent cells, one on each side. These adjacent cells, called [[suspensor]]s provide structural support. The central cell is destined to become a spore. The nuclei join in a process called [[karyogamy]] to form a [[zygote]].

==Mating in Ascomycota==
As it approaches a mate, a [[haploid]] [[sac fungus]] develops one of two complementary organs, a "female" ascogonium or a "male" antheridium. These organs resemble gametangia except that they contain only nuclei. A bridge, the [[trichogyne (fungi)|trichogyne]] forms, that provides a passage for nuclei to travel from the antheridium to the ascogonium. A [[dikaryote]] grows from the ascogonium, and [[karyogamy]] occurs in the [[fruiting body]].

===''Neurospora crassa''===
[[File:Neurospora crassa life cycle.jpg|thumb|600px|''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' life cycle. The haploid mycelium reproduces asexually by two processes: (1) simple proliferation of existing mycelium, and (2) formation of conidia (macro- and micro-) which can be dispersed and then germinate to produce new mycelium.  In the sexual cycle, mating can only occur between individual strains of different mating type, A and a.  Fertilization occurs by the passage of nuclei of conidia or mycelium of one mating type into the protoperithecia of the opposite mating type through the trichogyne.  Fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types occurs within the protoperithecium to form a zygote (2N) nucleus.]]
''Neurospora crassa'' is a type of red bread mold of the phylum [[Ascomycota]]. ''N. crassa'' is used as a [[model organism]] because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle: this makes [[genetics|genetic]] analysis simple, since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis within a sac-like structure called an ''ascus'' (pl. ''asci'').  In its natural environment, ''N. crassa'' lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It often can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires.

''Neurospora'' was used by [[Edward Tatum]] and [[George Wells Beadle]] in the experiments for which they won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1958. The results of these experiments led directly to the "one gene, one enzyme" hypothesis that specific [[genes]] code for specific [[protein]]s. This concept launched [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Horowitz NH, Berg P, Singer M, et al. |title=A centennial: George W. Beadle, 1903–1989 |journal=Genetics |volume=166 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |date=January 2004 |pmid=15020400 |pmc=1470705 |doi= 10.1534/genetics.166.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two cells of different mating type come together (see Figure).  Like other Ascomycetes, ''N. crassa'' has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by ''A'' and ''a''.  There is no evident morphological difference between the ''A'' and ''a'' mating type strains.  Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure).  Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Westergaard M, Mitchell HK (1947) Neurospora. V. A synthetic medium favoring sexual reproduction. Amer J Bot 34, 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson MA, Metzenberg RL |title=Sexual development genes of Neurospora crassa |journal=Genetics |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1356883 |pmc=1205113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air.  The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell, usually a conidium, of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure).  Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium.  Since both ''A'' and ''a'' strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female.  However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the ''A'' and ''a'' strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.

The subsequent steps following fusion of ''A'' and ''a'' haploid cells have been outlined by Fincham and Day.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham J RS, Day PR (1963). Fungal Genetics. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK. ASIN: B000W851KO&lt;/ref&gt; and Wagner and Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner RP, Mitchell HK. (1964).  Genetics and Metabolism.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York ASIN: B00BXTC5BO&lt;/ref&gt;  After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed.  Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously.  The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. ''A/a'') migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium.  Each of these ascogenous hyphae bends to form a hook (or ''crozier'') at its tip and the ''A'' and ''a'' pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously.  Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells.  The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one ''A'' and one ''a'' nucleus (see Figure).  This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an “ascus-initial” cell.  Next the two [[uninucleate]] cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a [[binucleated cells|binucleate cell]] that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times.

After formation of the ascus-initial cell, the ''A'' and ''a'' nuclei fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure).  This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of ''N. crassa''.  The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each.  Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by [[meiosis]].  The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the ''A'' mating type and two of the ''a'' mating type.  One further mitotic division leads to four ''A'' and four ''a'' nucleus in each ascus.  Meiosis is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in ''N. crassa'' seems typical of meiosis generally.

As the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens.  The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure.

A mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air.  These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes to induce germination.  For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days.  In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.

===Benefit of mating type in ''N. crassa''===

That mating in ''N. crassa'' can only occur between strains of different mating type suggests that some degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection.  In haploid multicellular fungi, such as ''N. crassa'', meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage is one of their most complex processes.  The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation.  In ''N. crassa'', recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations.&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leslie JF, Raju NB |title=Recessive mutations from natural populations of Neurospora crassa that are expressed in the sexual diplophase |journal=Genetics |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=759–77 |date=December 1985 |pmid=2933298 |pmc=1202670 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores).  The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed pachytene or diplotene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raju NB, Leslie JF |title=Cytology of recessive sexual-phase mutants from wild strains of Neurospora crassa |journal=Genome |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=815–26 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1427061 |doi= 10.1139/g92-124|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435&lt;ref name=Leslie /&gt; (about 4% of the total number of 9,730 genes). Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see [[Complementation (genetics)]]).

===''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''===
[[Image:Yeast lifecycle.svg|thumb|right|250px|The yeast cell's life cycle: {{ordered list |Budding |Conjugation |Spore}}]]
''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', brewer's and baker's yeast, is in the phylum ''Ascomycota''.  During vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, ''S. cerevisiae'' reproduces by mitosis as either haploid or diploid cells. However, when starved, diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores.&lt;ref name="pmid3070323"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herskowitz I |title=Life cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiol.

The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same [[ascus]], the sac that contains the [[Tetrad (genetics)|tetrad]] of cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they may mate.

Ruderfer et al.&lt;ref name=Ruderfer /&gt; analyzed the ancestry of natural ''S. cerevisiae'' strains and concluded that outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, although ''S. cerevisiae'' is heterothallic, it appears that, in nature, mating is most often between closely related yeast cells.  The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of [[genetic diversity]]) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

===''Candida albicans''===
''[[Candida albicans]]'' is a diploid fungus that grows both as a yeast and as a filament.  ''C. albicans'' is the most common fungal pathogen in humans. It causes both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections.  ''C. albicans'' has maintained an elaborate, but largely hidden, mating apparatus.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson A |title=The biology of mating in Candida albicans |journal=Nat.

===Mating type===
A picture of the mating type mechanism has begun to emerge from studies of particular fungi such as ''S. cerevisiae''. The mating type genes are located in [[homeobox]] and encode [[enzyme]]s for production of [[pheromone]]s and pheromone [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. Sexual reproduction thereby depends on pheromones produced from variant [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]]. Since sexual reproduction takes place in haploid organisms, it cannot proceed until complementary genes are provided by a suitable partner through cell or hyphal fusion. The number of mating types depends on the number of genes and the number of alleles for each.

Depending of the species, sexual reproduction takes place through [[gamete]]s or hyphal fusion. When a receptor on one haploid detects a pheromone from a complementary mating type, it approaches the source through [[chemotropism|chemotropic]] growth or [[chemotaxis|chemotactic]] movement if it is a gamete.

==Mating in Basidiomycota==

Some of the species within [[Basidiomycota]] have the most complex systems of sexual reproduction known among [[Fungi]]. In general for Fungi there are two main types of sexual reproduction: [[homothallic|homothallism]], when mating occurs within a single individual, or in other words each individual is self-fertile; and [[heterothallic|heterothallism]], when [[hyphae]] from a single individual is self-sterile and needs to interact with another compatible individual for mating to take place. Additionally, mating compatibility in the Basidiomycota is further categorized into two types of mating systems: tetrapolar and bipolar.

===Tetrapolar and bipolar mating system===

Heterothallism is the most common mating system in Basidiomycota and in [[Agaricomycotina]] (the mushroom-forming Fungi) about 90% of the species are heterothallic.&lt;ref name="James 2007 317–331"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Timothy|title=Sex in Fungi: Molecular Determination and Evolutionary Implications|year=2007|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington DC|pages=317–331|editor=J. Heitman |editor2=J. W. Kronstad |editor3=J. W. Taylor |editor4=L. A. Casselton |chapter=Analysis of mating type locus organization and synteny in mushroom fungi: Beyond model species}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrapolar type of mating system is ruled by two unlinked mating loci termed ''A'' and ''B'' (in Agaricomycotina) or ''b'' and ''a'' (in [[Ustilaginomycotina]] and [[Pucciniomycotina]]), both of which can be multiallelic. The combination of ''A'' and ''B'' (or ''b'' and ''a'') alleles, termed mating type, determine the specificity or sexual identity of the individual harboring them. Only individuals with different specificities are compatible with each other and therefore able to start the mating event. A successful mating interaction begins with nuclear exchange and nuclear migration resulting in the formation of [[dikaryotic]] hyphae (containing separate haploid nuclei from both initial parents). Dikaryotic hyphae, under the appropriate environmental conditions will give rise to the fruiting body which contains the [[basidia]] – specialized cells in which sexual recombination via karyogamy and meiosis occurs. This dikaryotic condition in Basidiomycota is often maintained by a specialized hyphal structure called a [[clamp connection]]. The formation of clamp connections is regulated by both mating loci. 
Examples of tetrapolar organisms are the smuts ''[[Ustilago maydis]]'' and ''U. longissima'',&lt;ref name="Bakkeren 1996 1601–1613"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakkeren |first=G|author2=Kronstad, J.

For example, in the case of ''U. maydis'', which bears more than 25 ''b'' but only 2 ''a'' specificities, an individual has an approximately 50% chance to encounter a compatible mate in nature.&lt;ref name="Hsueh 2008 517–524"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Y.

In contrast, bipolar mating systems are ruled by a single allelic mating locus, termed either ''A'' or ''b''. In Agaricomycotina, bipolar organisms mostly have multiple alleles for their ''A'' mating locus; however, in Ustilaginomycotina and Pucciniomycotina, the ''b'' mating locus is predominantly diallelic, which reduces the occurrence of outcrossing within these [[species]].&lt;ref name="Bakkeren 1996 1601–1613"/&gt; Bipolarity likely arose via one of two potential routes: 1) during evolution the ''B'' or ''a'' locus lost functionality in determining specificity, as has occurred in the mushroom ''[[Coprinellus disseminatus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=James, T.

===The ''A'' and ''B'' or ''b'' and ''a'' mating loci===
In the ''B'' or ''a'' locus there are linked genes that code for [[pheromones]] and [[G protein-coupled|pheromone receptors]]. The pheromones are short [[polypeptides]] with conserved residues&lt;ref name="Casselton 2007 283–300"/&gt; and the pheromone receptors belong to the G protein-coupled family of receptors located in the [[cell membrane]]; they sense different molecules (in this case the pheromones) outside and activate a specific pathway inside of the cell. Pheromone-receptor interaction occurs in a way that the pheromone from one individual interacts with the receptor from the partner and vice versa. The functions of these genes are to regulate reciprocal nuclear exchange, nuclear migration in both mates and ultimately clamp cell fusion.&lt;ref name="Brown 2001 393–400"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=A.

A. |title=Mating in mushrooms: increasing the chances but prolonging the affair |journal=Trends in Genetics |year=2001 |volume=17|issue=7 |pages=393–400 |doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(01)02343-5|pmid=11418220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mating pheromone-receptor genes characterized were for ''U. maydis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bölker|first=M. |author2=Urban, M. |author3=Kahmann, R. |title=The a mating type locus of U. maydis specifies cell signaling components|journal=Cell|year=1992 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=441–450|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90182-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''A'' or ''b'' mating locus contains genes that code for two types of homeodomain transcription factor proteins, usually tightly linked, that are homologues to the ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' mating proteins MATα2 and MATa1. In Agaricomycotina the two types of homeodomain transcription factors are termed HD1 and HD2; so the HD1 and HD2 proteins from an individual interacts with the HD2 and HD1 proteins from the other partner, respectively, generating heterodimers able to activate the ''A'' transcriptional regulated pathway, which involves formation of clamp cells, coordinated [[nuclear division]] and [[Cell division|septation]].&lt;ref name="Brown 2001 393–400"/&gt;

===Homothallism===
Homothallic species may likely have evolved from heterothallic ancestors (Lin and Heitman 2007). In Basidiomycota homothallism is not very common and in Agaricomycotina it is estimated that only 10% of species have homothallic mating behavior.&lt;ref name="James 2007 317–331"/&gt; For example, one subspecies of the [[ectomycorrhizal]] Basidiomycete ''Sistotrema brinkmannii'' is homothallic, although other subspecies have maintained their ability to outcross. Also, a variety of the edible mushroom ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'', (''A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus'') produces haploid self-fertile basidiospores. Additionally, in the human pathogen ''[[C. neoformans]]'' known to outcross under laboratory conditions, both mating types are not normally distributed in natural populations, with the α mating type much more commonly found (&gt;99%), suggesting homothallism is the most prevalent mode of sexual reproduction in ´''C. neoformans'' in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin |first=X.|title=Sex in Fungi: Molecular Determination and Evolutionary Implications |year=2007 |publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington DC|pages=35–57|author2=Heitman, J.|editor=J.

'''Michael Joseph Owens''' (January 1, 1859 &amp;ndash; December 27, 1923) was an inventor of machines to automate the production of glass bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography]] |title=Michael Joseph Owens |url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopaediaofame08wilsuoft#page/n233/mode/2up |isbn= |pages= |quote= | accessdate=2013-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Mason County, West Virginia]] on January 1, 1859. He left school at the age of 10 to start a glassware [[apprenticeship]] at [[J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. 
[[File:Ten Arm Owens Automatic Bottle Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A ten-arm owens automatic bottle machine, ca. 1910, photo by [[Jacob Riis]]]]
In 1888 he moved to [[Toledo, Ohio]] and worked for the [[Toledo Glass Factory]] owned by [[Edward Drummond Libbey]]. He was later promoted to foreman and then to supervisor. He formed the [[Owens Bottle Machine Company]] in 1903. His machines could produce glass bottles at a rate of 240 per minute, and reduce labor costs by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall of Fame -- Inventor Profile: Michael Joseph Owens |url=http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/357.html |publisher=[[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=2012-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927020621/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/357.html |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens and Libbey entered into a partnership and the company was renamed the Owens Bottle Company in 1919. In 1929 the company merged with the Illinois Glass Company to become the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Joseph Owens |url=http://www.todayinsci.com/O/Owens_MichaelJ/OwensMichaelJ.htm |quote=Michael Owens was a glass manufacturer who invented an automatic glass bottle manufacturing machine that revolutionized the industry.

The '''Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica''' is a [[music museum]] and [[music library]] in the Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, in the historic center of [[Bologna, Italy]].

==Museum==

===Background===
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 to hold the city's collection of musical objects. It was renamed Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica in 2004 when the museum's current site, the Palazzo Sanguinetti, opened to the public. The palace was reopened after a long and careful restoration that brought the rich, interior [[frescoe]]s back to their original splendour. These frescoes were first completed between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and provide one of the finest examples of Napoleonic and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] decoration.

The purpose of the museum was to make the public aware of the rich musical heritage owned by the Comune di Bologna. Until recently, much of this heritage remained confined in warehouses – primarily due to lack of adequate space – and was only brought out occasionally for temporary display.

Palazzo Sanguinetti offered the possibility to enhance the cultural value of such precious musical heritage and to provide an environment worthy of the priceless items displayed. The palace also guarantees ideal conditions for managing and conserving these items.

The institute is now divided into two sites. An ample selection of volumes, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the museum halls in Strada Maggiore 34 (Palazzo Sanguinetti), while the majority of bibliographic material is accessible in Piazza Rossini 2 (the ex-Convent of San Giacomo) in rooms attached to the G.B. Martini Conservatory of Music.

====The Palazzo Sanguinetti====
In the early 16th century, the original core of the Palazzo Sanguinetti belonged to the Loiani family. The building was sold in 1569 to the Bolognese brothers, Ercole and Giulio Riario, who were originally from Savona and were related to the della Roveres. Having acquired neighboring land and buildings, Senator Ercole Riario had the home reconstructed and enlarged. The individual homes were united into one structure, and construction on the impressive staircase, which still characterizes the building today, was likely begun. The second major reconstruction was commissioned by Count Antonio Aldini, to whom the Marquis Raffaello Riario Sforza had granted a long-term lease in 1796. Count Aldini tasked the architect Giovanni Battista Martinetti (1774–1830) with modernizing the building. A neighboring house was attached to the tower belonging to the Oseletti family, and the huge 16th-century hall was divide into two rooms, which correspond to the modern museum's two most spacious rooms – the vestibule, or the Room of Virtues, and the Ballroom.

Following the fall of [[Napoleon]] and the economic ruin of Aldini, the palace was sold to the Cuban nobleman don Diego Pegnalverd, a former member of the Napoleonic government. Upon his death in 1832, the palazzo passed to the famous tenor, [[Domenico Donzelli]]. It is noted that [[Gioachino Rossini]] stayed there while his own nearby home was under reconstruction. In 1870 the Sanguinetti family purchased the building. They were responsible for the most recent decorations in the intended library and the “Egyptian Room.” During recent renovations of the palazzo, marvelous frescoes were discovered in these two areas.

In 1986 the last heiress, Eleonora Sanguinetti, donated the larger part of the building to the Comune di Bologna in memory – as she wrote in her will – of “my unforgettable father, Dr. Guido Sanguinetti. I wanted to donate the building in Strada Maggiore 34 in his name and memory, and for the love that he always had for his city and his home, so that it could become a music museum and library.”

===The frescos and decorations===
The Palazzo Sanguinetti decorations displays works by major 18th- and 19th-century [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] painters, such as [[Pelagio Palagi]] (1777–1860), [[Serafino Barozzi]], and [[Antonio Basoli]] (1774–1848), under the direction of [[Vincenzo Martinelli]] (1737–1807). On the ground floor, the landscape fresco (a magnificent trompe-l'oeil perspective) is attributed to [[Luigi Busatti]], while the [[quadratura]] is the work of [[Francesco Santini]] (1763–1840). Santini, with the probable collaboration of [[Serafino Barozzi]] (1735–1810), also decorated the walls of the grand staircase. On the first floor, the Woodland Room (Room 1), used as and called the Banquet Room, was designed by Martinelli: he illustrates landscapes rich with greenery and classical architecture in the distance. These classical elements surround the onlooker in the illusion of a step that supports hermes and statues of Bacchus and Ceres, works by a young Palagi.&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions by Paola Foschi writes in the museum guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aeneas Room (Room 2), also by Palagi, depicts stories of the [[Aeneid]] on a black, ''Etruscan'' background. The Zodiac and Aurora Room (Room 3) depicts the Zodiac signs by Domenico Corsini (1774–1814) and a figure of Aurora, attributed to Palagi. The last small room of the east wing (Room 4) is decorated by artists from the Barozzi workshop.  They are also credited with the two rooms (Rooms 6 and 7) that conclude the west wing, which are decorated in ''oriental'' style with curtains and pavilions, exotic plants, and feminine figures with small umbrellas. Room 5 is the Ballroom. At the end of the museum tour are two salons in the apartment designed by Aldini; they were the first two rooms to be decorated. The original room (Room 8), is decorated by Antonio Basoli in a ''neo-gothic'' style, with figures, statues, and bass reliefs by [[Pietro Fancelli]] (1764–1850).

====Father Giovanni Battista Martini====
[[File:Padre Martini 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Padre Gianbattista Martini. Author: Angelo Crescimbeni, 1770.]]

The original core of the museum's musical collections is credited to the Conventual Franciscan [[friar]], [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] (Bologna, April 24, 1706 – August 3, 1784), important 18th-century music scholar and collector, a theorist and composer, and a teacher of counterpoint. [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Mozart|Wolfgang Amadé Mozart]] were among his students.

At only 19 years old, Martini was appointed chapel-master of the Church of [[Basilica of San Francesco, Bologna|San Francesco]] in Bologna. His fame as an excellent teacher and connoisseur of music began to grow when he “won” a dispute with the scholar, Redi, regarding the interpretation of a mysterious ''canone dell'Animuccia'' that existed in the choir gallery of the Santa Casa di Loreto, where Redi himself was chapel-master. After this triumph, not content with being only a scholar, he continued his music studies and was an admired composer of [[sonatas]] for the harpsichord, canons, and about 500 unpublished musical pieces.

The numerous letters conserved in the library (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] who had contacts with Martini. Even the [[Emperor of Austria]] visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the walls of his library in the Monastery of San Francesco.

===Exhibition path===
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart, composer Author:unknown, 1777.]]
The museum path opens among the lush decorations of '''the Boschereccia Room''' with some symbolic works which serve as an introduction to the museum and prepare the visitor for their trip through the musical universe.

'''Rooms 2''' and 3 are dedicated to the spiritual father of the new museum, pictured in an oval by Angelo Crescimbeni: Giambattista Martini, whose priceless moral heritage, both intellectual and material, is celebrated here and made known to the greater public.
&lt;br /&gt;
In '''Room 3''', the relationships between [[Padre Martini]] and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young [[Mozart]] or [[Johann Christian Bach]], who is represented in the famous portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], are displayed. In the same room, one can also admire the famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]].&lt;br /&gt;
'''Room 4''' (“The Idea of Music”) follows, which is dedicated to the musical scholars from the 15th century to the 17th century, with important examples of musical treatises, and portraits of their respective authors. This room also contains some musical instruments of great importance, like the unique omnitonum harpsichord  by [[Vito Trasuntino]] ([[Venice]] 1606).

Some of the more relevant pieces are on display in the following '''Room 5''' (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the “Books for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.” In this room, rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases in the center of the room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.

Then there are the instruments: lutes; the harmony of flutes by Manfredo Settala of 1650, which represents a real unicum;
the pochette, various little violins used as instruments by dance instructors, the ghironde, the serpentoni, the extraordinary series of horns and cornets from the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally, a unique performance instrument: the tiorba, which is in the shape of a khitára.

Italian opera is the focus of the following room.
The 18th century are first in '''Room 6''', dedicated to the famous singer [[Carlo Broschi]], known as [[Farinelli]].

His beautiful portrait, painted by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], dominates the room, together with the portraits of the castrati from various periods and of composers from the time, such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa]].

'''Room 7''' places the visitor in the 19th century with [[Gioachino Rossini]], whose name is forever tied to [[Bologna]]. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first recitals of [[Isabella Colbran]], a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of [[The Barber of Seville]] and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by [[Camille Pleyel]].

The path proceeds through the centuries, the musical uses, and styles in '''Room 8''', which is dedicated to “Books for music and instruments in the 18th and 19th centuries.” There are viole d'amore and flutes along with the original scores composed by [[Torelli]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Ferdinando Bertoni|Bertoni]], etc. There are also clarinets and the beautiful Buccin, created in [[Lyon]] by Jean Baptiste Tabard (1812–1845).

Concluding the exhibit, '''Room 9''' pays a proper tribute to two important people in the Italian and Bolognese musical culture, [[Giuseppe Martucci]] and [[Ottorino Respighi]].  This room displays the composer's portraits, photographs, and a selection of works from the Respighi property, which were donated to the library in 1961 by his widow, Elsa, for the 25th anniversary of his death. In the same room lies the portrait of the musician Arrigo Serato, painted by the famous artist [[Felice Casorati]].

===Collections===
The first floor of the Palazzo is home to the nine rooms of the exhibition, which illustrates about six centuries of the history of European music. There are over one hundred paintings of famous people from the music world, which are a part of the picture gallery started by Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, more than eighty antique musical instruments, and a large selection of valuable historical documents, such as treatises, volumes, opera libretti, letters, manuscripts, original musical scores, etc.

==Library==
[[File:Due sportelli di libreria con scaffali di libri di musica.jpg|thumb|right|Libreria. Autore:G.M.Crespi, c. 1720 – 1730. Collocazione: Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica]]
The collection inherited from Padre Martini constitutes one of the most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini painstakingly kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.
Saved from the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations  due to the intervention of [[Stanislao Mattei]], Martini's disciple and successor, the valuable bibliographic patrimony was donated to the Liceo musicale di [[Bologna]] in 1816. The Liceo had been founded in 1804 at the ex-convent of the Agostinians in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The library grew considerably throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, thanks to the amount of materials produced from the didactic activity of the Liceo (famous students of the Liceo included Rossini, Donizetti, and Respighi and directors Mancinelli, Martucci, and Busoni).
The library also grew because of the valuable items and rare volumes that were acquired by [[Gaetano Gaspari]], who was appointed as librarian in 1855.
Gaspari directed the library for many years with a unique zeal and knowledge. After many years of hard work and constant effort, he was able to excellently organize and card-catalogue all the library material (also from this period came the posthumous publication, the "Library Catalogue of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna", which bears his name and is now also available online).
In 1942, when the Liceo musicale was transformed into a state institution – Regio Conservatorio di Musica – the [[Comune di Bologna]] chose to maintain ownership of Padre Martini's bibliographic patrimony and the attached picture gallery.
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 in order to conserve and make the most of the bibliographic patrimony and portrait gallery.

===Picture gallery===
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|right|Supposed portrait of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]. Author and date unknown.]]
There is not much information about the development of the picture gallery, which seems to have had no rivals in [[Bologna]] during the 18th century. From the valuable letters of correspondence that [[Padre Martini]] kept with different well-known people of the time (for example, musicians that were his students in [[Bologna]], members of the [[Philharmonic Academy of Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]], music theorists, composers, nobles, illustrious intellectuals, chapel masters, and custodians of Franciscan convents), it is evident that there was a complex network of informers and intermediaries that were responsible for finding the portraits he desired.
Many of the portraits were commissioned to the artists directly by [[Padre Martini]]. The painters drew the features of the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings as much as their plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator – music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.
It's worth noting that there are many paintings by famous artists present in the collection, including the portrait of [[Farinelli]] by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], the portrait of [[Johann Christian Bach]] by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], and one of [[Charles Burney]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]].
It also seems that the prestige of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable [[Europe]]an expert on the art of music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.
The picture gallery remained in the convent of [[San Francesco]] even after Martini's death, surviving the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei. Only in 1801 was it transferred to the ex-convent of the Agostinians at the Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore. Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on canvas with some pastels and drawings.

===The collection of musical instruments===
The musical instruments displayed in the rooms of the museum originate from the collections of two important Bolognese institutions: the Museo Civico Medievale and the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. The core of this collection from the Museo Civico Medievale comes from the Liceo musicale, which was founded in 1804. As Federico Parisini (the Liceo librarian from 1881 to 1891) explained, following the Napoleonic suppressions, “the instruments, many famous musical works, chorus books, rare instruments, and other items related to music were sold publicly.”
The central administration of the Dipartimento del Reno had asked the government of the Repubblica Cisalpina to purchase and conserve the objects that risked being dispersed. The recovered instruments were then entrusted to the Liceo and, in 1881, were finally added to the Museo Civico Medievale, where they have remained until today.
Among the most valuable instruments now displayed in the rooms of the museum is the Trasuntino harpsichord of 1606 (displayed in Room 4). It was constructed for Camillo Gonzaga, the Count of Novellara, and afterwards was passed to Giuseppe Baini (1775–1844), the celebrated author of the first biography of [[Palestrina]]. In his will, Baini bequeathed the harpsichord to the Liceo Musicale. Other valuable instruments on display are the Trasuntino monochord, which was built to tune the cymbal, and the 5-reed flute, which is able to mimic several flutes playing in harmony. There is also the polyphonic flute (displayed in Room 5), which bears the mark of Manfredo Settala (1600–1680), a Milanese rector, who was a great collector and famous personality in the cultural panorama of the 17th century.
The origin of the collection of musical instruments in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale is more uncertain. The collection includes some particularly important models, such as eight pianos, five of which are grand pianos and three of which are rectangular. These pianos date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Among these are the priceless Erard from 1811 (that possibly belonged to Paolina Borghese), which was restored for the inauguration of the museum and is now exhibited in Room 8. Also included are [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] piano of 1844 (exhibited in Room 7), and the so-called “spinette of Padre Martini”, a rectangular Glonner from 1780 (displayed in Room 3). Other important instruments on display are the Heckelphon of 1900 (Room 8), various English horns, some cornets, and two oboes.

'''Library'''

Though it is to be transferred to a new site, the library is located in Piazza Rossini 2. It is made up of a single reading room, which is shared with the Conservatorio di Musica “G.B. Martini”. The room has 20 seats, twelve of which are exclusively reserved for the consultation of antique and particular texts. There are two microfilm (and one microfilm/microfiches) machines available in the room, and a space for bibliographic and catalogue searches.

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|As the logos on the window show, the RKD shares the same building (located near [[Den Haag Centraal]]) with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Letterkundig Museum|nl}} (LM), the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History|Huygens ING]], the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]

The '''Netherlands Institute for Art History''' or '''RKD''' (Dutch: '''RKD-Nederlands Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis''') is located in [[The Hague]] and is home to the largest [[art history]] center in the world. The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on [[Western art]] from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of [[Dutch Masters]].

Via the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.

The RKD also manages the Dutch version of the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], a [[thesaurus]] of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The collection was started through bequests by [[Frits Lugt]], art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] (1863–1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] (National Library).
==Open access website==
Though not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its [[metadata]] is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.
===Online artist pages===
In the artist database ''RKDartists'', each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for [[Salvador Dalí]] is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/19752 |title=Salvador Dalí |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P650}}
===Online artworks pages===
In the images database ''RKDimages'', each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for [[The Night Watch]] is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/3063 |title=Civic guardsmen of Amsterdam under command of Banninck Cocq |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property |P350 }}
{{commons category|RKDimages}}

===Online thesaurus of art terms===
The Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called "The Night Watch" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: ''algemene trefwoord'') can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5BRKD_algemene_trefwoorden%5D=militia%20painting All available records for "militia painting"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the [[iconclass]] database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71E1232  All available records for iconclass code "71E1232"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nurturant parent model''' also "Nurturing Parent" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system.  In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive .  

The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both "roots in the ground and wings to fly." He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings).  The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence.  As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges.

At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground thru managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally. 

The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.' 

Other ideas:

* True discipline is much more than strict, unquestioning obedience.  Mutual [[respect]] and [[compassion]] are also rights.
* The outside world is no more inherently hostile than it is inherently friendly; stay alert, the world  commands respect
* Mutual respect and compassion is best taught by example.

== Research ==

This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in [[Human development (psychology)|Human Development]]{{fact|date=August 2012}} where researchers were investigating the [[Parenting styles|parenting style]] preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the [[Parenting_styles#Authoritative_parenting|authoritative style]].{{fact|date=August 2012}} The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called "the nurturing parent" that focuses on responsibility, [[empathy]], and [[creativity]]. The basic approach these parents used was to:

* Trust in their children's fairness and good judgment
* Respect their children's [[autonomy]], thoughts and feelings
* Support their children's interests and goals
* Enjoy their children's company
* Protect their children from doing injury to self or others, not by establishing rules but by communicating values and discussing their children's behavior with them
* Modeling the [[self-control]], [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] they believe their children will need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dacey |first=J. S. |last2=Packer |first2=A. J. |year=1992 |title=The Nurturing Parent: How to Raise Creative, Loving, Responsible Children |location=New York |publisher=Fireside, Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-77145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further mentions ==

Herbert Jay Rosenfield ([[Social_work|LCSW]]) in his unfinished book ''Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting'' encourages use of the acronym "RECEPEE", for "'''R'''easonable '''E'''xpectations, '''C'''learly '''E'''xpressed, '''P'''erformed '''E'''veryday and by '''E'''xample". "The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym "UCARE":

* '''U'''niqueness that is positive, achieved through praise, encouragement, and positive feedback
* '''C'''onnectiveness to family, to extended family, and to a neighborhood that is safe, healthy and moderate
* '''A'''ge-appropriate autonomy: responsibilities and privileges that parallel their age and capabilities
* '''R'''ole '''E'''xamples: parent models with good self-esteem and behavior, whom they can emulate

Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that "parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment".

The nurturant parent model is also discussed by [[George Lakoff]] in his books, including ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and ''Whose Freedom?'' In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the [[strict father model]]. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then [[progressivism|progressive]] politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance.

The model is also consistent with [[slow parenting]] in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.

'''PROBA-2''' is the second satellite in the [[European Space Agency]]'s series of [[PROBA]] low-cost [[satellite]]s that are being used to validate new spacecraft technologies while also carrying scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Proba_Missions/About_Proba-2 |title=About PROBA-2 |date=2012-12-02 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROBA-2 is a small satellite (130&amp;nbsp;kg) developed under an ESA General Support Technology Program (GSTP) contract by a Belgian consortium led by Verhaert (now [[QinetiQ|QinetiQ Space]]) of Kruibeke, Belgium. The nominal mission duration was two years.&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; The mission's most recent extension runs to {{Date|2016-12-31}}.&lt;ref name=ex2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/54999-working-life-extensions-for-esas-science-missions/ |title=Working life extensions for ESA’s science missions |date=28 November 2014 |website=ESA Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission summary==
It was launched on {{Date|2009-11-2}}, with the [[Rockot]] launch system together with [[ESA]]'s [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |title=Successful launch qualification test for PROBA-2 |date=2008-09-16 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074327/http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was launched in a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]] (altitude of 725&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

PROBA-2 contains five scientific instruments. Two of them are designated to observe the [[Sun]]: "The Sun Watcher using APS and Image Processing" ([[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]], an EUV imager) and the "Large Yield Radiometer" ([[LYRA]]), a radiometer made of diamond photodiodes. The Principal investigator teams of both instruments are hosted at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]. This institute will also host the [http://proba2.oma.be PROBA-2 Science Center]  from which the [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] and [[LYRA]] instruments will be operated and their data distributed. There are three other instruments to measure basic space plasma properties: the [[Dual segmented Langmuir probe]] (DSLP)&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; (developed by the [[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Astronomical Institute]] and Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), the Thermal Plasma Measurement Unit (TPMU), and the Science Grade Vector Magnetometer (SGVM) developed by the [[Technical University of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

'''''Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935''''' is a futuristic [[political novel]] published anonymously in 1912 by author [[Edward M. House|Edward Mandell House]], an American diplomat, politician, and presidential foreign policy advisor.  According to historians, House highly prized his work and gave a copy of ''Dru'' to his closest political ally, [[Woodrow Wilson]], to read while on a trip to Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g1IgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 Colonel House: A Biography of Woodrow Wilson's Silent Partner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jcL20ZS_KUC&amp;pg=PA53 Woodrow Wilson's Right Hand: The Life of Colonel Edward M.

==Book reviews==
Historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote: "Oddly enough, in 1911 he [House] had published a political novel, ''Philip Dru: Administrator'', in which a benevolent dictator imposed a corporate income tax, abolished the protective tariff, and broke up the 'credit trust'—a remarkable adumbration of [[Woodrow Wilson|[Woodrow] Wilson]] and his first term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Johnson (writer) | title = A History of the American People | publisher = HarperPerennial | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 635–636| isbn = 0060930349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billie Jensen, a historian from the [[University of Kansas]] noted that "''Philip Dru was obviously an expression both of House's ambition and his political dreams and it was an expression of the ideas of the man who had an impressive amount of influence on Woodrow Wilson.  Seldom have the elements of a utopia been implemented so soon as the reforms of Philip Dru were; seldom has a utopian reformer been as influential as House was.  For these reasons, Philip Dru is a significant political document.''&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;[https://libprdojsap.lib.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/2434 Philip Dru, The Blueprint of a Presidential Adviser]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book review for [[The New York Times]], [[Walter Lippmann]] wrote of the novel and its anonymous author that "''if the author is really a man of affairs, this is an extraordinarily interesting book''".&lt;ref&gt;[*[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DB1E3AE633A2575BC0A9649D946396D6CF AMERICA'S FUTURE; Pictured in a Decidedly Quaint Modern Novel], [[Walter Lippmann]], December 8, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''Post-romanticism''' or '''Postromanticism''' refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of [[Romanticism]].

[[Herman Melville]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are post-Romantic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milder, ''Exiled Royalties: Melville and the Life We Imagine'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|0-19-514232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' is a post-Romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Heath, ''Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary'', Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13. {{ISBN|0-521-31483-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Baumback and others, "A History of British Poetry", Trier: WVT. {{ISBN|978-3-86821-578-6}}. Section 19: Poetic Genres in the Victorian Age I: Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Post-Romantic Verse Narratives by Anne-Julia Zwierlein.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', New York: Routledge, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;134. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Romanticism in music ==
Post-romanticism in [[music]] referred to [[romantic music|Romantic]] composers who would use [[musical form|forms]] that were found typically in the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are [[Puccini|Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninov]]. [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]]&lt;!--in an interview with Virgil Thomson--&gt; describes the mysticism of [[La Jeune France]] as post-Romanticism rather than [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Thomson,. ''Virgil Thomson: A Reader: Selected Writings, 1924-1984'', edited by Richard Kostelanetz, New York: Routledge, 2002p.&amp;nbsp;268. {{ISBN|0-415-93795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Pfitzner]] also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera ''Palestrina''.

Quite unlike Late Romantic composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and [[harmony]]. [[Béla Bartók]], for example, "in such Strauss-influenced works as ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''," may be described as having still used "[[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound"—unlike [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Strauss himself, who both believed in "a mythology of historical progress in Western music".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright,. ''Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources'',  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004pp.&amp;nbsp;243-44. {{ISBN|0-226-01267-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychology of programming''' ('''PoP''') is the field of research that deals with the [[psychological]] aspects of writing [[Computer program|program]]s (often [[computer]] programs). The field has also been called the '''''empirical studies of programming''''' ('''ESP'''). It covers research into computer programmers' cognition; tools and methods for programming-related activities; and programming education.

Psychologically, computer programming is a human activity which involves [[cognition]]s such as [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]] [[computer language]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], and [[reasoning]].

==History==
The history of psychology of programming dates back to late 1970s and early 1980s, when researchers realized that computational power should not be the only thing to be evaluated in programming tools and technologies, but also the usability from the users.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Sajaniemi. Psychology of Programming: Looking into Programmers’ Heads. Human Technology [Internet]. 2008 May 4–8 [cited 2012 Oct 4]; 4(1): Available from: http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume4/2008/ge-sajaniemi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers, [[Ben Shneiderman]] listed several important destinations for researchers. These destinations include refining the use of current languages, improving present and future languages, developing special purpose languages, and improving tools and methods. Two important workshop series have been devoted to psychology of programming in the last two decades: the Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP), based primarily in the US, and the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), having a European character. ESP has a broader scope than pure psychology in programming, and on the other hand, PPIG is more focused in the field of PoP. However, PPIG workshops and the organization PPIG itself is informal in nature, It is group of people who are interested in PoP that comes together and publish their discussions.

==Goals and purposes==
It is desirable to achieve a programming performance such that creating a program meets its specifications, is on schedule, is adaptable for the future and runs efficiently.&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |authorlink=Gerald Weinberg |title=The Psychology of Computer Programming |place=New York |publisher=Dorset House |year=1998 |edition=Silver |url=https://leanpub.com/thepsychologyofcomputerprogramming |isbn=0-932633-42-0 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:Weinberg+intitle:The+Psychology+of+Computer+Programming]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to satisfy all these goals at a low cost is a difficult and common problem in software engineering and project management. By understanding the psychological aspects of computer programming, we can better understand how to achieve a higher programming performance, and to assist programmers to produce better software with less error.

==Research methods==
Some methods which one can use to study the psychological aspects of computer programming include [[introspection]], [[observation]], [[experiment]], and [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name="weinberg"/&gt;

A '''pugil stick''' is a heavily padded pole-like training weapon used since the early 1940s by [[military]] personnel in training for [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]] combat.&lt;ref name="Marine pugil"&gt;[http://www.marines.com/main/index/making_marines/recruit_training/training_matrix/pugil_stick "Pugil Stick-Overcoming Hesitation and the Opponent"], www.marines.com, Retrieved 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The pugil stick is similar to a [[quarterstaff]] or [[bo (weapon)|Japanese ''bo'']], and may be marked to indicate which end represents the bayonet and which the [[rifle]] butt. Dr. Armond H. Seidler (1919-2017) of the [[University of New Mexico]] invented the Pugil Stick training method during [[World War II]]. It was initially adopted by the [[United States Marine Corps]], but was later included in [[United States Army]] combat training as well. Dr. Seidler received an award from the Marine Corps for his invention. 

Pugil bouts are usually conducted with hard contact while wearing protective gear such as groin protectors, [[American football]] helmets, [[hockey]] gloves, and chest protectors or shin guards, such as those worn by [[baseball]] [[catcher]]s. Some pugil sticks are made with integrated hand guards to reduce the potential for injury. Military procedures for pugil bouts are often detailed, with [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] both prohibiting pugil training by anyone who has recently suffered [[concussion of the brain]], lest they suffer [[traumatic brain injury]], or had a tooth extraction within the past 24 hours.

Pugil stick sparring was popularized in the United States by the ''[[American Gladiators]]'', a physical [[game show]] which ran from 1989 to 1996, and again in the [[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|2008 revival]], as well as in [[Gladiators (1992 UK TV series)|the British version]]. In the "Joust" contest, competitors would try to knock each other off pedestals using pugil sticks.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The name "pugil stick" is a [[neologism]] from the [[Latin]] noun ''pugnus'' (fist), the source for other English words such as "pugilist" (boxer) and "pugnacious" (eager to fight).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20792">'''Retail design''' is a creative and [[Commerce|commercial]] discipline that combines several different areas of expertise
together in the [[design]] and construction of [[retail]] space.

Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space. Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers, the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle-free shopping experience for the consumer.
For example, research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A.

Retail spaces, especially when they form part of a [[retail chain]], must also be designed to draw people into the space to shop. The storefront must act as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for the store, often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside. In the case of a retail chain, the individual spaces must be unified in their design.&lt;ref name="Luxury" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R8N6qJeo1DAC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHuRTKiHF8K78ga1v5i-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Boutiques and other retail spaces: the architecture of seduction"] by Leontine de Wit, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century, with stores such as [[Bon Marche]] and [[Printemps]] in [[Paris]], "followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago, Selfridges in London and Macy's in New York." These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the [[chain store]]. 

The first known [[chain stores|chain department stores]] were established in Belgium in 1875, when Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated ''Dewachter frères'' (Dewachter Brothers) selling [[ready-to-wear]] clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear.&lt;ref name =ACTS&gt;Annexes to the Belgian Monitor of 1875. Acts, Extracts of Acts, Minutes and Documents relating to Corporations, Book #3, Page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm opened with four locations&lt;ref name =ACTS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:La Louvière|The French Wikipedia site reports that ''Dewachter frères'' opened in La Louvière in 1865, but provides no reference.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1904, ''Maison Dewachter'' (House of Dewachter) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with multiple stores in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Maison Dewachter'' Liège 1891 letterhead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maison_Dewachter_Bordeaux,_France_Letterhead_1904.png ''Maison Dewachter'' Bordeaux 1904 letterhead listing 20 cities and towns and three stores in Bordeaux itself]&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore's eldest son, Louis Dewachter, managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym [[Louis Dewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], which quickly became a franchise across the US. Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later, with stores like [[Boots UK|Boots]]. After [[World War II]], a new type of retail design building known as the [[shopping centre]] came into being. This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe. Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the [[suburban]] family, while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town. The first shopping centre in the [[Netherlands]] was built in the 1950s, as retail design ideas began spreading east.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPROj1JJIO4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Retail Design"], ''Design: the key concepts'' by Catherine McDermott, Psychology Press, 2007, Pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the [[boutique]] in the 1960s, which emphasized retail design run by individuals. Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the [[Biba]] boutique created by [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and the [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]] line of stores made by [[Terence Conran]]. The rise of the boutique was followed, in the next two decades, with an overall increase in consumer spending across the [[Developed country|developed world]]. This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses. Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes. These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple "expensive, one-off designer shops" catering to specific [[fashion design]]ers and retailers.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

The rise of the [[internet]] and [[Online shopping|internet retailing]] in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate. Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops, where retail design can be properly utilized.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

==Usage==

===Role===
A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the [[consumer]], by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.9&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity. Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design elements===
Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear, a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined. These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space, entrances, circulation systems, atmospheric qualities (light and sound) and materiality. By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise. It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features, that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change (e.g. per season).&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design; often the spaces already exist, and have had many prior uses. It is at this stage that logistics must be determined, structural features like columns, stairways, ceiling height, windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design. In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.15-17&lt;/ref&gt; The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space. [[circulation (architecture)|Circulation]] is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back, guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience:

# '''Straight plan:''' this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise. It also leads the consumer to the back of the store. This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Pathway plan:''' is most suitable for large stores that are single level. In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures, this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store. This is well suited for apparel department stores, as the clothes will be easily accessible.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Diagonal plan:''' uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow. The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible. This plan is most suited for self-service retail.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Curved plan:''' aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting. In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls, corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures. Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Varied plan:''' in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas, as well as having storage areas that line the wall. This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;
# '''Geometric plan:''' uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement. By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces. This is well suited for appeal stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;

Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined, the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting, sound, materials and visual branding. These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space. It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store. The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures. Firstly, examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space. Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.65-80&lt;/ref&gt; If no natural light exists, a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space. The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider. This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas. The next layer should emphasize the selling areas. These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh. Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer. To minimize the possibility of eye strain, the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas. The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer. The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.147-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.183-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio, the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to, this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed. In a lingerie store the music should be soft, feminine and romanticized; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd.p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Materiality (architecture)|Materiality]] is another key selling tool, the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.563-566&lt;/ref&gt; Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable. The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting, a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p51-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.160-172&lt;/ref&gt; By switching materials throughout the store zones/ areas can be defined, for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store. Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise. As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"/&gt;

Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return. The key factor is consistency exterior [[brand]]ing and signage should continue into the interior, they should attract, stimulate and dramatise the store. To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store, proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located. The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.81-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective===
The final element of a well-executed retail space is the staging of the consumer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space. From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople''' ({{lang-ru|Русский археологический институт в Константинополе}}) was founded in 1895 and led by two distinguished Russian Byzantinists, [[Fyodor Uspensky]] and [[Nikodim Kondakov]]. The institute carried out excavations and studies across the entire [[Ottoman Empire]], carrying off large numbers of relics, manuscripts and other finds to Russia. Aside from its research role, the institute was from the outset intended as a statement of foreign policy, following the [[Russian Empire]]'s claim to be the inheritor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as the "[[Third Rome]]", and its long-standing ambition to conquer [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] from the Ottoman Empire. The institute continued to function until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45418">'''Sex in advertising''' is the use of [[sex appeal]] in [[advertising]] to help sell a particular product or service. According to research, sexually appealing imagery does not need to pertain to the product or service in question. A few examples of sexually appealing imagery include [[nudity]], [[pin-up model]]s, and muscular men. "Sex sells" became a controversial issue, with techniques for enlarging and titillating the audience challenging conventional moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dawn Blair, et al., "Ethics in advertising: sex sells, but should it?." ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues'' 9.1/2 (2006): 109+.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary mainstream advertising (e.g., magazines, online, television), sex is present in promotional messages for a wide range of branded goods. Ads often feature provocative images of well-defined women (and men) in revealing outfits and postures selling things such as clothing, alcohol, beauty products, and fragrances. Advertisers such as Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret, and Pepsi (just to name a few) use these images to cultivate a sexy media presence. Also, sexual information is used to promote mainstream products not traditionally associated with sex. For example, [[Dallas Opera]]'s recent reversal of its declining ticket sales has been attributed to the marketing of the more lascivious parts of its performances.&lt;ref&gt;Chism, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex in advertising research: A review of content, effects, and functions of sexual information in consumer advertising|year=2002|pages=241–73|journal=Annu. Rev. Sex Res.|volume=13|author=Tom Reichert|pmid=12836733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of sex in advertising can be highly overt or extremely subtle and, on some level, subliminal. It ranges from relatively explicit displays of sexual acts and seductive behavior aimed at the viewer, to the use of double-meanings and underlying sexual references that are more subconscious. Sex in advertising relies on evolutionary processes and varies in effectiveness depending on the culture and gender of the receiver. The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to objectify the female body and emphasizing various stereotypes.

''Gender Advertisements'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goffman |first1=Erving |title=Gender Advertisements |date=March 1, 1979 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0060906332 |pages=84 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1979 book by Canadian social anthropologist, [[Erving Goffman]] is series of studies of visual communication and how gender representation in advertising communicates subtle, underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising. The book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising and the differences, as well as the symbolism implied in the depictions of men and women in advertising.

When couples are used in an advertisement, the sex-roles played by each also send out messages. The interaction of the couple may send out a message of relative dominance and power, and may stereotype the roles of one or both partners. Usually the message is very subtle, and sometimes advertisements attract interest by changing stereotypical roles. For example, companies including [[Spotify]], [[AirBnB]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] have used same-sex couples in adverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=13 amazing adverts featuring same-sex couples|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/13/13-amazing-adverts-featuring-same-sex-couples/|website=PinkNews|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These adverts appeal to same-sex couples; and they also create the image that these companies are tolerant and allow them to appeal to a wider consumer audience.

As many consumers and professionals think, sex is used to grab a viewer's attention but this is a short-term success. Whether using sex in advertising is effective depends on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2008/03/does-sex-in-adv.html|title=DOES SEX IN ADVERTISING WORK?|publisher=Branding Strategy Insider|accessdate=2015-03-31|date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About three-quarters of advertisements using sex to sell the product are communicating a product-related benefit, such as the product making its users more sexually attractive. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Types==

===Physical attractiveness===
The use of physically attractive models in advertising is a form of sex in advertising. Physical attractiveness can be conveyed through facial beauty, physique, hair, skin complexion as well as by the model's inferred personality. This form of sex in advertising is effective as it draws attention and influences the overall feeling of the ad. Furthermore, such ads create an association between physical attractiveness and the product which sends a message to the consumer buying it that they will help them achieve that physique.&lt;ref name="Reichert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reichert|first1=Tom|title=Sex in advertising: Perspectives on the erotic appeal|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|pages=11–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[sexual arousal]] possibly elicited by physical attractiveness in adverts is thought to transfer onto the advertised product.&lt;ref name="AABerger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Arthur Asa|title=Ads, fads and Consumer culture|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=99–120|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual behaviour===
Marketers often use tactics such as using sexual imagery in their advertisements to capture the consumer's attention for longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Sengupta &amp; Vohs (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Sex in advertising is also incorporated using hints of [[sexual behaviour]]. The latter is communicated by the models using flirtatious [[body language]], open posture and making eye contact with the viewer. Sexual behaviour can also be displayed using several models interacting in a more or less sexual way. Sexual behaviour in advertising is used to arouse sexual interest from the viewer.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt; Research has shown that sexual arousal elicited by an advert subsequently affects the overall ad evaluation and the chances of future purchase.&lt;ref name="AABerger" /&gt;

For example, in a Guess clothing advert, while the models are physically attractive, it is their behavior such as position, posture and facial expressions that communicate sexual interest to the viewer. Women are often shown as being shorter, put in the background of images, shown in more ‘feminine’ poses than men, and generally present a higher degree of ‘body display’ than men in print advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotos|first=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction:  An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual referents===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VW topless.png|thumb|282x282px|Volkswagen advert for the "topless" Beetle Cabriolet]] --&gt;
Sexual referents are a more implicit example of sex in advertising. Sex can be invoked in advertising using sexual double entendre or innuendos. The latter rely on the viewer to interpret them. They can be words or images that while not being explicitly sexual, trigger sexual thoughts from the viewer. Elements such as lighting, music, models’ behaviour and camera effects can contribute towards communicating implicit sexual meaning. Sexual referents are a powerful tool as they drive viewers to create sexual thoughts and interpretations of the product.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

While sexual referents are an implicit use of sex in advertising, as there may be nothing overtly sexual about them, they are placed by advertisers in the aim that viewers will interpret them as sexual.

An example of sexual referents is [[Volkswagen]]'s campaign for the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] Cabriolet. The advert pixelates the non-existent roof to the car, similar to the pixilation that occurs when female's breasts are exposed in some forms of media. Volkswagen have a history of producing tongue-in-cheek adverts, and this one serves to compare their new convertible to a woman who goes topless at a beach. It implies the car is relaxed and fun, like someone who goes topless at a beach.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Super chocolate cake vagina Moist.jpg|left|thumb|168x168px|Betty Crocker cake mix advert using sexual embed technique]] --&gt;

===Sexual embeds===
Sexual embeds are a controversial form of sex in advertising. They are a powerful technique that advertising agencies do not want consumers to consciously notice. They are [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] elements that are detected as sexual information solely at the subconscious level. Sexual embeds can take the form of objects or words that, at the subconscious level (or when occasionally consciously identified) explicitly depict sexual acts or genitalia. For example, a perfume bottle could mimic a phallic shape and its positioning could suggest sexual intercourse. Embeds are especially effective as they unconsciously trigger sexual arousal in the consumer which drives motivation and goal directed behaviour such as purchase intention.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

An example of this technique is a particular cake mix advertisement from [[Betty Crocker]] in which it would appear the chocolate icing on the heel of the cake has been painted to look like [[female genitalia]]. Amongst millions who viewed the commercial, very few will have noticed anything unusual; however, while this detail might not have been consciously perceived, it would have been interpreted sexually at the [[subconscious]] level. This advertisement, directed at women, puts an emphasis on the [[sense of touch]] by using words such as "moist", and on the whole the ad creates a subconscious association between the product and [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

===Gender roles===
After women achieved the vote in the United States, Britain and Canada in the 1920s, advertising agencies exploited the new status of women. For example, they associated driving an automobile with masculinity, power, control, and dominance over a beautiful woman sitting alongside. More subtly, they published automobile ads in women's magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were in fact men.  The new ads promoted themes of women's liberation while also delineating the limits of this freedom. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility and modernity.  The ads offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einav | first1 = Rabinovitch-Fox | year = 2016 | title = Baby, You Can Drive My Car: Advertising Women's Freedom in 1920s America | url = | journal = American Journalism | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 372–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary theory ==
[[File:AN Aurora Jolie 1.jpg|thumb|209x209px|An example of a product being paired with sexual imagery to create an association between the two. The logo of the product this model is promoting is printed on the [[pasties]] (on her breasts).]]
Research into evolution explains the use of sex in advertising and the differences between genders, due to different [[Mating strategy|mating strategies]]. It is the biological prerogative of the male to reproduce with as many females as possible, as this increases his chances of producing [[offspring]]. Because of this need to reproduce as much as possible, males search for cues which signal females are available and accessible, such as seductive behaviour, as well as cues that indicate good health, including facial symmetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill &amp; Gangstead|year=1996|title=The evolution of human sexuality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49758142|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=11|issue=2|pages=98–102|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81051-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shiny hair and firm breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havlíček |first=Jan|display-authors=etal |year=2016|title=Men's preferences for women's breast size and shape in four cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816302847|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=In Press|issue=2|pages=217–226|via=|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers can use these findings to help create an association between their product and the males needs by pairing the two.

Evolutionary research into female sex strategies show that women are more concerned about long term prospects and mates resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss |first=D |last2=Schmitt |first2=D.|year=1993|title=Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100.2|issue=2|pages=204–232|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and less interested in typical male requirements of good health and accessibility. This explains why sexually explicit adverts tend to be directed at male consumers, whereas products aimed at a female market typically involve romantic imagery, and males who are wealthy, intelligent or powerful.

==History==
{{main|History of advertising}}
The earliest known use of sex in advertising is by the Pearl Tobacco brand in 1871, which featured a naked maiden on the package cover. In 1885, W. Duke &amp; Sons inserted trading cards into cigarette packs that featured sexually provocative starlets. Duke grew to become the leading American cigarette brand by 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|320x320px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal''  version of the famous seduction-based ad by [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency]] Other early forms of sex appeal in advertising include woodcuts and illustrations of attractive women (often unclothed from the waist up) adorning posters, signs, and ads for [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s, [[patent medicine|tonic]]s, and [[tobacco]]. In several notable cases, sex in advertising has been claimed as the reason for increased consumer interest and sales.

===Sex and soap===
[[Woodbury's Facial Soap]], a woman's beauty bar, was almost discontinued in 1911. The soap's sales decline was reversed, however, with ads containing images of romantic couples and promises of love and intimacy for those using the brand.&lt;ref&gt;''Account Histories'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Jovan Musk Oil, introduced in 1971, was promoted with sexual entendre and descriptions of the fragrance's sexual attraction properties. As a result, Jovane, Inc.'s revenue grew from $1.5 million in 1971 to $77 million by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan &amp; Millman, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===KamaSutra condoms in India===
In 1991, J.K. Chemicals Group asked the [[Bombay]] office of Lintas Bombay to develop a campaign for a new [[condom]] brand. The problem was that in the late 1940s, the [[Nehru]] government had launched a major population limitation program to reduce India's birthrate. The program was very heavy-handed, using coercion, and demanding that men use condoms.  The product therefore signified an oppressive governmental intrusion.  The agency head hit on the idea of a pleasurable condom, "So when the user hears the brand name, he says, "Wow. It's a turn on. Not a turn off."  A brainstorming session hit on the name "[[KamaSutra (brand)|KamaSutra]]", which refers to [[Kama Sutra|an ancient Sanskrit treatise on lovemaking]] and the sculptures at temples that illustrate the positions involved.  The term was known to well-educated Indians, and that was the intended audience.  Correctly predicting the huge impact the ad campaign would have, the agency purchased all the advertising space in the popular glamour magazine ''[[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]]'' and filled it with erotic images of [[Bollywood]] actors and actresses promoting KamaSutra condoms. A television commercial followed featuring a steamy shower scene. The television ad was censored but the print campaign proved highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William M. | year = 2008 | title = Advertising in India | url = | journal = Advertising &amp; Society Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mazzarella, ''Shoveling Smoke: Advertising and Globalization in Contemporary India'' (Duke University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benetton===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Priest Benetton Nun.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Nun and Priest kissing in a Benetton United Colours advert]] --&gt;
The Italian clothing company [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention in the late 20th century for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' (2007) pp 146–49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brooke shields calvin klein jeans.jpg|left|thumb|268x268px|Calvin Klein advert featuring Brooke Shields]] --&gt;

===Calvin Klein - sex and jeans===
[[Calvin Klein]] of '''Calvin Klein [[Jeans]]''' has been at the forefront of this movement to use sex in advertising, having claimed, "Jeans are about sex. The abundance of bare flesh is the last gasp of advertisers trying to give redundant products a new identity." Calvin Klein's first controversial jeans advertisement showed a 15-year-old [[Brooke Shields]], in Calvin Klein jeans, saying, "Do you want to know what gets between me and my Calvins? Nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sischy |first=Ingrid |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/04/calvin200804?currentPage=7 |title=Vanity Fair Calvin Klein |publisher=Vanityfair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calvin Klein]] has also received media attention for its controversial advertisements in the mid-1990s. Several of Calvin Klein's advertisements featured images of teenage models, some "who were reportedly as young as 15" in overly sexual and provocative poses.&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm Calvin Klein: A Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521174126/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm |date=2012-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Klein insisted that these advertisements were not pornographic, some considered the campaign as a form of "[[soft porn]]" or "[[kiddie porn]]" that was exploitative, shocking, and suggestive. In 1999, Calvin Klein was the subject of more controversy when it aired advertisements of young children who were only wearing the brand's underwear. This "kiddie underwear ad campaign" was pulled only one day after it aired as a result of public outlash.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Robert. [http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html "Kiddie Porn" Controversy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074812/http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html |date=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson from Calvin Klein insisted that these ads were intended "to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you find in a family snapshot."&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"/&gt;

==Effectiveness==

===Effective use===
Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm, has reported that in more than 50 years of testing advertising effectiveness, it has found the use of the erotic to be a significantly above-average technique in communicating with the marketplace, "...although one of the more dangerous for the advertiser. Weighted down with taboos and volatile attitudes, sex is a Code Red advertising technique ... handle with care ... seller beware; all of which makes it even more intriguing." This research has led to the popular idea that ''"sex sells"''.&lt;ref name="Sex sells"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession|last=Streitmatter|first=Roger|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing strategies centred around sex have been successful. [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] used sex to market their brand in a variety of ways, including store greeters dressed only in underwear, models working in store and topless models on the bags. Employees were hired based on physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/07/abercrombie-and-fitch-hollister-sexual-marketing/70934572/|title=Cover up! Abercrombie &amp; Fitch says sexual marketing is over|website=USA today|last1=Bowerman|first1=Mary|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was aimed at teenagers and young adults, who are the most impressionable consumer group, and who have vast amounts of disposable money. During the late 1990s, the company produced a magazine/catalogue (magalog), featuring semi-nude or nude models. The magalog was a success, with A&amp;F issuing over 1.5 million copies. Despite being somewhat paradoxical, the use of sexual branding raised their revenue from $85 million in 1993 to $1.35 billion in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Message Communication in Advertising: Selling the Abercrombie and Fitch Image|url=https://www.uwlax.edu/urc/jur-online/PDF/2005/driessen.pdf|journal=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research VIII|last1=Driessen|first1=Claire|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;F have expressed that they will move away from sexual marketing, and focus on showcasing product and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/shirts-boys-abercrombie-says-its-done-sexualized-marketing-164300|title=Shirts on, Boys.

Sexuality in advertising is extremely effective at attracting the consumer's attention and once it has their attention, to remember the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=James|last2=McClelland|first2=Alastair|last3=Furnham|first3=Adrian|date=2015-03-01|title=Sex Really Does Sell: The Recall of Sexual and Non-sexual Television Advertisements in Sexual and Non-sexual Programmes|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210–216|doi=10.1002/acp.3095|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solves the greatest problem in advertising of getting the potential buyer to look at and remember the advertisement. However the introduction of attraction and especially sexuality into an ad often distracts from the original message and can cause an adverse effect of the consumer wanting to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6040|title=Sexual Content and Advertising Effectiveness: Comments on Belch Et Al.

=== Ineffective use ===

There are some studies that contradict the theory that sex is an effective tool for improving finances and gathering attention. A study from 2009 found that there was a negative correlation between nudity and sexuality in movies, and box office performance and critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/aca-3-4-200.pdf |title=Sex Doesn't Sell—Nor Impress!

It is hypothesized by that survey, that this is a result of a general numbing caused by over use of [[sexual stimuli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencemarketing.com/2005/10/25/sex-in-ads-does-not-sell/ |title=Sex in ads does not sell |publisher=Emergencemarketing.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in advertising.

In another experimental study conducted on 324 undergraduate college students, [[Brad Bushman]] examined brand recall for neutral, sexual or violent commercials embedded in neutral, sexual or violent TV programs. He found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral TV programs and neutral commercials versus those who saw sexual or violent commercials embedded in sexual or violent TV programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushman|first=Brad|title=That was a great commercial, but what were they selling?

Unless sex is related to the product (such as beauty, health or hygiene products) there is not clear effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/magazine-trends-study-finds-increase-in-advertisements-using-sex/|title=Magazine trends study finds increase in advertisements using sex|date=2012-06-05|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7624485|title=Violence and Sex in Television Programs Do Not Sell Products in Advertisements|date=2012-06-05|publisher=researchgate.net|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using sex may attract one market demographic while repelling another at the same time.  The overt use of sexuality to promote [[breast cancer awareness]], through fundraising campaigns like "I Love Boobies" and "Save the Ta-tas", is effective at reaching younger women, who are at low risk of developing breast cancer, but angers and offends some breast [[cancer survivor]]s and older women, who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/30/patients-decry-sexualization-of-breast-cancer/1630911/ |title=Sexy breast cancer campaigns anger many patients|last=Szabo|first=Lisa|date=30 October 2012 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Recent research indicates that the use of sexual images of females in ads negatively affects women's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-women-sexually-explicit-ads-unappealingunless.html#inlRlv |title=Women find sexually explicit ads unappealing—unless the price is right |publisher=medicalxpress.com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that females were more likely than males to be portrayed as nude, wearing sexual clothing or only a partial amount of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soley|first=Lawrence|year=1986|title=Sex in Advertising: A Comparison of 1964 and 1984 Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=15|issue=3|pages=46–64|via=|doi=10.1080/00913367.1986.10673018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 2013 of how printed ads with sexual content affects women clearly showed that women are not attracted to them except in the case of products being luxurious and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sex-doesnt-sell-this-study-into-womens-response-to-raunchy-advertising-starts-wrong-and-gets-worse-8995776.html |title=Sex doesn't sell?

Further research &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=J|year=2008|title=Gender-related reactions to gratuitous sex appeals in advertising|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Advertising|volume=18|pages=62–78|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2007.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that men have a positive attitude to sexual adverts, whereas women have a negative response to them, this study used an advert with both a male and female. This was thought to be because women had lower average [[sex drive]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s than men. Another theory for this difference is that evolution has led men to seek casual sex, contrary to women who value commitment and intimacy in the context of a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herold|year=1993|title=Gender differences in casual sex and AIDS prevention: A survey of dating bars.|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=30|pages=36–42|via=|doi=10.1080/00224499309551676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adverts sex tends to be represented in its own right and not as part of a relationship leading to the difference in responses. This theory is supported by research which found that women respond less negatively to sexual adverts when it is in the context of gift giving from a man to a women. Therefore, react less negatively when the sexuality of the advert is the context of commitment. Men respond more negatively to the sexual advert when it involves gift giving as it emphasises them having to spend money in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren|year=2009|title=Sex in advertising: Gender differences and the role of relationship commitment|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=36|issue=2|pages=215–231|via=|doi=10.1086/597158|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.2353}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with evolutionary theory that women value men for their resources and men value women for sex and fertility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|year=1989|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=12|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research found that even in men recall of the advert is worsened by sexual content, as they focus on breasts and legs but not on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nudd|year=2005|title=Does sex really sell?|url=|journal=Adweek|volume=46|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
In order to be consistent, brands use standardized campaigns across various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argawal|first=Wadhu|year=1995|title=Review of a 40-year debate in international advertising: Practitioner and academician perspectives to the standardization/adaptation issue|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=12|pages=26–48|doi=10.1108/02651339510080089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural differences have been found in response to sexual adverts. A 2016 study by the Korea Internet Advertising Foundation (KIAF) noted that 94.5% of South Korean high schoolers were familiar with sex-driven ads, 83.4% of adults thought such ads have negative influence on society, and 91.2% said there are too many of such ads. A KIAF official noted that government legislation aimed to reduce such ads is not effective due to its ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreabizwire.com/internet-ads-with-sexual-imagery-at-a-critical-level-survey/65968?platform=hootsuite|title=Internet Ads with Sexual Imagery at a Critical Level: Survey {{!}} Be Korea-savvy|website=koreabizwire.com|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has found that sex is used in adverts more in [[France]] than in the [[United States]] because they are more sexually liberated and so receptive to its use in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biswas|year=1992|title=A comparison of print advertisements from the United States and France|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=21|issue=4|pages=73–81|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In the [[21st century]], the use of increasingly explicit sexual imagery in consumer-oriented print ads have become almost commonplace.  Ads for jeans, [[perfume]]s and many other products have featured provocative images that were designed to elicit sexual responses from as large a cross section of the population as possible, to shock by their ambivalence, or to appeal to repressed sexual desires, which are thought to carry a stronger emotional load.  Increased tolerance, more tempered censorship, emancipatory developments and increasing buying power of previously neglected appreciative target groups in rich markets (mainly in the West) have led to a marked increase in the share of attractive flesh 'on display'.

''[[Advertising Age|Ad Age]]'', a magazine delivering news, analysis, and data on marketing and media, published a list of Top 100 most effective advertising of the century, out of the 100, only 8 involved use of sex.&lt;ref name=Garfield&gt;{{cite news |author=Garfield, Bob |date=29 March 1999 |title=Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the Century |url=http://adage.com/century/campaigns.html |newspaper=Ad Age|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unruly Media's viral video tracker lists the Top-20 most viewed car commercial viral videos. Only 1 uses sex, while the No.1 spot was held by VW's "The Force" ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top-20 most popular car commercials |url=http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/8/17/top-20-most-popular-car-commercials.html |publisher=Unruly Media |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811141649/http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/8/17/top-20-most-popular-car-commercials.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall top-spot (across all product segments), was held by VW's "Fun Theory" campaign, the most viewed viral video as of October 2011.

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in television advertising in [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], and the [[United States]] reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Michelle R. | last2 = Paek | first2 = Hye-Jin | year = 2008 | title = Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries | url = | journal = International Journal of Advertising | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 715–744 | doi=10.2501/s0265048708080281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, sex in advertising has focused on heterosexual gender roles, but there are increasing examples of sex being used to advertise to the [[LGBT]] community. The New Zealand Aids Foundation's Love Your Condom (LYC) campaign used provocative images of males alongside captions such as "Riding hard?", "Bear hunting?" and "Going deep?", followed by the hashtag #loveyourcondom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loveyourcondom.co.nz/condoms|title=Order free condoms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped by using images explicitly directed towards homosexual men, their use of condoms would increase, which would help decrease rates of HIV transmission amongst gay and bisexual men. The campaign has been successful, with a 12% in new [[HIV]] infections among [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation |title=History of NZAF |url=https://www.nzaf.org.nz/about-us/history-of-nzaf/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Georgia in 2003, researchers looked at sexual advertisements in magazines over the span of the last 30 years. The rate at which sex in advertising is being used increased from 15% to 27% in the advertisements that the researchers looked at. Their reasoning behind the increase is because they believe sex still sells, specifically with “low-risk products impulse purchases.” The study also mentions “alcohol, entertainment and beauty are the main product categories that use sex in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2649-sex-sells-more.html|title=Why Sex Sells…More Than Ever|newspaper=Business News Daily|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Stereotypes===
The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to reinforce sexist stereotypes. Since the late 1970s, many researchers have determined that advertisements depict women as having less social power than men, but the ways in which females are displayed as less powerful than men have evolved over time. In modern times, advertisements have displayed women's expanding roles in the professional realm and importance in business backgrounds. However, as this change occurred there has been a substantial increase in the number of images that showcase women as less sexually powerful than men and as objects of men's desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankiewicz and Rosselli|first1=Julie and Francine|title=Women as Sex Objects and Victims in Print Advertisements|journal=Sex Roles|date=2008|issue=58.7|pages=579–589|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9359-1|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification ===

Furthermore, sex in advertising has been criticised for its emphasis on the importance of physical attractiveness and role as mate. This emphasis has led men and women to value intelligence and general skills less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Society|last=Pardun|first=Carol|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise in awareness of sexism portrayed in these types of adverts has led to stricter advertising policies. One group that enforces these rules is the [[Advertising Women of New York]] association. Adverts using highly sexual images containing nudity and unrealistic physiques can lead to self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|year=2004|title=Mere exposure:effects of priming a state of self-objectification|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|pages=17–28|via=|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000032306.20462.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this can lead to shame, disgust, appearance anxiety, eating disorders and depression. The increase in self-objectification caused by the use of sex in advertising has been found in women and men. The latter is not surprising with the increased sexual portrayal of men in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichart|first=Tom|year=1999|title=Cheesecake and beefcake: No matter how you slice it, sexual explicitness in advertising continues to increase.|url=|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=76|pages=7–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social norms ===

Sex in advertising is an accepted marketing technique however it is not unusual for it to cause backlash when it breaks social norms. In 1995, the Calvin Klein advertising campaign (see section on Calvin Klein, above) that showed teenage models in provocative poses wearing Calvin Klein underwear and jeans was deemed inappropriate and shocking. The ads were withdrawn when parents and child welfare groups threatened to protest and Hudson stores did not want their stores associated with the ads. It was reported that the [[US Justice Department]] was investigating the ad campaign for possible violations of federal child pornography and exploitation laws. The Justice Department subsequently decided not to prosecute Calvin Klein for these alleged violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-16/business/fi-3736_1_calvin-klein|title=Justice Department Plans No Charges Over Calvin Klein Ads|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1995-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skyy Vodka ===
[[Skyy Vodka]] is known for using sex in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epowers1.blogspot.com/2012/02/i-think-we-can-all-agree-with-statement.html|title=Liz's Media Criticism Blog: Skyy Ad Campaign Sells More Than Just Vodka|last=Powers|first=Liz|date=2012-02-16|website=Liz's Media Criticism Blog|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} In a specific Skyy Vodka advertisement, which was a part of Skyy Vodkas “SKYY SEXY” campaign in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100928006244/en/CORRECTING-REPLACING-Skyy-Spirits-Unveils-Sexiest-Ad|title=CORRECTING and REPLACING Skyy Spirits Unveils Sexiest Ad Campaign in SKYY® Vodka History    {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2016-12-12|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a woman's legs are wrapped around a bottle of Skyy Vodka. Bruce Lee Livingston, of the [[Marin Institute]] stated “This is just ridiculous, It’s a porn-a-hol”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-09-28-vodka28_ST_N.htm|title=Skyy pushes the envelope with sexy ad campaign - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to mention its affect on underage kids. “Underage kids will look at this and associate sexual prowess with drinking Skyy.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Skyy Vodka’s marketing director, Maura McGinn, defended the advertisement by stating, “It’s the content of our product...We’re an adult product consumed mostly in the evenings and in flirtatious situations.” McGinn even defended the advertisement when pitted against the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. ad code that states, “Beverage alcohol advertising and marketing materials should not rely upon sexual prowess or sexual success as a selling point for the brand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discus.org/responsibility/code/|title=Code of Responsible Practices {{!}} DISCUS|website=www.discus.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn stated “There is nothing in our ad that would suggest we are making such a claim.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Steller's sea ape''' (''Simnia marina danica''&lt;ref&gt;A number of scientific names were proposed for the creature, but none has gained modern-day acceptance: "''Siren cynodephala'', given by [[Johann Julius Walbaum]] in 1792; ''Trichechus hydropithecus'', suggested by [[George Shaw]] in 1800; and ''Manatus simia'', proposed by [[Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger]] prior to 1811." Eberhardt, 2002, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;) is an unconfirmed [[marine life|marine]] [[animal]] described from a single sighting by explorer [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]] on August 10, 1741, in waters off the [[Shumagin Islands]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Stejneger, Georg Wilhelm Steller (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1936), pp. 278–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002&gt;George Eberardt (2002). Mysterious Creatures. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], {{ISBN|1-57607-283-5}}, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only animal described by Steller that has not been corroborated by physical evidence or other witnesses.{{fact|date=June 2018}} 

==Description==
Georg Wilhelm Steller (1709-1746) was a German naturalist known for his work in Russia and Alaska. He described many species of plants and animals, including [[Steller's eider]], [[Steller's jay]], [[Steller's sea eagle]] and the extinct [[Steller's sea cow]]. 

In his roughly two-hour encounter with the sea ape,&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002/&gt; Steller wrote that was able to observe the animal from as close as about 16 feet (4 meters). He described the animal as about 5&amp;nbsp;ft (~1.5&amp;nbsp;m) long with a head similar to that of a [[dog]].&lt;ref name=Stellar1742/&gt; It had large eyes, pointed, erect ears, and long whiskers that he likened to a human [[moustache]].&lt;ref name=Stellar1742/&gt; Its tail resembled that of a [[shark]] in that the upper lobe was larger than the lower, but it had no forefeet or forefins.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002/&gt; Its body was covered with thick grayish hair, but its abdomen was reddish-white.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002/&gt; Steller recalled that it resembled an animal illustrated by [[Conrad Gessner]] which had been called ''Simia marina'',  [[Latin language|Latin]] for "sea ape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frost | first = O.W. | year = 1993  |title = Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741-1742 | publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | isbn = 0-8047-2181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steller wrote that the animal was capable of raising its front end out of the water for several minutes at a time to observe the ship, and engaged in an amusing [[juggling]] behavior with a piece of seaweed.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, O.W. 2003. ''Bering: The Russian Discovery of America''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-10059-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steller attempted to shoot the animal with a gun but missed. 

The ship's log did not note the sea ape encounter,{{fact|date=June 2018}} and Steller's 1742 governmental report made no mention of it.&lt;ref name=Thaler/&gt; nor did his'' De Bestiis Marinis'' (‘The Beasts of the Sea’). However, he did describe the sea ape in his travel diary, published posthumously as ''Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741-1742''&lt;ref name=Stellar1742&gt;Georg Willhelm Stellar (1742, 1793). ''Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741-1742'' (O. Frost, editor; Margaritt Engel, translator), [[Stanford University Press]], p. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Sailor [[Miles Smeeton]] records an entry in his book ''Misty Islands'' of an encounter with an animal while sailing in the Aleutian Islands in 1969. His description is remarkably similar to Steller's.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002/&gt; It was seen by Smeeton, his daughter and a friend. They had no idea what the animal was at the time, but after reading the description by Steller some time later, they felt it closely matched their own observations.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Smeeton, The Misty Islands (London: George Harrap, 1969), pp. 109–110;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
According to biographer Dean Littlepage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Littlepage | first = D. | year = 2006 | title = Steller's Island: Adventures of a Pioneer Naturalist in Alaska | publisher = The Mountaineers Books | isbn = 1-59485-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a young [[Northern fur seal]] appears to be the most likely explanation for the sighting. Their forelimbs are set far enough behind on their torso so that they could have been obscured below the waterline, and the "shark-like" tail of the creature may have been the animal's hind flippers. Steller had already been familiar with fur seals, but Littlepage suggests that the poor lighting conditions during the lengthiest encounter of a probable juvenile fur seal could account for the misidentification.&lt;ref&gt;Littlepage, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible explanations have been proposed:&lt;ref name=Eberhardt2002/&gt; a stray [[Hydrurga leptonyx]] (Leopard seal) or [[Monachus schauinslandi]] (Hawaiian monk seal), which generally match Stellar's description and physical behavior for the sea ape but both have visible ears and their habitat is far from Alaska; or a [[Enhydra lutris]] (sea otter), though Stellar was familiar with them and they are much smaller than the reported dimensions of the sea ape.

Another possibility is that the sea ape did not exist and that ''Simnia marina danica'', or Danish sea ape, was simply a vengeful caricature of the Danish captain of the ship, [[Vitus Bering]]. Andrew Thaler, an ecologist, argues this explanation is supported by several factors: Steller's contentious relationship with Bering; Bering being the only Dane on the ship; the sea ape's reported long whisker's (similar to Bering's facial hair); and the creature's omission from Steller's official reports.&lt;ref name=Thaler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thaler|first1=Andrew|title=The Secret History Behind Steller’s Sea Ape|url=http://theportalist.com/the-secret-history-behind-stellers-sea-ape/|website=The Portalist|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">The '''surgical sieve''' is a thought process in [[medicine]]. It is a typical example of how to organise a structured examination answer for [[medical students]] and [[physician]]s when they are challenged with a question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.bmj.com/back_issues/0602/education/ed6.html sBMJ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a way of constructing answers to questions from [[patients]] and their relatives in a logical manner, and structuring articles and reference texts in medicine. Some textbooks put emphasis on using the surgical sieve as a basic structure of [[diagnosis]] and management of illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Oral diagnosis - the clinician's guide, W. Birnbaum, S. M. Dunne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Aird's Companion in Surgical Studies (3rd edn). K. Burnand, A. Young, J. Lucas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surgical Talk: Revision In Surgery, A. Goldberg, G. Stansby&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medicine and Surgery: a concise textbook, G. Kendall, K.Y. Shiu, S. L. Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingmedicine.com Thinking Medicine: Structure Your Knowledge for Success in Medical Exams, C. Koppel, A. Naparus]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Although there are several versions around the world with slight variations, the surgical sieve usually consist of the following types of process in the human body in any particular order:

* [[Congenital]]
* Acquired
** [[Vascular disease|Vascular]]
** [[Infection|Infective]]
** [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]tic
** [[Autoimmune disease|Autoimmune]]
** [[Metabolism|Metabolic]]
** [[Inflammation|Inflammatory]]
** [[Neurological]]
** [[Neoplasm|Neoplastic]]
** [[Degenerative disease|Degenerative]]
** [[Environmental disease|Environmental]]
** [[Idiopathic|Unknown]]
A more extensive, and perhaps more concise mechanism of employing the surgical sieve is using the mnemonic MEDIC HAT PINE:
* Metabolic (conditions relating to metabolism, biochemistry, and the like)
* Endocrinological (conditions relating to the various secretory systems within the body)
* Degenerative (conditions relating to age-related destruction of tissue, or stress-related destruction of tissue)
* Inflammatory/Infective (conditions that primarily present in a way that involves the profane activation of the immune system)
* Congenital (conditions present at birth)
* Haematological (conditions relating to the blood system, in one way or another)
* Autoimmune (conditions relating to the inappropriate activation of the immune system, in one of many ways)
* Traumatic (conditions relating to a physical response between two or more objects)
* Psychological/Neurological (conditions relating to the nervous system, in one way or another – whether that be the CNS or the PNS)
* Idiopathic/iatrogenic (conditions without a known cause, or without a known cause outside of medical intervention)
* Neoplastic (conditions relating to cancers)
* Environmental (conditions relating to exposures, and dose-response relationships thereof)

== Examples ==
What are the causes of an acute [[Mental confusion|confusional state]] in a patient?
# Treatment induced: [[polypharmacy]], sedatives, analgesics, steroids, drug withdrawal
# Vascular: [[stroke]], [[Transient ischemic attack|TIA]], [[vascular dementia]]
# Inflammatory: infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome
# Traumatic: head injury, [[Intracranial hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]
# Autoimmune: thyroid disease
# Metabolic: [[electrolyte imbalance]], [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[hypoglycaemia]], [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone|SIADH]]
# Infective: [[sepsis]], local infection
# Neoplastic: [[brain tumour]], [[carcinomatosis]]
# Degenerative: [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[dementia]]

What are the causes of [[splenomegaly]]?
# Idiopathic: [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
# Vascular: [[portal vein obstruction]], [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]], [[haemoglobinopathies]] ([[Sickle-cell disease]], [[thalassemia]])
# Infective: [[AIDS]], [[mononucleosis]], [[septicaemia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[malaria]], [[infective endocarditis]]
# Traumatic: [[haematoma]], [[wikt:rupture|rupture]]
# Autoimmune: [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]
# Metabolic: [[Gaucher's disease]], [[mucopolysaccharidoses]], [[amyloidosis]], [[Tangier disease]]
# Inflammatory: [[sarcoidosis]]
# Neoplastic: [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], [[metastases]], [[myeloproliferative disorder]]s

== Pathologic Basis Of Disease ==
Robbins ''Pathologic Basis Of Disease&lt;ref&gt;Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, R. S. Cotran, V. Kumar, T. Collins&lt;/ref&gt;'' is an internationally used reference textbook in [[pathology]]. Its chapters under the heading 'General Pathology' can be considered to be a version of the surgical sieve:

3. Acute and chronic ''inflammation''&lt;br /&gt;
4. Tissue Repair&lt;br /&gt;
5. ''Hemodynamic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
6. ''Genetic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
7. Diseases of ''Immunity''&lt;br /&gt;
8. ''Neoplasia''&lt;br /&gt;
9. ''Infectious Diseases''&lt;br /&gt;
10. ''Environmental and Nutritional'' Pathology

==In popular culture==
The surgical sieve is frequently used by [[Gregory House]], who is a physician in the TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/house/ FOX Broadcasting Company: House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523030504/http://www.fox.com/house/ |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to diagnose the rare diseases that his patients are suffering from. In some episodes various forms of the surgical sieve are scribbled on to House's whiteboard while his team struggle to diagnose difficult cases. In the episode [[Paternity (House)|'Paternity']] the mnemonic 'MIDNIT' is used to run through the sieve (metabolic, inflammation, degenerative, neoplastic, infection, trauma).

Technosignatures are analogous to the [[biosignatures]] that signal the presence of life, whether or not intelligent.&lt;ref name=tarter-2018 /&gt;  Some authors prefer to exclude radio transmissions from the definition,&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such restrictive usage is not widespread.
[[Jill Tarter]] has proposed that the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) be renamed "the search for technosignatures".&lt;ref name="tarter-2018" /&gt;
Various types of technosignatures, such as [[radiation leakage]] from [[megascale engineering|megascale]] [[astroengineering]] installations such as [[Dyson sphere]]s, the light from an extraterrestrial [[ecumenopolis]], or [[Shkadov thrusters]] with the power to alter the orbits of stars around the [[Galactic Center]], may be detectable with [[hypertelescope]]s.  Some examples of technosignatures are described in [[Paul Davies]]'s 2010 book ''[[The Eerie Silence]]'', although the terms "technosignature" and "technomarker" do not appear in the book.

==Astroengineering projects==
A Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms dwelling in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], would cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, [[Freeman Dyson]] selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his 1960 paper on the subject.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date= 1960|url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM|title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= Freemann J.

From 2005, [[Fermilab]] has conducted an ongoing survey for such spectra, analyzing data from the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]].&lt;ref name=carrigan&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=Dick| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere |title='&amp;#39;Dyson sphere'&amp;#39; at Scholarpedia |publisher=Scholarpedia.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which remain unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; In October 2012, astronomer [[Geoff Marcy]], one of the pioneers of the search for [[extrasolar planets]], was given a research grant to search data from the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' telescope, with the aim of detecting possible signs of Dyson spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/10/05/grants-help-scientists-explore-border-between-science-science-fiction/ |title=Grants help scientists explore boundary between science &amp; science fiction |publisher=Newscenter.berkeley.edu |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shkadov thrusters, with the hypothetical ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as [[molecular cloud|cold molecular cloud]]s or [[impact event|cometary impact]]s, would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the [[transit method|transiting]] extrasolar planets searched by ''Kepler''. Unlike planets, though, the thrusters would appear to abruptly stop over the surface of a star rather than crossing it completely, revealing their technological origin.&lt;ref name=Villard2013&gt;{{Cite web | title = Alien 'Star Engine' Detectable in Exoplanet Data? | url = http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/planet-searches-might-stumble-across-an-alien-stellar-engine-130625.htm | date = 2013 | author = Villard, Ray | accessdate = 2013-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence of targeted extrasolar [[asteroid mining]] may also reveal extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1103.5369|author1=Duncan Forgan|author2=Martin Elvis|title=Extrasolar Asteroid Mining as Forensic Evidence for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|date=2011|doi=10.1017/S1473550411000127|volume=10|issue=4|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=307–313|bibcode=2011IJAsB..10..307F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary analysis==

===Artificial heat and light===
Various astronomers, including [[Avi Loeb]] of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and [[Edwin Turner]] of [[Princeton University]] have proposed that artificial light from extraterrestrial planets, such as that originating from cities, industries, and transport networks, could be detected and signal the presence of an advanced civilization. Such approaches, though, make the assumption that the radiant energy generated by civilization would be relatively clustered and can therefore be detected easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2011/11/03/SETI-search-urged-to-look-for-city-lights/UPI-89301320361336/#ixzz2HRkOcctY |title=SETI search urged to look for city lights |publisher=UPI.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Planets: Formation, Detection and Dynamics Rudolf Dvorak, page 14 John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Light and heat detected from planets must be distinguished from natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of intelligent life on a planet.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; For example, NASA's 2012 ''Black Marble'' experiment showed that significant stable light and heat sources on Earth, such as chronic wildfires in arid [[Western Australia]], originate from uninhabited areas and are naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/aus-fires.html |title=Wildfires Light Up Western Australia |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric analysis===
Atmospheric analysis of planetary atmospheres, as is already done on various Solar System bodies and in a rudimentary fashion on several [[hot Jupiter]] extrasolar planets, may reveal the presence of chemicals produced by technological civilizations.&lt;ref name=choi-2012 /&gt; For example, atmospheric emissions from industry on Earth, including [[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, are detectable from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Satellite_sniffs_out_chemical_traces_of_atmospheric_pollution |title=Satellite sniffs out chemical traces of atmospheric pollution / Observing the Earth / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial pollution may therefore be detectable on extrasolar planets. However, there remains a possibility of mis-detection; for example, the [[atmosphere of Titan]] has detectable signatures of complex chemicals that are similar to what on Earth are industrial pollutants, though obviously not the byproduct of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21470-saturn-moon-titan-haze-cassini.html |title=Haze on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Similar to Earth's Pollution |publisher=Space.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SETI scientists have proposed searching for artificial atmospheres created by planetary engineering to produce habitable environments for colonisation by an ETI.&lt;ref name=choi-2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/18624-alien-life-search-hairspray.html |title=Alien Hairspray May Help Us Find E.T. |publisher=Space.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial artifacts and spacecraft==
{{see also|Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact#Extraterrestrial artifacts}}

=== Spacecraft ===
[[Interstellar spacecraft]] may be detectable from hundreds to thousands of [[light-year]]s away through various forms of radiation, such as the [[photon]]s emitted by an [[antimatter rocket]] or [[cyclotron radiation]] from the interaction of a magnetic sail with the [[interstellar medium]]. Such a signal would be easily distinguishable from a natural signal and could hence firmly establish the existence of extraterrestrial life were it to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Detection of Extraterrestrial Civilizations via the Spectral Signature of Advanced Interstellar Spacecraft | publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | author=Zubrin, Robert | editor=Shostak, Seth | booktitle=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | date=1995 | conference=Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | pages=487–496 | bibcode=1995ASPC...74..487Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, smaller [[Bracewell probe]]s within the Solar System itself may also be detectable by means of optical or radio searches.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998

=== Satellites ===
A less advanced technology, and one closer to humanity's current technological level, is the Clarke Exobelt proposed by Astrophysicist Hector Socas-Navarro of the [[Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dorminey |first1=Bruce |title=NASA's TESS Telescope May Spot Alien Geo-Satellites, Say Astronomers |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/02/24/nasas-tess-telescope-could-detect-belt-of-alien-geo-satellites-says-new-paper/#36256f8e4eb4 |website=Forbes |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothetical belt would be formed by all the artificial [[satellite]]s occupying [[geostationary]]/[[geosynchronous]] orbits around an [[exoplanet]]. Simulations suggest that a very dense satellite belt (requiring only a moderately more-advanced civilization than ours) would be detectable with existing technology in the [[Light curve|light curves]] from [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transiting]] exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Possible Photometric Signatures of Moderately Advanced Civilizations: The Clarke Exobelt|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=855|issue=2|pages=110|arxiv=1802.07723|author=Hector Socas-Navarro|date=2018-02-21|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aaae66|bibcode=2018ApJ...855..110S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific projects searching for technosignatures==
One of the first attempts to search for Dyson Spheres was made by Vyacheslav Slysh from the Space Research Institute in Moscow in 1985 using data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;Alien megaprojects: The hunt has begun New Scientist 09 April 2013 by Stephen Battersby&lt;/ref&gt;

Another search for technosignatures, circa 2001, involved an analysis of data from the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] for traces of anti-matter, which, besides one "intriguing spectrum probably not related to SETI", came up empty.&lt;ref name="harris-2001" /&gt;

In 2005, [[Fermilab]] had an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from IRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson Sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson Sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere ''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"/&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting planetary-sized artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. He showed that such technosignature was within the reach of space missions aimed at detecting exoplanets by the [[transit method]], as were ''Corot'' or ''Kepler'' projects at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Luc F. A. Arnold, 2005, Transit Light-Curve Signatures of Artificial Objects http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2005ApJ...627..534A&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the detection remains applicable for the future exoplanets missions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite TESS.] NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CHEOPS CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite http://cheops.unibe.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/plato/ PLATO PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars]. ESA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a trio of astronomers led by Jason Wright started a two-year search for Dyson Spheres, aided by grants from the [[Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="UT-2013" /&gt;

In 2013, Geoff Marcy received funding to use data from the [[Kepler Telescope]] to search for Dyson Spheres and interstellar communication using lasers,&lt;ref name="SMH-2013" /&gt; and [[Lucianne Walkowicz]] received funding to detect artificial signatures in stellar photometry.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131022101358/http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2012/10/04/new-frontiers-in-astronomy-the-research-grant-winners/]

Starting in 2016, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of [[UCLA]] has been searching for technosignatures with large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name="UT-2018" /&gt;

'''Transition Engineering''' is the professional engineering discipline that deals with the application of the principles of science to the design, innovation and adaptation of engineered systems that meet the needs of today without compromising the ecological, societal and economic systems on which future generations depend to meet their own needs. Just as [[safety]] considerations are incorporated into design parameters in all engineering fields, [[sustainability]] thinking is built into Transition Engineering. Transition engineering is emerging as a field to give engineers the tools necessary to address sustainability in design and management of engineered systems. Transition engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that addresses the issues of future resource availability and identifies, then realizes opportunities to increase [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].

== Overview ==

Engineering professions emerge when new technologies, new problems or new opportunities arise. This was the case when [[safety engineering]] grew in the early 1900s to combat the high workplace injury and fatality rates. In the 1960s, [[Environmental engineering]] emerged as a discipline to reduce industrial pollution and mitigate impacts on [[environmental health]] and [[water quality]]. [[Quality engineering]] came about with the increase in [[mass production]] techniques during WWII and the need to confirm the quality of the products.

There are two serious problems driving the emergence of Transition Engineering; the exponential growth in the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere]] and the lack of growth and imminent decline of conventional oil production known as [[peak oil]]. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400ppm, a level that Earth has not known for 800,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=carbon_ppm_milestone&gt;{{cite news|last=Montaigne|first=Fen|title=Record 400ppm CO2 milestone 'feels like we're moving into another era'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-400ppm-co2-carbon-emissions|publisher=Guardian Environment Network|accessdate=2013-05-19|location=London|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Transition engineering aims to take advantage of the current access to the remaining lower cost and higher [[EROI]] energy resources to re-develop all aspects of urban and industrial engineered systems to adapt as fossil fuel use is dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first=Susan|title=Transition Engineering of Urban Transportation for Resilience to Peak Oil Risks|journal=ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress|date=2011-11-17|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The idea behind transition engineering has sprouted from many different roots, both technical and non-technical. The concept of [[sustainable development]] has been around since 1987 and the problem of [[sustainability]] was a driving force in the development of transition engineering. The [[Transition Town]] movement provided further inspiration as it showed that there were many groups of people around the world motivated to prepare for [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]]. [[Transition towns]] and [[ecovillages]] demonstrate the need for engineers to build systems that manage un-sustainable risks and provide people with [[sustainable]] options. Engineers are ethically required to "hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public" and answer society's need for sustainable development&lt;ref name=Code_of_ethics&gt;{{cite web|last=National Society of Professional Engineers|title=NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers|url=http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of [[safety engineering]] provided much of the inspiration for transition engineering. At the beginning of the 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire]] in [[New York City]] killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace a safer place to be. This eventually lead to the formation of the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]].&lt;ref name=ASSE_history&gt;{{cite web|last=American Society of Safety Engineering|title=About ASSE -History|url=http://www.asse.org/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As safety engineering manages the risks of unsafe conditions, transition engineering manages the risks of unsustainable conditions. To give engineers a better grasp of sustainability, transition engineering defines the problem as UN-sustainability. This is similar to the problem of un-safe conditions that is the purpose of safety engineering. We do not necessarily know what a perfectly safe system looks like, but we do know what unsafe systems look like and how to improve them; the same applies to unsustainability of systems. By reducing unsustainability issues we take steps in the right direction&lt;ref name=survival_spectrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan|title=The Survival Spectrum, the key to Transition Engineering of Complex Systems|journal=University of Canterbury, Mechanical Engineering|year=2010|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Seven Step Method ==

The Transition Engineering method involves 7 steps to help engineers develop projects to deal with changing unsustainable activities. As a discipline, Transition Engineering recognizes that "Business as Usual" projections of future scenarios from past trends are not valid because the underlying conditions have changed sufficiently from the conditions of the past. For example, the projection of future oil supply in 2050 from data prior to 2005 would give an expectation of a 50% increase in demand over that time-frame. However, the actual production rate of conventional oil has not increased since 2005 and is projected to decline by more than 50% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan |author2=Page, S. |author3=Dantas, A.|title=Urban form and long-term fuel supply decline: A method to investigate the peak oil risks to essential activities|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|year=2010|volume=5|issue=44|pages=306–322|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#History: First, historical data are gathered and historical trends understood in cultural and political contexts. All historical aspects of the system are considered. Transition Engineering investigates the effects that technology and social developments have on energy and resource demand. How did we get to where we are now? Why are we here? What factors put us here?
#Present: This step assesses the current situation. All current capabilities, investments, assets and condition/age of the assets, and liabilities are considered. Energy use is audited and its end-use behavior is assessed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Organisation for Standardisation|title=ISO 500001 Energy Management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso50001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Future: Scenarios from all areas of study are considered to get a consensus view of both inertial trajectories of current trends, and limitations of carrying capacity and resource scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Shift Project|title=Science for Energy Scenarios|url=http://science-and-energy.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transition Engineers apply the science of climate change, petroleum geology, ecology, hydrology etc. to describe the "forward operating environment". Determining the probability of each future outcome creates a future operating environment envelope. This gives engineers and decision makers constraints with varying levels of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Energy Agency|title=IEA Scenarios and Projections|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Energy Information Administration|title=International Energy Outlook|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Path Break Concepts: Innovation takes place in this step when current assumptions about behavior and economics are set aside in favor of consideration of the forward operating environment at the end-point of the time-frame of study. The TE innovator places him/herself in the future and uses the future design constraints to come up with realistic and workable concepts. The path-break concept is not futuring.
#Backcasting: The path break concepts are analysed to see how they differ from the current situation. In this step, the barriers and strategies to change existing systems are also analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=The Natural Step|title=Backcasting|url=http://www.naturalstep.org/backcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Trigger Events: Although existing systems carry a large amount of inertia, if the right trigger is applied at the right time, a great amount of change is possible. Triggers can be either disastrous events such as economic collapse, or external changes such as a corporate merger, new law, or new staff. They can also be engineered change projects. The trigger event for safety engineering was the “Triangle shirtwaist factory fire.” (reference) The challenge is to communicate the advantages and benefits of adaptive change, and to initiate a disruptive event that enables an organization to get out of the rut. See [[Change Management]]
#Shift Projects: Finally, by planning for future supply and demand, change projects are realized to make best use of the current available resources. Through these projects, society will be more resilient to peak oil and climate change events.

== Global Association for Transition Engineering (GATE) ==

GATE opened the first group in the UK in Feb 2014. GATE is a Professional Engineering Institution; a membership association and learned society, and comprises an emerging network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other unsustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame are at odds with most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.&lt;ref name="fishwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/cod/species_pages/atlantic_cod.htm|title=NOAA - FishWatch: Atlantic Cod|publisher=fishwatch.gov|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=International Society of Transition Engineering|title=ISTE|url=http://www.transitionengineering.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016. It is a "Charitable Incorporated Organisation" or CIO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">VOCs ([[volatile organic compounds]]) are a dangerous contaminant of [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]].  They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices.

==Overview==
[[Volatile organic compounds|VOCs]] are responsible for a number of adverse health effects especially for [[breastfeeding|nursing]] and [[pregnant]] mothers.  Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of [[groundwater]] identified these substances in drinking water sources.

==Specific VOCs==
===PCE===
[[Tetrachloroethylene]] is used in metal degreasing and dry cleaning.  It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===TCE===
[[Trichloroethylene]] is used in cleaning metal parts and was widely believed to be harmless before being linked to [[birth defects]]. It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===Toluene===
[[Toluene]] is an organic compound which is mostly harmless to adults and is sometimes abused as an [[inhalant]].  [[Fetal toluene syndrome]] has been defined and resembles [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] with resultant [[birth defects]], but the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have identified differentiating features between the two [[syndrome]]s including FTS having the additional facial features of [[micrognathia]], large anterior [[fontanel]], down-turned mouth  corners, hair patterning abnormalities, bifrontal narrowing of the face, and ear abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. (2004). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis''. Can be downloaded at https://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505061132/http://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Camp Lejeune===
{{Details|Camp Lejeune water contamination}}
U.S. Marine Corps Base [[Camp Lejeune]] was built near [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]] in 1942.  In 1982, the Marine Corps discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in several drinking water wells that fed into two of the eight water systems.  The sources were traced to [[Tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE) from a two dry cleaners - one on base, the other off the base and [[Trichloroethylene]] which had been used in vehicle maintenance on the base.  These problems were addressed but there were concerns with nursing and pregnant mothers who may have been exposed previously.  It wasn't until the late 1990s that the federal government tried to track down people who may have been exposed.

===Love Canal===
{{main|Love Canal}}
[[Love Canal]] was an abandoned canal near [[Niagara Falls, New York]] which was used by the [[U.S. military]] and [[Occidental Petroleum]] as a [[chemical waste]] dumping ground.  Numerous cases of cancer and birth defects were found from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The primary VOC at Love Canal is [[toluene]], which is found along with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s and other [[pollutants]].

===Valley of the Drums===
{{main|Valley of the Drums}}
The [[Valley of the Drums]] is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} toxic waste site in northern Bullitt County, Kentucky, near Louisville, named after the waste-containing drums strewn across the area. Contaminants include 
[[xylene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]], 
[[methylene chloride]],
[[acetone]],
[[phthalates]],
[[anthracene]],
[[toluene]],
[[fluoranthene]],
[[alkyl benzene]],
[[vinyl chloride]],
[[dichloroethylene]], and [[aliphatic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0486009.pdf EPA report on the A. L. TAYLOR SITE  - page 5]
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known as one of the primary motivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">[[File:Dai Jin-Travelers Through Mountain Passes.jpg|thumb|[[Dai Jin]], considered the founder of the school, ''Travellers Through Mountain Passes'']]
The '''Zhe School''' (浙派) was a [[school]] of painters and was part of the Northern School, which thrived during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The school was led by [[Dai Jin]], traditionally considered its founder. The "Zhe" of the name refers to Dai Jin's home province - [[Zhejiang]]. The school was not a school in the proper sense of the word in that the painters did not formulate a new distinctive style, preferring instead to further the style of the [[Southern Song]], specializing in decorative and large paintings. Instead the school was identified by the formal, academic and conservative outlook, being a revival in the early [[Ming Dynasty]] of the Ma-Xia (Ma Yuan 馬遠, Xia Gui 夏珪), 'academic', style of painting landscapes of the Southern Song.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-zhe-school.php&lt;/ref&gt;
