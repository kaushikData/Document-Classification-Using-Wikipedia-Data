[[Image:Aboriginal tracker piper.jpg|thumb|Portrait of 'John Piper', an Aboriginal tracker who accompanied [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] in his expedition across the Great Dividing Range]]

In the years following [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British settlement]] in [[Australia]], '''[[Australian Aborigines|aboriginal]] trackers''' or '''black trackers''', as they became known, were enlisted by settlers to assist them in navigating their way through the Australian landscape. The trackers' [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle gave rise to excellent tracking skills which were advantageous to settlers in assisting them in finding food and water and locating missing persons, capturing [[bushrangers]] and violently dispersing other groups of aboriginals.

The first recorded employment of the services of Aboriginal trackers by Europeans in Australia was in 1791 when [[Watkin Tench]] utilised Eora men Colbee and Balloderry to find a way to the Hawkesbury River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tench|first1=Watkin|title=A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson|date=1793|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1795, an aboriginal guide led Henry Hacking to the Cowpastures area where the lost First Fleet cattle were rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turbet|first1=Peter|title=The First Frontier|date=2011|publisher=Rosenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1802, Dharawal men Gogy, Budbury and Le Tonsure with Gandangara men Wooglemai and Bungin assisted Ensign Francis Barrallier in his explorations into the Blue Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrallier|first1=Francis|title=Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other examples of explorers, squatters, military/paramilitary groups, naval missions, and police utilising aboriginal assistance in tracking down wanted persons.  For instance, in 1834, near [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], two trackers named Mogo and Mollydobbin tracked a missing five-year-old boy for over ten hours through the rough Australian bush.&lt;ref name="ausgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/trackers/ |title=Aboriginal trackers |accessdate=29 December 2008 |publisher=Department of Culture and Recreation (Government of Australia), |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827232231/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/trackers/ |archivedate=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable event occurred in 1864 when Duff children Jane (7), Isaac (9) and Frank (4) Duff, lost for nine days in [[Wimmera]], were found by aboriginal tracker [[Dick-a-Dick]].&lt;ref name="ausgov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Tracking==
When asked how he tracked, Mitamirri, a famous tracker of the early 20th century, said "I never bend down low, just walk slow round and round until I see more."&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, S. (1996) "James, Jimmy [Mitamirri] (1902? - 1945)", ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, Parkville.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 [[Edward Stone Parker]] the Assistant [[Protector of Aborigines]] based at the Loddon Aboriginal Protectorate Station at [[Franklinford, Victoria|Franklinford]], wrote a letter to the Chief Protector reporting on the murder of a native at Joyce's Station (near Newstead). No witness could be found to the murder but the footprints of five men were tracked by the [[Dja Dja Wurrung|Jajowurrong]] to open country south of Mount Macedon (Sunbury region). The trackers there met with another man attached to the Loddon Protectorate Station who was on his return from Melbourne. He told the trackers he had met with the group they were tracking and was able to give a description of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Morrison | first =Edgar | authorlink =  | title =Frontier Life in the Loddon Protectorate | publisher =Daylesford Advocate | year =1967 | location =Daylesford | pages =62 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New South Wales Police Force]] actively engaged Aboriginal Trackers from 1850, attempting to secure Aboriginal Trackers for each of the police districts. By 1867, 52 Aboriginal Trackers were in the employ of the police at a daily rate of 2s 6d (approximately ₤3 17s 6d per month).&lt;ref&gt;NSW State Archives, NRS 10946, Police salary registers&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year, at the height of Bushranger activity in the Goulburn Police District, three mounted Aboriginal Trackers of the [[New South Wales Police Force]] were actively involved in the capture of the [[Clarke brothers]] at Jinden near Braidwood.  Aboriginal Tracker Sir Watkin Wynne (later Sergeant Major Sir Watkin Wynne), led the initial party of police from Fairfield under the command of Senior Constable Wright (later Sub-inspector Wright) to their location at Jinden.  He was seriously injured during the capture and had an arm amputated.  He was awarded ₤120 for his role in the capture.  Two other trackers, who subsequently led other police to the scene, Trackers George Emmott (stationed at Ballalaba) and Thomas (stationed at Major's Creek), secured lesser awards of ₤7 10s.  Tracker George Emmott had previously received an award of ₤30 for the arrest of Pat Connell another member of the gang.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Brennan's handwritten ''Police History of Notorious Bushrangers'' held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney, NSW - A2030  pp270-322, transcribed at http://grafton.nsw.free.fr/mother/pdfs/Brennan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Two members of the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force, Wannamutta and Werannabe, assisted in the capture of [[Ned Kelly]] at [[Glenrowan, Victoria]] in 1880. They had been promised ₤50 reward for Kelly's capture but descendants claimed the two were never paid.&lt;ref&gt;''Koori Mail'', "Tracker descendants to appeal back-pay ruling", 24 September 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 101

==Native Police==
{{main|Native Police Corps}}
[[File:Queensland Native Police.jpg|thumb|Members of the Queensland Native Police who assisted in the search of [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] and his gang]]
A number of Native Police organisations were established throughout Australia during the 19th Century which employed armed and mounted aboriginal trackers under white officers to carry out various duties, the foremost of these being punitive missions against aboriginals who resisted colonial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bottoms|first1=Timothy|title=Conspiracy of Silence|date=2013|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[goldrush]] era, they were also used to patrol goldfields and search for escaped prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/online-exhibitions/nativepolice/background_duties.html|title=Large variety of duties - Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office   Victoria)|website=www.prov.vic.gov.au|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were provided with uniforms, firearms, food rations and a rather dubious salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=L.E.|title=Police of the Pastoral Frontier|date=1975|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 the services of a group of Queensland black police were requested to help track the [[Ned Kelly|Kelly]] gang which were on the run from the Victorian police. Their use was agreed and a party of six native troopers, with a white officer (Sub-Inspector Stanhope O'Conner) reached [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]] about March 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Sadleir | first =John | authorlink =  | title =Recollections of a Victorian Police Officer | publisher =Penguin Colonial Facsimiles | year =1973 | location =Blackburn, Victoria | pages =210 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent and present day use==
In 1941, the [[Northern Territory Special Reconnaissance Unit]] was established to patrol the North Australian coastline for Japanese landings and infiltration, and was primarily composed of Aboriginal soldiers. The [[2/1st North Australia Observer Unit]] ("Nackaroos") performed a similar role, though Aboriginals were a minority in the unit, serving as labourers and trackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gov.au/norforce/Unit_History.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927162337/http://www.army.gov.au/norforce/Unit_History.asp |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present day Australian Army, the [[Regional Force Surveillance Units]] can be seen as a spiritual descendant of the Tracker legacy.

Aboriginal trackers within the Queensland police force wore yellow [[epaulets]] to denote their role. By 2012, only one tracker remained, Lama Lama elder Barry Port. Queensland police do not expect another tracker to replace Port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Peter|title=Hunt for missing miner Bruce Schuler ends era of trackers|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/hunt-for-missing-miner-bruce-schuler-ends-era-of-trackers/story-fndo4ckr-1226427461934|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What kind of history it was that Strabo alludes to, is uncertain.  The so-called [[Aurelius Victor]] quotes the first book of a history of the [[Marsic War]] by Alexander the Ephesian; but this authority is considered doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''Origo Gentis Romanae'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have supposed that this Alexander is the author of the history of the succession of Greek philosophers ({{lang|grc|αἱ τῶν φιλοσόφων διαδοχαί}}), which is often referred to by [[Diogenes Laërtius]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], i. 116, ii. 19, 106, iii. 4, 5, iv. 62, vii. 179, viii. 24, ix. 61&lt;/ref&gt; but this work belonged probably to [[Alexander Polyhistor]].  His geographical poem, of which several fragments are still extant, is frequently referred to by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''s. v.'' {{lang|grc|Λάπηθος}}, {{lang|grc|Ταπροβάνη}}, {{lang|grc|Δῶρος}}, {{lang|grc|Ὑρκανοὶ}}, {{lang|grc|Μελιταία}}, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], ''On [[Dionysius Periegetes]]'' 388, 591&lt;/ref&gt;  Of his astronomical poem a fragment is still extant, which however has also been attributed to [[Alexander Aetolus]], particularly by the scholars [[Thomas Gale]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gale]], ''Addend. ad Parthen.'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Gottlob Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Gottlob Schneider]], ''ad Vitruv.'' ii. p. 23, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is highly probable that [[Cicero]] is speaking of Alexander Lychnus when he mentions an Alexander whom he says is a bad poet, and a careless writer, but whose poems yet possess some factual information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''ad Att.'' ii. 20, 22&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek text of his poem has been edited with a commentary by Christophe Cusset.&lt;ref&gt; In David Sider (ed.), ''Hellenistic Poetry: A Selection'' (Ann Arbor 2017) 56-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amy Bess Williams Miller''' (May 4, 1912 – February 23, 2003) was an American [[historian]], [[preservationist]], [[trustee]], and [[activist|civic leader]] from the cities of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and Pittsfield, [[Massachusetts]]. Best known for leading the effort to preserve [[Hancock Shaker Village]] on the border of Pittsfield and [[Hancock, Massachusetts]] and establish a museum there, she was a major scholar of [[Shaker]] history, society, and artifacts. In addition to serving as the Hancock museum's first president, she was president of the [[Berkshire Athenaeum]], member of the [[Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners]] and [[American Antiquarian Society]], and trustee of [[Berkshire Medical Center]], the [[Berkshire Museum]], [[Miss Hall's School]], the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]], and the [[Shaker Museum and Library]]. Miller's published works all deal with Shaker history and society. She wrote four books and co-edited a fifth, contributed an article to ''The Herbarist'', and contributed to numerous exhibits.

== Biography ==
Amy Bess Williams was born on May 4, 1912, in El Paso, Texas to Dr. Frederick R. Williams and Elizabeth Avery Taft Williams. At the age of five, her family relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts. During the 1920s, Williams gained a reputation as a [[socialite]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and often visited events held by the American Antiquarian Society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achorn|first=Robert C.|date=April 2003|title=Amy Bess Miller|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539550.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society|location=Worcester, Mass|publisher=the Society|volume=113|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the [[University-preparatory school|preparatory]] schools [[Bancroft School]] in Worcester and [[Miss Hall's School]] in Pittsfield, and then attended the [[Sorbonne]], where she specialized in [[art history]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On October 14, 1933, Williams married Lawrence K. "Pete" Miller, who was then editor and publisher of his family's newspaper ''[[The Berkshire Eagle]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Among the wedding presents the couple received was a table made by the [[Shakers]], an American Christian sect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gift is credited with sparking Miller's lifelong interest in the Shakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1944, Miller became president of the Berkshire Athenaeum, a public library in Pittsfield, holding that position until 1979.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_18046501|title=Day 132: Amy Bess Miller|last=Sullivan|first=Brian|date=May 11, 2011|website=[[Berkshire Eagle]]|access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s she led a project to preserve what remained of the Hancock Village, as the few remaining Shakers there planned to leave.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/us/amy-miller-90-a-founder-of-shaker-village.html|title=Amy Miller, 90, a Founder of Shaker Village|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=February 26, 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGfLy6OoZukC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Selling Shaker: The Commodification of Shaker Design in the Twentieth Century|last=Bowe|first=Stephen|last2=Richmond|first2=Peter|publisher=[[Liverpool University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9781846310089|location=Liverpool|pages=125, n. 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project resulted in the transformation of the Village into a museum, which opened in 1960.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=20030226&amp;id=bnohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BooFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6973,6254513&amp;hl=en|title=Amy Bess Miller dies, revamped Shaker site|last=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=February 26, 2003|work=[[The Daily Gazette]]|access-date=May 26, 2016|via=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller served as president of this museum until 1990.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From 1964 to 1970, Miller served on the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, and, in 1972, Miller successfully advocated for the construction of a new library building to house the Berkshire Athenaeum collection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1976, she was inducted into the American Antiquarian Society, to which she contributed regularly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She additionally served as a long-term trustee of Berkshire Medical Center,  the Berkshire Museum, Miss Hall's School, the Massachusetts Audubon Society, and the Shaker Museum and Library.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was also the first woman president of the Pittsfield Community Chest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Miller's husband Lawrence died in 1991. The couple had four children: a daughter Margo and sons Kelton II, Michael, and Mark.

He has published numerous theoretical studies, monographs and exhibition catalogues on the [[Russian avant-garde]], [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[contemporary art]] and European [[abstract art]].
Since the publication of his critical edition of the writings of [[Malevich|Malewicz]] (Malevich) by [[Champ Libre]], Paris 1975, he has engaged in research on the work of this artist and has published the four-volume ''[[Malevich|Kazimir Malewicz]] le peintre absolu'' in April 2007 (Thalia Édition, Paris). Part of this work's documentation comprising the catalogue raisonné of the artist's plastic work was published in 2002 (Éditions Adam Biro, Paris) under the title ''Kazimir Malewicz, Catalogue raisonné''. In January 2016, for the fifth consecutive year Andrei Nakov gets Moral Rights over the work of Alexandra Exter.

'''Anigouran''' or '''Aligouran''', or Arigullan, is a character in the mythology of the Tuaregs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2SGrXv4rlcC|title=Contes et légendes touaregs du Niger: des hommes et des djinns|last=Rivaillé|first=Laurence|date=1993|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=|isbn=9782865374236|location=|pages=9|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in many stories transmitted by their [[oral tradition]]. Anigouran is characterized by his exceptional intelligence and his taste for riddles. He is credited with the invention of [[Tifinagh]] "the Tuareg alphabet", and entries using this alphabet engraved on the rocks of the [[Aïr Mountains]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2SGrXv4rlcC|title=Contes et légendes touaregs du Niger: des hommes et des djinns|last=Rivaillé|first=Laurence|date=1993|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=|isbn=9782865374236|location=|pages=16|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also made him the mythical inventor of several games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2SGrXv4rlcC|title=Contes et légendes touaregs du Niger: des hommes et des djinns|last=Rivaillé|first=Laurence|date=1993|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=|isbn=9782865374236|location=|pages=42|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Tuareg mythology ==
The stories devoted to Anigouran depict adventures in which his intelligence and cunning allow him to get out of difficult situations. They also portray his rivalry with his Adelasegh nephew, whose great intelligence causes jealousy of Anigouran, who tries to kill him several times, but eventually reconciled with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2SGrXv4rlcC|title=Contes et légendes touaregs du Niger: des hommes et des djinns|last=Rivaillé|first=Laurence|date=1993|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=|isbn=9782865374236|location=|pages=15–46|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Adelasegh and his sister were captured by bandits and where Anigouran finally decided to reconcile with his nephew, Anigouran can not trace them, So he engraved on the desert rocks a coded [[tifinagh]] messages that only Adelasegh and his sister can decode, to show them the way back to his camp. This story thus provides a mythological explanation of the current presence of Tifinagh inscriptions in the desert.

==Education and early career==
During [[World War II]] Ashmead moved with her family from the East Coast to the West to La Jolla, California, while her father [[Gaylord P. Harnwell]], a Professor of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania, was directing the U. S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory at the [[Naval Base Point Loma]] in San Diego and developing FM Sonar for submarines. During the war, she attended [[The Bishop's School (La Jolla)]] and afterwards, upon returning East, she graduated from [[Lower Merion High School]]. She received her archaeology education at [[Bryn Mawr College]], BA (1952, Honors, Magna Cum Laude)  MA (1954); PhD (1959) in Classical Archaeology with [[Rhys Carpenter]]. Her thesis was on the [[Onesimos (vase painter)]]. At Bryn Mawr College professional colleagues included [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]], [[Machteld Mellink]] and Kyle Phillips. Awarded an Ella Riegel Fellowship, Ashmead worked with [[Lucy Talcott]] in 1956-1957 at the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] on the excavations at the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]] publishing on fragments by the [[Kleophrades Painter]] under the Directorship of [[Homer Thompson]] with his wife also an archaeologist [[Dorothy Burr Thompson]]. Ashmead then taught at Bryn Mawr College and was the Curator for Ella Riegel Museum. She became a Research Associate with the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] having written and compiled its [[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]] with the late Kyle Phillips.&lt;ref name="PumaSmall1994"/&gt;

==Circle of archaeologists and classicists==
Other colleagues and circle of archaeologists and classicists include [[Richmond Lattimore]], Richard Green, Phyllis Pray Bober, Ingrid Edlund Berry, Theresa Howard Carter, Jess [[Jeanny Canby]], [[Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, Jr.]], [[Adrienne Mayor]], Jocelyn Penny Small and [[Dyfri Williams]].

==Expertise==
Ann Ashmead is a classical Greek vase painting expert, the leading authority on depictions of cats, particularly the [[Cheetah]], on 5th Century Red-Figured Greek Vases.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Cats: Exotic Pets Kept by Rich Youths in Fifth Century B.C. Athens as Portrayed on Greek Vases, published in Expedition, Spring 1978, http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/20-3/Ashmead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmead has also introduced technical sections in her catalogues, through the use of x-rays, including references to kiln stacking marks, under-painting and preliminary sketches, fingerprints, and fuller inscriptions, and details garnered through technological examination, before it became a more commonly accepted practice in writing about Greek Vases.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-sv|ˈoːɡɵst ²strɪnːdbærj|lang|sv-August Strindberg.ogg}}; 22 January 1849{{spaced ndash}}14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter.&lt;ref name="Lane 1998, 1040"&gt;Lane (1998), 1040.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 3, 567.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952, 75).&lt;/ref&gt; A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic [[tragedy]], [[monodrama]], and history plays, to his anticipations of [[expressionism (theatre)|expressionist]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] dramatic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998), 1040–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952), 75–6, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043147459|title=August Strindberg and visual culture : the emergence of optical modernity in image, text, and theatre|last=|first=|publisher=Bloomsbury|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., Stenport, Anna Westerståhl,, Szalczer, Eszter, editors|year=2018|isbn=9781501338007|location=New York|pages=|oclc=1043147459}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered the "father" of modern [[Swedish literature]] and his ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg novel)|The Red Room]]'' (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meˈyer (1985), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, Strindberg is known as an essayist, painter, poet, and especially as a novelist and playwright, but in other countries he is known mostly as a playwright.

The [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] rejected his first major play, ''[[Master Olof]]'', in 1872; it was not until 1881, at the age of thirty-two, that its première at the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]] gave him his theatrical breakthrough.&lt;ref name="Lane 1998, 1040"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 49, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In his plays ''[[The Father (Strindberg play)|The Father]]'' (1887), ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), and ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'' (1889), he created naturalistic dramas that – building on the established accomplishments of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s prose [[problem play]]s while rejecting their use of the structure of the [[well-made play]] – responded to the call-to-arms of {{lang|fr|[[Émile Zola]]}}'s manifesto "Naturalism in the Theatre" (1881) and the example set by {{lang|fr|[[André Antoine]]}}'s newly established {{lang|fr|[[Théâtre Libre]]}} (opened 1887).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 280), Innes (2000, 22), Lane (1998, 1040), and Williams (1952, 77–80).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Miss Julie'', characterisation replaces plot as the predominant dramatic element (in contrast to [[melodrama]] and the well-made play) and the determining role of [[heredity]] and the [[Social environment|environment]] on the "vacillating, disintegrated" characters is emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting from Strindberg's Preface to ''Miss Julie''; see Carlson (1993, 281), Innes (2000, 12–13), and Lane (1998, 1040).&lt;/ref&gt; Strindberg modeled his short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre (1889) in [[Copenhagen]] on Antoine's theatre and he explored the theory of Naturalism in his essays "On Psychic Murder" (1887), "On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre" (1889), and a preface to ''Miss Julie'', the last of which is probably the best-known statement of the principles of the theatrical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 280) and Lane (1998, 1040).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1890s he spent significant time abroad engaged in scientific experiments and studies of the occult.&lt;ref name="cgt0"&gt;Lane (1998, 1040).&lt;/ref&gt; A series of psychotic attacks between 1894 and 1896 (referred to as his "''Inferno'' crisis") led to his hospitalization and return to Sweden.&lt;ref name=cgt0/&gt; Under the influence of the ideas of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], he resolved after his recovery to become "the Zola of the Occult".&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1040) and Meyer (1985, 350); on 23 August 1896 he wrote in a letter to Torsten Hedlund: "You said recently that people are looking for the Zola of occultism. That I feel is my vocation."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he returned to play-writing with ''[[To Damascus]]'', which, like ''[[The Great Highway]]'' (1909), is a dream-play of spiritual pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041), Meyer (1985, 374), and Williams (1952, 86–93).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[A Dream Play]]'' (1902) – with its radical attempt to dramatize the workings of the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] by means of an abolition of conventional dramatic time and space and the splitting, doubling, merging, and multiplication of its characters – was an important precursor to both expressionism and surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 346–347) and Lane (1998, 1041).&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned to writing historical drama, the genre with which he had begun his play-writing career.&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041).&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to run the [[Strindbergs Intima Teater|Intimate Theatre]] from 1907, a small-scale theatre, modeled on [[Max Reinhardt]]'s {{lang|de|Kammerspielhaus}}, that staged his [[chamber play]]s (such as ''[[The Ghost Sonata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041) and Williams (1952, 96–99).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Youth===
[[File:Klara skola.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The school in [[Klara (Stockholm)|Klara, Stockholm]], whose harsh discipline haunted Strindberg in his adult life]]

Strindberg was born on 22 January 1849 in Stockholm, Sweden, the third surviving son of Carl Oscar Strindberg ([[Shipping agency|a shipping agent]]) and Eleonora Ulrika Norling (a serving-maid).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 3–4). In his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'' (1886), Strindberg described his father as "an aristocrat by birth and upbringing"; quoted by Meyer (1985, 8). When Johan August was four his father was declared bankrupt; see Meyer (1985, 7). He had two elder brothers, Carl Axel and Oscar, who were born before their parents were married. After Johan August came another brother, Olle, and three sisters, Anna, Elisabeth, and Nora; see Meyer (1988, 3, 7).&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiographical novel ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'', Strindberg describes a childhood affected by "emotional insecurity, poverty, religious fanaticism and neglect".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995, 1074–5). One of his biographers, [[Olof Lagercrantz]], warns against the use of ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'' as a biographical source. Lagercrantz notes Strindberg's "talent to make us believe what he wants us to believe" and his unwillingness to accept any characterization of his person other than his own (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven, Strindberg moved to Norrtullsgatan on the northern, almost-rural periphery of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 9–10). Norrtullsgatan is not far from [[Tegnérlunden]], the park where [[Carl Eldh]]'s grand statue of Strindberg was later placed.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the family moved near to Sabbatsberg, where they stayed for three years before returning to Norrtullsgatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strindbergsmuseet.se/stockholm3.html |title=Norrmalm |last=Höök |first=Erik |access-date=16 February 2017 |website=[[Strindberg Museum]] |language=Swedish |quote=Strindberg bodde större delen av sin uppväxt i olika malmgårdar nära Norrtull. Längs bodde man på Norrtullsgatan 14, där [[Norrtulls sjukhus]] nu ligger. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501171521/http://www.strindbergsmuseet.se/stockholm3.html |archive-date=1 May 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a harsh school in Klara for four years, an experience that haunted him in his adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 10).&lt;/ref&gt; He was moved to the school in Jakob in 1860, which he found far more pleasant, though he remained there for only a year.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 11–13).&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1861, he was moved to the [[Stockholms Lyceum|Stockholm Lyceum]], a progressive private school for middle-class boys, where he remained for six years.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 13"&gt;Meyer (1985, 13).&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he had a keen interest in natural science, photography, and religion (following his mother's [[Pietism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 12–13).&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Strindberg recalled later with bitterness, always resented her son's intelligence.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 13"/&gt; She died when he was thirteen, and although his grief lasted for only three months, in later life he came to feel a sense of loss and longing for an idealized maternal figure.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 15"&gt;Meyer (1985, 13–15).&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year after her death, his father married the children's [[governess]], Emilia Charlotta Pettersson.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 15). Together they had a son, Emil, who was born in the year after their marriage.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his sisters, Strindberg came to regard them as his worst enemies.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 15"/&gt; He passed his [[Studentexamen|graduation exam]] in May 1867 and enrolled at the [[Uppsala University]], where he began on 13 September.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 18–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strindberg spent the next few years in [[Uppsala]] and Stockholm, alternately studying for exams and trying his hand at non-academic pursuits. As a young student, Strindberg also worked as an assistant in a pharmacy in the university town of [[Lund]] in southern Sweden. He supported himself in between studies as a substitute primary-school teacher and as a tutor for the children of two well-known physicians in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Adams_2002&gt;Adams (2002)&lt;!-- missing page numbers for citations --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He first left Uppsala in 1868 to work as a schoolteacher, but then studied chemistry for some time at the [[Royal Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in preparation for medical studies, later working as a private tutor before becoming an extra at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in Stockholm. In May 1869, he failed his qualifying chemistry exam which in turn made him uninterested in schooling.

===1870s===
Strindberg returned to [[Uppsala University]] in January 1870 to study aesthetics and modern languages and to work on a number of plays.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he first learnt about the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 30–2.&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the Rune Society, a small literary club whose members adopted pseudonyms taken from [[Runic alphabet|runes]] of the ancient [[Teutons|Teutonic]] alphabet – Strindberg called himself [[Freyr|Frö]] (Seed), after the god of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 31). The membership was restricted to a maximum of nine.&lt;/ref&gt; After abandoning a draft of a play about [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] halfway through in the face of criticism from the Rune Society, on 30 March he completed a one-act comedy in verse called ''In Rome'' about [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], which he had begun the previous autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was accepted by the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]], where it premièred on 13 September 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii"&gt;Robinson (2009), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; As he watched it performed, he realised that it was not good and felt like drowning himself, though the reviews published the following day were generally favourable.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 32–4).&lt;/ref&gt; That year he also first read works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Georg Brandes]], both of whom influenced him.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AStrindberg1874.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Strindberg in 1874, age 25]]
Taking his cue from [[William Shakespeare]], he began to use colloquial and realistic speech in his historical dramas, which challenged the convention that they should be written in stately verse.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the Christmas holiday of 1870–71, he re-wrote a historical tragedy, ''Sven the Sacrificer'', as a one-act play in prose called ''[[The Outlaw (play)|The Outlaw]]''.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Depressed by Uppsala, he stayed in Stockholm, returning to the university in April to pass an exam in Latin and in June to defend his thesis on [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]]'s [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[tragedy]] ''Earl Haakon'' (1802).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Following further revision in the summer, ''The Outlaw'' opened at the Royal Theatre on 16 October 1871.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 37, 40–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Outlaw'' was first published in December 1876; see Meyer (1985), 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite hostile reviews, the play earned him an audience with [[Charles XV of Sweden|King Charles XV]], who supported his studies with a payment of 200 [[Swedish riksdaler|riksdaler]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 41–3). After asking when he could expect the next payment in the spring of 1872, he was informed that it was not a regular arrangement, but was sent one further payment.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year Strindberg completed a first draft of his first major work, a play about [[Olaus Petri]] called ''[[Master Olof]]''.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1872, the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] rejected it, leading to decades of rewrites, bitterness, and a contempt for official institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995), 1074–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the university for what would be his final term in the spring, he left on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1872, without graduating.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 43–4).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Town and Gown'' (1877), a collection of short stories describing student life, he ridiculed Uppsala and its professors.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2009, xviii). Meyer gives the collection's date of publication as December 1876, while Lagercrantz and Robinson give it as December 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strindberg embarked on his career as a journalist and critic for newspapers in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 44).&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly excited at this time by [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization'' and the first volume of Georg Brandes' ''Main Currents of Nineteenth-Century Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 46–7).&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1874, Strindberg worked for eight years as an assistant librarian at the [[National Library of Sweden|Royal Library]].&lt;ref name="Lagercrantz 1984, 49"&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagercrantz 1984, 49"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 53. He was accepted for the position despite not possessing the requisite university degree; it is possible that two articles that had been published in ''The Swedish Citizen'' in March 1874, in which he praised the library and its chief librarian, may have prompted his acceptance. After taking several periods of unpaid leave in 1881–82, he finally resigned from the library on 31 August 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 92.&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Strindberg offered ''[[Master Olof]]'' to [[Edvard Stjernström]] (the director of the newly built [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]] in Stockholm), but it was rejected.&lt;ref name="Lagercrantz 1984, 49"/&gt; He socialised with writers, painters, journalists, and other librarians; they often met in the Red Room in [[Berns Salonger|Bern's Restaurant]].&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2009 xvii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 55–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the summer of 1875, he met [[Siri von Essen]], a 24-year-old aspiring actress who, by virtue of her husband, was a [[baron]]ess – he became infatuated with her.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 57–60. "All his life, Strindberg, while affecting to despise aristocrats, was unwillingly attracted by them." Strindberg in different works gives both late May and June as the date of their first meeting. Siri had performed as an amateur, but her husband did not want her to become a professional.&lt;/ref&gt; Strindberg described himself as a "failed author" at this time: "I feel like a deaf-mute," he wrote, "as I cannot speak and am not permitted to write; sometimes I stand in the middle of my room that seems like a prison cell, and then I want to scream so that walls and ceilings would fly apart, and I have so much to scream about, and therefore I remain silent."&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of an argument in January 1876 concerning the inheritance of the family firm, Strindberg's relationship with his father was terminated (he did not attend his funeral in February 1883).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984, 60–61) and Meyer (1985, 63, 109).&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of 1876, Strindberg and Siri began to meet in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 61–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 63).&lt;/ref&gt; Following a successful audition that December, Siri became an actress at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 70–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They married a year later, on 30 December 1877;&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 75).&lt;/ref&gt; Siri was seven months pregnant at the time. Their first child was born prematurely on 21 January 1878 and died two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 75–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 1879, Strindberg was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1879, his novel ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'' was published.&lt;ref name= "Meyer 1985, 79"&gt;Meyer (1985, 79).&lt;/ref&gt; A satire of Stockholm society, it has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel.&lt;ref name = "Meyer 1985, 79"/&gt; While receiving mixed reviews in Sweden, it was acclaimed in Denmark, where Strindberg was hailed as a genius.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 79–80).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''The Red Room'', he had become famous throughout Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2009, xix).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edvard Brandes]] wrote that the novel "makes the reader want to join the fight against hypocrisy and reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Meyer (1985, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; In his response to Brandes, Strindberg explained that:

{{quote |I am a socialist, a nihilist, a republican, anything that is anti-reactionary!... I want to turn everything upside down to see what lies beneath; I believe we are so webbed, so horribly regimented, that no spring-cleaning is possible, everything must be burned, blown to bits, and then we can start afresh...&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Edvard Brandes]], 29 July 1880; quoted by Meyer (1985, 85).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===1880s===
[[File:Siri von Essen Sir Bengt's Wife Strindberg 1882.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Strindberg's first wife, [[Siri von Essen]], as Margit in ''Sir Bengt's Wife'' (1882) at the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]].]]
Strindberg and Siri's daughter Karin was born on 26 February 1880.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 82"&gt;Meyer (1985, 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyant from the reception of ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'', Strindberg swiftly completed ''The Secret of the Guild'', an historical drama set in [[Uppsala]] at the beginning of the 15th century about the conflict between two masons over the completion of the city cathedral, which opened at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] on 3 May 1880 (his first première in nine years); [[Siri von Essen|Siri]] played Margaretha.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 81–2) and Robinson (2009, xix).&lt;/ref&gt; That spring he formed a friendship with the painter [[Carl Larsson]].&lt;ref name="Meyer 1985, 82"/&gt; A collected edition of all of Strindberg's previous writings was published under the title ''Spring Harvest''.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 81, 86). The first two volumes appeared in November and December 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881, at the invitation of [[Edvard Brandes]], Strindberg began to contribute articles to the ''Morgenbladet'', a Copenhagen daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 88).&lt;/ref&gt; In April he began work on ''The Swedish People'', a four-part cultural history of Sweden written as a series of depictions of ordinary people's lives from the 9th century onwards, which he undertook mainly for financial reasons and which absorbed him for the next year; Larsson provided illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 83, 90–97) and Robinson (2009, xix).&lt;/ref&gt; At Strindberg's insistence, Siri resigned from the Royal Theatre in the spring, having become pregnant again.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 90).&lt;/ref&gt; Their second daughter, Greta, was born on 9 June 1881, while they were staying on the island of [[Kymmendö]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 91).&lt;/ref&gt; That month, a collection of essays from the past ten years, ''Studies in Cultural History'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 91) and Robinson (2009, xix). Meyer translates the title as ''Cultural-Historical Studies''. The collection includes Strindberg's assessment of [[Impressionism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ludvig Josephson (the new artistic director of Stockholm's [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]]) agreed to stage ''[[Master Olof]]'', eventually opting for the prose version – the five-hour-long production opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 89, 95) and Robinson (2009, xix). Lane gives the length of the production as six hours. The name of the theatre in Swedish is Nya Teatern. Two former theatres of Stockholm have used this name (one is also known as the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|Swedish Theatre]], which burnt-down in 1925, while the other, [[Mindre teatern]], was demolished in 1908). August Lindberg took over from Edvard Stjernström, who founded the one known as the Swedish Theatre; see Lane (1998, 1040) and Meyer (1985, 89).&lt;/ref&gt; While this production of ''Master Olaf'' was his breakthrough in the theatre, Strindberg's five-act [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]] play ''Lucky Peter's Journey'', which opened on 22 December 1883, brought him his first significant success, although he dismissed it as a [[potboiler]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1040), Meyer (1985, 96), and Robinson (2009, xix).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1882 he wrote in a letter to Josephson: "My interest in the theatre, I must frankly state, has but one focus and one goal – my wife's career as an actress"; Josephson duly cast her in two roles the following season.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt;

Having returned to Kymmendö during the summer of 1882, Strindberg wrote a collection of [[anti-establishment]] short stories, ''The New Kingdom''.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 99).&lt;/ref&gt; While there, to provide a lead role for his wife and as a reply to [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), he also wrote ''Sir Bengt's Wife'', which opened on 25 November 1882 at the New Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 81, 102) and Robinson (2009, xix–xx).&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Grez-sur-Loing, just south of Paris, France, where Larsson was staying. He then moved to Paris, which they found noisy and polluted. Income earned from ''Lucky Peter's Journey'' enabled him to move to Switzerland in 1883. He resided in [[Ouchy]], where he stayed for some years. On 3 April 1884, Siri gave birth to their son, Hans.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 126) and Robinson (2009, xx).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strindberg's reception in Stockholm 20-10-1884.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Newspaper illustration of Strindberg's reception on his return to Stockholm on 20 October 1884 to face charges of [[blasphemy]] arising from a story in the first volume of his collection ''[[Getting Married (collection)|Getting Married]]''.]]
In 1884 Strindberg wrote a collection of short stories, ''[[Getting Married (collection)|Getting Married]]'', that presented women in an [[egalitarian]] light and for which he was tried for and acquitted of [[blasphemy]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (129–141) and Robinson (2009, xx).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups "led by influential members of the upper classes, supported by the right-wing press" probably instigated the prosecution; at the time, most people in Stockholm thought that [[Sophia of Nassau|Queen Sophia]] was behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 135).&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of that year Strindberg was in a despondent mood: "My view now is," he wrote, "everything is shit. No way out. The skein is too tangled to be unravelled. It can only be sheared. The building is too solid to be pulled down. It can only be blown up."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Meyer (1985, 142).&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1885 he wrote: "I am on my way to becoming an [[atheist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (145).&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the publication of ''Getting Married'', he began to correspond with [[Émile Zola]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 143).&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer he completed a sequel volume of stories, though some were quite different in tone from those of the first.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 130, 146–147).&lt;/ref&gt; Another collection of stories, ''Utopias in Reality'', was published in September 1885, though it was not well received.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 147).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, they moved back to Paris.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In September 1887 he began to write a novel in French about his relationship with Siri von Essen called ''[[The Defence of a Fool]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984, 55), Meyer (1985, 178–179), and Schleussner (1912). The title of the novel (''Le Plaidoyer d'un Fou'') has also been translated as ''The Confession of a Fool'', ''A Madman's Defence'' and ''A Fool's Apology''. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924100213770 A public domain English-language translation is available online].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, they moved to Issigatsbühl, near [[Lindau]] by [[Lake Constance]]. His next play, ''Comrades'' (1886), was his first in a contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2009, xxi). The play's original title was ''Marauders''. It received its première on 23 October 1905 at the Lustspieltheater in [[Vienna]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the trial he evaluated his religious beliefs, and concluded that he needed to leave [[Lutheranism]], though he had been Lutheran since childhood; and after briefly being a [[deist]], he became an [[atheist]]. He needed a [[credo]] and he used [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] nature worshiping, which he had studied while a student, as one. His works ''[[The People of Hemsö]]'' (1887) and ''Among French Peasants'' (1889) were influenced by his study of Rousseau. He then moved to Germany, where he fell in love with [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s [[Prussia]] status of the officer corps. After that, he grew very critical of Rousseau and turned to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophies, which emphasized the male intellect. Nietzsche's influence can be seen in ''The Defence of a Fool'' (1893), ''Pariah'' (1889), ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'' (1889), and ''By the Open Sea'' (1890).

Another change in his life after the trial is that Strindberg decided he wanted a scientific life instead of a literary one, and began to write about non-literary subjects. When he was 37, he began ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'', a four-part autobiography. The first part ends in 1867, the year he left home for Uppsala. Part two describes his youth up to 1872. Part three, or ''The Red Room'', describes his years as a poet and journalist; it ends with his meeting [[Siri von Essen]]. Part four, which dealt with the years from 1877 to 1886, was banned by his publishers and was not published until after his death. The three missing years, 1875–1877, were the time when Strindberg was wooing von Essen and their marriage; entitled ''He and She'', this portion of his autobiography was not printed until 1919, after his death. It contains the love letters between the two during that period.

In the later half of the 1880s Strindberg discovered [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]. After completing ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' in a matter of weeks, he sent a copy to [[Émile Zola]] for his approval, though Zola's reaction was lukewarm. The drama revolves around the conflict between the Captain, a father, husband, and scientist, and his wife, Laura, over the education of their only child, a fourteen-year-old daughter named Berta. Through unscrupulous means, Laura gets the Captain to doubt his fatherhood until he suffers a mental and physical collapse. While writing ''The Father'', Strindberg himself was experiencing marital problems and doubted the paternity of his children. He also suspected that Ibsen had based Hjalmar Ekdal in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) on Strindberg because he felt that Ibsen viewed him as a weak and pathetic husband; he reworked the situation of Ibsen's play into a warfare between the two sexes. From November 1887 to April 1889, Strindberg stayed in [[Copenhagen]]. While there he had several opportunities to meet with both [[Georg Brandes]] and his brother [[Edvard Brandes]]. Georg helped him put on ''The Father'', which had its première on 14 November 1887 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 183) and Robinson (2009, xxi).&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed a successful run for eleven days after which it toured the Danish provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 183–185).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before writing ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'', Strindberg completed one of his most famous pieces, ''[[Miss Julie]]''. He wrote the play with a Parisian stage in mind, in particular the [[Théâtre Libre]], founded in 1887 by [[Andre Antoine]]. In the play he used [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[survival of the fittest]] and dramatized a doomed sexual encounter that crosses the division of social classes. It is believed that this play was inspired by the marriage of Strindberg, the son of a servant, to an aristocratic woman.

In the essay ''On Psychic Murder'' (1887), he referred to the psychological theories of the [[Nancy School]], which advocated the use of hypnosis. Strindberg developed a theory that sexual warfare was not motivated by carnal desire but by relentless human will. The winner was the one who had the strongest and most unscrupulous mind, someone who, like a hypnotist, could coerce a more impressionable psyche into submission. His view on psychological power struggles may be seen in works such as ''Creditors'' (1889), ''The Stronger'' (1889), and ''Pariah'' (1889).

In 1888, after a separation and reconciliation with Siri von Essen, he founded the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre in Copenhagen, where Siri became manager. He asked writers to send him scripts, which he received from [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]] and Nathalia Larsen. Less than a year later, with the theatre and reconciliation short lived, he moved back to Sweden while Siri moved back to her native Finland with the children. While there, he rode out the final phase of the divorce and later used this agonizing ordeal for the basis of ''The Bond and the Link'' (1893). Strindberg also became interested in short drama, called Quart d'heure. He was inspired by writers such as Gustave Guiche and Henri de Lavedan. His notable contribution was ''[[The Stronger]]'' (1889). As a result of the failure of the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre, Strindberg did not work as a playwright for three years. In 1889, he published an essay entitled "On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre", in which he disassociated himself from naturalism, arguing that it was petty and unimaginative realism. His sympathy for Nietzsche's philosophy and atheism in general was also on the wane. He entered the period of his "Inferno crisis," in which he had psychological and religious upheavals that influenced his later works.

August Strindberg's Inferno is his personal account of sinking deeper into some kind of madness, typified by visions and paranoia. In ''Strindberg och alkoholen'' (1985), James Spens discusses Strindberg's drinking habits, including his liking for absinthe and its possible implications for Strindberg's mental health during the inferno period.

===1890s===
[[File:August Strindberg by Edvard Munch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edvard Munch]] ''Portrait of August Strindberg'', 1892, [[Moderna Museet|Museum of Modern Art]], [[Stockholm, Sweden]]]]
After his disenchantment with naturalism, Strindberg had a growing interest in transcendental matters. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] was just beginning at this time. [[Verner von Heidenstam]] and Ola Hanson had dismissed naturalism as "shoemaker realism" that rendered human experience in simplistic terms. This is believed to have stalled Strindberg's creativity, and Strindberg insisted that he was in a rivalry and forced to defend naturalism, even though he had exhausted its literary potential. These works include: ''Debit and Credit'' (1892), ''Facing Death'' (1892), ''Motherly Love'' (1892), and ''The First Warning'' (1893). His play ''The Keys of Heaven'' (1892) was inspired by the loss of his children in his divorce. He also completed one of his few comedies, ''Playing with Fire'' (1893), and the first two parts of his post-inferno trilogy ''To Damascus'' (1898–1904).

In 1892, he experienced writer's block, which led to a drastic reduction in his income. Depression followed as he was unable to meet his financial obligations and to support his children and former wife. A fund was set up through an appeal in a German magazine. This money allowed him to leave Sweden and he joined artistic circles in Berlin. [[Otto Brahm]]'s Freie Bühne theatre premiered some of his famous works in Germany, including ''The Father'', ''Miss Julie'', and ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]''.
[[File:Ślewiński August Strindberg.jpg|thumb|[[Władysław Ślewiński]], ''Portrait of August Strindberg'', 1896, [[National Museum in Warsaw]]]]
Similar to twenty years earlier when he frequented The Red Room, he now went to the German tavern The Black Porker. Here he met a diverse group of artists from Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany. His attention turned to [[Frida Uhl]], who was twenty-three years younger than Strindberg. They were married in 1893. Less than a year later, their daughter Kerstin was born and the couple separated, though their marriage was not officially dissolved until 1897. Frida's family, in particular her mother, who was a devout Catholic, had an important influence on Strindberg, and in an 1894 letter he declared "I feel the hand of our Lord resting over me."

Some critics think that Strindberg suffered from severe paranoia in the mid-1890s, and perhaps that he temporarily experienced insanity. Others, including Evert Sprinchorn and [[Olof Lagercrantz]], believed that he intentionally turned himself into his own guinea pig by doing psychological and drug-induced self-experimentation. He wrote on subjects such as [[botany]], [[chemistry]], and [[optics]] before returning to literature with the publication of his edited journals ''Legends'' and ''Jacob Wrestling'' (both 1898), where he noted the impact [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] had on his current work.
[[File:Eric XIV - M. Chekhov 1921.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Michael Chekhov]] as Erik in the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] 1921 production of Strindberg's play ''[[Eric XIV (play)|Erik XIV]]'' (1899).]]
"The Powers" were central to Strindberg's later work. He said that "the Powers" were an outside force that had caused him his physical and mental suffering because they were acting in retribution to humankind for their wrongdoings. As [[William Blake]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[William Butler Yeats]] had been, he was drawn to [[Swedenborg]]'s mystical visions, with their depictions of spiritual landscape and Christian morality. Strindberg believed for the rest of his life that the relationship between the transcendental and the real world was described by a series of "correspondences" and that everyday events were really messages from above of which only the enlightened could make sense. He also felt that he was chosen by [[Divine Providence|Providence]] to atone for the moral decay of others and that his tribulations were payback for misdeeds earlier in his life.

In 1899, he returned to Sweden, following a successful production of ''Master Olaf'' in 1897 (which was re-staged in 1899 to mark Strindberg's fiftieth birthday). He had the desire to become the national poet and felt that historical dramas were the way to attain that status. Though Strindberg claimed that he was writing "realistically," he freely altered past events and biographical information, and telescoped chronology. Works included the so-called Vasa Trilogy: ''The Saga of the Folkungs'' (1899), ''Gustavus Vasa'' (1899), and ''Erik XIV'' (1899).

===1900s===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Strindberg was pivotal in the creation of [[chamber play]]s. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a big supporter of his, staging some of his plays at the Kleines Theatre in 1902 (including ''The Bond'', ''The Stronger'', and ''The Outlaw''). Once [[Otto Brahm]] relinquished his role as head as of the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theatre]], Reinhardt took over and produced Strindberg's plays.

In 1903, Strindberg planned to write a grand cycle of plays based on world history, but the idea soon faded. He had completed short plays about [[Martin Luther]], [[Plato]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Socrates]]. He wrote another historical drama in 1908 after the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] convinced him to put on a new play for its sixtieth birthday. He wrote ''The Last of the Knights'' (1908), ''Earl Birger of Bjalbo'' (1909), and ''The Regents'' (1909).

His other works, such as ''Days of Loneliness'' (1903), ''The Roofing Ceremony'' (1907), and ''The Scapegoat'' (1907), and the novels ''The Gothic Rooms'' (1904) and ''Black Banners Genre Scenes from the Turn of the Century'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=54157&amp;concordeid=310783 Strindberg, August.

August Falck, an actor, wanted to put on a production of ''Miss Julie'' and wrote to Strindberg for permission. In September 1906 he staged the first Swedish production of ''Miss Julie''. August Palme, Strindberg's friend, played Jean and Manda Bjorling played Julie.

In 1909, Strindberg thought he might get the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], but instead lost to [[Selma Lagerlöf]], the first woman and first Swede to win the award. The leader of the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark|Social Democrat Youth Alliance]] started a fund-raiser for a special award. [[Nathan Söderblom]] was noted as a donor, yet he was criticized by the conservative party. In total there was 45,000 Swedish crowns collected, by more than 20,000 donors, most of whom were workers. [[Albert Bonniers förlag]] paid him 200,000 Swedish crowns for his complete works. He invited his first three children to Stockholm and divided the money into five shares, one for each child, one for Siri, and the other for himself.

He founded [[Strindbergs Intima Teater|The Intimate Theatre]] in Stockholm in 1907. His theatre was modeled after Max Reinhart's Kammerspiel Haus. Strindberg had the intention of the theatre being used for his plays and his plays only, he also had the intention of the theatre being used mainly to perform chamber plays. For the theatre's opening, Strindberg wrote four chamber plays: ''Thunder in the Air, The Burned Site, The Ghost Sonata'', and ''The Pelican''. Strindberg had very specific ideas about how the theatre would be opened and operated. He drafted a series of rules for his theatre in a letter to August Falck: 1. No liquor. 2. No Sunday performances. 3. Short performances without intermissions. 4. No calls. 5. Only 160 seats in the auditorium. 6. No prompter. No orchestra, only music on stage. 7. The text will be sold at the box office and in the lobby. 8. Summer performances. Falck helped to design the auditorium, which was decorated in a deep-green tone. The ceiling lighting was a yellow silk cover which created an effect of mild daylight. The floor was covered with a deep-green carpet, and the auditorium was decorated by six ultra modern columns with elaborate up-to-date capitals. Instead of the usual restaurant Strindberg offered a lounge for the ladies and a smoking-room for the gentlemen. The stage was unusually small, only 6 by 9 metres. The small stage and minimal number of seats was meant to give the audience a greater feeling of involvement in the work. Unlike most theatres at this time, the Intima Teater was not a place in which people could come to socialize. By setting up his rules and creating an intimate atmosphere, Strindberg was able to demand the audience's focus. When the theatre opened in 1907 with a performance of ''The Pelican'' it was a rather large hit. Strindberg used a minimal technique, as was his way, by only having a back drop and some sea shells on the stage for scene design and props. Strindberg was much more concerned with the actors portraying the written word than the stage looking pretty. The theatre ran into a financial difficulty in February 1908 and Falck had to borrow money from [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke]], who attended the première of ''The Pelican''. The theatre eventually went bankrupt in 1910, but did not close until Strindberg's death in 1912. The newspapers wrote about the theatre until its death; however, Strindberg felt it was entirely unsuccessful. He felt that he never had the opportunity to successfully stage a play the way he wanted to – which was the purpose of the theatre in the first place.

===Death and funeral===
[[File:Strindberg 2.jpg|thumb|right|Strindberg in his later years]]
Strindberg died shortly after the first of his plays was staged in the United States—''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' opened on 9 April 1912 at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, in a translation by Edith and Wärner Oland.&lt;ref&gt;Oland and Oland (1912a) and (1912b, v).&lt;/ref&gt;

During Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with [[pneumonia]] and he never recovered completely. He also started to suffer from a stomach cancer. The last weeks of his life were painful, and the daily papers in Stockholm reported on his health in every edition. He received many letters and telegrams from admirers across the country.&lt;ref name="gefle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gd.se/kultur/pa-nya-kyrkogarden-vill-jag-ligga |title="På Nya Kyrkogården vill jag ligga..." |last=Attius |first=Håkan |language=sv |newspaper=[[Gefle Dagblad]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 14 May 1912 at the age of 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j8ZMAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-j8ZMAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=August Strindberg: the spirit of revolt: studies and impressions|author=Lizzy Lind-af-Hageby|date=Jan 1, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strindberg was interred at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm. He had given strict instructions concerning his funeral and how his body should be treated after death: only members of his immediate family were allowed to view his body, there would be no obduction, no photographs were taken, and no [[death mask]] was made. Strindberg had also requested that his funeral should take place as soon as possible after his death to avoid crowds of onlookers. However, the workers' organisations requested that the funeral should take place on a Sunday to make it possible for working men to pay their respects, and the funeral was postponed for five days, until Sunday, 19 May. According to Strindberg's last wish, the funeral procession was to start at 8am, again to avoid crowds, but large groups of people were nevertheless waiting outside his home as well as at the cemetery, as early as 7am. A short service was conducted by [[Nathan Söderblom]] by the bier in Strindberg's home, in the presence of three of Strindberg's children and his housekeeper, after which the coffin was taken outside for the funeral procession. The procession was followed by groups of students, workers, and members of Parliament, and it was estimated that up to 60,000 people lined the streets. King Gustaf V sent a wreath for the bier.&lt;ref name="gefle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svd funeral"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/brottningen-med-gud-praglade-begravningen |title=Brottningen med Gud präglade begravningen |last=Krook |first=Caroline |language=sv |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
[[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[John Osborne]], and [[Ingmar Bergman]] are among the many artists who have cited Strindberg as an influence.&lt;ref name="Adams 2002"&gt;Adams (2002).&lt;!-- missing page numbers for citations --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene O'Neill]], upon receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature, dedicated much of his acceptance speech to describing Strindberg's influence on his work, and referred to him as "that greatest genius of all modern dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1936/oneill-speech.html |title= Banquet Speech |author= Eugene O'Neill |date= 10 December 1936 | publisher =The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-faceted author, Strindberg was often extreme. His novel ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'' (1879) made him famous. His early plays belong to the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] movement. His works from this time are often compared with the Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Strindberg's best-known play from this period is ''[[Miss Julie]]''. Among his most widely read works is the novel ''[[The People of Hemsö]]''.

[[File:Strindbergmetro.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Detail of mural in honour of August Strindberg in Stockholm, at the [[Rådmansgatan]] subway station]]
Strindberg wanted to attain what he called "greater Naturalism." He disliked the expository character backgrounds that characterise the work of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and rejected the convention of a dramatic "[[slice of life]]" because he felt that the resulting plays were mundane and uninteresting. Strindberg felt that true naturalism was a psychological "battle of brains": two people who hate each other in the immediate moment and strive to drive the other to doom is the type of mental hostility that Strindberg strove to describe. He intended his plays to be impartial and objective, citing a desire to make literature akin to a science.

Following the inner turmoil that he experienced during the "Inferno crisis," he wrote an important book in French, ''[[Inferno (Strindberg)|Inferno]]'' (1896–7) in which he dramatised his experiences. He also exchanged a few cryptic letters with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheffauer |first1=Herman |title=A Correspondence between Nietzsche and Strindberg |journal=The North American Review |date=1 August 1913 |volume=198 |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-25120062/25120062#page/n1/mode/2up |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strindberg subsequently ended his association with Naturalism and began to produce works informed by [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. He is considered one of the pioneers of the modern European stage and [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]]. ''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|The Dance of Death]]'', ''[[A Dream Play]]'', and ''[[The Ghost Sonata]]'' are well-known plays from this period.

His most famous and produced plays are ''[[Master Olof]]'', ''[[Miss Julie]]'', and ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]''.

The Swedish Composer [[Ture Rangström]] dedicated his first Symphony, which was finished in 1914, to ''August Strindberg in memoriam''.

==Politics==
[[File:Eldstrindbergmonument.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Carl Eldh]]'s grand statue of Strindberg in [[Tegnérlunden]], Stockholm]]

Influenced by the history of the [[Paris Commune]], during 1871, young Strindberg embraced the view,  that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes. He was admired by many as a far-left writer. He was a socialist (or perhaps more of an anarchist, meaning a libertarian socialist, which he himself claimed on at least one occasion&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uXxcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=August+Strindberg+anarchist&amp;dq=August+Strindberg+anarchist&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ei=0EO5Tu-_A4rysgb1l-XRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Inferno, Alone, and other writings: In new translations], August Strindberg, Edited by Evert Sprinchorn, Anchor Books, 1968, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G-rbnAl3wKAC&amp;pg=PA233 Selected essays], August Strindberg, Edited by Michael Robinson, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;). Strindberg's political opinions nevertheless changed considerably within this category over the years, and he was never primarily a political writer. Nor did he often campaign for any one issue, preferring instead to scorn his enemies manifesto-style – the military, the [[Church of Sweden|church]], the [[Monarchy of Sweden|monarchy]], the politicians, the stingy publishers, the incompetent reviewers, the narrow-minded, the idiots – and he was not loyal to any party or ideology. Many of his works, however, had at least some politics and sometimes an abundance of it. They often displayed that life and the prevailing system were profoundly unjust and injurious to ordinary citizens.

The changing nature of his political positions shows in his changing stance on the women's rights issue. Early on, Strindberg was sympathetic to women of 19th-century Sweden, calling for women's suffrage as early as 1884. However, during other periods he had strongly [[misogyny|misogynistic]] opinions, calling for lawmakers to reconsider the emancipation of these "half-apes ... mad ... criminal, instinctively evil animals." This is controversial in contemporary assessments of Strindberg, as have his antisemitic descriptions of Jews (and, in particular, Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life) in some works (e.g., ''Det nya riket''), particularly during the early 1880s. Strindberg's antisemitic pronouncements, just like his opinions of women, have been debated, and also seem to have varied considerably. Many of these attitudes, passions and behaviours may have been developed for literary reasons and ended as soon as he had exploited them in books.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In satirizing Swedish society – in particular the upper classes, the cultural and political establishment, and his many personal and professional foes – he could be very confrontational, with scarcely concealed caricatures of political opponents. This could take the form of brutal character disparagement or mockery, and while the presentation was generally skilful, it was not necessarily subtle.

His daughter [[Karin Strindberg]] married a Russian [[Bolshevik]] of partially Swedish ancestry, [[Vladimir Smirnov (politician)|Vladimir Smirnov]] ("Paulsson").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=RCHGI |publisher=SPB |year=2001 |url=http://www.rchgi.spb.ru/Pr/spb_2001/usykin.htm |language=Russian |place=RU |contribution=Usykin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718051144/http://www.rchgi.spb.ru/Pr/spb_2001/usykin.htm |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his political views, Strindberg was promoted strongly in socialist countries in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union and [[Cuba]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Painting and photography offered vehicles for his belief that chance played a crucial part in the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/strindberg/default.shtm Strindberg exhibition, Tate Modern] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230200839/http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/strindberg/default.shtm |date=30 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strindberg's paintings were unique for their time, and went beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical lack of adherence to visual reality. The 117 paintings that are acknowledged as his were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and are now seen by some as among the most original works of 19th-century art.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnarsson (1998, 256–60).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, his best-known pieces are stormy, expressionist seascapes, selling at high prices in auction houses. Though Strindberg was friends with [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], and was thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis. [[Anders Zorn]] also did a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnarsson (1998, 256).&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in photography resulted, among other things, in a large number of arranged self-portraits in various environments, which now number among the best-known pictures of Strindberg.

In 1895 Strindberg met [[Camille Flammarion]] and became a member of the [[Société astronomique de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9667257k/f456.image [[L'Astronomie (magazine)|''Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France'']]] 1896, p. 438.]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave some of his experimental astronomical photographs to the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Robinson. ''August Strindberg: Selected Essays'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alchemy]], [[occultism]], [[Swedenborgianism]], and various other eccentric interests were pursued by Strindberg with some intensity for periods of his life. In the curious autobiographical work ''[[Inferno (Strindberg)|Inferno]]''—a paranoid and confusing tale of his years in Paris, written in French—he claims to have successfully performed alchemical experiments and cast black magic spells on his daughter.

==Personal life==
[[File:Bosse as Indra's daughter in A Dream Play.1907.png|thumb|right|220px|Strindberg's third wife, the actress [[Harriet Bosse]], as Indra's Daughter in the 1907 première of ''[[A Dream Play]]'']]
Strindberg was married three times, as follows:
* [[Siri von Essen]]: married 1877–91 (14 years), 3 daughters ([[Karin Smirnov]], Greta, and another who died in infancy), 1 son (Hans);
* [[Frida Uhl]]: married 1893–95, (2 years) 1 daughter (Kerstin); and
* [[Harriet Bosse]]: married 1901–1904 (3 years), 1 daughter (Anne-Marie).

Strindberg was age 28 and Siri was 27 at the time of their marriage. He was 44 and Frida was 21 when they married, and he was 52 and Harriet was 23 when they married. Late during his life he met the young actress and painter Fanny Falkner (1890–1963) who was 41 years younger than Strindberg. She wrote a book which illuminates his last years, but the exact nature of their relationship is debated.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner (1921). The book's title includes the name of Strindberg's home in his final years (Bla Tornet).&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brief affair in Berlin with [[Dagny Juel]] before his marriage to Frida; it has been suggested that the news of her murder in 1901 was the reason he cancelled his honeymoon with his third wife, Harriet.

He was related to [[Nils Strindberg]] (a son of one of August's cousins).

Strindberg's relationships with women were troubled and have often been interpreted as [[misogyny|misogynistic]] by contemporaries and modern readers. Marriage and families were being stressed in Strindberg's lifetime as Sweden industrialized and urbanized at a rapid pace. Problems of prostitution and poverty were debated among writers, critics and politicians. His early writing often dealt with the [[gender roles|traditional roles of the sexes]] imposed by society, which he criticized as unjust.

Strindberg's last home was [[Blå tornet]] in central Stockholm, where he lived from 1908 until 1912. It is now a museum. Of several statues and busts of him erected in Stockholm, the most prominent is [[Carl Eldh]]'s, erected in 1942 in [[Tegnérlunden]], a park adjoining this house.

'''"Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States"''' is a 37-page [[Classified information|classified]] [[United States Department of Justice]] [[memorandum]] dated October 23, 2001. This memo states that the President has both constitutional and statutory authority to use the military as a means to combat terrorist activity within the United States.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/memomilitaryforcecombatus10232001.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2014-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230081606/http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/memomilitaryforcecombatus10232001.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This memo is a direct result of the terrorist attacks on [[September 11 attacks|September 11th 2001]]. Its existence is known because it was referred to in another Department of Justice memo. According to the latter memo, the former memo argued that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had no application to domestic military operations. The memo has been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/olc/docs/memomilitaryforcecombatus10232001.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512164553/http://www.justice.gov/olc/docs/memomilitaryforcecombatus10232001.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was made using a five-part analysis. First it was found through interpretation by the executive branch of the [[Constitution]] that the [[President of the United States]] has the authority to "deploy military force against terrorist threats within the [[United States]]". Second, the enactment of legislation S.J. Res. 23, [[Act of Congress|Pub. L.]][http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/pdf/PLAW-107publ40.pdf No. 107-40], 115 Stat. 224 (2001) was assessed for legal consequences and it was determined that the President "may deploy military force domestically and to prevent and deter similar terrorist attacks." Third, the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] was reviewed and it was determined that the act only applies to "domestic use of the Armed Forces for law enforcement purposed rather that for the performance of military functions." Fourth, it was determined that military intrusion into terrorist cells does not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. Fifth and finally the government has "a compelling interest in protecting the nation" and "the war effort would outweigh the relevant privacy interests" in regards to a claim of unreasonable search and seizure. The terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 are unprecedented and thus the President's authority to deploy military force against terrorist threats is affirmed. The scale of these terrorist attacks has been viewed as a campaign against the United States and thus viewed as an act of war.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

==History of federal forces in law enforcement==
[[File:U.S. Marines with the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division and Japanese soldiers move toward their next objective while conducting raid training during exercise Iron Fist 2014 at Marine Corps Base 140207-M-ZH987-105.jpg|thumbnail|right|Members of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] were used to control crowds in [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].]]
Over the course of the last two hundred and fifteen years the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] have been used to intervene in domestic affairs and enforce laws. Federal troops have been used to control riots, protect minorities from violence, break strikes and guard the borders. Due to partiality and unreliability of state militias, Presidents have found that the use of federal troops was a much more effective means of controlling such domestic disturbances. The use of federal troops in recent times has lessened due to Presidents' preference to let state governors utilize state militias to handle issues within the states.
Over the last two centuries laws regarding the use of Federal troops to regulate domestic matters have been augmented to reflect lessons learned from previous use of federal troops in civil matters. These laws are based on past experience and were not developed to handle new and unprecedented events such as domestic terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="army.mil"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/docs/10-16/ch_11.asp |title={title} |access-date=2014-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420190740/http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/docs/10-16/ch_11.asp |archive-date=2014-04-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Necessity for Authorized Use of Military Forces within the United States==
As unprecedented events occur in history it is necessary to examine current policies for adequacy. A federal law that "prohibits military personnel from enforcing the law within the United States" is an inadequate policy for addressing the [[Global War on Terrorism]]. In years prior to September 11, 2001 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] narrowly focused on the military's ability to enforce laws domestically and not the President's authority to authorize such use of force.
&lt;ref name="army.mil"/&gt;

==The effect on the United States Judicial System==
[[File:Yaser Esam Hamdi in Camp X-ray, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba - 20020404.jpg|thumbnail|rught|Hamdi during his detention at Guantanamo Bay.]] The document pertaining to the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States has been mentioned in several [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] cases.  Two cases that stand out are the [[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6173897153146757813&amp;q=Authority+for+Use+of+Military+Force+to+Combat+Terrorist+Activities+Within+the+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20000006&lt;/ref&gt; case and the [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1251834070131661299&amp;q=Authority+for+Use+of+Military+Force+to+Combat+Terrorist+Activities+Within+the+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20000006|title=Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; case.  These two cases are examples of challenges to the constitutionality of the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States.

==Controversy over the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States==
Other than the implications of this document in the Supreme Court this document has received criticisms elsewhere.  A memo that originated from the [[United States Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department]] stated that the memo concerning the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States "should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose."&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torturingdemocracy/documents/20081006.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2014-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720154340/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torturingdemocracy/documents/20081006.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This memo continues to highlight that the original memo was written in the time immediately after the September 11 attacks and therefore it is no longer relevant.  The original memo stated that the use of military force domestically was not a violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]], however in the more recent memo it is stated that this is no longer the view of the administration.  The more recent memo also recants the statement that the [[first amendment]] could be suspended.  It also continues to sort out any discrepancies.&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"/&gt;

'''Azerbaijan Museum''' is the major archaeological and historical museum in [[Tabriz]], in the northwest part of [[Iran]] ([[East Azerbaijan province]]). It was established on April 1958.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eachto.ir/farsi/content/view/647/368/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124222501/http://www.eachto.ir/farsi/content/view/647/368/ |date=November 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum consists of three major halls, a side yard, office rooms and a library. It mostly contains objects discovered from excavations in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], also some artworks and sculptures of artists. Its library contains more than 2500 books, both handwritten and printed, about history, archaeology, art and Iranian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroun.com/Museums/IranMuseum/IranMRegion1/AzerbayjanMuseum.htm Iran, Azerbaijan East: Azerbaijan Museum (Tabriz Museum)]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[National Museum of Iran]] in Tehran, Azerbaijan Museum has the largest collection belonging to different periods of Iran's history.
[[File:"Bismillah" Stone.jpg|thumb|'Bismila Stone' a calligraphy of marble stone, 1845.]]
==Galleries==
The museum has three galleries. The first gallery bears the oldest remains from 5th millennium BC until Sassanian dynasty (212-656 AD). The museum's monuments include goddesses, [[Rhyton]]s, two skeletons (male and female) and a carved slab of marble known as [[Basmala|Bism Allah]]-Stone. 
The second gallery consists of two parts: one for Islamic archeology and another part for coins and seals. Part one involves pottery dated from the 10th to the 19th centuries. The coins of this gallery (part two), began with the [[Achamenid]] dynasty and end in the [[Qajar dynasty]]. The displayed seals and stamps date from the third millennium BC to Islamic eras.

The third gallery includes some sculptures made by [[Ahad Hosseini]]. They are made of plaster and represent the sculptor's own image about the fate of mankind in the 20th century.

In the yard of museum some stone figurines, statues, rams and inscriptions are kept.

==Theft==
On May 7, 2013, five silver plate belonging to the Sasanid time stolen from Azerbaijan museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://khabarfarsi.com/ext/5186546&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2013, East Azerbaijan police arrested the thieves but they couldn't retrieve the stolen items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anaj.ir/news/pages/68474 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201015214/http://anaj.ir/news/pages/68474 |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portugalete Casa Torre Lope Garcia de Salazar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''dorretxeak'' or tower-houses were vigil fortified towers common in the areas controlled by the Señoríos.]]

The '''Basque ''jaurerriak''''' or '''''señoríos''''' (literally, the Basque lordships) were a series of feudal territories that came into existence in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The lordships were hereditary land titles over territories of variable size under the name of a lord or count. The title and lands were often recognized by kings to [[Basque people|Basque]] chieftains. It is loosely related to the concept of [[manorialism]] as the king had to swear allegiance to the [[fueros|Foral law]] in exchange for military assistance from the Basque chiefs, who were considered [[sovereign]] over their own lands and people. The Basque señoríos generally conformed [[vassal states]] of larger kingdoms; most of them started as part of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] (later [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]) but were integrated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] by the 13th century. The [[Basque language|Basque]] term ''jaurreria'' (pronounced {{IPA-eu|jauˈɾeria|}}) means "the lord's country" and it is usually used to refer to these feudal territories.

The feudal title confirmed considerable powers to the holder, which in other areas were directly controlled by the king. The ''Lord'' or ''Count'' was a [[sovereign]] judicial and military high authority, who ruled directly without referring to a king. The powers of the lord included the appointment of government and civil servants and collection of taxes, as well as the powers to sign external treaties, raise armies and wage wars. 

The largest and most important of the ''señoríos'' was the [[Lordship of Biscay]], which comprised the entire territory of the present-day province of [[Biscay]]. 

== ''Señoríos'' ==

=== Lordship of Biscay ===
[[File:Arms of the House of Haro, Lords of Biscay.svg|right|130px|thumb|The coat of arms of the Castilian House of Haro, the bearers of the title of ''Señorío de Vizcaya'' during the 11th and 14th century.]]

{{main|Lordship of Biscay}}

The Lordship of Biscay was a feudal territory comprising the present-day province of [[Biscay]]. It was ruled by the [[Lord of Biscay]]. It was the largest and most powerful of the Basque señoríos, and acted as a semi-autonomous territory with its own naval ensign and international consulates from the 11th century until its dissolution in 1876. The Lordship was first a vassal state of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], but starting in the 13th century it was conquered and later annexed by the Kingdom of Castile. The [[House of Haro]] were the bearers of the title after the Castilian conquest and until 1379, when [[John I of Castile]] inherited the title and lands.

The Lordship was integrated by three constituent lands:

* The ''Lur Laua'' or ''Tierra Llana'' (meaning "flat land"), referred to the non-fortified towns and villages of Biscay, which were organised in [[elizate]]s.
* The [[Enkarterri]], a historical region west of the river [[Nervión]].
* The [[County of Durango]], comprising a previously autonomous county who was eventually integrated into the Lordship. 

=== Lordship of Gipuzkoa ===

A feudal territory comprising most of the present-day province of [[Gipuzkoa]]. It was annexed by [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] to the Kingdom of Castile in the year 1200.

=== County of Álava ===
[[File:Baronatarren dorretxea 1.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Tower-house of Varona, in Álava.]]
{{main|County of Álava}}

The County of Álava comprised most of the present-day province of [[Álava]] from its consolidation in the 9th century until its dissolution in the year 1200 after being conquered by Alfonso VIII and annexed to the Kingdom of Castile. The county changed hands frequently, being controlled by the kingdoms of Asturias, Castile and Navarre at different times. The figure governing the County had the title of Count of Álava.

=== Lordship of Oñate ===
{{main|Lordship of Oñate}}
The smallest of the Basque señoríos, it comprised the territory surrounding the fortified city of [[Oñati]], in present-day Gipuzkoa. The lordship was originally awarded by the Navarrese monarchs to the members of the House of Guevara, who all originated in the [[Guevara, Spain|village with the same name]] in Álava. As such, the lordship had strong links with the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], but also with the County of Álava. The lordship was conquered by Castile circa the year 1200, but the titles were ratified by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] to the Guevara family in the year 1481. 

The lordship was dissolved in 1845, when Oñati was finally integrated into the province of Gipuzkoa.

'''Callixenus of Rhodes''' was a [[Hellenistic]] author from [[Rhodes]].  He was a contemporary of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] and [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]]. He wrote two works, both of which are lost. 

=="Peri Alexandreias"==
This consisted of at least four books, and was much used by [[Athenaeus]] (Athen. v. p. 196, &amp;c., ix. p. 387, xi. pp. 472, 474, 483; Harpocrat. s. v. eggythike).  It contained the main account of the [[tessarakonteres]].

==Title unknown==
This seems to have been a catalogue of [[Painting|painter]]s and [[sculptor]]s (zografonte kai andriantopoion anagrafe), of which [[Sopater (poet)|Sopater]], in the twelfth book of his ''Eclogae'' had made an abridgement. (Phot. Bibl. Cod. 161 ; comp. Preller, Polem. Fragm. p. 178, &amp;c.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Chronological synchronism''' is an event that links two [[chronology|chronologies]]. For example, it is used in [[Egyptology]] to ground [[Egyptian chronology]]. The main types of chronological synchronism are synchronisms with other historical chronologies and synchronisms with precisely datable astronomical events.

Synchronisms with other chronologies often rely on some form of recorded communication between regions. For example, in Egyptology, the earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC, during the [[Amarna Period]] by the considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Akhenaten]] and various [[Near Eastern]] monarchs; that links Egyptian chronology with other Near Eastern chronologies.

Astronomical synchronisms rely on precise identification of astronomical events recorded in the historical record. The best known of these is the [[Sothic cycle]] whose careful study led [[Richard Anthony Parker]] to argue that the dates of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] could be fixed with absolute precision.&lt;ref&gt;Set forth in "Excursus C: The Twelfth dynasty" in his ''The Calendars of ancient Egypt'' (Chicago: University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has eroded that confidence and questioned many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle. As a result, experts have moved away from relying on it.&lt;ref&gt;One example is Patrick O'Mara, "Censorinus, the Sothic Cycle, and calendar year one in ancient Egypt: the Epistological problem", ''Journal of Near Eastern studies'', '''62''' (2003), pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civility''' comes from the word ''civilis'', which in Latin means "[[citizen]]". Civility is caused by a person's emotions or lack thereof. If a person is emotionally affected by the negative feedback that they get from other people in a psychologically normal manner then they are defined as civil.

== Etymology ==

[[Late Middle English]]: from [[Old French]] ''civilite'', from [[Latin]] ''civilitas'', from civilis 'relating to citizens' (see civil). In early use, the term denoted the state of being a citizen and hence good citizenship or orderly behavior. The sense 'politeness' arose in the mid-16th century.

==Developmental model==

Adolf G. Gundersen and Suzanne Goodney Lea have developed a civility model grounded in empirical data that "stresses the notion that civility is a sequence, not a single thing or set of things". The model conceives of civility as a continuum or scale consisting of increasingly demanding traits ranging from "indifference" to "commentary", "conversation", "co-exploration" and, from there, to "habituation". According to the authors, such a developmental model has several distinct advantages, not least of which is that it allows civility to be viewed as something everyone can get better at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Gundersen, Adolf G., PhD, and Suzanne Goodney Lea, PhD" |title=Let's Talk Politics: Restoring Civility through Exploratory Discussion. [publisher=Interactivity Foundation, Parkersburg, WV] |date=March 14, 2013]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide civility==

[[File:International Day of Peace &amp; Society For Women &amp; Child Development.png|thumb|130px| International Day of Peace is observed around the world each year on 21st of September.]]

===Movement to foster worldwide civility===
The [[International Day of Peace]] ("Peace Day") is observed by many countries on September 21. Peace day was first started in 1981 by declaration of the United Nations General Assembly. The voting was overwhelmingly in favor of enacting Peace Day, and so the observance was thus born. The goal of Peace Day is to help bring the world together, and share a collective attitude of peace and harmony. Many countries around the world celebrate September 21 as a day of non-violence and cease-fires to emulate the mission of global peace. Since its beginnings the day has spread more throughout the world, with many countries annually participating in this observance.

Participation is open to all people of the world. People may choose to celebrate Peace Day in different ways, but the goal is to have peace at the heart of all the activity's intentions. Individuals, businesses and organizations are also welcome and encouraged to celebrate Peace Day. Spreading peace and good will towards all mankind is the great aim that's in view for raising awareness for Peace Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internationaldayofpeace.org/ |title=International Day of Peace |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |access-date=September 17, 2015 |quote=International Day of Peace (Also referred to as "Peace Day") is observed around the world each year on 21st of September. Established in 1981 by resolution 36/37, the United Nations General Assembly declared this day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples. Furthering the Day’s mission, the General Assembly voted unanimously in 2001 to adopt resolution 55/282 establishing 21 September as an annual day of non-violence and cease-fire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI) was launched in an attempt to measure the relative ranking of peacefulness around different countries around the world. Today, the Global Peace Index is maintained the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], and is conducted on an annual basis. The index primarily measures three different categories to determine the level of peace in the world. These levels look at the overall security, crime levels, and the build up of military forces. By measuring levels of peace, the hope is that a greater general awareness and attention is given towards making the world a more peaceful place.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology {{cite web | title =2014 Global Peace Index | publisher =Institute for Economics and Peace | url =http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | accessdate =2015-06-02 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150221185512/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | archivedate =2015-02-21 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

===Opinion polls===

A 2010 Allegheny College poll found that nearly all Americans (95 percent) believe civility is important in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Peter|title=We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For: The Promise of Civic Renewal in America|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|asin=B00F51ZXII|edition=Kindle, first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 poll conducted by [[Weber Shandwick]], 65% of Americans reported an increase in incivility due to a weakened U.S. economy during the Great Recession. Almost 50% of those same Americans surveyed indicated they have removed themselves from participating in any politics because of fear of incivility or bullying. Of the 1000 people surveyed, a follow-up study revealed that 86% of those people reported being subjected to incivility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=The Rise of Incivility and Bullying in America |publisher=Psychology Today |date=July 15, 2012 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201207/the-rise-incivility-and-bullying-in-america |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this report, a part of an annual follow-up research report in January 2016 sharing findings on attitudes and sentiment about civility, 95% of Americans believe that incivility is a very visible issue, while 74% recognized that civility in general had declined during the past few years. Over 90% of voters claimed that the presidential candidates' attitudes and civil behavior would play a significant role in their voting decision in the upcoming 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=Nearly All Likely Voters Say Candidates’ Civility Will Affect Their Vote; New Poll Finds 93% Say Behavior Will Matter |publisher=Weber Shandwick |date=January 28, 2016 |url=http://www.webershandwick.com/news/article/nearly-all-likely-voters-say-candidates-civility-will-affect-their-vote |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to foster civility in the U.S.===

====In government====
Many projects are led by State Supreme Courts to foster civility. One of these initiatives is led by the California Judicial Branch for their Civics Education Outreach program. The primary objective of this program is to teach young adults and students how democracy is supposed to function in the United States and other details about how legal processes work. The mission is to have students leave the program with a greater interest and understanding of U.S. courts, legal processes, and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Administrative Office of the Courts" |title=California Judicial Branch Outreach to Students:Highlights |publisher=California Judicial Branch |date=March 2011|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/factsheet-civics-outreach.pdf |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the legal profession====
Penn State University conducted a study on perceptions of the legal professional and its relation to civility. They found that general opinion pointed to a drop or decline in civility with the legal profession. To counteract demeaning and unprofessional behavior, there has been several initiatives put in place by state bar associations. However, the legal profession is not the only industry that has adopted civility standards. Many other companies and organizations across several industries have adopted civility standards that have also help to increase workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="PennState University" |title=University Libraries Civility Statement and Guidelines |publisher=Penn State University Libraries |date=2017 |url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/diversity/university-libraries-civility-statement-and-guidelines |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In schools====
Numerous universities in the U.S., such as the [[University of Colorado]], the [[University of Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="University of Missouri" |title=Civility, You, and Mizzou |publisher=University of Missouri |date=2015 |url=https://understand.missouri.edu/civility-you-mizzou/ |accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Civility Project|url=http://civilityproject.ucdavis.edu/|website=civilityproject.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johns Hopkins University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=User|first1=Administrative|title=JHU Dr. Forni's Civility Website|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/civility|website=krieger.jhu.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UW Oshkosh CivilityWorks|url=http://civilityworks.uwosh.edu/|website=CivilityWorks|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Relations|first1=Written by Sandra Lanman |title=Rutgers Project Advances Civility on Campus and Beyond|url=http://sas.rutgers.edu/news-events/student-news/1058-draft-2-rutgers-project-advances-civility-on-campus-and-beyond2nd-draft-for|website=Rutgers University, School of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Civility|url=https://www.american.edu/ocl/Civility.cfm|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California State University San Marcos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Student Life and Leadership California State University San Marcos" |title=The Civility Campaign |publisher=California State University San Marcos |date=2015 |url=http://www.csusm.edu/civility/ |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have created programs designed to foster and define what civility means on their campuses. Some colleges, such as the [[Arizona State University]], offer an undergraduate certificate in Civil Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Arizona State University" |title=Certificate in Civil Communication |publisher=Arizona State University |date=2017 |url=https://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/degrees/certificate-and-minor |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other universities, such as [[Kansas State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Kansas State University" |title= Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy |publisher=Kansas State University |date=2017 |url=https://www.k-state.edu/icdd/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed programs in dialogue and deliberation which involve codes of behavior that foster constructive, civil discourse. Although many colleges have adopted programs to foster civility efforts, there are still many colleges and universities, including many of the [[Ivy League]] schools, that do not have or list no visible place online about any civility initiatives, codes or standards.

====In the community====
Numerous community groups have formed throughout the U.S. to restore constructive civility in the public space. The Civility Toolkit with approximately 300 civility tools aggregated by the Civility Center with a mission to help provide access to resources regarding civility and to help restore civility in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Civility Center" |title= The Civility Center Toolkit &amp; Resources |publisher=Civility Center 501(c)(3) |date=2015 |url=http://www.civilityresources.com/Civility-Resources.html |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups are members of the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation" |title= What We’re All About |publisher=NATIONAL COALITION FOR DIALOGUE &amp; DELIBERATION |date=2015 |url=http://icdd.k-state.edu/ |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs like iCivics, which was started by [[Sandra Day O'Conner]] U.S. Justice, provides educational tools for students that teach about the importance of actively taking part in democracy. Although some private schools offer courses geared to teach about the U.S. government and legal system, most public schools do not teach about the U.S. government until their junior or senior year in high school. To help bring these lessons into the classroom, O'Conner's program provides teachers with educational tools, such as printable goals, games, and various lesson plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="iCivics" |title= Our Story |publisher=iCivics |date=2015 |url=http://www.icivics.org/our-story|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnett and Arneson define civility "a metaphor that points to the importance of public respect in interpersonal interaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnett, Arneson |first=Ronald, Pat |date=September 30, 1999 |title=Dialogic Civility in a Cynical Age: Community, Hope, and Interpersonal Relationships |url= |location= |publisher=State University of New York Press |page=7 |isbn=978-0791443262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between tolerating someone, and respecting them are concerned with the outlook that toleration does not imply respect, but respect requires understanding of another person's perspective. Having [[social intelligence]] or "Social IQ" impacts our ability to empathize with people, and realize all people are human and that if respect or common ground cannot be met that we strive for at least toleration in order to be civil.

In ''Psychology Today'', Price-Mitchell describes civility as a personal attitude that acknowledges other humans' rights to live and coexist together in a manner that does not harm others. The Psychology of civility indicates awareness, ability to control oneself's passions, as well as have a deeper understanding of others are a part of civil obligation, which everyone should strive to participate. This may suggest that civility goes beyond mere toleration, but may inherently imply a mutual co-existence and respect for [[humankind]]. Some may relate this to the ideas expressed by singer [[John Lennon]] in the song "Imagine", with the words "Imagine all the people sharing all the world." Although the level of peace can be a subjective topic, many people would agree that it requires a certain degree of harmony and opposes violence in order to remain civil.

In the academic journal ''[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]'', Calhoun delineates civility as an element of dialogue that sheds light on "basic moral attitudes of respect, tolerance, and considerateness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Cheshire |last=Calhoun |title=The Virtue of Civility |journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs |location=251-275 |access-date=September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of civility is expansive, and can be viewed from many different perspectives. Calhoun considers civility to be a part of the moral virtues that can differ from what is socially acceptable, since what is socially acceptable is not always morally correct.

====Masons and Civility====
The Freemasons and members of the entire Masonic family, have had a long history of fostering civil dialogue and building civil societies. Masonic Lodges represent a peaceful assembly of people that are of different places of origin, languages, backgrounds, and beliefs. In particular, the principles and tenets of Freemasonry's values aim to promote and restore civility in the United States and around the globe. In 2015, Grand Master Charvonia of the Grand Lodge of California declared May 25, 2015 to be the "Champion Civility Month", which encouraged Freemasons throughout California to make an effort to bring more civility into their local lodges and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Freemason.org" |title= Champion Civility This May |publisher=Freemason.org |date= May 2015 |url=https://freemason.org/newsEvents/article.htm;jsessionid=4F774C610EC8EFC302FF60B9A7FFDE4B?id=10759 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Freemasons from around the world have been working to repair civility through the Masonic Family Civility Project. This Civility Project was built to help raise awareness of Civility, and by providing social conversations, civility resources, multimedia education, and information for anyone to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Masonic Family Civility Project" |title= Using Masonic Values to Promote Civility|publisher=masoniccivility.org |date= December 2017 |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/document-resources/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===

Recent studies and polls from 2014 indicate that Americans find [[workplace incivility]] to be a growing problem that has had a negative impact on them and their duties at work. One study's research suggests 60% of employees think that their co-workers' irritating habits to have negatively affected them at their job. In the same study, 40% reported that they are looking for another job opportunity because of another negative co-worker. These studies suggest that incivility in the workplace dampens productivity and an adverse effect on an organization's bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Barbara Richman" |title=  Ten Tips for Creating Respect and Civility in Your Workplace |publisher=Lorman |date=May 28, 2014 |url=http://www.lorman.com/resources/ten-tips-for-creating-respect-and-civility-in-your-workplace-15463 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this data is only looking to quantify how widespread workplace incivility is in the workplace, it does not account for how many people encounter workplace incivility and are not sure what they can do about it. Furthermore, it is not taking into consideration how many of these workplaces have civility tools or initiatives at the researched companies.

Numerous organizations, including the United States government, have actively attempted to put in place measures to prevent incivility in the workforce. One measure that was initiated to reduce workplace incivility, was processing cases of [[sexual harassment]] to be illegal, which is defined by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ([[EEOC]]) as being against the law in every state to harass any person during the employment or hiring process because of that person's [[gender]]. Harassment can include "sexual harassment", but is not limited to workplace bullying, cyber bullying, physical and verbal threats.&lt;ref name="eeoc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm | title = Sexual Harassment | publisher = U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many would agree that sexual harassment is an issue that should be illegal, it has really been in the spotlight of the attention in the U.S. since 1964. Because of the legal ramifications from poor prior classification of sexual harassment cases in the past, its boundaries were more loosely interpreted and more people were subject to unwanted contact or attention. Since this the term has been redefined, people are greater protected from a legal perspective in their place of work, but must actively participate in preventing these issues by speaking up and/or reporting issues. The definition for these laws are still being written today, as more people are speaking out against the abuse.

===Lack of civility===

[[Incivility]] is the polar opposite of civility, or in other words a lack or completely without civility. Verbal or physical attacks on others, [[cyber bullying]], [[rudeness]], [[religious intolerance]], [[discrimination]], and [[vandalism]] are just some of the acts that are generally considered acts of incivility. Incivility is a negative part of society that has impacted many people in the United States, but as the world is becoming increasingly more transparent in social interactions, it has become more increasingly apparent that incivility has become an issue on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |work= InDC Journal |url= http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |accessdate= 2006-11-25 |date= 2004-10-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate= 2013-01-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media and the web have given people the ability around the globe to freely exchange ideas, but it has not come without its consequences.

Politicians in the U.S. have frequently cited that they encounter a lack of civility in their workplace, and have disregarded it as unfortunate aspect of politics, but polls indicate that "going negative" can help candidates win elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate [[Donald Trump]] has regularly called his rivals "stupid, incompetent and losers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bush Appeals for Civility in GOP Race |work=US News |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2015/07/28/bush-appeals-for-civility-in-gop-race |accessdate=2015-08-16 |date= 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that incivility online, more commonly referred to as cyber bullying, has become an increasing problem that takes away from a positive online experience. Recognizing that people harassing others online has become a problem and can have negative consequences for businesses, many companies have stepped up to create more awareness and initiatives to help. [[Intel]] in collaboration with organizations such as the [[Born This Way Foundation]] and [[Vox Media]] have made an initiative called "Hack Harassment" aimed to increase awareness of online harassment and anti-harassment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hack Harassment |work= Hack Harassment |url=http://www.hackharassment.com/ |accessdate=2016-01-17 |date= 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no claim of solution for what can be done to stop online harassment, but many studies suggest that a large number of people are harassed online.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Although there are many tactics to block cyber-bullying, such as censorship and banning users from accessing a site, it does not correct the underlying issues on what causes it in the first place. Although blocking people online from bullying others may solve some of the issues on the web, it may only manifest itself in other forms offline and in person where the possibility for violence and other physical harm could take place.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On April 22, 2016 The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the [[University of Chicago]] released a report citing that 74 percent of Americans think manners and behavior have declined in the United States. In this study they discovered that people in most cases can agree with what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. They found that 8 out of 10 Americans find jokes made based on race, gender, or sexuality are considered inappropriate, but only a small number of people owning up to actually making these types of jokes ever. Although there were some differences between age demographics on newer technologies, such as the use of cell phones. The report suggests that nearly half of all Americans 18-29 find it acceptable to use their cell phones in a restaurant, while less than 22 percent of people over the age of 60 years old agrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Americans believe civility is on the decline |work= The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==

===Movement to foster civility in Canada===

In July 2012, the President of the [[Federation of Law Societies of Canada]] made a strong point on civility at the 5th Biennial International Legal Ethics Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wooley |first=Alice |year=2013 |title= 'Uncivil by Too Much Civility'? Critiquing Five More Years of Civility Regulation in Canada|journal=Dalhousie Law Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=239 |ssrn=2186930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation is often very open for interpretation, unless strictly and prohibitively defined by law, but in most cases where the law is yet to be defined many lawyers can see opportunity to act immorally to win their case. The "anything to get the job done" mentality can not only have negative consequences in the legal system, but it could possibly further spread the potential for laws and regulations to be exploited in immoral manner.

Additionally, during 2012, the Law Society of Upper Canada decided that Joe Groia was guilty of his incivility to opposing counsel during his successful defense of John Felderhof from [[Insider trading]] and securities charges. On the same case, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] confirmed the decision of [[Bar of Quebec]] that Giles Dore was guilty of professional misconduct because of an uncivil letter he wrote to a judge. This high-profile case brought a lot of attention to the legal definition of the word civility, and what it means to be civil in the legal profession. It has since defined a broader set of rules of what is legally considered civil in the court of law in Canada.

Since the case with Joe Groia, [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]] has launched several initiatives to guard against incivility in the Canadian legal profession. To enforce The Law Society's stance on the issues of civility in the Canadian legal system, they have issued verbal warnings to lawyers who are not civil with judges and other lawyers. The counter argument against civility measures in if the new guidelines inhibit their ability to defend their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Has the so-called civility movement already won? |work=National Magazine |url=http://www.nationalmagazine.ca/Articles/January-2015-Web/Out-of-order.aspx |accessdate=2015-09-17 |date= 2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since laws and rules are often open to interpretation, some lawyers consider it a [[conflict of interest]] to be civil with their opponents as they do not believe there is any way to accomplish their goals while remaining civil.

In January 2017, the BC &amp; Yukon Freemasons in Canada stated civility being like The [[Golden Rule]], defined as "treating others as you would want them to treat you". This statement was in part to a recent civility initiative grounded in respect and attitude of inclusiveness with family, community, and the society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=January 20, 2017 |title=Freemason’s Civility Initiative Outline by BC and Yukon Freemasons- 2017|publisher= Masonic Civility |quote= Civility can simply be defined as treating others as you would want them to treat you.  |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freemasons_civility_initiative_outline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In New Zealand==

===Movement to foster civility in New Zealand===

At a recent address with Gisborne's top businesswomen in early 2016, Lara Meyer an adviser to the Australian Government cited incivility in the workplace has cost New Zealand approximately $15 Million a year. Noting that Australia is also losing out about $26 Million a year due to a lack of workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Counting the cost of rudeness |work=The Gisborne Herald |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2255300-135/counting-the-cost-of-rudeness |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There could even potentially be more loss that is unaccounted for in New Zealand businesses, as the cost of rudeness could be holding them back from working together more politely and agreeably.

[[Image:Dalmatiek.jpg|thumb|175px|Ornately embroidered dalmatic (shown from the back with an appareled [[amice]])]]
The '''dalmatic''' is a long, wide-sleeved [[tunic]], which serves as a liturgical [[vestment]] in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[United Methodist]], and some other churches. When used, it is the proper vestment of a [[deacon]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other services. Although infrequent, it may also be worn by [[bishop]]s above the [[alb]] and below the [[chasuble]].

Like the chasuble worn by priests and bishops, it is an outer vestment and is supposed to match the [[liturgical colors|liturgical colour]] of the day. The dalmatic is often made of the same material and decoration as a chasuble, so as to form a matching pair. Traditional [[Solemn Mass]] vestment sets include matching chasuble, dalmatic, and [[tunicle]].

A dalmatic is also worn by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] during the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation service]].

== History ==
In the [[Roman Empire]], the dalmatic was an amply sleeved [[tunic]] with wide stripes ''(clavi)'' that were sometimes worked with elaborate designs. Dalmatics had become typical attire for upper-class women in the latter part of the 3rd century AD. They are pictured in a few funerary portraits on shrouds from [[Antinoopolis]] in [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Walker, ''Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000), pp. 25, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary sources record dalmatics as imperial gifts to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''Ancient Faces,'' p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dalmatic was a garment of [[Byzantine dress]], and was adopted by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] of the [[Russian Empire]] as a coronation and liturgical vestment. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[icon]]s of [[Jesus Christ]] as [[monarch|King]] and Great [[wiktionary:High Priest|High Priest]] he is shown in a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Uspenskii, B. A., ''Tsar' i Patriarkh: kharizma vlasti v Rossii'', Moscow, Shkola "Iazyki russkoi kul'tury," 1998, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a normal item of clothing at the time when ecclesiastical clothes began to develop separately around the fourth century, worn over a longer tunic by the upper classes, and as the longest part of the dress of men of lower rank.

== Roman Catholic Church ==
The dalmatic is a robe with wide sleeves; it reaches to at least the knees or lower. In 18th-century vestment fashion, it is customary to slit the under side of the sleeves so that the dalmatic becomes a mantle like a [[scapular]] with an opening for the head and two square pieces of the material falling from the shoulder over the upper arm. Modern dalmatics tend to be longer and have closed sleeves, with the sides being open below the sleeve. The distinctive ornamentation of the vestment consists of two vertical stripes running from the shoulder to the hem; according to Roman usage these stripes are narrow and sometimes united at the bottom by two narrow cross-stripes. Outside of Rome the vertical stripes are quite broad and the cross-piece is on the upper part of the garment. At a [[Pontifical High Mass]], a dalmatic (usually made of lighter material) is worn by the bishop under the chasuble. At solemn papal liturgical occasions the Pope is assisted by two [[Cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal deacon|cardinal-deacons]] vested in a dalmatic and wearing a ''mitra simplex'' (simple white [[mitre]]).

In the Roman Catholic Church the [[subdeacon]]s wore a vestment called the [[tunicle]], which was originally distinct from a dalmatic, but by the 17th century the two had become identical, though a tunicle was often less ornamented than a dalmatic, the main difference often being only one horizontal stripe versus the two becoming a deacon's vestment. Additionally, unlike deacons, subdeacons do not wear a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] under their tunicle. Today, the tunicle is rare in the Roman Catholic Church as only certain authorized clerical societies (such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]]) have subdeacons.

Traditionally the dalmatic was not used in the Roman rite by deacons during Lent. In its place, depending on the point in the liturgy, was worn either a folded [[chasuble]] or what was called a broad [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], which represented a rolled-up chasuble. This tradition went back to a time at which the dalmatic was still considered an essential secular garment and thus not appropriate to be worn during the penitential season of Lent.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Eastern tradition ==
[[Image:Placing Gospel Book onto Antimension at end of Liturgy.jpeg|thumb|200px|Bishop wearing a ''[[sakkos]]'']]
In the [[Byzantine Rite]] the ''[[sakkos]]'', which is elaborately decorated and amply cut, usually worn by the bishops as an outer vestment in place of a presbyter's ''[[phelonion]]'' and which, like the ''phelonion'', corresponds to the western [[chasuble]] and [[cope]], is derived from Byzantine imperial dress, and hence is identical in origin to the Western dalmatic.

In all [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern rites]] the ''[[sticharion]]'' (which is analogous to the Western [[alb]]), of the ornate sort worn by deacons and lower clergy, is sometimes referred to as a dalmatic.

The '''Duchy of Gascony''' or '''Duchy of Vasconia''' ({{lang-eu|Baskoniako dukerria}}; {{lang-oc|ducat de Gasconha}}; {{lang-fr|duché de Gascogne, duché de Vasconie}}) was a duchy in present southwestern France and northeastern Spain, part corresponding to the modern region of [[Gascony]] after 824. The Duchy of Gascony, then known as ''Wasconia'', was originally a [[Francia|Frankish]] march formed to hold sway over the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques (Vascones)]]. However, the Duchy went through different periods, from its early years with its distinctively Basque element to the merger in personal union with the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] to the later period as a dependency of the [[Plantagenet]] kings of England.

In the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Charles V of France]] conquered most of [[Guyenne|Gascony]] by 1380, and under [[Charles VII of France]] it was incorporated into the kingdom of France in its entirety in 1453. The corresponding portion within [[Spain]] became part of the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Basque Kingdom of Navarre]].

==History==

===Formation===
{{further|Aquitani|Gallia Aquitania}}
Gascony was the core territory of Roman [[Gallia Aquitania]]. This province, by the 2nd century, was extended to include much of western [[Roman Gaul]], as far north as the [[Loire]]. Thus, the name of the ''[[Aquitani]]'' came to be transferred to the territory of central-western France later known as the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]]. In 293, [[Diocletian]] re-created the original province of Caesar's Aquitania under the name of [[Novempopulania]] or ''Aquitania Tertia''.

The ''[[Vascones]]'' were a people of the southwestern Pyrenees in the Roman period, but by the end of the 6th century, the Vascones defined a confederacy of native tribes with similar language and traditions on both sides of the Pyrenees who had not been culturally Romanized. Around 580, both the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and the [[kingdom of the Franks]] launched major campaigns against the Basques. In 587 Basques are cited as raiding the plains of Aquitaine, maybe to the west of [[History of Toulouse|Toulouse]]. [[Chilperic I]] sent his duke [[Bladastes]] stationed in Toulouse, but was defeated. After taking the throne, [[Leovigild]] launched a series of military campaigns around the Iberian Peninsula, taking control from the Basques ("''partes Vasconiae''") in the upper reaches of the Ebro (present-day Álava, possibly up to the north of Castile), and founded a fortress called Victoriacum (dubiously [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], possibly [[Iruña-Veleia]]).

This military push from a stronger centralized authority in Toledo placed more pressure on the Basques to get off the Ebro rich farmland than those already stretching all the way to the Garonne. In this period (585), the count of Bordeaux Galactorius is cited as fighting the Basques, who are portrayed as hiding out in the mountains, and the Cantabrians.

===Early Frankish period (602–660)===
[[File:Dux wasconum2.png|thumb|Duchy of Vasconia (602-610)]]
In 602, the [[Merovingians]] created a frontier duchy to their southwest during the tripartite wars between Franks, Visigoths, and Basques. A certain  ''Genial'' was then appointed ''[[Dukes of Gascony|dux wasconum]]'' as a way of better handling their relations with the Basques. At the same time, the Visigoths created the [[Duchy of Cantabria]] as a buffer against the Basques inhabiting west of current [[Navarre]].
The march of Vasconia (or Wasconia) was created with the purpose of controlling  the Basques in [[Novempopulania]], but it extended at this stage on the lands south and around the axis provided by the river [[Garonne]] between Bordeaux and Toulouse. About this period duke Francio is reported to vow allegiance to the Franks in [[Cantabria#Middle Ages|Cantabria]], an area inhabited by the Basques, but c. 612, the Gothic king Sisebut seems to have conquered the territory.

By the year 602, the duchy of Vasconia, under Frankish overlordship, was consolidated in the areas around the [[Garonne]] river but it may have extended up to Cantabria, under Frankish domain at the time of and before the creation of the Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;Azkarate Garai-Olaun, A. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23–50}} In the years 610 and 612 respectively, the Gothic kings [[Gundemar]] and [[Sisebut]] launched attacks against the Basques. After a Basque attack in the [[Ebro]] valley in the year 621, [[Swinthila]] defeated them and founded the fortress of [[Olite]].

In 626, the Basques rebelled against the Franks, with the [[bishop of Eauze]] being exiled on the accusation of supporting or sympathising with the Basque rebels,&lt;ref&gt;Fredegarius. IV, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; while in 635 a gigantic Frankish expedition led by the duke Arnebert and 9 more dukes launched an attack against the Basques, forcing them to retreat to the mountains, while Arnebert's column was defeated in [[Soule|Subola]], maybe near [[Tardets-Sorholus|Tardets]]. However, the Basques' relish was short-lived since they were brought to heel by Dagobert (Clichy, 636).&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"&gt;Collins, R. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}} By 626, it is certain that the duchy extended up to the Pyrenees and Vasconia had replaced Novempopulania as a preferred name for the geographical area between the Pyrenees and the Garonne. In 643, there was another rebellion to the north of the Pyrenees and in 642 and 654 they battled against the Visigoths to the south, in Saragossa.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"&gt;Collins, R. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} From 589 to 684, the [[Bishop of Pamplona]] was absent from the Visigothic [[Councils of Toledo]], which is interpreted by some as the result of this city being under Basque or Frankish control.

===Personal union with Aquitaine (660–769)===
[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|250px|thumb|Duchy of Vasconia after the Battle of Poitiers (734-743)]]
[[File:North and south of the Pyrenees (Year 760).jpg|250px|thumb|Duchy of Vasconia and both sides of the Pyrenees (760)]]

In the year 660, [[Felix of Aquitaine]], a patrician from Toulouse of Gallo-Roman stock, received the ducal title of both Vasconia and [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] (located between the Garonne and [[Loire]] rivers), effectively ruling independently over Vasconia and at least part of Aquitaine. Under Felix and his successors, Frankish overlordship over these lands became merely nominal, and Vasconia became a prominent regional power. The ''[[Ravenna Cosmography|Ravena Cosmography]]'' cites "Wasconia" as extending up to the [[Loire]], although the real concept behind the name is contested; it further divides the territory into Guasconia (north of [[Garonne]]) and Spanoguasconia (south of Garonne).  

Independent dukes [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]], Odo, Hunald and [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]] succeeded him respectively, with the last three belonging to the same lineage. Their ethnicity is not certain, since records and their names are not conclusive.

But the [[Muslim conquest of Iberia|Umayyad invasion]] of 711 effected a complete shift in trends. Hitherto the duke [[Odo the Great]] had been independent, refusing to recognise the authority of either the Merovingian king or his [[mayor of the palace]]. In 714, [[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] was captured by the Umayyads. In 721, Odo defeated the Arabian-African forces at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]].&lt;ref name=Lewis65&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald R. Lewis |year= 1965 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin |isbn=  |pages=378–379 |accessdate=September 11, 2012|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|21}} However, in 732 he was utterly routed at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] near [[Bordeaux]], after which the Muslim troops under [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] plundered the country and captured [[Narbonne]]. Only by submitting to the suzerainty of his Frankish archrival, the mayor [[Charles Martel]], could they decisively defeat the Umayyad invaders at the [[Battle of Tours]]. Aquitaine and its attendant marches were then united to Francia, but Odo probably kept ruling the Duchy of Vasconia and Aquitaine about the same as before until his death.&lt;ref name=Lewis65/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Odo died c. 735, leaving his realm to his son [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|Hunald]], who desiring the former independence which had been his father's, attacked Martel's successors, starting a war which was to last for two generations. In 743, the situation was further complicated by the arrival of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturian]] forces attacking Vasconia from the west. In 744, Hunald abdicated to his son [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], who repeatedly challenged Frankish overlordship. After a campaign against the Umayyads in [[Septimania]], the king [[Pepin the Short]] turned his attention to Aquitaine and Waifer, unleashing a devastating [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war on Aquitaine]] (Vasconia included) that was to have dire consequences on its population, towns and society.&lt;ref name=Lewis65/&gt;{{rp|27}} Waifer and his Basque troops confronted Pepin several times but were defeated thrice in 760, 762, and 766, after which Aquitaine and Vasconia pledged loyalty to Pepin and Waifer was eventually murdered by desperate followers, or possibly by someone bribed by Pepin.

===Carolingian duchy (769–864)===
Beginning in 778, [[Charlemagne]] did appoint counts (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Fezensac) on the bordering lands of Vasconia along the banks of the river Garonne, so undermining the influence of the dukes of Vasconia.

The Basques however found a pivotal ally in the south in the Basque Muslim realm of the [[Banu Qasi]] (early 9th century), and enjoyed some safety from the west, as the Asturians were immersed in continuous dynastic conflicts.
The time of Charlemagne's reign was rife with conflicts between Basques, Franks and Muslims. Most famous is the [[Battle of Roncevaux]] in 778, during which Basques ambushed and slaughtered Charlemagne's rearguard after the Franks destroyed the walls of Pamplona. Heavily mythologised from the 11th century on as a clash between Christians and Muslims, this battle became one of the most celebrated events in the legendary [[Matter of France]].

Muslims attacked Vasconia as well, taking possession of Pamplona for some time, but they were expelled by a rebellion in 798-801 that helped to create the Basque Muslim realm of the Banu Qasi around [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]. In 806 Pamplona, still under Cordovan rule, was attacked by the Franks; and the Pamplonese, led by a certain Velasco, pledged allegiance to Charlemagne again, but his tenure proved short lived. At about 814, an anti-Frankish faction led by Enecco, allied with the Banu Qasi, seems to have taken over again. A Frankish army was sent to quash the revolt, to little effect. Furthermore, on their way north through Roncevaux an ambush was attempted, but resulted in a stalemate as the Franks had taken Basque women and children hostage.

Northern Basques, organized in the Duchy of Vasconia, collaborated with Franks during campaigns such as the capture of [[Barcelona]] in 799 but after the death of Charlemagne in 814, uprisings started anew. The revolt in Pamplona crossed the Pyrenees north and in 816 [[Louis the Pious]] deposed the Basque Duke [[Semen I Lop of Gascony|Seguin]] of Bordeaux for failing to suppress or sympathising with the rebellion, so starting a widespread revolt, led by [[García I Jiménez of Gascony|García Jiménez]] (according to late traditions, a near-kinsman of [[Íñigo I of Pamplona|Íñigo Arista]], to be the first monarch of Pamplona) and newly appointed duke Lupus Centullo (c. 820). Meanwhile, in Aragon the pro-Frankish Count Aznar Galindo was overthrown by Enecco´s allied Count Gartzia Malo, with Aznar Galindo in turn seeking refuge in Frankish-held territory. Louis the Pious received the submission of rebel Basque lords in Dax, but things were far from settled.

In 824 the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|second Battle of Roncevaux]] took place, when counts [[Aeblus|Eblo]] and [[Aznar Galindez I|Aznar Galindo]] (identified as [[Aznar Sánchez]] too), Frankish vassals and the latter appointed Duke of Gascony, were captured by the joint Pamplonese and Banu Qasi forces, strengthening the independence of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Pamplona]]. In the early 9th century the lands around the Adour river were segregated from the Duchy under the name of County of Vasconia. Count Aznar's successor, [[Sancho Sánchez of Gascony|Sans Sancion]], fought against [[Charles the Bald]], as Charles didn't recognize him as legitimate.

In 844, [[Vikings]] invaded Bordeaux and killed [[Seguin II of Gascony|Duke Seguin II]]. His heir [[William I of Gascony|William]] was killed trying to retake Bordeaux in 848,&lt;ref&gt;Monlezun, 342.&lt;/ref&gt; though some sources say he was only captured and later deposed by the king. By the year 853, [[Sancho Sánchez of Gascony|Sans Sancion]], the Basque leader, was recognised as duke by Charles the Bald. During that same year, Muza of Tudela, relative of the Basque princes, invaded Vasconia and made Sans prisoner. In 855, Sans died and was succeeded by [[Arnold of Gascony|Arnold]], who died fighting against the [[Norsemen|Norse]] in 864.

===Basque duchy of Gascony (864–1053)===
[[Sancho III Mitarra of Gascony|Sancho III Mitarra]] (or ''Menditarra'', cited in 864) appears to be the founder of a lineage of autochthonous independent dukes ruling Gascony up to [[Sancho VI William of Gascony|Sancho VI William]] (died in 1032), with loose ties, if any, to the Frankish Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"/&gt;{{rp|137}}

The dukes had to face Viking inroads and unrest for over a century, an instability that brought about the destruction of existing monasteries in Gascony and a decayed urban life. The dukes of Gascony faced up against the Norsemen (Vikings), and a King of Navarre is cited as providing assistance against them near Bayonne. The Gascon ducal family became tied to the rising [[Kingdom of Navarre]] by matrimonial alliances at the end of the 10th century, eventually bringing Gascony suzerain to King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] ("the Great") for a short period up to 1035.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"/&gt;{{rp|181–182}}

While the gradual decay of the Carolingian dynasty would have been expected to pave the way for a reassertion of its regional identity, new borders, a more rigid structure derived from feudalizalization, and internal Basque divergences of culture, interest and language stopped that process.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"/&gt;{{rp|179}} Dukes parcelled out the duchy as [[appanage]]s for their sons — the power of decision was gradually transferred in the 9th and 10th centuries to Gascony's smaller constituent counties, such as [[Béarn]], [[Armagnac (region)|Armagnac]], [[Bigorre]], [[Comminges]], [[Nébouzan]], [[Labourd]], etc.

The Duchy of Vasconia between the Adour and the Garonne, gradually became the Duchy of Gascony, moving away from the history of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] as [[Gascon language|Gascon]] (a romance language) took hold in 'greater Gascony', so stripping the name of its former ethnic connotations and lending it a political one. By the 11th-12th century, Basque language is believed to extend on the north-east up to the upper reaches of the Adour river, far short of its extension 300 years before.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"/&gt;{{rp|112}}

===Within the Duchy of Aquitaine (1053–1453)===
After [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho ''the Great'']]'s reign, Gascony distanced again from Pamplona. By 1053, Gascony was inherited and conquered by the Duchy of Aquitania. It thus became a part of the [[Angevin Empire]] in the 12th century. The ducal title was reemployed by [[Edward Longshanks]] and it formed a base of support for the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. [[Margaret Wade Labarge]] called it England's first foreign colony.&lt;ref&gt;Labarge.&lt;/ref&gt;

England lost Gascony as a result of its defeat in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and the region thence became a permanent part of France.

==Feudal status==
Under the Basque line of dukes that began in 864, Gascony became effectively independent of the Frankish kings. In 1004, [[Abbo of Fleury]], when visiting the monastery of [[La Réole]], claimed to be more powerful there than the king, since nobody recognised his power. Charters of La Réole are dated by the reign of the duke of Gascony and not that of the king of France. Nonetheless, charters from elsewhere in Gascony continued to be dated by the reigns of the Frankish kings down to the acquisition of Gascony by Aquitaine.{{sfn|Higounet|1963|pp=48–49}}

According to the [[cartulary]] of Saint-Seurin at Bordeaux in 1009, "the custom is that no count [of Gascony] can legitimately govern in this city of Bordeaux if he has not received the charge of the consulate, eyes lowered, from the most holy saint bishop Seurin and if he does not make an annual tribute." A later notice from between 1160 and 1180, says specifically that the would-be count must lay his sword on [[Severinus of Bordeaux|Saint Seurin]]'s altar and then only take it up again after receiving the saint's standard. These practices parallel the practice of the French kings of receiving their kingdom from [[Denis|Saint Denis]] and carrying his banner, the [[Oriflamme]]. It is possible, however, that the notices in the cartulary of Saint-Seurin, which both elevate that religious house and at the same time distance the dukes of Gascony from any French vassalage, were forged in the late 12th century to advance the cause of the Plantagenets.{{sfn|Higounet|1963|p=50}}

==Extent during the Early Frankish period==
Frankish ''Wasconia'' comprised the former [[Roman province]] of [[Novempopulania]] and, at least in some periods, also the lands south of the Pyrenees centred on [[Pamplona]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, relying on the ''[[Vita Hludowici]]''. Louis the Pious crossed the Pyrenees and "settled matters" in Pamplona, implying that it fell within his realm, obviously within the Gascon march.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the Duchy of Vasconia comprised Basque areas north and south of the [[Pyrenees]] at least until the definite detachment of [[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] from the Duchy in 824.

In 628 the Frankish king [[Dagobert I]] made arrangements for his brother [[Charibert II]] to rule over the territories between the Loire and the Pyrenees (''limes Spaniae'') 'in the general area of Vasconia', including [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], [[Perigueux]], [[Cahors]], [[Agenais]], etc.&lt;ref name=Collins90&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1990 | title = The Basques | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location=Cambridge, Ma| isbn = 0-631-17565-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–96}} In the following years, the same king is reported to have subjugated the whole of Vasconia, meaning that it extended beyond the Pyrenees as well.

The ''Ravenna Cosmographer'' refers to Vasconia as the whole territory stretching out to the [[Loire]], and so does the ''Chronicle of Fredegar'', suggesting that it lies south of the Loire.&lt;ref name="BasquesCollins"/&gt;{{rp|96}} but the nature of this naming is subject to debate. At any rate, Basques on either side of the [[Garonne]] are cited in the last independent years of the Duchy up to 768, but this year, its northern boundary was pinpointed on the river Garonne. Several authors have put down this large geographical extent of the 7th-8th centuries to an expansion of the Basques from their assumed original habitations around the Pyrenees.

==Social organisation during the Early Frankish period==
Unlike neighbouring regions, counts did not play a role in Vasconia's power share. Moreover, they were absent, and dukes are mentioned as the main figures of the Basques, immediately followed on the hierarchy by tribal chiefs and families, at least until the rise of the Carolingian dynasty.&lt;ref name=Lewis65/&gt;{{rp|7–8}}As for the judicial system, neither the Visigoth law nor Roman law seem to have been in use in the Duchy of Vasconia,&lt;ref name=Lewis65/&gt;{{rp|8}} and a native order may have prevailed at least until the Carolingian takeover in 768-769.

As of 778, Charlemagne started appointing counts (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Fezensac) on the bordering lands of Vasconia along the banks of the river Garonne, so undermining the grip on power of the dukes of Vasconia.

==Dukes and counts of Vasconia==
The names of the dukes are recorded under a bewildering number of variants, which makes identification very difficult. These dukes and counts were leaders of the Basque clans that dominated Gascony and so their native names were Basque. However, as the Gascon language gradually replaced Basque, their names are also recorded in Gascon. Indeed, eventually the dukes of Gascony probably themselves adopted Gascon, which is reflected in the declining use of authentically Basque names by the last dukes.

In written documents, their names were usually recorded in Latin, which was the favored written language at the time. Today, their names are also frequently found in their French version, and also sometimes in their Spanish version. One example: the Basque name Otsoa (meaning "wolf") was literally translated Lop in Gascon, Lupus in Latin, Loup in French, and Lobo in Spanish. Thus, Duke Otsoa II of Gascony can be known by any of these names, which confuses people not used to the local linguistic situation. Furthermore, even within a set language, there exist many different written variants, as for the Basque name Santso (from Latin ''sanctus'', meaning "holy"), which can be found in Basque documents written Antso, Sanzio, Santio, Sanxo, Sancio, and so on.

Usually, the dukes and counts of Gascony had two names, the first one being their given name, the second one being the given name of their father (for example, Duke Sans I Lop, which means this is Duke Sans I, son of Lop). This custom later generated the Spanish family names, with the adding of suffix -''ez'' meaning "son of". "Juan Sánchez" literally means "John, son of Sancho". For a few dukes of Gascony, the second name is not the given name of their father, but it is a nickname that they gained over time and that replaced the given name of their father, such as the famous duke Sans III Mitarra, where ''Mitarra'' is not the name of his father, but a nickname referring to his origin, probably "Menditarra",&lt;ref name=BasquesCollins&gt;Collins, R. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|173}} with a typical Basque ''-tarra'' suffix to express origin.

There is one duke of Gascony subject to a historiographical discussion, and that is Duke Seguin I (Segiwin, Sihimin,...). It has been contended that it actually hides a Basque "Semen"&amp;mdash;written forms ''Semeno, Xemen, Ximen'', or ''Jimeno''. It may be that native Basque name based on the word ''seme'' (meaning "son", attested in Aquitanian engravings), or it may be "Seguin" (modern Gascon "Siguin"),{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} a name of Germanic origin based on ''sig'', meaning 'victory' (cf modern German ''Sieg''), and ''win'', meaning 'friend'.

It has been suggested that some apparently Basque names are merely corruptions of late Germanic names. For example, Garsinde leading to Garsean, Gendolf or Centulf to Centule, Aginald or Hunnald to Enneko (in Flanders, and [[Frisians|Frisian]],still a short form of the first two frank names), Aginard to Aznar, Belasgytta or Wallagotha to Velasquita, Belasgutho to Velasco, Arnoald to Arnau, Theuda to Toda, Theudahilda to Dadildis or Dedadils. While some of them may be so, many of them&amp;mdash;Andregoto, Amunna, Aznar(i), Velasco, Garcia, Ximen(o), Enneco&amp;mdash;have well explained forms according to consistent linguistic rules and etymologies, as described by linguist [[Koldo Mitxelena]]. The oldest Basque medieval names reflected totemic (animal) references,&lt;ref name=DouglassBilbao&gt;{{cite book |last1=Douglass|first1=William A.|last2=Douglass|first2=Bilbao, J.|origyear=1975|year=2005 |title=Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press |isbn=0-87417-625-5 |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} and family links.

The '''[[cuisine]]''' of '''[[early modern Europe]]''' (c. 1500–1800) was a mix of dishes inherited from [[medieval cuisine]] combined with innovations that would persist in the [[modern era]]. Though there was a great influx of new ideas, an increase in foreign trade and a [[scientific revolution]], preservation of foods remained traditional: preserved by drying, salting and smoking or pickling in [[vinegar]]. Fare was naturally dependent on the season: a cookbook by Domenico Romoli called "Panunto" made a virtue of necessity by including a recipe for each day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Romoli, ''La singolar dottrina'', Venice, 1560.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The discovery of the [[New World]], the establishment of new trade routes with [[Asia]] and increased foreign influences from [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] meant that Europeans became familiarized with a multitude of new foodstuffs. [[Spice]]s that previously had been prohibitively expensive luxuries, such as [[Piper (genus)|pepper]], [[cinnamon]], [[cloves]], [[nutmeg]], and [[ginger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Grendler | first1 = Paul F. | title = The Renaissance : an encyclopedia for student | year = 2004 | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | isbn = 0-684-31283-2 | page =  90}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon became available to the majority population, and the introduction of new plants coming from the New World and India like [[maize]], [[potato]], [[sweet potato]], [[chili pepper]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[vanilla]], [[tomato]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]] transformed European cuisine forever. 

There was a very great increase in prosperity in Europe during this period, which gradually reached all classes and all areas, and considerably changed the patterns of eating. Everywhere both doctors and chefs continued to characterize foodstuffs by their effects on the [[Humorism|four humours]]: they were considered to be heating or cooling to the constitution, moistening or drying.  [[Nationalism]] was first conceived in the [[early modern period]], but it was not until the 19th century that the notion of a national cuisine emerged. Class differences were far more important dividing lines, and it was almost always upper-class food that was described in recipe collections and cookbooks.

==Meals==
In most parts of Europe two meals per day were eaten, one in the early morning to noon and one in the late afternoon or later at night. The exact times varied both by period and region. In Spain and in parts of Italy such as [[Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] the early meal was the lighter one while supper was heavier. In the rest of Europe, the first meal of the day was the more substantial. Throughout the period, there was a gradual shift of mealtimes. The first meal, then called dinner in English, moved from before noon to around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon by the 17th century. By the end of the 18th century, it could be held as late as 5:00 or 6:00. This necessitated a midday meal, luncheon, later shortened to [[lunch]], which was established by the late 18th century. [[Breakfast]]&lt;ref&gt;The word "breakfast" is a [[calque]] of [[Medieval Latin]] ''disjejunare'', literally "to un-fast", and rendered ''disnare'' or ''disner'' in [[Old French]]. The word was later borrowed into [[Old English]] as "dinner" and referred to the first (accepted) meal of the day.&lt;/ref&gt; does not receive much attention in any sources. Breakfast, when it began to be fashionable, was usually just a coffee, tea or chocolate, and did not become a more substantial meal in many parts of Europe until the 19th century. In the south, where supper was the largest meal, there was less need for breakfast, and it therefore remained unimportant, something that can still be seen today in the traditionally light breakfasts of southern Europe, which usually consists of coffee or tea with bread or pastry. There is no doubt that working people since medieval times ate some sort of morning meal, but it is unclear exactly at what time and what it consisted of. The three-meal-regimen so common today did not become a standard until well into the [[modern period|modern era]].&lt;ref&gt;Albala (2002), pp. 231-232. Referenced from [https://www.questia.com/read/117361680/food-in-early-modern-europe Questia].&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants in the early modern world commonly ate a diet that consisted of "gruels, pottages, and ... grains". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yong|date=2016|title=Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History by Rachel Laudan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2016.0020|journal=Journal of World History|volume=26|issue=1|pages=187–189|doi=10.1353/jwh.2016.0020|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the Middle Ages, breakfast in the sense of an early morning meal, is largely absent from the sources. It's unclear if this meant it was universally avoided or that it simply was not fashionable enough to be mentioned, as most sources were written by, for, and about the upper class.

==Foods==

===Cereals===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Harvesters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''The Corn Harvest'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]; [[Antwerp]], 1525-1530.]]
For most of Europe, the many varieties of grain were the most important crop and formed the daily staple for segments of society. The differentiation was in the varieties, its quality and how it was prepared. The lower classes ate bread that was coarse and of considerably higher bran content while the upper classes enjoyed the finely ground, white wheat flour that most modern Europeans are used to. Wheat was considerably more expensive than other grains, and rarely eaten by many.  Most bread was made with a mixture of wheat and other grains.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, pp.105-29&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grain remained the undisputed main staple of early modern Europe until the 17th century. By this time the skepticism towards New World imports such as [[potato]]es and [[maize]] had softened among the general populace, and the potato in particular found new appreciation in [[northern Europe]], where it was a much more productive and flexible crop than wheat. In Ireland, this would later have disastrous results. In the early 19th century, when much of the country depended almost exclusively on potato, the [[Phytophthora infestans|potato blight]], a fungus that rotted the edible tubers of the potato plant while still in the ground, caused a massive famine that killed over a million people and forced another two million to emigrate. In regions of Europe such as [[Scotland]], [[Scandinavia]] and northern [[Russia]], the climate and soil types were less suited for wheat cultivation, and rye and barley were far more important. Rye was used to bake the dense, dark bread that is still common in countries like Sweden, Russia and Finland. Barley was more common in the north, and was often used to make [[beer]].

[[Oats]] made up a considerable minority of the produced grain but stood very low in status and was commonly used as animal feed, especially for horses. [[Millet]], grown in much of Europe since prehistoric times was still used throughout much of the early period, but had largely disappeared by the 18th century although its exceptional storage period of up to twenty years meant it was used for emergency reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the Italian dish [[polenta]], previously made from millet, later was made with [[maize]]. [[Pasta]] had been a common food since the middle of the medieval period, and gained in popularity during the early modern period (notably in [[Naples]], where it was not often seen until the late 18th century), but it was not yet usual to use the hard variety of [[durum wheat]] or [[semolina]] to make dried pasta until the [[Industrialization|Industrial era]]. [[Rice]] became established in many places, especially Italy and Spain, during the period, but was regarded as a low-status food; the well-off might occasionally have [[rice pudding]] but otherwise ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, pp. 110-11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pea]]s and beans, which made up a very large part of the diet of the medieval poor, were still often treated as a staple food, but to a diminishing extent over the period, to be replaced by cereals and the potato.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, pp. 112-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meats===

No parts of animals were wasted; blood was used in soups, for [[blood sausage]]s, [[tripe]] was an ingredient in stews, soups or pies, and even cuts that clearly reminded of the live creature were readily consumed. Calf's head could be served as a separate dish, and eating eyes, tongue or cheeks was not seen as problematic; in some regions they were even considered to be delicacies.

European consumption of meat remained exceptional by world standards, and during the period high levels generally moved down the social scale.  But the poor continued to rely mainly on [[egg (food)|egg]]s, dairy products, and pulses for [[protein]].  Often they did better in the less populated regions, where wild game and fish could still easily be found.  The richer nations, especially England, ate considerably more meat than the poorer ones.  In some areas, especially Germany and the Mediterranean counties, the meat consumption of ordinary people actually declined, beginning in about 1550, and continuing throughout the period.  Increasing population seem to lie behind this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel pp. 190-99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fats===
A map of Early Modern Europe could be drawn based on the characteristic [[fat]]s that predominated: [[olive oil]], [[butter]] and [[lard]]. These kitchen staples had not changed since Roman times, but the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] that coincided with Early Modern Europe affected the northernmost regions where olives would flourish. Only olive oil was a subject of long-distance trade.

===Sugar===
[[Sugarcane|Cane sugar]], native to India, was already known in Europe in the Middle Ages, expensive and mainly regarded as a [[medicine]].  From the end of the 17th century, greatly increased New World production struggled to meet the increase in European demand, so that by the end of the period the maritime nations of England, France, the Low and Iberian Countries were consuming large quantities, but other parts of Europe used it far less.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, pp. 224-7&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, modern distinctions between sweet and savoury dishes were becoming general; meat dishes were much less likely to be sweetened than in the Middle Ages.

==Drink==
[[File:Pietro Longhi La cioccolata del mattino The Morning Chocolate 1775-1780.jpg|thumb|200px|''The morning chocolate'' by [[Pietro Longhi]]; Venice, 1775-1780.]]
[[Water]] as a neutral table beverage did not appear in Europe until well into the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial era]], when efficient water purification could ensure safe drinking water. All but the poorest drank mildly [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]] on a daily basis, for every meal; [[wine]] in the south, [[beer]] in the north, east and [[middle Europe]]. Both drinks came in many varieties, vintages and at varying qualities. Those northerners who could afford to do so drank imported wines, and wine remained an integral part of the [[Eucharist]], even for the poor. [[Ale]] had been the most common form of beer in England through most of the Middle Ages, but was mostly replaced with [[hops|hopped]] beer from the [[Low Countries]] in the 16th century.

===Spirits===
The art of distillation was perfected in Europe during the 15th century, and many of today's most common and familiar spirits were invented and perfected before the 18th century. [[Brandy]] (from Low German ''Brandwein'' via Dutch ''brandewijn'', meaning "distilled wine") first appeared in 15th-century Germany. When the English and Dutch were in fierce competition for the control of the lucrative European export market, the Dutch encouraged wine growing outside the [[Bordeaux]] area, where the English had strong connections. The result that the regions of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]] and [[Armagnac (region)|Armagnac]] became famous for producing high-quality brandy. [[Whisky]] and [[schnapps]] were produced in small household stills. Whisky became fashionable, commercialised and exported in the 19th century. [[Gin]], grain liquor flavored with [[juniper]], was invented by the Dutch and commercial production by [[Lucas Bols]] began in the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was later refined in England and became immensely popular among the English working classes.

In the [[triangular trade]] which began in the 16th and 17th century between Europe, North America and the Caribbean, [[rum]] was one of the most important commodities. It was made from [[molasses]] and was one of the most important products made from the sugar grown on the [[Caribbean]] Islands and in [[Brazil]].

===Coffee, tea and chocolate===
Before the Early modern period, the social drinks of Europe had all been alcoholic. With the increased contact with Asia and Africa and the discovery of the Americas meant that Europeans came into contact with [[tea]], [[coffee]] and [[drinking chocolate]]. But it was not until the 17th century that all three products became popular as social beverages. The new drinks contained [[caffeine]] or [[theobromine]], both mild stimulants that are not intoxicating in the same way as alcohol. Chocolate was the first drink to gain popularity, and was one of the preferred drinks of the Spanish nobility in the 16th and early 17th century. All three remained very expensive throughout the early modern period.

==National cuisines==
As nations began to form in Europe, the foundations of cuisine had begun to form.  Although nationalization of many of today's European nations had not occurred in early modern Europe, many of the characteristics that establish a national cuisine began to emerge.  These attributes included attributes such as the emergence of professional chefs, professional kitchens, the printing of codified culinary texts, and educated diners.

===France===
{{main|French cuisine#Ancien régime|l1=French cuisine}}
In France in particular, this characteristic change came from the specialization of culinary skills by-way-of [[guild]]s.  The two major separations of guilds were between those who supplied raw products and those who prepared them.  Those who were members of guilds, specialized in specific forms of cookery, including [[baker]]s, [[pastrycook]]s, [[Saucier|saucemaker]]s, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s.  It was through this specialization that many of the well-known French dishes of today began to take hold, but it was not until the 17th century that France's [[haute cuisine]] would begin codification with [[François Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]] the author of works such as Cvisinier françois and  Le Parfait confitvrier, he is credited with publishing the first true French [[cookbook]].  His [[recipe]]s marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, pp. 114-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th and 16th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by Christopher Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
{{main|Italian cuisine#Early modern era|l1=Italian cuisine}}
Italy similarly was undergoing its own shift toward a national cuisine.  However, a didactic switch occurred during the early modern era which changed the cuisine from one of high court cuisine, to a regional local cuisine by the end of the era.  In the beginning of the era the courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]] and [[Ferrara]] were an integral component to the creation of fine cooking in Italy with the court of Estes in Ferrara a central figure to the creation of this high-cuisine. A number of chefs were integral to this process, including [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to Ippolito d'Este, published [[Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande]] in 1549, which detailed banquets in the first half of the book, while the second half of the book featured a multitude of recipes for items such as pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings).&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1570, Opera was written by [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], a five-volume work which to that date encompassed the most comprehensive example of Italian cooking. The work contained over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. Opera was an important text as it is seen as one of the first integral works which shed game meats in favor of domesticated animals.  Additionally "alternative" cuts of animals such as tongue, head, and shoulder appear in recipes.  Seasonality to fish and seafood dishes was also featured along with emphasis on [[Lenten]] cookery.  Opera also featured an early version of the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[pizza]], however, it was a sweet concoction unlike today's savory dish.  Turkey and maize also appear for a first time in Italy in this book.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, pp. 14,15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike France's continued path toward high-cuisine, Italy began to show a change toward regionalism and simple cooking in the late 17th century.  In 1662 the last cookbook on Italian high-cuisine was published by [[Bartolomeo Stefani]] chef to [[Gonzagas]]. L'Arte di Ben Cucinare introduced ''vitto ordinario'' ("ordinary food") to Italian cookery.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, at the beginning of the 18th century, the cookery books of Italy began to show the regionalism of Italian cuisine in order for Italian chefs to better show the pride of their regions instead of the high cuisine of France. These books were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives who could address their home cook.&lt;ref&gt;De Conte, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in booklet form, periodicals such as La cuoca cremonese (The cook of Cremona) written in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity and frequency, while the price to attain them dropped well within the reach of the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4240">'''Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy''' (12 September 1812 &amp;ndash; 17 January 1878) was an English historian and jurist.

==Life==
He was born the son of a Land Agent in [[Bexley]], Kent, England and educated at [[Eton College]] (where he won the [[Newcastle Scholarship]] in 1831) and [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He was called to the Bar in 1837&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CRSY831ES|name=Creasy, Edward Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed assistant judge at the Westminster sessions court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/bri/s/sir-edward-shepherd-creasy.html|title=Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy|publisher=Bible Encyclopedias|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, he began teaching history at the [[University of London]] and wrote a number of historical books including ''[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]'' (1851).

Creasy was knighted in 1860, and spent the next decade and a half in Ceylon as [[Chief Justice of Ceylon]] (1860 to 1875). He then returned in poor health to England and died in London on 17 January 1878.

Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the [[Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] from 1861 to 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalasiaticsociety.lk/about-2/past-presidents/|title=Past Presidents|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 1864 Creasy founded the [[Colombo Rowing Club]].

==Works==
Creasy's best known contribution to literature is his ''[[Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]'' (1851). It is typical of 19th century European sentiment, highly Eurocentric, with references to the barbarism and immorality of non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Creasy |first1=Edward |title=The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: From Marathon to Waterloo |date=22 March 1994 |publisher=Da Capo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason Creasy gives for the significance of many of the fifteen battles, is that they denied Eastern peoples access to European soil.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Other battles are seen as "decisive" because they shaped the development of Britain, which was the world's leading power at the time of writing.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Other works included are:

'''France Klopčič''' (25 October 1903 - 25 April 1984) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[historian]], [[author]], [[translation|translator]] and [[Communist]] political activist.

He was born in the town of [[L'Hôpital, Moselle|L'Hôpital]] ({{lang-de|Spittel}}), [[France]], then part of the [[German Empire|German]] province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where his father worked as an industrial worker. In 1909, the family moved to the industrial town of [[Zagorje ob Savi]]. He attended high school in [[Ljubljana]]. Already as a teenager, he became a member of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], and became one of the leasers of the Communist Youth in [[Slovenia]]. During the 1920s, he worked as a journalist for [[left wing]] newspapers. He strongly opposed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] centralism, and advocated the establishment of a socialist and federal Yugoslavia. In 1924, he took part in the armed clash between the Communist-organized workers' units and members of the Yugoslav nationalist militiamen of the [[ORJUNA]] organization that took place in the industrial town of [[Trbovlje]]. Between 1926 and 1929, he was in the leadership of the Slovenian section of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During this period, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Yugoslav authorities on two occasions.

In 1930, he emigrated to the [[Soviet Union]]. In the mid-1930s, he was accused of counter-revolutionary activity, and imprisoned. He was released in 1945, but had to remain in the Soviet Union because of his disapproval of the [[Informbiro]] declaration. In 1956, he was released at the request of the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] authorities.

After his return to Yugoslavia, he settled in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and became a professional historian, focusing on the history of the worker movement in Slovenia, and on the history of the Communist Party. Together with [[Dušan Kermavner]], he was one of the foremost Communist historians of the Socialist movement in Slovenia. He was also vocal in the defence of the federalist system in Yugoslavia and of the autonomy of the single Yugoslav republics against centralist pressures.

He was also a prolific translator from [[Russian language|Russian]] into [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Among other, he translated several works of [[Lenin]] and [[Mayakovsky]]. In 1964, he translated [[Solzhenitsyn]]'s novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.

He died in Ljubljana.

He was the brother of the [[social realist]] poet [[Mile Klopčič]], and the uncle of the film director [[Matjaž Klopčič]].

The '''Gawis cranium''' is a portion of a fossil [[hominin]] skull discovered on February 16, 2006 near the drainage of [[Gawis, Ethiopia|Gawis]], a tributary of the [[Awash River]] in the [[Afar Depression]], [[Ethiopia]]. Despite the presence of volcanic ash layers that are key to dating, the cranium is only generally dated between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago due to [[Taphonomy|taphonomic]] issues. 

The 2006 discovery was reported by [[Sileshi Semaw]], director of the [[Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project|Gona Project]], which is based at the Stone Age Institute and Indiana University Bloomington's CRAFT research center.

==Discovery and significance==


The hominin skull was discovered by [[Asahmed Humet]], a member of the [[Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project]]; he found the recently resurfaced fossil in a small erosion gully that empties into the Gawis river drainage basin in the [[Afar Region]], some 300 miles northeast of [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/3142.html|title=Scientists discover hominid cranium in Ethiopia: IU News Room: Indiana University|last=|first=|date=|website=newsinfo.iu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skull is a nearly complete cranium of what is believed to be a [[Middle Pleistocene]] human ancestor. While different from a modern human, the braincase, upper face and jaw of the cranium have unmistakable anatomical evidence that belong to human ancestry. The discovery was reported by [[Sileshi Semaw]], director of the Gona Project at the [[Stone Age Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sileshi+Semaw%22+gawis&amp;btnG=Search&lt;/ref&gt; Semaw noted the skull fossil could be a [[transitional fossil|transitional form]] that fills a gap in human evolutionary origins; he described its appearance as intermediate between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

Significant archaeological collections of stone tools and numerous fossil animal specimens were also found at the site. 

Gawis is in the Gona Research Project study area situated in the Awash River Valley. Immediately to the east of Gona, also located along the Awash and one of its tributaries is the site of [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]], where in 1974 U.S. scientist [[Donald Johanson]] found the 3.2-million-year-old remains of an ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', known as [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]. The [[Middle Awash]] project, site of many other hominin discoveries, is to the south.

In addition to the Gawis cranium, the Gona project area has yielded some of the world's oldest stone tools (2.6 million years old), as well as fossils of ''Ardipithecus ramidus''—[[hominid]], and debated as whether or not [[hominin]]—dated to approximately 4.5 million years ago.

[[File:Geneva gown.png|thumb|right|A [[Presbyterian]] pastor wearing a Geneva gown over a cassock with white preaching tabs.]]
[[File:LutheranClergy.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Lutheran minister in Geneva gown.]]
The '''Geneva gown''', also called a '''pulpit gown''', '''pulpit robe''', or '''preaching robe''', is an [[ecclesiastical]] [[garment]] [[convention (norm)|customarily]] worn by [[ordained]] [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] in the [[Christian church]]es that arose out of the historic [[Protestant Reformation]].  It is particularly associated with Protestant churches of the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[Methodist]] tradition.

== Description ==
The gown, analogous to the [[Western culture|Western]] [[academic regalia|doctoral robe]] and similar to [[United States|American]] [[court dress|judicial attire]], is constructed from heavy material, most appropriately of black color, and usually features double-bell sleeves with a cuff (mimicking the [[cassock]] once worn under it) and [[velvet]] facings (or panels) running over the neck and down both sides of the front enclosure length-wise, mimicking the ecclesiastical tippet once worn over it.

A minister who has earned an [[academic]] [[doctoral degree]] in any of the [[theological]] disciplines ([[Doctor of Divinity|DD]], [[Doctor of Ministry|D.Min.]], [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|STD]], [[Doctor of Theology|Th.D.]]) or in the [[academic discipline|liberal arts and sciences]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], [[Doctor of Arts|DA]]) may adorn each sleeve with three [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] or bars of velvet cloth in black or scarlet red, signifying senior [[intellectual|scholarly]] credentials. The velvet panels of the gown's facings match the chevrons. Some doctoral gowns also have black velvet chevrons and panels, and adorned with red piping.

Contemporary [[choir]] robes and other expressions of lay [[vestment|vesture]] are inspired by, but remain distinct from, the Geneva gown.

== Purpose ==
The simple yet dignified gown is meant to convey the authority and solemn duty of the ordained [[Minister (Christianity)|ministry]] as called by [[God]] to proclaim the [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]] of [[Jesus]] and preach the [[biblical]] Word of God, the bearer being a learned minister of the Word and [[elder (religious)|teaching elder]] (''[[presbyter]]'') over the [[church body|Church]] faithful.

Worn over street [[clothing|clothes]], traditionally a [[cassock]] but today more commonly a [[suit (clothes)|business suit]] with or without [[clerical collar]], the gown eschews ostentation, obscuring individual [[etiquette|grooming]] and concealing [[fashion]] preferences, and instead draws attention to the wearer's office and not the person.

== History ==
The Reformed [[Protestant Reformers]] of western Europe rejected the traditional dress worn by members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] because they disagreed with what it represented. Instead, they began attending church in their daily clothes, which happened to be long black robes due to the fact that the majority of the Reformation leaders were of the scholarly class. This was eventually defined as liturgical dress, and the traditional garment for those in leadership roles.&lt;ref name=liturgical&gt;{{cite journal|title=Liturgical Dress in the Uniting Church|last1=Gribben|first1=R|publisher=Assembly Commission on Liturgy|url=https://assembly.uca.org.au/images/stories/Theology_Discipleship/pdf/Liturgical_Dress_in_the_Uniting_Church-2.pdf|page=2|quote=The origins of the Geneva Gown|format=PDF|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=G|title=Christian Worship: A Theological and Historical Introduction|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-4982-3135-0|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL6CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;q=plain|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
By [[Convention (norm)|convention]] a minister may wear the gown only at expressly Christian [[rite|services]] of [[worship]] wherein a [[sermon]], that is an exposition of [[Scripture]], is delivered.

With the gown a minister may also wear [[preaching bands]] and a [[liturgical]] [[Stole (vestment)|stole]].  Less typically a minister may choose to put on white [[gloves]] when distributing the [[wikt:element|elements]] of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], a practice predating the advent of [[stainless steel]] [[Chalice (cup)|chalices]] and communion trays.

For historical and theological reasons the gown is most typical of [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Reformed]] churches, that is those [[wikt:congregation|congregations]] primarily influenced by [[Calvinist]] formulations of Christian [[doctrine]] and [[ecclesiology|church order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/worship/faq-basic.htm Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): ''Theology and Worship&amp;nbsp;– What about all the different clerical vestments?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Though historically also common with [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] clergy, its use waned in the 20th century. During that century, there was a general shift toward a less formal religious service; this movement spread across most denominational lines. In many cases, the Geneva gown was replaced by a lounge suit.

Another liturgical movement which took place was a renewed interest in medieval liturgical practices. This was an outgrowth of the 19th century [[Oxford Movement]] which took place in the [[Church of England]].  During the later half of the 20th century, the ongoing effects of this movement began to spark interest for liturgical reforms in non-Anglican denominations in America (particularly the [[United Methodist Church]] and the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]]). Today, it is not uncommon to find the [[alb]] worn by many mainline Protestant clergy during services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbod.org/worship/default_body.asp?act=reader&amp;item_id=1768 ''General Board of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church: Some Frequently Asked Questions About Clergy Attire and Proper Ways of Addressing Clergy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184628/http://www.gbod.org/worship/default_body.asp?act=reader&amp;item_id=1768 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, should not be seen as a revival of historical practice, but as part of general liturgical reforms which were occurring in denominations at that time.

The typical clerical dress of an Anglican minister during the 18th century was a [[cassock]], Geneva gown, and [[bands (neckwear)|neck bands]]. For this reason, the gown is sometimes (though rarely) found in "[[low church]]" [[parishes]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], many whom desire a continuity with the stauncher Protestant stances of the church before the influence of the [[Oxford Movement]]. In these parishes it is usual for the gown is worn for preaching, whilst the surplice is worn for the liturgy&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of the Free Church of England&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also widely used in many [[African-American]] congregations regardless of [[Christian denomination|denominational]] affiliation. Use of the gown has also waned in Lutheran churches, though it seemed to be common during the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries. Rarely is this uniquely Protestant attire worn by [[Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Roman Catholic]].

In the [[Church of Scotland]], it is normal for the Geneva gown to be vented (opened at the front), sleeveless, and worn over a cassock.  The cassock, usually black (like its counterpart in the [[Church of England]]), also comes in blue (signifying the [[Royal Blue]] in the [[Flag of Scotland]], which bears the Cross of [[St. Andrew]], the patron saint of Scotland), or scarlet red signifying a Queen's Chaplain.  This practice is sometimes followed by some English Methodists and American Presbyterians, although wearing the more familiar American-style gown, including wearing a black cassock in Roman or Anglican cut.

== Trends ==
United or [[Christian ecumenism|Uniting churches]] which contain an episcopalian element have in some countries (notably Australia; generally not in Canada) tended to abandon the Geneva gown in favor of the more symbolically [[ecumenical]] alb and [[cincture]], whereas some non-united [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] congregations have for various reasons done away with distinct ministerial dress altogether.

Some [[rabbis]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] leaders of other non-Christian [[faiths]] have fashioned their modern religious [[Clothing|garb]] patterned after the historic Geneva gown.

Among the [[Paleo-orthodoxy]] and [[emerging church]] movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, particularly [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Presbyterian]], many clergy are reclaiming not only the traditional [[Eucharist]] [[vestments]] of [[alb]] and [[chasuble]], but also [[cassock]] and [[surplice]] (typically a full-length Old English style) with appropriate liturgical stole, and cassock and Geneva gown for a Liturgy or Service of the Word.

'''Herodotus'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|h|ᵻ|ˈ|r|ɒ|d|ə|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἡρόδοτος}}, ''Hêródotos'', {{IPA-el|hɛː.ró.do.tos|att-pron}}}} ({{circa}} 484 BC – {{c.|lk=no}} 425&amp;nbsp;BC) was an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] historian who was born in [[Halicarnassus]] in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (modern-day [[Bodrum]], [[Turkey]]). He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', a detailed record of his "inquiry" ({{lang|grc|ἱστορία}} [[History#Etymology|''historía'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into a [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as "[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes a large number of obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. Herodotus, however, states that he is merely reporting what he has been told. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.

==Place in history==
Herodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''. The original title can be translated from the Greek as "researches" or "inquiries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herodotus "Herodotus"] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography.'' The Gale Group. Retrieved March 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}} as such:

{{quotation|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.|Herodotus, ''The Histories''&lt;br&gt;
Robin Waterfield translation (2008)}}

===Predecessors===
His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naïve, often charming – all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.

===Writing style===
In his introduction to Hecataeus's work, ''Genealogies'':
[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&amp;nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD]]
{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}

This points forward to the "folksy" yet "international" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as "a curious false start to history",&lt;ref name="OswynMurray"&gt;{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Preparation of the Gospel'',&amp;nbsp;X, 3&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as "Heliopolitans" (''Histories''&amp;nbsp;2.73).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.&lt;ref name="OswynMurray" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&amp;nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His debt to previous authors of prose "histories" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&amp;nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&amp;nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&amp;nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&amp;nbsp;904-920).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp&amp;nbsp;181-182, n.904-920&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|“In the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary and modern critics===
It is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics in early modern times branded him "The Father of Lies".&lt;ref name="BurnHerodotus"&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:
{{quotation|
Herodotus the son of Sphynx &lt;br&gt;
lies; in Ionic history without peer; &lt;br&gt;
a Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand &lt;br&gt;
and made in Thuria his new native land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Yet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&amp;nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes – a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Tritle. (2004). ''The Peloponnesian War''. Greenwood Publishing Group. pp&amp;nbsp;147-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Hart. (1982). ''Herodotus and Greek History''. Taylor and Francis. p&amp;nbsp;174&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a "logos-writer" (story-teller).&lt;ref name="OswynMurray_a"&gt;{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.&lt;ref&gt;Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). (1998). ''The Histories by Herodotus''. University of Oxford Press. “Introduction”, p&amp;nbsp;xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the ''[[polis]]'' or city-state. The interplay of civilizations was more relevant to Greeks living in Anatolia, such as Herodotus himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent memory.&lt;ref name="OswynMurray_a" /&gt;
{{quotation|Before the Persian crisis, history had been represented among the Greeks only by local or family traditions. The "Wars of Liberation" had given to Herodotus the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a Greek. These wars showed him that there was a corporate life, higher than that of the city, of which the story might be told; and they offered to him as a subject the drama of the collision between East and West. With him, the spirit of history was born into Greece; and his work, called after the nine Muses, was indeed the first utterance of [[Clio]].|[[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Jebb, ''The Genius of Sophocles'', [[s:The Genius of Sophocles#7|section 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

==Life==
[[File:Relief Herodotus cour Carree Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Relief of Herodotus by [[Jean-Guillaume Moitte]] (1806), [[Louvre]], Paris]]
Modern scholars generally turn to Herodotus's own writing for reliable information about his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented with ancient yet much later sources, such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[Suda]]'', an 11th&amp;nbsp;century encyclopaedia which possibly took its information from traditional accounts.

{{quotation|The data are so few – they rest upon such late and slight authority; they are so improbable or so contradictory, that to compile them into a biography is like building a house of cards, which the first breath of criticism will blow to the ground.

Modern accounts of his life typically&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; go something like this: Herodotus was born at [[Halicarnassus]] around 484&amp;nbsp;BC. There is no reason to disbelieve the ''Suda''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s information about his family: that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to [[Panyassis]] &amp;ndash; an epic poet of the time. The town was within the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] at that time, making Herodotus a Persian subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M.

Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson Lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454&amp;nbsp;BC. The epic poet [[Panyassis]] &amp;ndash; a relative of Herodotus &amp;ndash; is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&amp;nbsp;39–60), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.

Herodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. The ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early travels===
As Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&amp;nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&amp;nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.

Herodotus's eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably some time after 454&amp;nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460–454&amp;nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and some time around 447&amp;nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] &amp;ndash; a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&amp;nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&amp;nbsp;137; VIII,&amp;nbsp;52–5), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.

According to [[Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&amp;nbsp;II p&amp;nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&amp;nbsp;II p&amp;nbsp;862&amp;nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&amp;nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.

===Later life===
In 443&amp;nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by "Herodotus of Thurium", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&amp;nbsp;15,99; VI,&amp;nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&amp;nbsp;91; VII,&amp;nbsp;133, 233; IX,&amp;nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&amp;nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.

===Author and orator===
Herodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as "performance pieces". These portions of the research seem independent and "almost detachable", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&amp;nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to "publish" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,&lt;ref&gt;Montfaucon’s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&amp;nbsp;clxxvii p&amp;nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade &amp;ndash; by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression "Herodotus and his shade" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]&lt;ref&gt;Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&amp;nbsp;lx p&amp;nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tzetzes]],&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes ''Chil.''&amp;nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, "Your son's soul yearns for knowledge."

Eventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p&amp;nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]
''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.&lt;ref name="OswynMurray_b"&gt;{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable. Fehling writes of "a problem recognized by everybody", namely that Herodotus frequently cannot be taken at face value.&lt;ref name="Fehling_2"&gt;{{harvp|Fehling|1994|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Herodotus still serves as the primary, and often only, source for events in the Greek world, Persian Empire, and the region generally in the two centuries leading up until his own day.&lt;ref name="BurnHerodotus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{harvp|Jones|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus, like many ancient historians, preferred an element of show{{efn|Boedeker comments on Herodotus' use of literary devices.&lt;ref name="Boedeker"&gt;{{harvp|Boedeker|2000|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to purely analytic history, aiming to give pleasure with "exciting events, great dramas, bizarre exotica."&lt;ref name="Joe Saltzman"&gt;{{harvp|Saltzman|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, certain passages&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Archambault|2002|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Farley|2010|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been the subject of controversy and even some doubt, both in antiquity and today.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;{{harvp|Lloyd|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{harvp|Nielsen|1997|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baragwanath_19"&gt;{{harvp|Baragwanath|de Bakker|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fehling_13"&gt;{{harvp|Fehling|1994|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marincola_34"&gt;{{harvp|Marincola|2001|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalley"&gt;{{harvp|Dalley|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalley 2013"&gt;{{harvp|Dalley|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For Detlev Fehling, the sources are simply not credible that Herodotus claims for many stories that he reports. Persian and Egyptian informants tell stories to Herodotus that dovetail neatly into Greek myths and literature, yet show no signs of knowing their own traditions. For Fehling, the only credible explanation is that Herodotus invented these sources, and that the stories themselves were concocted by Herodotus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehling|1989|pp=4, 53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The accuracy of the works of Herodotus has been controversial since his own era.{{efn|Kenton L. Sparks writes, "In antiquity, Herodotus had acquired the reputation of being unreliable, biased, parsimonious in his praise of heroes, and mendacious".}} [[Cicero]]{{efn|Cicero (''On the Laws'' I.5) said that the works of Herodotus were full of legends or "fables".}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberts|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], [[Josephus]], [[Duris of Samos]],{{efn|Duris of Samos called Herodotus a myth-monger.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Marincola|2001|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harpocration]]{{efn|Harpocration wrote a book on "the lies of Herodotus".}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cameron|2004|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plutarch]] all commented on this controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sparks|1998|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asheri|Lloyd|Corcella|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, however, he was regarded as reliable in antiquity, and is especially so today. Many scholars, ancient and modern, routinely cite Herodotus (e.g., &lt;!--don't link these unless you KNOW who you're linking to, there are many false leads and DAB pages--&gt;Aubin, [[A. H. L. Heeren]], Davidson, [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], &lt;!--is this really Edgar Allen Poe?--&gt;Poe, Welsby, Celenko, Volney, [[Pierre Montet]], &lt;!--is this J D Bernal?--&gt;Bernal, Jackson, DuBois, [[Strabo]]). Many of these scholars (Welsby, Heeren, Aubin, Diop, etc.) explicitly mention the reliability of Herodotus's work{{efn|such as on the [[Nile Valley]]}} and demonstrate corroboration of Herodotus's writings by modern scholars.{{efn|Welsby said that "archaeology graphically confirms Herodotus' observations."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Welsby|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;L. Heeren quoted Herodotus throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages (source of the Nile, location of Meroe, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heeren|1838|pp=13, 379, 422–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further his work on the Egyptians and Assyrians, Aubin uses Herodotus's accounts in various passages and defends Herodotus's position. Aubin said that Herodotus was "the author of the first important narrative history of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aubin|2002|pp=94–96, 100–102, 118–121, 141–144, 328, 336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diop provides several examples (the inundations of the Nile) which, he argues, support his view that Herodotus was "quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time." Diop argues that Herodotus "always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told." Diop also notes that Strabo corroborated Herodotus's ideas about the Black Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Colchians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Diop|1981|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Diop|1974|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Oikoumene]] (inhabited world), ancient map based on Herodotus, {{c.|lk=no|450&amp;nbsp;BC}}]]

===Egypt===
The reliability of Herodotus' writing about Egypt is sometimes criticized.&lt;ref name="Dalley 2013"/&gt;{{efn|Herodotus claimed to have visited [[Babylon]]. The absence of any mention of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] in his work has attracted further attacks on his credibility. In response, Dalley has proposed that the Hanging Gardens may have been in Ninevah rather than in Babylon.&lt;ref name="Dalley"/&gt;}} Alan B. Lloyd argues that, as a historical document, the writings of Herodotus are seriously defective, and that he was working from "inadequate sources".&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; Nielsen writes: "Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of Herodotus having been in Egypt, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it."&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether Herodotus ever traveled up the Nile River, and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehling|1994|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baragwanath_19"/&gt; Fehling states that "there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story" about the claim of Herodotus that Pharaoh [[Sesostris]] campaigned in Europe, and that he left a colony in Colchia.&lt;ref name="Marincola_34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fehling_13"/&gt;{{efn|Fehling concludes that the works of Herodotus are intended as fiction. Boedeker concurs that much of the content of the works of Herodotus are literary devices.&lt;ref name="Marincola_34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boedeker"/&gt;}}

===Science===
[[File:Goldinpan.jpg|thumb|upright|Gold dust and nuggets]]
Herodotus provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they "saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards". Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been. His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_307.gif The Indian Empire] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', 1909, v. 2, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Meenakshi|title=The India they saw: Foreign Accounts|date=2011|publisher=Ocean Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8184301069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, R. C. (1981). The Classical accounts of India: Being a compilation of the English translations of the accounts left by Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, Quintus, Diodorus, Siculus, Justin, Plutarch, Frontinus, Nearchus, Apollonius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Aelian, and others with maps. Calcutta: Firma KLM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to Herodotus's credibility. He described [[Gelonus]], located in [[Scythia]], as a city thousands of times larger than [[Troy]]; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called "Naucratis stela" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].
[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]

After journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.&lt;ref name="Peissel Ants"&gt;{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry "[[ant]]s" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] – the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] – that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for "marmot" with the word for "mountain ant". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.&lt;ref name="Peissel Ants" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the "ants" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.

===Accusations of bias===
Some "calumnious fictions" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case "a great collector of slanders"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom '&amp;#39;Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states – [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=8, 9, 32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Histories'' were sometimes criticized in antiquity,{{efn|For example, they were criticized for inaccuracy by [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who attacked Herodotus as a liar in ''Verae Historiae'' and went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]]}} but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotus's methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered "father of comparative anthropology",&lt;ref name="BurnHerodotus" /&gt; "the father of ethnography",&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; and "more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history".&lt;ref name="OswynMurray_b"/&gt;

=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===
It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that "Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5–6, §1.1, 1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: "I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, §1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, §1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states "[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, §1.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: "Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, §1.45, ¶2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Herodotus had not met these people whom he is discussing, he claims to understand their thoughts and intentions.

== Mode of explanation ==
Herodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of for an event. He lays this out in the proem: "This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:

:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''
:''Apollo,''
:''Zeus’ son and Leto’s, offended''
:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''
:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''
:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''
:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, "who set these two at each other's throats?" In Herodotus's case, "Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?"

Herodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that "the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of causality ===
Herodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question "why did this happen?" but rather "why did this happen to me?" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that "this is how it had to be," is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus's explanation that an event "was going to happen" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of "it was going to happen" reveals a "tragic discovery" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's, ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a "philosophy of history" or "simple causality". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Herodotus and myth==
Although Herodotus considered his "inquiries" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that "many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man" (IX, 100).

In Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, "second to no man living at that time," who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that "a very wonderful thing is said to have happened," and alleges its veracity by adding that the "Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter." Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'' 1.23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herrington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought – Herodotus as centaur:

{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.

'''Kaarle Jalmari Jaakkola''' (1 January 1885 – 12 February 1964) was a Finnish historian and a professor of Finnish history at the [[University of Helsinki]] between 1932 and 1954. Jaakkola is known as a historian who primarily researched medieval history  and sought to put forth that Finland existed as an entity already during that period. Some of Jaakkola's hypotheses are today considered to be overtly nationalist and outdated, but his influence during his lifetime remains undisputed.

His other research interests included the historical origins of the [[Birkarls]] and [[Kvenland|Kvens]], and the historical background of [[Kalevala]] [[epic poetry]].

== Early life and education ==
Jaakkola was born in [[Eurajoki]] to a peasant family of Markus Jaakkola and Johanna Fredrika Nuorante. He completed student [[matriculation]] in 1905 and studied history and [[Finnish language]] at the University of Helsinki. He made studying journeys to Germany and Sweden, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1909, a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in 1921, and a PhD in 1923. The subject of his doctoral thesis was the legend of [[Eric IX of Sweden]] and its authenticity.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/6992/ |title=Jaakkola, Jalmari (1885 - 1964) |last1=Jutikkala |first1=Eino  |date=22 April 1998 |website=Kansallisbiografia |publisher= [[Finnish Literature Society]] |accessdate=28 August 2014 | language=Finnish | registration = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a teacher and a headmaster until he was appointed a [[docent]] of Nordic history in 1923, and later a professor of Finnish history in 1932.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;

== Work ==
The focus of his research was the medieval period of Finnish history, as he endeavoured to write a history extending from the ancient times for the newly independent country. He emphasized Finnish position in the Western sphere of influence and concentrated on the history of his home region, [[Satakunta]]. Jaakkola supported his historical research with [[toponymy]], [[ethnopoetics]], epic poetry, and sometimes extensive speculation. Many of Jaakkola's assertions have been refuted by later research.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUr7TDC8x2MC&amp;pg=PA187|title=Constructivism, Narrative and Foreign Policy Analysis: A Case Study of Finland|first=Christopher S.|last=Browning|year=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3039105191|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1935 and 1959, Jaakkola published an extensive five-volume synthesis on Finnish history from the [[Viking Age]] to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt; The series is especially speculative in regard to the sections on history prior to the fourteenth century, although the books included almost all sources available in the Finnish history. The works were criticized by archaeologists at the time of their release. Despite this criticism, Jaakkola decided not to do any major changes for the reprints.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;

The central theme of the series was the medieval political history of Finland, during which, as Jaakkola argued, there was a period of ancient independence during which the country guarded its own interests. He envisioned Finland almost as a fourth member of the [[Kalmar Union]], instead of an insignificant part of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIVvQoxIHQkC&amp;pg=PA57|title=Conceptions of National History: Proceedings of Nobel Symposium 78|page=57|first1=Erik |last1=Lönnroth|first2=Karl |last2=Molin|first3=Ragnar |last3=Björk|year=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110135043}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most theoretically sustainable conclusions of Jaakkola include viewing the [[First Swedish Crusade|Swedish crusades to Finland]] as more of a peaceful transition to Swedish rule and [[Catholicism]] rather than as a period of conflict. Jaakkola wanted to continue his series to cover the twentieth century, and the work was carried on by his students who wrote two works on the period of the Swedish rule, but after Jaakkola died in 1964, the series was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;

After the [[Winter War]], Jaakkola wrote the concise presentation of Finnish history, ''Suomen historian ääriviivat'', which was meant for readers abroad. It was translated into several languages. During the [[Continuation War]], President [[Risto Ryti]] commissioned Jaakkola to write ''Die Ostfrage Finnlands'' (1941), to argue for Finnish territorial expansion eastwards to the [[Kola Peninsula]] and [[East Karelia]].&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vb8yAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA403|title=Finland in World War II: History, Memory, Interpretations|publisher=Brill|year=2011|page=403|isbn=900421433X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaakkola's writing took on a nationalist and even [[Nazism|German nationalist]] tone as he attempted to justify the Finnish expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtPT9Qe2z60C&amp;pg=PT94|title=Finland's Holocaust: Silences of History|first1=Simo |last1=Muir|first2=Hana|last2=Worthen|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1137302666|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qM_St-6JOGwC&amp;pg=PA45|title=Bordering the Baltic: Scandinavian Boundary-drawing Processes, 1900-2000|page=45|first=Madeleine |last=Hurd|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=2010|isbn=3643107781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficult style and academic nature of Jalmari Jaakkola's works, his influence on contemporary beliefs is considered to have been extensive. He chose the text, "The seer of early Finnish history", for his 75th anniversary memorial medal.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; He was the editor of the scientific journal ''Historiallinen aikakauskirja'' between 1935 and 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Historiallinen aikakauskirja |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=saBmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=JALMARI+JAAKKOLA|location= |publisher=Suomen Historiallinen Seura |page=91 |date=2003 |isbn= |accessdate=28 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaakkola was awarded an honorary degree from the faculty of theology at the University of Helsinki and the faculty of philosophy at the [[University of Turku]].&lt;ref name="Kansallisbiografia" /&gt;

== Personal ==
Jaakkola married Katie Jansson in 1915, with whom he had one child.&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hs.fi/extrat/kaupunki/korttelit/19.html |title=Elisabethin talon vanhin asukas syntyi kansalaissodan melskeissä |last1=Järvenpää |first1=Eeva  |date=26 November 2005 |website=HS.fi |publisher= [[Helsingin Sanomat]] |accessdate=28 August 2014 | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">'''John of Trokelowe''' was an English [[Benedictine]]  of the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Still living in 1330, but his dates of birth and death are unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a monk of [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]], who in 1294 was living in the dependent priory of [[Tynemouth]], [[Northumberland]]. Once he was thought to be a significant [[chronicler]], on the basis of internal evidence, it is now considered very possible that he was merely the scribe for [[William Rishanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Gransden, ''Historical Writing in England II'' (1982), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[prior]] and monks endeavoured to sever connection with St Albans and to obtain independence by presenting the [[advowson]] to the king; but abbot [[John of Berkamsted]] resisted this arrangement, visited Tynemouth, and sent Trokelowe with other monks as prisoners back to St Albans. There Trokelowe wrote his ''Annales'' including the period 1259 to 1296 and a useful account of the reign of [[Edward II of England]], from 1307 to 1323, after which date his chronicle was continued by '''Henry de Blaneford'''. A reference made by Trokelowe to the execution of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]] shows that he was writing after 1330.

'''José Antonio Conde y García ''' (1766&amp;ndash;1820) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and historian of [[Al-Andalus]] period. His ''[[Anacreon]]'' (1791) obtained him a post in the royal library in 1795. He also published several paraphrases of Greek classics. These were followed in 1799 by an edition of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] text of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s ''Description of Spain'', with notes and a translation. As an [[afrancesado]], he fled Spain in 1813, but returned a year later and was eventually reinstated to his honors.  His ''magnum opus'',  the three-volume ''Historia de la Dominación de los Árabes en España,'' was published after his death.

==Career==

Conde was educated at the university of [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]]. He published a translation of the works of the Greek poet ''Anacreon'' in 1795. In 1796&amp;ndash;1797, he published paraphrases from [[Theocritus]], [[Bion of Smyrna|Bion]], [[Moschus]], [[Sappho]] and [[Meleager]]. In 1799, these were followed by an edition of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] text of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s ''Description of Spain'', with notes and a translation, making him among the first modern western historians to translate an important Arabic text. Conde became a member of the [[Spanish Royal Academy|Spanish Academy]] in 1802. He succeeded [[Tomás Antonio Sánchez|Tomás Antonio Sánchez de Uribe]] to the so-called "G" seat. Conde was a member also of Academy of Sciences and Letters of [[Berlin]].

In 1804, Conde was accepted to membership of the Royal Academy of History, but his appointment as interpreter to [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and his being an ''[[Afrancesados|afrancesado]]'' (French sympathizer) led to his expulsion from  both the Academy of History and the Spanish Academy in 1814. He escaped to [[France]] in 1813, but returned a year later.  He was not permitted to reside at [[Madrid]] until 1816. Two years later he was re-elected to his former seats by both academies.

Conde died in poverty on the 12 June 1820. [[George Ticknor]], American [[Hispanist]] at [[Harvard University]] and several Spanish friends [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]] and [[Agustín Argüelles]] paid his funeral expenses.

==Personal information==

Conde born at [[La Peraleja]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], in present-day [[Spain]] on 28 October 1766. He married a 20-year-old cousin of [[Leandro Fernández de Moratin]], who died in childbirth in September 1817.

==Legacy==

His major work, ''Historia de la Dominación de los Árabes en España'', was published in 1820&amp;ndash;1821. He completed only the first volume before his death. [[Juan Tineo]] compiled volumes two and three from Conde's manuscript. This work was translated into [[German language|German]] (1824&amp;ndash;1825), [[French language|French]] (1825) and [[English language|English]] (1854). Although it has since been superseded by other works, Conde's work stimulated others in the same field and in the context of time it was considered a valuable work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">[[File:August Fuhrmann-Kaiserpanorama 1880.jpg|thumb|A drawing of a Kaiserpanorama with 25 viewing stations.]]
The '''Kaiserpanorama''' (or '''Kaiser-Panorama''') is a form of [[stereoscopic]] entertainment medium used chiefly in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a [[Precursors of film|precursor to film]], invented by [[August Fuhrmann]] (1844 – 1925). It was patented by the inventor ca. 1890. There would be a number of viewing stations through which people would peer through a pair of lenses showing a number of rotating [[stereoscopic]] glass slides. By 1910 he is said to have controlled exhibitions in over 250 branches across [[Europe]], and in the central archive have up to 100,000 slides stored.

==Description==
[[File:Kaiserpanorama Prater.jpg|thumb|left|A kaiserpanorama in [[Prater]] (1900)]]
A kaiserpanorama would normally have around 25 wooden stations, each with a pair of viewing lenses. Inside the device there would be a rotating mechanism showing numerous [[stereoscopic]] images on rear-illuminated glass, giving a 3D effect.
[[File:KayserPanorama.jpg|thumb|left|Kayserpanorama within the [[Dubaï Moving Image Museum|Dubai Moving Image Museum]].]]

==Reconstructions==
Various modern reconstructions as well as few authentic, remaining kaiserpanoramas exist in the [[Munich Stadtmuseum]], [[Wels]], [[Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum]], the [[Märkisches Museum|Märkisches Museum (Berlin)]], [[Neugersdorf]], [[Pioneer Settlement]] ([[Swan Hill]], Australia), Muzeum Kinematografii ([[Łódź]], Poland), [[Deutsches Technikmuseum]] ([[Berlin]]), the [[Dusseldorf Film Museum]] and [[Teylers Museum]] ([[Haarlem]], Holland). Another example is the [[Warsaw Fotoplastikon]],&lt;ref name="Fotoplastikon"&gt;{{pl}} [http://fotoplastikonwarszawski.pl/ Fotoplastikon Warszawski].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fotoplastikon en"&gt;[http://fotoplastikon.stereos.pl/index-en.html Fotoplastikon Warszawski].&lt;/ref&gt; built in 1905, which, despite very similar design, is not under the name kaiserpanorama.
During the German occupation, it was used by the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] as a meeting point.
There was a [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dismantled?s=t dismantled] kaiserpanorama in [[Snibston Discovery Museum]] in [[Coalville]], [[Leicestershire]], UK. However, since the museum is now closed, the item is now in storage and under the care of [[Leicester City Council]].

'''Langston''' is a town in [[Logan County, Oklahoma|Logan County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States, and is part of the [[Oklahoma City]] [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 1,724 at the 2010 census, an increase of 3.2 percent from 1,670 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/Langston CensusViewer: Population of the City of Langston, Oklahoma]&lt;/ref&gt;  Langston is home to [[Langston University]], the only historically black college in Oklahoma.

==History==
Langston was founded on April 22, 1890 by [[Edward P. McCabe]], an African-American political figure from Kansas. McCabe helped lead a migration of black settlers from southern U.S. states who hoped to escape discrimination by creating a majority-black state in what was then the [[Oklahoma Territory|Territory of Oklahoma]].{{efn|McCabe founded of the ''Langston City Herald'' newspaper in October 1890.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Langston"/&gt;}}  He named the town for [[John Mercer Langston]], a black member of the [[51st United States Congress]] from Virginia.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Langston"&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=LA020 Larry O'Dell, "Langston," ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.] Accessed May 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The townsite was actually owned by a white man, Charles Robbins, who surveyed and filed a plat in 1891. The ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'' asserts that the two men collaborated in promoting the town.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Langston"/&gt;}} McCabe used traveling salesmen and African-American newspapers to advertise lots for sale in Langston, and the deeds which accompanied the sale of these lots stipulated that their re-sale could only be to other African-Americans.&lt;ref name="Rummel"&gt;{{cite book

By 1891, Langston had a population of 200, which included a preacher, doctor, and schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="Rummel"/&gt; By 1892, the town had 25 businesses, with a bank and a public school. A Roman Catholic mission was established in 1893 by Rev. Bishop Theophile Meerschaert and the Benedictine Sisters. The town had a telephone system in service in 1895. In 1897, the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature passed a law creating the Colored Agricultural and Normal University at Langston (which later became [[Langston University]]).&lt;ref name="EOHC-Langston"/&gt;

'''The Lenape Stone''' is a piece of slate found in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]] in 1872, which appears to depict [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] hunting a [[woolly mammoth]]. This image, however, seems to have been carved some time after the stone was broken into two; for this and other reasons, it is generally considered an [[archaeological forgery]].

==History==
The first portion of the stone is reported to have been found in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] by Barnard Hansell, a farmer, in the spring of 1872. In 1881, Hansell sold the fragment to Henry Paxon, a young man with an interest in Native American artifacts. A few months later, Hansell reported finding the second piece of the stone in the same field where he had unearthed the first.

Once the two pieces were joined, they were examined by members of the [[Bucks County Historical Society]], including archaeologist and historian [[Henry Chapman Mercer]]. Despite evidence which cast doubt on the stone's origin, Mercer came to be an ardent proponent of its authenticity, an argument which he put forth in his 1885 book, ''The Lenape Stone, or the Indian and the Mammoth''. However, even Mercer acknowledged that the stone's unique nature and a lack of physical evidence (such as soil samples) made scientific certainty impossible.

The stone is currently housed at the [[Mercer Museum]] in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]].

[[File:HOTCHKIN(1892) p344 The Lenape Stone or the Indian and the Mammoth.jpg|thumbnail|The Lenape Stone - both sides]]

==Physical description==
The Lenape Stone is a small piece of [[slate]], about {{convert|4.5|in|cm}} long, and is hypothesised to have been a gorget, a type of ornamental necklace. Supporting this theory are the two holes drilled into the stone which would have enabled it to be worn about the neck. The stone comprises two fragments, each of which is decorated with clear engravings on both sides; they form a complete picture when the two halves are joined. On one side there are numerous depictions of turtles, fish, birds, and snakes. The reverse side shows an elephant-like creature, apparently a mammoth, along with humanoid figures, a forest, some teepees, and other markings. The humanoid figures are engaged in battle with the mammoth, and one even appears to have been trampled by it.

==Authenticity==
There is much evidence against the authenticity of the Lenape Stone. Mammoths are thought to have become extinct in North America around 10,000 years ago, while most gorgets uncovered in archaeological digs are less than 2,000 years old. In addition, other artifacts found in the same field as the Lenape Stone bore stylistically similar carvings, and these were all dated to around 2,000 years ago. There were no witnesses to verify the circumstances under which either fragment of the stone was found, and after it was found, the stone was cleaned multiple times, making geological tests virtually impossible. The carvings on each half of the stone appear not to match up perfectly, which may indicate that they were made after the stone was broken. The stone, therefore, was probably a forgery, the motive for which may have been money, as the stone was sold soon after its discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feder|first=Kenneth L.|title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO/Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-37918-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmDnhPNLwYwC&amp;pg=PA159|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Wilma Massey Hargreaves''' (March 1, 1914 &amp;ndash; August 29, 2008), a scholar of U.S. agricultural history, was the first woman at the [[University of Kentucky]] to reach the rank of full professor in the Department of History. Her areas of research included the agricultural history of the Northern Great Plains, dry land agriculture and land utilization. She was a [[Brookings Institution]] scholar, editor of the [[Henry Clay]] Papers and served in leadership roles in the [[Organization of American Historians]], the [[Southern Historical Association]];  in 1975 was elected president of the [[Agricultural History Society]]. She also served as a local and state officer in the [[American Association of University Women]].

==Early life and academic background==
Born on March 1, 1914, in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], Mary Wilma Massey was an only child. She attended East High School, and she enjoyed swimming as well as track and field sports.&lt;ref name= "JSH"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Thomas H. | last = Appleton Jr. | title = Obituaries | journal = Journal of Southern History | date = February 2009 | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 226–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An excellent student she won a full scholarship to [[Bucknell University]] and graduated in 1935 with a triple major in history, English and the social studies. She earned her master's degree in history from [[Radcliffe College]]/[[Harvard University]] in 1936, and she served as a research editor at the [[Harvard University]] School of Business Administration. She began her work on the Ph.D. as a doctoral candidate at Radcliffe writing about settlement in the American West, working under an exponent of the thesis of [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] - mentored by Harvard historian Frederick Merk.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal | first = David E. | last = Hamilton | title = Mary Wilma M. Hargreaves (1914-2008): A Memorial | journal = Agricultural History | date = Winter 2009 | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–105 | doi=10.3098/ah.2008.83.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Harvard in 1939, she became a junior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], a liberal think tank in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Marriage and a career on hold==
At  Brookings, she met Herbert Walter "Walt" Hargreaves, who was finishing up his Ph.D. in economics from Duke University. They married on August 24, 1940, and she followed her husband when he was hired to teach at what is now the University of Texas at El Paso. Walt Hargreaves joined up during World War II, and they moved to various posts for his training. He served also as a member of the economic reconstruction delegation to Germany, and for most of the war she lived in Brooklyn, New York. Soon after the war, Walt Hargreaves was hired as a professor of economics at the [[University of Kentucky]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].

When they arrived in Kentucky, Mary Wilma Hargreaves met Thomas D. Clark in the History Department who invited her to guest lecture in his classes on American land policy, the subject of her dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hargreaves | first = Mary Wilma | chapter = "Colleague" | title = Thomas D. Clark of Kentucky: An Uncommon Life in the Commonwealth | editor = John Kleber | publisher = University Press of Kentucky | place = Lexington | date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1951, Mary Wilma Hargreaves earned her Ph.D. in history from Harvard University. She applied for a job in the University's History Department, but instead was hired as a typist&lt;ref name= "JSH" /&gt; for James F. Hopkins who had been working on gathering the letters and works of [[Henry Clay]] for a bound series. By 1957 with a grant from the Eli Lilly Endowment and sponsored as part of a program by the National Archives and Records Division, Hopkins was appointed editor-in-chief of the Henry Clay Papers and Hargreaves was hired as associate editor. Together they edited the first five volumes of the series.

Hargreaves was finally hired as a professor in the University of Kentucky History Department in 1964 to teach courses on the American frontier and economic history of the U.S. She remained associate editor of the Henry Clay Papers until 1974 when she then became co-editor and project director. She was promoted to full professor in 1973 - the first woman in the department's history to do so.&lt;ref name="JSH" /&gt;

She wrote three major works, two of which focused on the economic history of the agricultural practices used in the high plains, with interpretations on the formation of national land policy and the socioeconomic problems associated with that. Her book ''Dry Farming the Northern Great Plains, 1900-1925'' (Harvard, 1957) was a part of the prestigious Harvard Economic Studies series (Volume 101) and went through nine editions.

By the 1970s she was writing important groundbreaking articles to update and expand upon her original work on the history of the American west, broadening her analysis to include studies of women's critical roles in agriculture and the settlement of the Great Plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Glenda | last= Riley | title = The Future of Western Women's History | journal = Historian | date = Fall 2004 | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 539–545  | DOI = 10.1111/j.1540-6563.2004.00086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed in Thomas D. Clark's footsteps when she won the Theodore Hallam Professor Award of the UK History Department for outstanding achievement.

She served on many boards, including the Henry Clay Memorial Foundation which acquired Ashland, the estate of Henry Clay.

==Retired life and death==

Hargreaves retired from the University of Kentucky in 1984 and was named professor emerita. She continued to work as a scholar and community activist, living with her husband in Lexington on Cassidy Avenue. During her retirement she produced a volume for the University Press of Kansas' American Presidency series: [http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/harqui.html ''The Presidency of John Quincy Adams''] (Lawrence, Kansas, 1985). Her book [http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/hardry.html ''Dry Farming in the Northern Great Plains: Years of Readjustment, 1920-1990''] (Lawrence, Kansas, 1993) followed up on the topic of her first study and was awarded the Theodore Saloutos book prize by the [[Agricultural History Society]].&lt;ref name = "Hamilton" /&gt; It is still widely regarded as a standard work on that topic.

She was an active member of the First United Methodist Church in Lexington and left a legacy for the Kentucky United Methodist Homes for Children and Youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Children's Voice Annual Report | publisher = Kentucky United Methodist Homes for Children and Youth | date = 2009 | URL = http://www.kyumh.com/PDFs/2009AnnualReport.pdf | accessdate = April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her activism in organizations included animal rights. She especially loved her many golden retrievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dekle | first = Victoria | title = Cutting The Cost: Arts &amp; Sciences Alumni Funds Enable Student Opportunities | URL = https://geography.as.uky.edu/cutting-cost-arts-sciences-alumni-funds-enable-student-opprtunities | website = College of Arts &amp; Sciences | publisher = University of Kentucky | accessdate = April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband enjoyed classical music as well as ballroom dancing at Arthur Murray studios. After a brief illness, Hargreaves died on August 29, 2008, in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] at age 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Beth | last = Musgrave |title=UK educator and author dies at 94| url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/08/31/508377_uk-educator-and-author-dies-at.html| publisher=Lexington Herald Leader|date = August 31, 2008 | accessdate= April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the First United Methodist legacy, Hargreaves also upon her death endowed a general fund scholarship at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bequests received | website = Nevada Silver &amp; Blue, Development and Alumni Relations | publisher = University of Nevada, Reno | url = http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2010/spring/NSB_Spring_2010_WEB-60.pdf | date = Spring 2010 | accessdate = April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A University of Kentucky Graduate School fellowship was named in her memory to provide financial support for graduate student travel, both for dissertation related research and for presentations at scholarly conferences.

The '''Museum of Moscow''' ({{lang-ru|Музей Москвы}}) is one of the oldest museums of the city of [[Moscow]], Russia. Its collection was established on the initiative of [[Russia]]n scientific community in 1896. The Moscow City Duma gave it a large collection of exhibits. 
In the 20th century the museum several times changed its name and location. 
In 1921 the museum was called ''Moscow Municipal Museum'' and was located in [[Sukharev Tower]]. In 1940 was renamed the ''Museum of History and Reconstruction of Moscow''.&lt;ref name=andreevskij&gt;Г. В. Андреевский ''Повседневная жизнь Москвы в сталинскую эпоху, 1930-1940-е годы'' - М. : Мол. гвардия, 2003. {{ISBN|5-235-02528-8}} {{ISBN|978-5-235-02528-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the museum got its present name. 

The museum acquired more than one million articles depicting life in the city throughout its history, from Moscow's ancient beginnings to the present day. This collection contains the archaeological finds, ancient tools, jewelry, bronze and stone items from most ancient period of Moscow history. There is a collection of maps and drafts which show how the city grew from year to year. A great number of photos recreate the important occasions, celebrations, and events of Moscow since middle of the 19th century to the present day. 

The museum holds original costumes, accessories, furniture and other everyday objects produced by talented Russian and European masters. 

The Museum's exhibition was housed in one of the [[Krestovsky Tower]]s.

'''Punta Sur''' marks the southern point of [[Cozumel]] and is part of the '''Parque Punta Sur''', a {{convert|247|acre|km2|sing=on}} ecological park that covers the [[reef]]s, beaches, [[lagoon]]s, and low forest of the surrounding area. The reef system is also part of the [[Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park]].
[[Image:Cozumel Caracol Punta Sur feb 2011 (2).JPG|thumb|left|Tumba del Caracol, Punta Sur]]

The '''Celarain''' [[lighthouse]] (''Faro de Celarain'') sits on the Punta Sur promontory (''Punta Celarain'') and is part of a nautical museum. Just northeast of it is the '''Caracol''' (''Tumba del Caracol''), a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] building erected during the post-classic period.  There is a persistent myth, often repeated by tour guides, that the building functioned as a weather alarm, producing a whistle that would precede the arrival of a hurricane, but that is only a legend.  The idea that the building somehow functioned as a lighthouse or beacon used to send signals to the mainland is another legend, but also incorrect; it was a temple and nothing more. 

Some of the sandy beaches are protected to allow hatching for [[sea turtles]]. Observation towers have been erected at the Columbia lagoon to watch wildlife. Off Punta Sur is the [[Devil's Throat at Punta Sur|Devil's Throat]] [[scuba diving]] area, while in the closer reef visitors can snorkel. The dirt road area is accessible to [[off-road vehicle]]s and allows some tours to access the area as part of a guided excursion. At the end of the dirt road you will find 2 beach clubs, [http://papitosbeachcozumel.com/ Papito's Beach Club Restaurant and Bar] as well as the [http://www.cozumelparks.com/eng/punta_sur.cfm Punta Sur Beach Club]. Included in the entrance fee to Punta Sur Park is also a guided boat ride on the Colombia Lagoon for bird watching, sightseeing, crocodile observation and more.

[[Image:The Rig Veda.jpg|thumb|200px|The first two verses of the Purusha sukta,  with [[Sayana]]'s commentary. Page of Max Müller's ''Rig-Veda-sanhita, the Sacred Hymns of the Brahmans'' (reprint, London 1974).]]
'''Purusha sukta''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] ''{{IAST|puruṣasūkta}}'', [[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] पुरुषसूक्त) is [[hymn]] [[Mandala 10|10]].90 of the [[Rigveda]], dedicated to the [[Purusha]], the "Cosmic Being".

It is also found in the [[Yajurveda#Shukla_Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]] Vajasena Samhita(adhyaya 31).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

One version of the suktam has 16 verses, 15 in the {{IAST|[[anuṣṭubh]]}} meter, and the final one in the {{IAST|[[triṣṭubh]]}} meter. Another version of the Sukta consists of 24 verses with the first 18 mantras designated as the ''Purva-narayana'' and the later portion termed as the ''Uttara-narayana'' probably in honour of Rishi Narayana. Some scholars state that certain verses of Purusha Sukta are later interpolations to the Rigveda. One of the reasons given is that it is the only hymn in all the Vedas that mentions the four [[Varna_(Hinduism)|varna]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s by name - although the word "varṇa" itself is not mentioned in the hymn.&lt;ref name="dkeane"/&gt;&lt;ref name=raghwan&gt;Raghwan (2009), Discovering the Rigveda A Bracing text for our Times, {{ISBN|978-8178357782}}, pp 77-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/1_sam/1_rv/rvh1-10u.htm|title=Rgveda|website=gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the universe. It presents the nature of Purusha, or the cosmic being, as both [[immanence|immanent]] in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it.&lt;ref name="purusha"&gt;The Purusha sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pura.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda&lt;/ref&gt; From this being, the Sukta holds, the original creative [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (ldentified with [[Viswakarma]], [[Hiranyagarbha]] or [[Prajapati]]) proceeds which causes the projection of the universe in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Krishnananda|Krishnananda, Swami]]. ''A Short History of Religious and Philosophic Thought in India''. [[Divine Life Society]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Purusha Sukta, in the seventh verse, hints at the organic connectedness of the various classes of society.

===Purusha===
The Purusha is defined in verses 2 to 5 of the Sukta. He is described as a being who pervades everything conscious and unconscious universally. He is poetically depicted as a being with thousand heads, eyes and legs, enveloping not just the earth, but the entire universe from all sides and transcending it by ten fingers length - or transcending in all 10 directions. All manifestations, in past, present and future, is held to be the Purusha alone.&lt;ref name="purush"/&gt; It is also proclaimed that he transcends his creation. The immanence of the Purusha in manifestation and yet his transcendence of it is similar to the viewpoint held by [[Panentheism|panentheists]]. Finally, his glory is held to be even greater than the portrayal in this Sukta.

===Creation ===
Verses 5-15 hold the [[creation myth|creation]] of the [[Rig Veda]]. Creation is described to have started with the origination of Virat, or the cosmic body from the Purusha. In Virat, omnipresent intelligence manifests itself which causes the appearance of diversity. In the verses following, it is held that Purusha through a sacrifice of himself, brings forth the avian, forest-dwelling and domestic animals, the three [[Vedas]], the metres (of the [[mantras]]). Then follows a verse which states that from his mouth, arms, thighs, feet the four [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]] (classes) are born. This four varna-related verse is controversial and is believed by many scholars, such as [[Max Müller]], to be a corruption and a medieval or modern era insertion into the text.&lt;ref name="dkeane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raghwan"/&gt;

After the verse, the Sukta states that  the moon takes birth from the Purusha's mind and the sun from his eyes. [[Indra]] and [[Agni]] descend from his mouth and from his vital breath, air is born. The firmament comes from his navel, the heavens from his head, the earth from his feet and quarters of space from his ears.&lt;ref name="purusha"/&gt; Through this creation, underlying unity of human, cosmic and divine realities is espoused, for all are seen arising out of same original reality, the Purusha.{{sfn|Koller, The Indian Way|2006|p=44}}

===Yajna===
The Purusha Sukta holds that the world is created by and out of a [[Yajna]] or sacrifice of the Purusha. All forms of existence are held to be grounded in this primordial yajna. In the seventeenth verse, the concept of Yajna itself is held to have arisen out of this original sacrifice.

==Context==
The Sukta gives an expression to immanence of radical unity in diversity and is therefore, seen as the foundation of the [[Vaishnava]] thought, [[Bhedabheda]] school of philosophy and [[Bhagavata]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;Haberman, David L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=63uDsPPr48gC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=purusha+sukta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OfnwT4WKIojLrQfNmtS9DQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=purusha%20sukta%20vedanta&amp;f=false River of Love in an Age of Pollution: The Yamuna River of Northern India]. University of California Press; 1 edition (September 10, 2006). P. 34. {{ISBN|0520247906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the Purusha is from the Samkhya Philosophy which is traced to the Indus Valley period. It seems to be an interpolation into the Rigveda since it is out of character with the other hymns dedicated to nature gods.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, Vol.&amp;nbsp; 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purusha Sukta is repeated with some variations in the [[Atharva Veda]] (19.6). Sections of it also occur in the [[Panchavimsha Brahmana]], [[Vajasaneyi Samhita]] and the [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]].{{sfn|Visvanathan, Cosmology and Critique|2011|p=148}} Among [[Purana|Puranic]] texts, the Sukta has been elaborated in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (2.5.35 to 2.6.1-29) and in the [[Mahabharata]] (Mokshadharma Parva 351 and 352).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Authenticity ==
Many 19th and early 20th century scholars questioned as to when parts or all of Purusha Sukta were composed, and whether some of these verses were present in the ancient version of Rigveda. They suggest it was interpolated in post-Vedic era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nagarajan | first=V | title=Origins of Hindu social system | publisher=South Asia Books | year=1994 | isbn=978-81-7192-017-4 | pages=16, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a relatively modern origin of Purusha Sukta.&lt;ref name=dkeane/&gt;&lt;ref name=raghwan/&gt;  

{{quote|As compared with by far the largest part of the hymns of the Rigveda, the Purusha Sukta has every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas. I have already observed that the hymns which we find in this collection (Purusha Sukta) are of very different periods.

}}

{{quote|That the Purusha Sukta, considered as a hymn of the Rigveda, is among the latest portions of that collection, is clearly perceptible from its contents.

{{quote|That remarkable hymn (the Purusha Sukta) is in language, metre, and style, very different from the rest of the prayers with which it is associated. It has a decidedly more modern tone, and must have been composed after the Sanskrit language had been refined.

}}

{{quote|There can be little doubt, for instance, that the 90th hymn of the 10th book (Purusha Sukta) is modern both in its character and in its diction. (...) It mentions the three seasons in the order of the Vasanta, spring; Grishma, summer; and Sarad, autumn; it contains the only passage in the Rigveda where the four castes are enumerated. The evidence of language for the modern date of this composition is equally strong. Grishma, for instance, the name for the hot season, does not occur in any other hymn of the Rigveda; and Vasanta also does not belong to the earliest vocabulary of the Vedic poets.

}}

B. V. Kamesvara Aiyar, another 19th-century scholar, on the other hand, disputed this idea:&lt;ref name="purush"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aiyar, B.V. Kamesvara|year=1898| |url=https://archive.org/details/purushasukta00unkngoog|title=The Purusha Sukta|publisher= G.A. Natesan, Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The language of this hymn is particularly sweet, rhythmical and polished and this has led to its being regarded as the product of a later age when the capabilities of the language had been developed. But the polish may be due to the artistic skill of the particular author, to the nature of the subject and to several other causes than mere posteriority in time. We might as well say that [[Chaucer]] must have lived centuries after Gower, because the language of the former is so refined and that of the latter, so rugged. We must at the same time confess that we are unable to discover any distinct linguistic peculiarity in the hymn which will stamp it as of a later origin.}}Scholarship on this and other Vedic topics has moved on decisively since the end of the twentieth century, especially since the major publications of Brereton &amp; Jamison and many others, and views such as the above are nowadays of interest only as part of the history of indology, and not as contributions to contemporary scholarship.

===Modern scholarship===
The verses about social estates in the Purusha Sukta are considered to belong to the latest layer of the Rigveda by  scholars such as V. Nagarajan, Jamison and Brereton. V. Nagarajan believes that it was an "interpolation" to give "divine sanction" to an unequal division in society that was in existence at the time of its composition. He states "The Vedic Hymns had been composed before the Varna scheme was implemented. The Vedic society was not organized on the basis of varnas. The Purush Sukta might have been a later interpolation to secure Vedic sanction for that scheme".&lt;ref name="dkeane"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRntCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Caste-based Discrimination in International Human Rights Law|author=David Keane|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, "there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system", and "the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality".&lt;ref name=Jamison57&gt;{{cite book | last=Jamison| first=Stephanie | title=The Rigveda : The Earliest Religious Poetry of India | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-937018-4 |pages=57–58|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ground Zero Spirit.jpg|thumb|''Raising the Flag at Ground Zero'']]
'''''Raising the Flag at Ground Zero''''' is a photograph by [[Thomas E. Franklin]] of [[The Record (Bergen County)|''The Record'' (Bergen County, N.J.)]], taken on September 11, 2001. The picture shows three [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]]s raising the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] at Ground Zero of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]], following the [[September 11 attacks]]. The official names for the photograph used by ''The Record'' are '''''Firefighters Raising Flag''''' and '''''Firemen Raising the Flag at Ground Zero'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |url=http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/category.asp?eventID=1289511&amp;CategoryID=69063 |title=9/11 Photo Gallery |work=NorthJerseyimages |publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]] |accessdate=July 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo appeared on ''The Record'' front page on September 12, 2001. The paper also put it on the [[Associated Press]] wire and it appeared on the covers of several newspapers around the world. It has often been compared to the ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' photograph taken by [[Joe Rosenthal]] during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

==Photograph==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2015}}
Franklin shot the photograph shortly after 5 p.m. with a [[telephoto lens]].  At this time, he was standing under a pedestrian walkway across the [[West Side Highway]] that connected the center to the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]], located at the northwest corner of the [[World Trade Center site]].  Franklin said the firefighters were about {{convert|150|yards}} away from him and the debris was {{convert|100|yards}} beyond that.  They were about {{convert|20|ft}} off the ground.

Franklin had hitched a ride on a [[tug boat]] across the [[Hudson River]], arriving around noon after the towers had collapsed.  He was with photographer [[James Nachtwey]] when he saw the firefighters.

The firefighters pictured were Brooklyn-based firefighters George Johnson of [[Rockaway Beach, Queens|Rockaway Beach]], Dan McWilliams of [[Long Island]] (both from Ladder 157), and Billy Eisengrein of [[Staten Island]] (Rescue 2).

==Flag==
The flag came from the yacht ''Star of America'', owned by Shirley Dreifus and her late husband Spiros E. Kopelakis, which was docked in the yacht basin in the Hudson River at the World Financial Center. McWilliams cut the [[Yard_(sailing)|yardarm]] off of the yacht with a [[K-Saw]] and then took the flag and its pole from the yacht to an evacuation area on the northwest side of the site.  They found a pole about {{convert|20|ft}} off the ground.

Soon after its raising above Ground Zero, the flag disappeared. The city thought it had possession of the flag after the attack, Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and [[George Pataki]] signed it, and it flew at the [[New York City Hall]], [[Yankee Stadium]], and on the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} during its service in the Mideast. When the flag's owner prepared to formally donate the flag, it was discovered that it was ''not'' the flag from Ground Zero. There was a size discrepancy, the yacht's flag measured {{convert|4|x|6|ft|m}}, the flag the city had measured {{convert|5|x|8|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Stars &amp; Stripes Forever |first= Richard H. |last= Schneider |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-06-052537-1 |pages= 160–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreifus started a website in an effort to get the flag back.&lt;ref name="WTCflag"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.famouspictures.org/raising-the-flag-at-the-wtc/|work=Famous Pictures Magazine |title= Raising the Flag at the WTC |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |last=Lucas |first= Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 [[CNN]] documentary film, ''The Flag'', directed by filmmakers [[Michael Tucker (director)|Michael Tucker]] and Petra Epperlein investigated the mystery of this missing 9/11 icon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 22, 2013 |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/22/the-flag-pursues-the-mystery-of-a-missing-911-icon/|title= ''The Flag'' Pursues the Mystery of a Missing 9/11 Icon |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=August 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered video evidence that the flag went missing hours after it was first raised. The original flag has now been recovered. The recovery came as a result of a lead gathered following the airing of the History Channel's ''Brad Meltzer's Lost History'' in 2014. A number of scientists have now verified that the flag is authentic, and it was unveiled on Sunday, September 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, on a History Channel special on the flag, ''America's 9/11 Flag: Rise From the Ashes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 6, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/nyregion/long-lost-9-11-flag-an-enduring-mystery-will-go-on-view-at-museum.html|title=Long-Lost 9/11 Flag, an Enduring Mystery, Will Go on View at Museum |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(who sponsored the stamp); Firefighter Dan McWilliams; and Record photographer [[Thomas E. Franklin]], who took the photo featured on the stamp]]
Michael Kessel, a Manhattan attorney, suggested to U.S. Representative [[Gary Ackerman]] that the photo be used for a stamp, and the "Heroes 2001" stamp, USA [[Scott catalogue|Scott]] #B2, was unveiled on March 11, 2002, by President [[George W. Bush]], in a ceremony attended by Franklin, Johnson, Eisengrein, and McWilliams. These stamps were [[semipostal]]s: they had a purchase price (45¢) higher than their postage value (34¢), with the balance given to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s relief efforts. A special exception was thus made to the normal requirement by the [[United States Postal Service]] that subjects of stamps be deceased. 

In December 2001, the New York City Fire Department unveiled plans for a statue based on the photograph to be placed at the Brooklyn headquarters.  In an effort to be inclusive of all those who had been affected by the tragedy, the statue was to include black, white, and Hispanic firefighters. The change in ethnicity from the actual firefighters, all of whom are white, proved controversial enough that the statue was never built.

On November 5, 2007, a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} bronze monument based on the photograph called ''To Lift A Nation'' and depicting three New York firefighters raising the flag over the ruins of the World Trade Center was dedicated at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Park in Emmitsburg, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first= Rusty |last= Shackleford |date= November 6, 2007 |title= 9/11 Firefighters Monument Dedicated |url= http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/190028.php |work= The Jawa Report |access-date= September 11, 2016}}{{verify credibility|date= September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From another angle==
The picture taken by Thomas E. Franklin is not to be confused with another picture of the same event but from a different angle by Ricky Flores for ''[[The Journal News]]''. Flores also was able to get near Ground Zero on the day of the attacks and at around the same time that Franklin took his shot, Flores was able to get into a second story of a nearby building and capture the same picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyppa.org/flores-911/|title=Ricky Flores - 9/11|author=|date=|website=New York Press Photographers Association, Inc.|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WTCflag" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12574">'''Slovene months''' have standard modern names derived from Latin names, as in most European languages. There are also archaic Slovene month names, which exist in both a standardized set as well as many variations. 

==Standard modern names==
[[File:Obaha gravestone - detail.jpg|thumb|Gravestone with the archaic spelling ''februvarij'' 'February']]
The standard modern Slovene month names are ''januar'', ''februar'', ''marec'', ''april'', ''maj'', ''junij'', ''julij'', ''avgust'', ''september'', ''oktober'', ''november'', and ''december''. When writing dates, they appear after the day and are often represented by Arabic numerals, and sometimes with Roman numerals (e.g., ''19. 5.'' or ''19. V.'' 'May 19th'). Older variants include ''januvarij'' 'January', ''februvarij'' 'February', and ''marcij'' 'March'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gradišnik|first1=A.|title=Čas|journal=Učiteljski tovariš|date=October 1, 1883|volume=23|issue=19|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard archaic names==
Many of the names in the standardized set of archaic Slovene month names first occur in the [[Škofja Loka manuscript]], written in 1466 by [[Martin of Loka]].&lt;ref name="Stabej 1966"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-93FLIZJH/ |title=Ob petstoletnici škofjeloškega zapisa slovenskih imen za mesece |language=Slovenian |trans-title=On the 500th Anniversary of the Škofja Loka Recording of Slovene Month Names |first=Jože |last=Stabej |journal=Loški razgledi |year=1966 |volume=13 |publisher=Muzejsko društvo Škofja Loka [Museum Society of Škofja Loka] |issn=0459-8210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant archaic month names==
Multiple systems have been used in various Slovene-speaking regions, some of which were based on the names of saints (e.g., ''jurjevščak'' 'April', literally 'St. George's'), numbers (e.g., ''prvnik'' 'January', literally 'first'), or other features (e.g., ''vetrnik'' 'March', literally 'windy'). In the [[Prekmurje Slovene|Prekmurje dialect]] of Slovene, the following system was attested: ''sečen'' 'January', ''süšec'' 'February', ''mali traven'' 'March', ''velki traven'' 'April', ''risalšček'' 'May', ''ivanšček'' 'June', ''jakopešček'' 'July', ''mešnjek'' 'August', ''mihalšček'' 'September', ''vsesvišček'' 'October', ''andrejšček'' 'November', ''božič'' 'December'.&lt;ref&gt;''Kalendar najsvetetjšeja srca Jezušovoga.'' 1925. 22: 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing the flag during the battle inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] to write the poem "[[Defence of Fort M'Henry]]", which, retitled with the flag's name from the closing lines of the first stanza and set to the tune of "[[To Anacreon in Heaven]]" by [[John Stafford Smith]], later became the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem of the United States]].

==History==
In Baltimore's preparation for an expected attack on the city, Fort McHenry was made ready to defend the city's harbor. When Major [[George Armistead]] expressed the desire for a very large flag to fly over the fort, General John S. Stricker and [[Joshua Barney|Commodore Joshua Barney]] placed an order with a prominent Baltimorean flagmaker for two oversized American Flags. The larger of the two flags would be the Great Garrison Flag, the largest battle flag ever flown at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.nps.gov/archive/fomc/tguide/Lesson8a.htm
|title= The Great Garrison Flag
|publisher= National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller of the two flags would be the Storm Flag, to be more durable and less prone to fouling in inclement weather.

Available documentation shows that this flag was sewn by local flagmaker [[Mary Young Pickersgill]] under a government commission in 1813 at a cost of $405.90 ({{Inflation|US|405.90|1813|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-back"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/star-spangled-banner-back-on-display-83229098/ |title=Star-Spangled Banner Back on Display |last=Poole |first=Robert M. |date=November 2008 |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation/fn|US}} [[George Armistead]], the commander of Fort McHenry, specified "a flag so large that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance".&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Misha ''A Nation's History'' ''Chicago-Sun Times'' 2002-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/fomc/tguide/Lesson8a.htm Fort McHenry lesson guide] retrieved 2008-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Mary Pickersgill stitched the flag from a combination of cotton and dyed English wool bunting, assisted by her daughter, two nieces, and an African American [[indentured servant]]. (Her elderly mother may also have helped.)&lt;ref name="NMAH-making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/making-the-flag.aspx |title=The Star-Spangled Banner: Making the Flag |work=[[National Museum of American History]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag has fifteen horizontal red and white stripes, as well as fifteen white stars in the blue field. The two additional stars and stripes, approved by the [[United States Congress]]'s [[Flag Acts (United States)|Flag Act]] of 1794, represent [[Vermont]] and [[Kentucky]]'s entrance into the Union. The stars are arranged in vertical rows, with five horizontal rows of stars, offset, each containing three stars. At the time, the practice of adding stripes (in addition to stars) with the induction of a new state had not yet been discontinued.

The flag originally measured {{convert|30|by|42|ft|m}}. Each of the fifteen stripes is {{convert|2|ft|m}} wide, and each of the stars measures about {{convert|2|ft|m}} in diameter. After the battle, the Armistead family occasionally gave away pieces of the flag as souvenirs and gifts;&lt;ref name="NMAH-keepsake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/family-keepsake.aspx|title=The Star-Spangled Banner: Family Keepsake |work=[[National Museum of American History]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; this cutting, along with deterioration from continued use, removed several feet of fabric from the flag's fly end, and it now measures {{convert|30|by|34|ft|m}}. The flag currently has only fourteen stars—the fifteenth star was similarly given as a gift, but its recipient and current whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="NMAH-fifteenth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/congratulations.aspx|title=The Star-Spangled Banner: Congratulations |work=[[National Museum of American History]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle===
The Flag was flown over the fort when 5,000 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] soldiers and a fleet of 19 ships attacked Baltimore on September 12, 1814. The bombardment turned to Fort McHenry on the evening of September 13, and continuous shelling occurred for 25 hours under heavy rain. When the British ships were unable to pass the fort and penetrate the harbor, the attack was ended, and on the morning of September 14, when the battered flag still flew above the ramparts, it was clear that Fort McHenry remained in American hands. This revelation was famously captured in poetry by Key, an American lawyer, and amateur poet. Being held by the British on a truce ship in the [[Patapsco River]], Key observed the battle from afar. When he saw the Garrison Flag still flying at the dawn of the morning of the 14th, he composed a poem he originally titled "Defence of Fort M'Henry". The poem would be put to the music of a common tune, retitled "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", and a portion of it would later be adopted as the United States National Anthem. Since its arrival at the Smithsonian, the flag has undergone multiple preservation efforts.

===Fragment sold at auction, November 2011===
A 2-inch by 5-inch fragment of the flag - white and red, with a seam down the middle - was sold at auction in Dallas, TX on November 30, 2011, for $38,837: the snippet was, presumably, cut from the famous flag as a souvenir in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Old Glory'' 2" X 5" snippet sold at an auction 30 November 2011; shown in '''Maine Antiques Digest''', March 2012, page 21-C, [https://www.maineantiquedigest.com/stories/index.html?id=3037 |"Heritage Auctions, Dallas, Texas: Brady Camera and Kennedy Rocker Take Top Bids in Americana Auction"]; accessed 26 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The framed remnant came with a faded, hand-written note attesting it was "''A piece of the Flag which floated over Fort McHenry at the time of the bombardment when Key's (''sic'') composed the Song of the Star Spangled Banner, presented by Sam Beth Cohen.''"&lt;ref&gt;'''Heritage Auctions''', Dallas, Texas; catalog "Political &amp; Americana Auction, November 30, 2011; [www.ha.com/common/auction/frontmatter/6066_catalogpdf.pdf |"A Piece of Old Glory"]; catalogue page 118, item #38311; accessed 26 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smithsonian National Museum of American History==
[[File:Pieces of the Star Spangled banner by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|In addition to the original flag on display, the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] also features pieces from the flag that had been snipped off over the years as patriotic mementos|thumb|right|200px]]

The flag that flew during that episode in history became a significant artifact. It remained in the possession of Major Armistead, who was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] lieutenant colonel, and his family for many years. Eben Appleton, Colonel Armistead's grandson, inherited the flag in 1878. In 1907, he lent it to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 it was made a formal gift. Today it is permanently housed in the [[National Museum of American History]], one of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] museums on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The flag was given to the museum in 1912, and has undergone multiple restoration efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being originally restored by [[Amelia Fowler]] in 1914. 

Due to environmental and light damage, a four-phase restoration project began in May 1999. In the first phase, the team removed the linen support backing that was attached to the flag during the 1914 restoration. The second phase consisted of the most comprehensive, detailed examination of the condition and construction of the Star-Spangled Banner to date, which provided critical information for later work. This included scientific studies with infrared spectrometry, electron microscopy, mechanical testing, and determination of amino acid content by a New Zealand scientist, and infrared imaging by a NASA scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/old-glory-new-glory-star-spangled-banner-gets-some-tender-loving-care Science News "Old Glory, New Glory: The Star-Spangled Banner gets some tender loving care"]&lt;/ref&gt; Planning and executing a cleaning treatment for the flag following scientific analysis was the third phase. In the fourth and final phase of the project, curators, scientists, and conservators developed a long-term preservation plan.

Following the reopening of the [[National Museum of American History]] on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a two-story display chamber that allows it to lie at a 10-degree angle in dim light. The Smithsonian has created a permanent exhibition to document the flag's history and significance, called "The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag that Inspired the [[National Anthem]]". Visitors are allowed a clear view of the flag, while it remains protected in a controlled environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613212709/http://amhistory.si.edu/ssb/7_preserving/7d_project/fs7d.html ''Smithsonian'' Preserving the Star-Spangled Banner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/20/AR2008112001242.html Washington POST "Reopening, in All Its Old Glory"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NMAH-visit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/visit.aspx |title=Visit the Star-Spangled Banner |work=National Museum of American History |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Museum of American History produced an online exhibition in conjunction with the reopening of Flag Hall in 2008. An interactive component allows site visitors to closely explore features of the flag in detail, download an audio-descriptive tour of the exhibition for the visually-impaired, and hear the song performed on original instruments from the National Museum of American History's collection.&lt;ref name="NMAH-online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/ |title=The Star-Spangled Banner |work=National Museum of American History |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lost Nazi bunker in a forest in Germany contains a dreadful secret.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5403">'''Theodorus Janssonius van Almeloveen''' (24 July 1657 – 28 July 1712&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferguson | first = John | title = Bibliographical Notes on Histories of Inventions and Books of Secrets | publisher = Strathern &amp; Freeman | year = 1895 | location = Glasgow | pages = 6–11 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN28002090&amp;id=POEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA6&amp;vq=almeloveen }}&lt;/ref&gt;) ('''Theodoor Jansson''') was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physician, and the learned editor of various classical and medical works. He was born at [[Mijdrecht]], near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], where his father was minister of the reformed church. His mother, Mary Jansson, was related to the celebrated printer of [[Amsterdam]], [[Jan Janssonius|Jan Jansson]].&lt;ref name="ngb"&gt;{{Cite Newgenbio |title=Almeloveen, Theodore|volume=1|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying at [[Utrecht University]] under various eminent men, such as [[Johann Georg Graevius]] for [[belles lettres]], de Vries for [[philosophy]], [[Johann Leusden]] for [[theology]], [[Johannes Munniks]] and [[Jacob Vallan]] (1637–1720), for [[medicine]],&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; etc., he determined to give up his father's profession, for which he had been intended,&lt;ref name="ngb"/&gt; and devote himself to medicine. He became doctor of medicine at Utrecht in 1681.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

In 1687, he settled at [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], where he married. He founded a learned society there in 1692.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; In 1697, he was invited to [[University of Harderwijk|Harderwijk]], to become professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[history]]; and in 1702, he was appointed professor of medicine, retaining both offices until his death.&lt;ref name="ngb"/&gt;

He was an untiring author and editor, and acquired the highest reputation as a teacher, and for his scholarship, science, and particularly for his great bibliographical knowledge. For this specialty, it has been suggested, he may have been indebted to the opportunities of observation afforded him by his uncle [[Jan Janssonius|Jan Jansson]], the printer, whose name he bore.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

He had a great knowledge of books. Besides editions with notes of [[Strabo]], [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], [[Quintilian]], the Aphorisms of [[Hippocrates]], [[Celsus]], ''[[Apicius]]'', [[Marcus Aurelius|Aurelian]] on Diseases, and Decker's ''Treatise on Supposititious Writings'', he has left a work in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] on the [[anatomy]] of the [[muscle]]s, several bibliographical treatises in Latin, among which are a work—''De Vitis Stephanorum'', a list of Plagiaries, and a list of books promised that never appeared.&lt;ref name="ngb"/&gt;

In his ''Inventa nov-antiqua'' (1684), he discusses in detail, with a strong bias towards antiquity, the question of how far the discoveries in contemporary medicine were anticipated by ancient physicians. In this particular field, therefore, he sustains the "ancients versus moderns" thesis taken up by others, and which, in its greatest amplitude, led to the serious debates of [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] and [[William Wotton]], and to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s satirical ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

In his ''Plagiariorum Syllabus'' (1694), he lists authors—including biblical, classical, and contemporary writers—who have [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] expressions from previous writers. His list includes [[Andrea Alciato]], [[Jean Bodin|Bodin]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Isaac Casaubon|Casaubon]], [[Daniel Heinsius|Heinsius]], [[Hadrianus Junius|Junius]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Petrus Ramus]], [[Claudius Salmasius]], [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]], and [[Henry Estienne]], among others.&lt;ref name="degraaf"&gt;"[http://antiqbook.nl/degraafbooks/list-155.html Antiquarian Bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503190523/http://www.antiqbook.nl/degraafbooks/list-155.html |date=2006-05-03 }}".

The gas chambers have continually broken down and the burial pits are overflowing with bodies. The SS resorts to shooting incoming Jews in the arrival area of the camp and piling bodies throughout the camp. In August, Globocnik orders [[Franz Stangl]], commandant of Sobibor, to replace Dr. Irmfried Eberl as commandant of Treblinka. Stangl restores order in the camp and supervises the building of new gas chambers, which are operational in early autumn 1942.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4207">'''Tishri-years''' is an ancient calendar system used in [[Israel]]/[[Judea]], and the [[Jewish people]] in [[Diaspora]]. It is based on, and is a variation of, the [[Nisan-years]]. 

Tishri-years is often called the Jewish Civil Calendar, in contrast to [[Nisan-years]], which is often called the Jewish [[Nisan-years|Religious Calendar]].

Tishri-years is similar to, and sometimes equivalent to, the [[Macedonian years]] practices by the Hellenistic empires (332-30 BC). They are all lunisolar years beginning from Autumn, but could differ by a month.

While the [[Nisan-years]] begin the year from the Spring season, around the [[Vernal Equinox]]/[[Spring Equinox]] (Gregorian March 20/21), the Tishri-years begin the years from the Autumn season, around the [[Autumn Equinox]] (Gregorian September 22/23). The [[New Years Day]] of the Tishri-years is called ''[[Rosh Hashanah]]'' ("Head of the Year"); it begins the [[Fall Feasts]] of Israel. 

Tishri 1, however, is not determined directly by its relationship to the [[Autumn Equinox]]. It depends on the determination of Nisan 1, which is the day after the [[New Moon]] closest to the [[Spring Equinox]] (within fifteen days before or after). Tishri 1 is the first day of the seventh month. Although the month number is always counted from Nisan, in the Tishri-years, the year begins and ends with Tishri 1.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology, rev ed. (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers), 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intercalary month]] is still the second Adar, initially determined by agricultural observations in Israel. Although meteorological conditions may cause a few days of delay for each [[Rosh Codesh]] ("Head of the Month"), over all the errors will cancel each other, and the calendar system remained accurate.

After the fourth century AD, [[Hillel II]] fixed the [[Jewish Talmudic Calendar]] by a mathematical algorithm, in order for Jews all around the world to observe the feasts according to the same calendar. This caused the Jewish calendar to gradually depart from the actual seasons, due to the accumulated errors.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Scheffler and P. P. Scheffler, Calmaster2000: Dates, Holidays, Astronomical Events (Pittsburgh, PA: Zephyr Services).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Tishri-years tradition can be traced to King [[David]], who was ordained the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (the two southern tribes) on Tishri 1, 1010 BC, before he was ordained the king of Israel (the ten northern tribes) on Nisan 1, 1002 BC. It seemed that [[David]] still used the [[Nisan-years]] in chronicling his years, but King [[Solomon]] made it a national calendar commemorating his great father. And after the split of the kingdom in 931/930 BC, the northern kingdom [[Israel]] continued using [[Nisan-years]], while the southern kingdom [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] used the Tishri-years.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, rev. ed. (Grand Rapids: Kregal Publications).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Jewish people]] kept on using the Tishri-years system throughout the first (Babylonian) and the second (Roman) [[Diaspora]], till today. They also traced the system back till the time of creation.

'''Wendy Elizabeth Davies''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]], [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]], [[Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales|FLSW]] is an Emeritus Professor of History at [[University College, London]], England.

Davies studied for her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree (1964) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree (1970) in history at UCL. Following positions in Munich and [[Birmingham University]], she returned to UCL as a Lecturer in Medieval History. She was made a Professor in 1985 and thereafter became Head of the Department of History, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Dean of the Faculty of Social &amp; Historical Sciences and, from 1995, UCL Pro-Provost (European Affairs). She was made a Fellow of UCL in 1997. UCL marked her retirement at a reception on 30 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;UCL site at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0710/07103101&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58729|date=14 June 2008|page=10|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a Founding Fellow of the [[Learned Society of Wales]]. Although her teaching originally covered a wide area of European and English [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history it more recently concentrated on Celtic subjects working across and within the disciplines of history, archaeology and [[Celt]]ic studies.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

She is particularly well known for her studies of early Welsh and [[Brittany|Breton]] history. She is co-director, with Prof. [[James Graham-Campbell]], of the interdisciplinary '[[Ogham inscriptions|Celtic Inscribed Stones Project]]', established to build a database of all known early medieval Celtic inscribed stones. For the last twenty years she has also convened a major research group, known as the 'Bucknell Group', with the aim of examining the social significance of early medieval European [[charter]]s. She is notable for her analysis of the [[Book of Llandaff|Llandaff Charters]].

She has a special interest in the economic and social structure of Western European pre-industrial rural communities and the ways in which they used land and for fifteen years ran, with Dr Grenville Astill, the "East Brittany Survey", a multidisciplinary research programme into settlement and land-use changes. Much of her work has involved collaboration with others and she believes in the importance of fieldwork in teaching and research. Her responsibility for co-ordinating and developing the college's European strategy required her to represent the Provost and President both abroad and at home and to advise him on major European [[Higher Education]] trends, maintain the college's membership of European networks and work with to promote the good reputation of UCL. She is particularly concerned that academic qualifications be speedily recognised within Europe.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Early years and academic career==
Dodd was born on October 21, 1869 on a farm near [[Clayton, North Carolina]].  He was of English or Scottish descent, his paternal ancestors having lived in America since the 1740s when the first of the family to arrive in the New World, Daniel Dodd, settled among the Highland Scots in the [[Cape Fear River|Cape Fear Valley]].  Dodd earned his bachelor's degree from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Polytechnic Institute]] (Virginia Tech) in 1895 and a master's degree in 1897. He earned his Ph.D. at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite web |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/02/10/archives/dr-we-dodd-dies-exenvoy-to-reich-critic-of-hitlerism-70-served.html |title=Doctor W.E. Dodd Dies; Ex-Envoy to Reich |date=February 10, 1940 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Martha married on December 25, 1901. They had two children, a daughter, [[Martha Dodd|Martha]], and a son, [[William E. Dodd Jr.]]&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Dodd learned a class-conscious view of [[Southern history]] from his family, which taught him that [[slaveholder]]s were responsible for the [[U.S. Civil War, Origins|Civil War]].  His semi-literate and impoverished father supported his family only through the generosity of wealthier relatives, whom Dodd came to view as "hard men, those traders and aristocratic masters of their dependents".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Virginia Scholar," 324–6&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd taught history at [[Randolph–Macon College]] from 1900 to 1908. His instruction there was at times controversial, because it included attacks on Southern aristocratic values. In 1902, he wrote an article in ''[[The Nation]]'' in which he complained of pressure to flatter Southern elites and their view that slavery played no role in the onset of the Civil War. He criticized the [[United Confederate Veterans|Grand Camp of Confederate Veterans]] by name.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Free Speech," 261–3&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate societies called for his dismissal. Dodd explained that "To suggest that the revolt from the union in 1860 was not justified, was not led by the most lofty minded statesmen, is to invite not only criticism but an enforced resignation." University administrators supported him and he attacked his accusers and detailed their distortions of Southern history.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Virginia Scholar", 327–8. See also William E. Dodd, "Some Difficulties of the History Teacher in the South," ''South Atlantic Quarterly'', vol. 3, October 1940, 117–22&lt;/ref&gt; When recruited by the [[University of Chicago]], he began his 25-year career as Professor of American History there in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd declined an offer from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the following year. Stephenson, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd was the first, and for many years the only, college or university professor fully devoted to the history of the [[American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 36&lt;/ref&gt; He produced many scholarly works, both articles and books, and won excellent reviews as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 37–8&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of his scholarship was superseded in later years, he helped to model a new approach to regional history: sympathetic, judicious, and less partisan than the work of earlier generations. In a letter to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], he described his approach: "The purpose of my studying and writing history is to strike a balance somewhat between the North and the South, but not to offer any defense of any thing."&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd wrote a biography of [[Thomas Jefferson]] in German.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Dodd was a Democrat, active in Chicago politics.&lt;ref name=nom /&gt; In 1912 he wrote speeches for presidential candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 50&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend of President Wilson, visited him in the White House frequently, and authored a biography of him, ''Woodrow Wilson and his Work'', that appeared in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Virginia Scholar," 323, 330&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an early opponent of the theory that German imperialism was solely responsible for [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He gave speeches on behalf of Wilson and U.S. participation in the [[League of Nations]], and in 1920 he reviewed the League-related parts of the speech [[Ohio Governor]] [[James M. Cox]] gave when accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 50–2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, following Wilson's death, Dodd lectured on his administration and its accomplishments, revised the biography he had written, and co-edited the six-volumes of ''The Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson''. He wrote in defense of Wilson for both scholarly journals and the popular press. Through these efforts, he developed connections to a number of figures in the Democratic Party establishment, including [[Josephus Daniels]], [[Daniel C. Roper]], and [[Edward M. House]].

Dodd held several positions as an officer of the [[American Historical Association]] and was named the organization's president for 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Henry E. Bourne, "Urbana Meeting American Historical Association," ''American Historical Review'', vol. 39, no. 3 (April 1934), 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd long planned to write a multi-volume history of the American South. As he reached his sixties, he found the prospect of completing it increasingly unlikely given his academic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointment as Ambassador to Germany ==
The Roosevelt administration had difficulty filling the post of U.S. Ambassador to Germany. The volatile political situation in Germany presented diplomatic challenges, but most observers expected German politics would stabilize before too long. The ambassadorship, normally a patronage position rather than one filled by a State Department professional, was offered to others, including [[James M. Cox]] and [[Newton D. Baker]], both of whom declined citing personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 447. Another name considered was [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], president of [[Columbia University]].&lt;/ref&gt; With the administration under pressure to act before the adjournment of Congress, Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper, a longtime friend of Dodd and his family, suggested his name&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 447–8; Offner, 55&lt;/ref&gt; after Dodd himself had made it clear he was seeking a diplomatic post that would allow him sufficient free time to complete his multi-volume history.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] offered Dodd the position on June 8, 1933, and sent the Senate his nomination to be U.S. Ambassador to Germany on June 10, 1933.&lt;ref name=nom&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1933/06/11/archives/wedodd-made-envoy-to-germany-senate-confirms-nomination-of-chicago.html "W.E. Dodd Made Envoy to Germany", June 11, 1933]. Retrieved March 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was confirmed the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 448&lt;/ref&gt; Before his departure, Dodd's old friend [[Carl Sandburg]] told him he needed "to find out what this man Hitler is made of, what makes his brain go round, what his blood and bones are made of" and still "be brave and truthful, keep your poetry and integrity."&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 68&lt;/ref&gt; He left for Germany on July 5, 1933, accompanied by his wife and two adult children. His departure statements said:&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 449&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The realities of the American past as well as the dilemma of the present reconcile me to the adventure I am about to undertake. Germany can hardly fail to realize the importance of friendly cooperation with the 120,000,000 people of the United States, and the United States can hardly fail to realize the value of social and economic cooperation with the land of Luther, Stein and Bismarck. Though difficulties lie ahead, one can hardly think that an honest, frank mission to Berlin can fail of good result.}}

==Service in Berlin==

===German debts===
Before his departure for Berlin, State Department officials set as his priority the need to ensure that the German government did not default on its debts to American lenders. Dodd met with a group of bankers in New York City who recognized that economic conditions in Germany made full payment unlikely. They hoped he could argue against a German default and suggested they would agree to lower the interest on their loans from 7% to 4% to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 46–9&lt;/ref&gt; National City Bank and Chase National Bank held over 100 million dollars in German bonds, which Germany later proposed to pay back at the rate of thirty-cents on the dollar. Dodd was not sympathetic to the bankers or the high interest rates they charged.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 37&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly registered protests with the German government when payments were suspended or debts to United States lenders were treated differently from debts owed to those in other countries. Yet he remained fundamentally in sympathy with Germany's request that interest rates be lowered. As Secretary of State Hull insisted that Dodd renew his requests for payment, Dodd expressed frustration in his diary: "What more can I say than I have said a score of times? Germany is in a terrible plight and for once she recognizes war is no remedy."&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 277–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitism===
Before leaving to take up his post, Dodd consulted on the situation in Germany, and especially Nazi persecution of the Jews, with his own contacts and during interviews the State Department arranged for him. The opinions he heard covered a broad range. [[Charles Richard Crane]], a plumbing industry tycoon and philanthropist, expressed great admiration for Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 39&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Jews, Crane said: "Let Hitler have his way."&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the State Department's most senior officials harbored an outright dislike of Jews, including [[William Phillips (diplomat)|William Phillips]], Undersecretary of State, the second-highest-ranking man in the department.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd met with members of the Jewish-American community, including [[Stephen S. Wise]] and [[Felix Warburg]], who asked him to seek a reversal of the Nazis' repressive anti-Jewish policies. Dodd promised he would "exert all possible personal influence against unjust treatment" of German Jews, but not in his official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roosevelt advised him on June 16, 1933:&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 32; Tansill, 49; Offner, 67–8&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The German authorities are treating Jews shamefully and the Jews in this country are greatly excited. But this is also not a government affair. We can do nothing except for American citizens who happen to be made victims. We must protect them, and whatever we can do to moderate the general persecution by unofficial and personal influence ought to be done.}}

[[Edward M. House]], a veteran in Democratic Party circles since the Wilson administration, told Dodd that he should do what he could "to ameliorate Jewish sufferings," but cautioned, "the Jews should not be allowed to dominate economic or intellectual life in Berlin as they have done for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 38; Tansill, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd shared House's views and wrote in his diary that "The Jews had held a great many more of the key positions in Germany than their numbers or talents entitled them to."&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this view of the proper role of Jews in society, he advised Hitler in March 1934 that Jewish influence should be restrained in Germany as it was in the United States. "I explained to him [Hitler]" wrote Dodd, "that where a question of over-activity of Jews in university or official life made trouble, we had managed to redistribute the offices in such a way as to not give great offense." Hitler ignored Dodd's advice and responded that "if they [the Jews] continue their activity we shall make a complete end of them in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 282–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd tried without success to save the life of [[Helmut Hirsch]], a [[German-American]] Jew who planned to bomb parts of the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] at [[Nuremberg]].

===Anti-Americanism===
The German government's treatment of United States citizens created a series of crises during Dodd's tenure as ambassador. [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]], a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' and president of the Foreign Press Association in Berlin, published a book-length attack on the Nazis, ''Germany Puts the Clock Back'', and continued his critical coverage until the government demanded his resignation as head of the Association. The U.S. State Department ignored the government's demand that it arrange for his return to the U.S. When Mowrer's employers arranged for him to leave and he sought to stay to cover the September 1933 Nuremberg rally, Dodd refused to support him, believing his reporting was so provocative that it made it difficult for other American journalists to work.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment of Nazi intentions===
On October 5, 1933 Dodd gave a speech in Berlin at the American Club describing the [[New Deal]]'s effect on the U.S. Constitutional system: "It was not revolution as men are prone to say.  It was a popular expansion of governmental powers beyond all constitutional grants, and nearly all men everywhere hope the President may succeed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box32/t299b01.html docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 1933 Dodd gave a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin, with [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] in attendance, and used an elaborate analogy based on Roman history to criticize the Nazis as "half-educated statesmen" who adopted the "arbitrary modes" of an ancient tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 74–5&lt;/ref&gt; His views grew more critical and pessimistic with the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in June–July 1934, when the Nazis killed prominent political opponents including many dissenters within the Nazi movement. Dodd was one of the very few in the U.S. and European diplomatic community who reported that the Nazis were too strongly entrenched for any opposition to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 104&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1935 he reported to his State Department superiors that Hitler intended "to annex part of the Corridor, part of Czechoslovakia, and all of Austria." A few months later he predicted a German-Italian alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 132. For Dodd's skepticism of Nazi intentions with respect to the [[Locarno Treaties]] following the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet Pact]] of 1935, see Offner, 136–40&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling ineffectual, Dodd offered to resign, but Roosevelt allowed him only a recuperative visit to the U.S. The President wrote to U.S Ambassador to Italy [[Breckinridge Long]] in September 1935 that he and Dodd had been "far more accurate in your pessimism for the past two years than any of my other friends in Europe." In a note to Assistant Secretary of State [[R. Walton Moore]] that same month, he wrote of Dodd: "we most certainly do not want him to consider resigning. I need him in Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd reported to Secretary of State Hull in September 1936 that Hitler's domestic economic policies, rearmament, and Rhineland initiatives had consolidated his support to the point that he could count on the support of the German people for a declaration of war "in any measure he might undertake."&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 166–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a U.S. vacation of several months in 1936, Dodd devoted the fall to testing German reaction to a personal meeting between Roosevelt and Hitler, an initiative the President proposed, or a world peace conference. After a series of rebuffs, Dodd produced a report for the State Department dated November 28, 1936, which Assistant Secretary Moore commended and forwarded to Roosevelt. He decried the tendency of Europeans to refuse to believe that Hitler meant to carry out the expansionist plans he had outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. He described Hitler's success in outmaneuvering France and Great Britain diplomatically and forging ties with Italy and Spain. Assessing the current situation he wrote: "there does not appear to be any vital force or combination of forces which will materially impede Germany in pursuit of her ambitions."&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 171–3 The report was called "A Survey of German National Socialist Foreign Policy."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with State Department===
Many in the State Department had reservations about Dodd's suitability for the job. He was neither a political figure of the sort normally honored with such a prestigious appointment, nor a member of the social elite that formed the higher ranks of the Foreign Service. In Berlin some of his subordinates were embarrassed by his insistence on living modestly, walking unaccompanied in the street, and leaving formal receptions so early as to appear rude. Dodd considered his insistence on living on his $17,500 annual salary a point of pride and criticized the posh lifestyle of other embassy officials.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 449–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his tenure as ambassador, Dodd decided to avoid attending the annual Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg rather than appear to endorse Hitler's regime. In 1933, the State Department left the decision to him, and other ambassadors—including those of France and Great Britain—adopted a similar policy to Dodd's.&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 266–7: Offner, 70–1&lt;/ref&gt; As the Nazi Party became indistinguishable from the government, however, the State Department preferred that Dodd attend and avoid giving offense to the German government. State Department pressure increased each year until Dodd determined to avoid attending in 1937 by arranging a visit to the United States at the time of the rally. His advice against sending a representative of the U.S. embassy to attend the September 1937 Nazi Party congress in Nuremberg was overridden by his State Department superiors, and the State Department allowed its overruling of Dodd's position to become public.&lt;ref name=protest&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1937/09/04/archives/dodd-protests-sending-aide-to-nazi-fete-but-state-department.html "Dodd Protests Sending Aide to Nazi Fete, but State Department Overrules Envoy," September 4, 1937]. Retrieved March 16, 2011. The ambassadors from France and Great Britain attended in 1937. The French Ambassador told the U.S. chargé d'affaires, the senior officer in Dodd's absence, that continuing their boycott "would be conspicuous if not antagonistic" and "to refuse the invitation would be acting out of accord with realities." Tansill, 340–1; Ford, 453&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler expressed his pleasure with the attendance of the U.S., Great Britain, and France for the first time, recognizing it as an "innovation" in policy.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 211–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation==
Dodd considered resigning several times, beginning as early as July 1934.

In 1935, American journalist [[Marguerite Young (journalist)|Marguerite Young]] interviewed Dodd at his own request for the [[CPUSA]]-controlled ''[[Daily Worker]]''.  He described to her FDR's lack of support for him.  She noted that Dodd met her because she already knew his daughter, [[Martha Dodd]], who was (unbeknownst to her father) a Soviet spy.  She wrote of Martha, "his daughter, whom I'd met and liked, an attractive young woman, light yellow hair, large black velvet bow at the nape of her neck." Dodd reported to Young that his anger because the State Department had no "secure communications" or meetings:  "he could not make an appointment to meet privately with anyone in Berlin, even members of his staff, without its becoming known instantly ... both his critics and his supports knew what he was doing before he told them."  Young filed the story–and it never appeared in print.  She traveled to New York and met directly with Party secretary general [[Earl Browder]].  The only explanation that Browder offered was "'You know that we are supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt' ... He just looked very solemn, implacable, and pious, pious, pious."&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;

By 1936, his health had declined seriously and his clear antagonism to the German government increased his personal sense of defeat.&lt;ref name=offner204&gt;Offner, 204&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1936 U.S. election campaign, Dodd wrote a public letter warning that the defeat of Roosevelt's programs would produce a fascist dictatorship financed by an American billionaire: "There are individuals of great wealth who wish a dictatorship ... There are politicians who think they may gain powers like those exercised in Europe. One man, I have been told by friends, who owns nearly a billion dollars, is ready to support such a program and, of course, control it."&lt;ref name=offner204 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ford452&gt;Ford, 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resign /&gt; Several Senators called for him to be recalled from Germany and Senator [[William Borah]] called him "an irresponsible scandalmonger."&lt;ref name=offner204 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ford452 /&gt; He supported Roosevelt's attempt to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the membership of the Supreme Court]], arguing that courts need to be responsive to popular wishes if the United States were to avoid totalitarian impulses.&lt;ref name=protest /&gt; Consistent in interpreting American institutions in terms of their place on the aristocratic-democratic continuum, he viewed the Supreme Court as an aristocratic institution in need of an infusion of democracy. When he expressed these views in letters to senators, they reacted angrily and newspapers called for Dodd's resignation.&lt;ref name=offner204 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Virginia Scholar", 340&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt told Dodd he was "frankly delighted" with the letter,&lt;ref name=offner204 /&gt; but the public dispute embarrassed President Roosevelt and gave Dodd's enemies in the State Department an opportunity to press for his removal.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, "Virginia Scholar", 340–1&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roosevelt, reacting to complaints about Dodd's effectiveness as well as his health, notified the State Department in April 1937 that he was prepared to see Dodd's tenure end September 1. Then Dodd, on his arrival in the U.S. in August, said that "the basic objective of some powers in Europe is to frighten and even destroy democracies everywhere," provoking a formal protest on the part of the German Ambassador to the U.S. Given that exchange, the State Department determined that it was more important that Dodd return to Germany than to allow his resignation to appear as a response to German protests. Dodd left a resignation letter and suggested the following March as a suitable date. In September, his dispute with the State Department over U.S. diplomatic presence at the Nuremberg rallies became public.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 206–9&lt;/ref&gt; The German government told the State Department that Dodd could no longer function in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 209&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd was surprised when told in November to prepare to depart by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 453–4; Offner, 205–6, 210&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation was announced in December.&lt;ref name=resign&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/08/archives/dodd-resigns-post-as-envoy-to-reich-wilson-successor-ambassador-who.html "Dodd Resigns Post as Envoy to Reich; Wilson Successor," December 8, 1937].

Retrieved September 28, 2011; Ford, 454&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==

In 1937, Dodd stepped down as ambassador in Berlin, and President Roosevelt appointed [[Hugh R. Wilson|Hugh Wilson]], a senior professional diplomat, to replace him.&lt;ref name=larson448&gt;Larson, 448&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his State Department post, he campaigned to warn against the dangers posed by Germany, Italy, and Japan, and detailed racial and religious persecution in Germany.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He predicted German aggression against [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=ford454 /&gt; Dodd, who was in failing health, traveled on a speaking tour of Canada and the US, establishing his reputation as a statesman who opposed the Nazis.&lt;ref name=larson448 /&gt;

In 1938, Dodd wrote an assessment of Nazi ideology and the Third Reich's plan for Europe. He stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William E. |last=Dodd |chapter=The Bible of a Political Church |title=The Nazi Primer: Official Handbook for the Schooling of Hitler Youth |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]] |year=1938 |pages=256ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=[S]everal policies were adopted during the first two years of the Nazi regime. The first was to suppress the Jews ... They were to hold no positions in University or government operations, own no land, write nothing for newspapers, gradually give up their personal business relations, be imprisoned and many of them killed ... [The Primer] betrays no indication of the propaganda activities of the Nazi government. And of course there is not a word in it to warn the unwary reader that all the people who might oppose the regime have been absolutely silenced. The central idea behind it is to make the rising generation worship their chief and get ready to "save civilization" from the Jews, from Communism and from democracy—thus preparing the way for a Nazified world where all freedom of the individual, of education, and of the churches is to be totally suppressed.}}

A volume of his planned four-volume history of the South was published in 1938 as ''The Old South: Struggles for Democracy'', covering the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Pearson, "Book Reviews," ''William and Mary Quarterly'', Second Series, vol. 18, no. 4, 517–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd's wife died in May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1938/05/29/archives/mrs-william-e-dodd-is-dead-in-virginia-wife-of-former-ambassador-to.html Mrs. William E. Dodd is Dead in Virginia," May 29, 1938]. Retrieved March 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Dodd accidentally ran over a 4-year-old African-American child and fled the scene. The child sustained severe injuries, but survived.&lt;ref name=larson448 /&gt; Dodd was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, convicted, and fined $250 plus court costs. Dodd also paid more than $1000 for the child's medical bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Traces Museum |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |url=http://www.traces.org/williamdodd.html|title=William Dodd|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year's illness, Dodd died on February 9, 1940, at his country home at [[Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In April 1946, during the [[Nuremberg trials]], Dodd's diaries were used as evidence against [[Hjalmar Schacht]], a liberal economist and banker, and a Nazi government official until the end of 1937. Schacht praised Dodd's character but suggested his views in the 1930s were tainted by his less than fluent German.&lt;ref&gt;Nizkor Project: [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-12/tgmwc-12-117-07.shtml "The Trial of German Major War Criminals"]. Retrieved August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He testified that Dodd was his friend who invited him to emigrate to the United States. Schacht's attorney described Dodd as "one of the few accredited diplomats in Berlin who very obviously had no sympathy of any sort for the regime in power".&lt;ref&gt;Nizkor Project: [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-12/tgmwc-12-117-08.shtml "The Trial of German Major War Criminals"]. Retrieved August 26, 2011. Others also disputed statements Dodd recorded in his diary, notably Sir [[Nevile Henderson]], [[British Ambassador to Germany|ambassador of Great Britain to Germany]] in 1937–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Assessments of Dodd's service in Berlin vary considerably, colored by what another ambassador might have accomplished. Hull in his ''Memoirs'' described Dodd as "sincere though impulsive and inexperienced."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 455. See also the report of [[Arthur Krock]], Ford, 456: "[Dodd] has impressed his diplomatic associates as a man who is inclined to forget his responsibilities as an envoy in his zeal as an historian and in his views as a contemporary observer of governing trends. For these impulses the Department [of State] is disposed to award Mr. Dodd full credit as a man. But it is no secret in these generally discreet corridors that a change at Berlin has long been desired ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Lerner]] later commented:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/projects/centcat/fac/facch18_01.html|title=William E. Dodd, History|website=www.lib.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=If the record of our times were not so keyed to the tragic, it might be read as first-rate ironic comedy. Here was a Germany in which there had just come to dominance a power-drunk fanatic, a ruthless activist who knew little of history and hated democracy; and the man we sent to him to represent American interests was a retiring scholar ... who, in the character of his democracy, was perhaps the last pure Jeffersonian to be found in America.}}

Dodd felt himself a failure both during his ambassadorship and after, having set himself the impossible standard of "changing the Third Reich by example and persuasion."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 458&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] believes no other ambassador to Nazi Germany was more effective, "even if some were more popular and others better informed." He reports the assessment of [[George S. Messersmith]], the embassy's consul general who worked closely with Dodd, who wrote that "there were very few men who realized what was happening in Germany more thoroughly " than Dodd, who proved ineffective because he "was completely appalled by what was happening."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard L. Weinberg]], ''Hitler's Foreign Policy 1933–1939: The Road to World War II'' (NY: Enigma Books, 2005), 107n&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Franklin L. Ford faults Dodd for failing to provide "concrete intelligence concerning ''immediate'' Nazi objectives and power" as his peers were providing their superiors in London and Paris. He faults as well Dodd's nostalgic view of the Germany of his student years and centuries past that enabled him to view [[German anti-Semitism]] as a Nazi phenomenon driven personally by Hitler without recognizing its deeper roots in German society.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 458–60&lt;/ref&gt; A harsh critic of FDR's foreign policy called Dodd "a tragic misfit", "a babe-in-the-woods in the dark forests of Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/80041906/20/k-William-E-Dodd-Goes-to-Germany-as-U-S-Ambassador?sh=157217b2b19f4bcb Back Door to War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tansill, 46. On Tansill, see ''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1952/05/11/archives/f-d-r-gets-the-blame-back-door-to-war-the-roosevelt-foreign-policy.html Dexter Perkins, "F.D.R. Gets the Blame," May 11, 1952]. Retrieved September 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd and his family's time in Nazi Germany are the subject of [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson's]] bestselling [[2011 in literature|2011]] work of popular history, ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'', which portrays Dodd as well meaning but naive and unprepared, believing as a historian that all national leaders are ultimately rational actors, and rendered helpless when he realizes that Hitler may in fact be completely irrational.
