'''Andris Ozols''' (born on January 30, 1968, in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]) is the director of [[Investment and Development Agency of Latvia]] (LIAA), a [[Investment promotion agency|government agency]] responsible for promoting [[Foreign direct investment|investments]] and business development in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liaa.gov.lv/eng/home/about_us/about_us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615003907/http://www.liaa.gov.lv/eng/home/about_us/about_us |archivedate=2012-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozols was appointed director of LIAA in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.db.lv/citas-zinas/latvijas-investiciju-un-attistibas-agenturu-stures-andris-ozols-117526&lt;/ref&gt; He also currently serves as deputy chairman of the board of the [[Liepāja Special Economic Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liepaja-sez.lv/lv/liepajas-osta/ostas-parvalde/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozols has become notorious as director of LIAA, due to the owner of company [[Aerodium Latvia]] Ivars Beitāns, who publicly accused Ozols of extorting a bribe from Aerodium in order for LIAA to award the contract for preparing [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Latvia|Latvia pavillion]] in [[World Expo 2010]]. Ozols maintained a counterclaim that Aerodium instead wished to bribe Ozols in order for LIAA not to pursue in court a claim for misappropriation of EU funding in another company of Beitāns -- "Gaisa sporta sertifikācijas centrs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diena.lv/raksts/pasaule/krievija/papildinata-aerodium-ozols-prasija-8-no-liguma-summas-liaa-vaditajs-kukuli-neprasiju-737061|title="Aerodium": Ozols prasīja 8% no līguma summas; LIAA vadītājs: kukuli neprasīju}}&lt;/ref&gt;. LIAA did afterwards sue "Gaisa sporta sertifikācijas centrs" for misappropriation of EU funds in Latvian courts, but lost the claim in all instances of the courts, the last instance declaring final verdict in October 17, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.la.lv/valsts-iestade-zaude-2-miljonu-eiro-prasiba-pret-veja-tunelu-razotajiem|title=Valsts iestāde zaudē 2 miljonu eiro prasībā pret vēja tuneļu ražotājiem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his professional career, Ozols has served as a board member at [[Riga International Airport]] and Latvia's [http://www.csdd.lv/ Road Traffic Safety Directorate].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/lidostas-padomes-priekssedetajs-bus-liaa-direktors-ozols/348328&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993-1997 he lived in Germany, where he worked in the transport and logistics industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebaltics.com/forum2008/Speakers/Ozols.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ozols studied physics and mathematics at the [[University of Latvia]] and holds a degree in business management from the [[School of Business Administration Turība]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/latvijas-investiciju-un-attistibas-agenturu-vadis-andris-ozols.d?id=9638562&lt;/ref&gt; He is fluent in Latvian, English, Russian, and German.

Ozols is married to [[Dana Reizniece-Ozola]], a deputy in the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament)&lt;ref&gt;http://titania.saeima.lv/personal/deputati/saeima11_depweb_public.nsf/depArchive.html?ReadForm&amp;unid=4680B802244E3FB8C22579100046C58B&amp;url=./0/4680B802244E3FB8C22579100046C58B?OpenDocument&amp;lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; and champion chess player who holds the title of [[Woman Grandmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;http://chess-results.com/tnr57855.aspx?art=9&amp;lan=1&amp;turdet=YES&amp;flag=30&amp;snr=75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brendan Rendall Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (15 February 1901 – 8 August 1958) was an [[Irish people|Irish]]-born businessman and a [[Minister of the Crown|minister]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] cabinet. He is best remembered for opposing the [[Bank of England|Bank of England's]] co-operation with [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|YauM5dHLn1s|Banking With Hitler}}, ''BBC'', 16 February 2006. Retrieved 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and for subsequently supporting [[Winston Churchill]]'s prosecution of [[World War II]] against Hitler. He was also the founder of the modern version of the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Lysaght/&gt; He served as [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] from 1941 to 1945.

==Early life==
Brendan Rendall Bracken was born in [[Templemore]], [[County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]], the second son and third of the four children of [[Joseph Kevin Bracken]] (1852–1904), builder and monumental mason, and his second wife, Hannah Agnes Ryan (1872–1928). His father had belonged to the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|IRB]] and was one of the seven founders of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Widowed in 1904, by  1908 Hannah Bracken had moved her family (including two stepdaughters) to [[Dublin]], where Brendan attended St Patrick's National School, [[Drumcondra, Dublin|Drumcondra]], until 1910, when he was transferred to the [[O'Connell School]], run by the [[Irish Christian Brothers]]. Distressed by his misbehaviour, his mother sent him in 1915 to [[Mungret College]], a [[Jesuit]] boarding school in [[County Limerick]], but he bolted in 1915 and ran up hotel bills. She then sent him to [[Australia]] to live with a cousin who was a priest in [[Echuca]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The young man led a nomadic existence in Australia, moving often but reading avidly and acquiring a self-education.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/32020 Bracken profile at Oxford DNB]; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 Bracken returned briefly to Ireland, finding his mother settled in [[County Meath]]. He distanced himself from Ireland and his siblings who were in revolt over their father's inheritance, moving instead to settle in [[Liverpool]]. In  1920 he appeared at [[Sedbergh School]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], claiming to be 15 years old, an [[Australian people|Australian]], to have been orphaned in a bush fire, and to have a family connection to Montagu Rendell, the then-headmaster of [[Winchester College]]. Without fully believing this story, Sedbergh's headmaster, impressed by the depth of knowledge and eagerness to progress by the young Bracken, accepted him. By the end of one term he emerged having succeeded in blending his [[Irish republican]] heritage and his five formative years in Australia, with the elements and trappings of a [[British public school]] man. He might have had good reason for seeking to hide his Irish heritage as the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1919–1921) aroused great hostility towards the [[Irish people|Irish]] living in [[Great Britain]].

For whatever reason this denial became a regular feature of his personal strategy in life. A second example occurred in 1926 when he met [[Major-General]] [[Emmet Dalton]], a former senior commander in the new [[Irish Army]], in [[London]].  This former [[British Army]] officer turned IRA confidant, who was one of [[General officer|General]] [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]'s right-hand men, recalled meeting Bracken at [[National school (Ireland)|national school]] in Dublin. Bracken denied this, but Dalton insisted that he remembered the smell of Bracken's corduroy trousers. A third example occurred during the [[Second World War]] when Bracken told people that his brother had been killed in action at [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik]], when in fact his brother was alive, well, and asking Brendan for money, from Ireland. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Business and political career==
After Sedbergh, whose [[School tie#Old school tie|"old boy" tie]] he used to good effect, Bracken was briefly a schoolmaster at [[Bishop's Stortford College]]. He then made a successful career from 1922 as a magazine publisher and newspaper editor in [[London]]. His initial success was based on selling advertising space to at least cover the cost of each number. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 election]] he assisted [[Winston Churchill]]'s unsuccessful attempt to be elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leicester West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester West]], which started their political affiliation.  He also assisted in 
the by-election at Westmister.  In the fighting that occurred on the streets, Bracken was stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixty Minutes with Winston Churchill|author=[[W. H. Thompson]]|date=1964|orig-year=1953|publisher=Johnson Publications Ltd.|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bracken himself stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], being elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1929 for the London constituency of [[Paddington North (UK Parliament constituency)|North Paddington]]. [[Stanley Baldwin]] described Bracken as Churchill's "faithful chela", "chela" being the Hindi word for disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.historytoday.com/charles-lysaght/churchills-faithful-chela |title=Charles Lysaght strips away some of the many mysteries surrounding Brendan Bracken, Churchill’s staunch but enigmatic supporter, and the founder of this magazine|journal=History Today|author= Lysaght, Charles |volume=52 |issue= 2|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his early magazine stories included a political flavour and he commissioned articles from a wide range of politicians such as Churchill and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]. Business and politics permanently overlapped in his life, in a similar way to the career of his occasional friend [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. He needed politicians for stories and they needed the publicity given by his publications. A supporter of Winston Churchill from 1923, when Churchill was out of Parliament and in the political wilderness, in the 1930s he was invited to join Churchill's "[[Other Club]]". Their lives changed from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939.

In 1926, he was the founding editor of ''[[The Banker]]'' magazine and bankers still name their respected annual Bank of the Year awards "Brackens" in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebanker.com/Awards/The-Bank-of-The-Year-Awards The Bank of the Year Awards"], ''The Banker''&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Banker'' features a regular column called "Bracken",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebanker.com/Comment/Bracken "The Bracken Column"] ''The Banker''&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on providing views and perspectives on how to improve the [[global financial system]].

===Assists in selection of Churchill===
In two matters relating to Churchill, Bracken can be said to have played a key part behind the scenes. When [[Neville Chamberlain]] prepared to resign in May 1940, his successor would be Churchill or [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]. The political issue at stake at the time was the formation of a British National Government, and the particular dilemma over which of Chamberlain's potential successors would be acceptable to the [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]]. The view in Churchill's mind was that the Labour Party would not support him, and he had therefore agreed with Chamberlain to nominate Lord Halifax. When Bracken became aware of Churchill's agreement to nominate Lord Halifax, he convinced Churchill that the Labour Party would indeed support him as Chamberlain's successor, and that Lord Halifax's appointment would hand certain victory to Hitler. Bracken advised Churchill tactically to say nothing when the three met to arrange the succession. After a deafening silence during which Churchill was expected to nominate Halifax, the latter obligingly ruled himself out and Churchill was put forward as Britain's wartime Prime Minister, having avoided any appearance of disloyalty to Chamberlain.&lt;ref name=Lysaght&gt;Lysaght, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support from the US 1940–41===
When Churchill became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in May 1940, Bracken helped in moving him into [[No. 10 Downing Street|Downing Street]]. Bracken was sworn into the [[His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1940, despite his lack of ministerial experience, and became Churchill's [[parliamentary private secretary]].

An insight into the nature of the relationship between Churchill and Bracken is found in Churchill's history of World War II. Churchill writes that he had received telegrams from Washington about [[Harry Hopkins]], "stating that he was the closest confidant and personal agent of the President. I therefore arranged that he should be met by Mr. Brendan Bracken on his arrival."&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, W. (2005) ''The Second World War'', Vol. 3, Ch. 2. Penguin Classics. {{ISBN|0141441747}}. pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion was that Churchill had arranged, as is diplomatic custom, for Hopkins to be met by the person who was his closest counterpart in British government, and that Bracken often played the role of confidant and personal agent to Churchill. After Bracken met Hopkins' flight on 9 January 1941, Churchill and Hopkins forged a close association.  According to [[Charles Lysaght|Lysaght's]] biography, Bracken and Hopkins had met in America in the late 1930s, and this personal tie helped speed the decision to assist Britain nearly a year before the US actually entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Lysaght, pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Information===
In 1941, Bracken was promoted to the post of [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] where he served until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.life.com/image/53374558"Brendan Bracken Press Conference" 1943 photo], life.com; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was one of the heads of the [[Political Warfare Executive]].

==Post-war years==
In 1945, after the break-up of the wartime coalition, Bracken was briefly made [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] in the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]], but lost the post in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|fall of the Churchill government]] to [[Clement Attlee]]'s Labour Party. He himself lost his North Paddington seat but soon returned to the Commons, as member of parliament for [[Bournemouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth]] in a November 1945 by-election. He was a relentless critic of the Labour Government's policy of [[nationalisation]] and the retreat from Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Times'', 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1950 general election he was returned for [[Bournemouth East and Christchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth East and Christchurch]], a seat he held until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election the following year]]. In early 1952 he was elevated to the peerage as '''Viscount Bracken''', of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] in the [[Hampshire|County of Southampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39435|date=8 January 1952|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never used the title nor sat in the [[House of Lords]]. He retired from publishing in 1956.

His best-known business accomplishment was merging the ''[[Financial News (1884-1945)|Financial News]]'' into the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in 1945. The latter was published from [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], London, clad in pink stone to match the colour of the paper, just east of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], which was remodelled in 1989. At this stage he was also publishing ''[[The Economist]]''. In 1951, with his love of history, he helped found ''[[History Today]]'' magazine.

==Death==
Bracken died of [[esophageal cancer]] on 8 August 1958, aged 57, in London.&lt;ref&gt;His article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Volume 7, page 147) simply states his death cause as "throat cancer".&lt;/ref&gt; Although raised a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], he refused the [[last rites]] of the Church despite efforts by his nephew, Rev Kevin Bracken, a Cistercian monk at [[Portglenone Abbey|Bethlehem Abbey]], [[Portglenone]], [[County Antrim]], to persuade him.

He was [[cremation|cremated]] without ceremony at [[Golders Green Crematorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Note cremation was formally banned by the Catholic Church until 1963, and until 1966 Catholic priests were forbidden to officiate at cremation services.&lt;/ref&gt; His being unmarried, the viscountcy died with him.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==2010 and 2015 television documentaries==
On 21 December 2010, [[RTÉ One]] broadcast an hour-long TV documentary about his life entitled ''Brendan Bracken – Churchill's Irishman''. The programme was made by [[Spain|Spanish]] production company, Marbella Productions, in association with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], and examined Bracken's life through photographs, interviews, rare archive footage and dramatic reconstructions, and told of his importance in the areas of British political and journalistic life, despite his attempt to hide from history by having all his papers burned after his death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The 2015 television documentary ''Churchill's Secret Son'' is the 90 minute version of the previous documentary ''Churchill's Irishman'', updated by the producers including additional images, stories about Bracken's life and additional footage. The programme was telecast on Discovery UK's History Channel on Saturday, 24 January 2015 at 10 pm, as part of the British History week, and coincided with the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death in 1965.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Canadian Arms Sales''' are governed by the country's [[Export and Imports Permits Act]]. Sales with the United States are also specifically regulated by the 1959 [[Defence Production Sharing Arrangement]].

As of 2000, the largest Canadian-owned arms-exporters were [[CAE (company)|Canadian Aviation Electronics]], the 61st-largest [[defence corporation]] in the world, and [[DY4]], the 94th-largest. Foreign-owned companies based in Canada, such as [[General Motors]] and [[Bell Helicopter]] also contribute significantly.

==Current policies==
[[File:Automatic Firearms Country Control List (AFCCL).png|thumb|400px|right|Countries on the Canadian Automatic Firearms Country Control List{{update inline|date=May 2016}}]]

===Automatic Firearms Country Control List (AFCCL)===
Canadian Government guidance for export controls on weapons systems is published by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-91-575/page-2.html#h-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/SOR-91-575.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Automatic Firearms Country Control List, amended January 2015, is a list of approved export nations which include Albania, Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-91-575/page-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current sales==

===Saudi Arabia===

525 [[MOWAG Piranha]] armoured personnel carriers (APCs) have been sold to Saudi Arabia since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;(http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[CBC News|CBC]] obtained records showing that the deal struck in 2014 involved 928 of the most modern LAVs, the LAV 6. 354 of those are standard troop carriers, 119 of them are "heavy duty" with 105 millimetre cannons affixed to the turret, another 119 are anti tank versions of the LAV 6 and another 119 are "direct fire support" with a two-man turret and a 30 millimetre chain gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-saudi-arms-deal-1.4579772|title=Canada's arms deal with Saudi Arabia includes 'heavy assault' vehicles|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation===

Canada sold about $329,000 worth of equipment to the [[Russian Federation]] between 2007 and 2011, mostly in firearms, armored equipment and software technology. However, due to the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|political crisis in Ukraine]], Canada is seeking to suspend all sales to Moscow as part of its move to implement sanctions in support of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/ndp-calls-on-canada-to-suspend-military-sales-to-russia-over-ukraine-crisis-251483261.html?device=mobile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual reports==

===1986===
In 1986, [[Project Ploughshares]] organised a protest against the conference ''HiTech '86'' which was hosted by the Canadian government, advertising potential foreign markets to military-based contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1986-08/mcgregor.html Views on Canadian Arms Sales&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991===
In 1991, the Canadian government amended the Exports and Imports Permit Act, to allow more freedom in selling [[Light armoured vehicle|LAVs]] and [[automatic weapon]]s. Because it had recently been banned from [[Ottawa]] city property, the [[Arms Exhibition]] ARMX'91 moved to a new home at the [[Carp Airport]] outside the city limits.

===1992===
In 1992, the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] introduced a Parliamentary proposal entitled ''Defence Conversion – A Liberal Priority'', which outlined three possibilities for a post-[[Cold War]] Canadian arms trade, including ''"increas[ing] exports to developing countries where arms spending has been less affected by the Cold War's end – thereby adding to the misery of these countries.'', and instead advocating the third option, to ''"encourage Canadian defence companies to adjust and move away from a dependence on military production and export."''.

===1994===
In 1994, Canadian arms sales skyrocketed 48% to a total of $497.4&amp;nbsp;million, causing a brief controversy.&lt;ref&gt;"Export of Military Goods from Canada Annual Report" produced by the [[Export Controls Division]] of the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt; This sharp escalation contributed to Canada's position as the 7th largest supplier of military arms to Third World countries. Large sales included [[General Motors|GM]]-built [[Light Armoured Vehicle]]s to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and [[Air Defense Anti-Tank System]]s and a [[TACAN|Tactical Air Navigation System]] to Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mons95a.html Canadian arms sales to the Third World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

1994 also saw Canada begin selling military arms to Algeria, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa.

===1995===
In 1995, Canada became the 7th-largest supplier of arms to third-world countries, and the 10th largest arms dealer overall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/research/newswatch/pcc/95-8.html NewsWatch Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
In 2000, Canada's sales totalled $434&amp;nbsp;million, across 50 nations. Large sales included eight [[Howitzer]]s to Brazil, and four more [[Light armoured vehicle|LAVs]] to Saudi Arabia, while smaller sales included $4.9&amp;nbsp;million worth of rockets to Malaysia, $270,976 in simulator parts to Morocco, $50,000 worth of aircraft parts to Indonesia, $27,000 in small arms to Argentina, $21,400 worth of missile parts to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/12299/ AlterNet: Opening The Books On Canadian Arms Sales&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The year also marked the conclusion of the Canadian sale of 40 [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] military helicopters to the United States, who then refitted 33 of the craft with further military upgrades and sold them to Colombia, thus allowing Canada to bypass its restriction against selling arms to Colombia.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ENG-IOR300032003 Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001===
From 1991 through 2001, the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Filipino Department of National Defense]] imported an annual average of $1.6&amp;nbsp;million worth of its equipment from Canada, including [[aircraft part]]s and [[service pistol]]s.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt; This was roughly 0.2% of the $995&amp;nbsp;million Filipino defense budget of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4humanrights.org/world/fields/2067.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004===
Major sales in 2004 included the sale of $346&amp;nbsp;million worth of [[Bell Helicopter]]s to Pakistan and $22&amp;nbsp;million worth of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney|Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada]] aircraft engines to Indonesia.

===2011===
Canada jumped&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://vancouversun.com/news/Canada+world+12th+largest+arms+exporter+Data/5077218/story.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from fifteenth to twelfth largest exporter of military hardware in the world.

===2012===
Canada sold their military equipment to the [[Philippines]] in their signed Memorandum of Understanding agreement.

On December 14, 2012, the Government of Canada concluded the regulatory process to amend the AFCCL. This amendment expands the AFCCL to include [[Colombia]], bringing the number of countries on the AFCCL to 34.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/about-a_propos/expor/amend-auto-modi.aspx?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centralisation''' (British) or '''centralization''' (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location  group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In [[political science]], centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a [[centralized government]].

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
''Centralisation of authority'' is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, A. (2012). ''What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority ?.'' [online] Preservearticles.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/201101143291/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-centralisation-of-authority.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was first introduced in the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancientmilitary.com, (2012). ''Ancient China Government.'' [online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ancientmilitary.com/ancient-china-government.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that [[Han Fei]]zi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, D., Bickers, R., Carter, J., de Weert, H., Elders, C., Entenmann, R. and Felton, M. (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia. New York: Marshall Cavendish'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* The monarchical power is the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolizes all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor's favor, are able to amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife.(Jin and Liu, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Jin, G. and Liu, Q. (1992). ''The Cycle of Growth and Decline - On the Ultrastable Structure of Chinese Society: Chapter 7''. 2nd ed. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The administrative department has highly centralized power. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation are not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries manage the government and effectively rule the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===
The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, K. (2015). ''What is Centralization and De-Centralization of the Authority? | Total MBA Guide.'' [online] Mbaofficial.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mbaofficial.com/mba-courses/principles-of-management/what-is-centralization-and-de-centralization-of-the-authority/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The central power maintains a large "encompassing interest" in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state's wealth and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organized top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, G. (2010). ''藤井厳喜WEBサイト | Fujii's Focus For Future 公式ブログ.'' [online] Gemki-fujii.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gemki-fujii.com/blog/2010/000641.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Excludes actors at the local and provincial levels from the prevailing system of governance, reducing the capacity of the central government to resolve disputes or design effective policies requiring local knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Amos|date=2004-09-01|title=Violent conflicts and governance challenges in West Africa: the case of the Mano River basin area|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/violent-conflicts-and-governance-challenges-in-west-africa-the-case-of-the-mano-river-basin-area/05EB21C20F63C87E8E9319952E5A6455|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=42|issue=3|pages=437–463|doi=10.1017/S0022278X04000266|issn=1469-7777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin’s book, ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', "The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lenin, V. (1939). ''Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism.'' New York: International Publishers,  pp.12-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. and Sheffrin, S. (2003). ''Economics.'' Needham, Mass.: Prentice Hall, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - "A trust is . . . simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, D. (1888). "The Legality of "Trusts". ''Political Science Quarterly'', 3(592).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in business studies==
Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. (2014). ''Centralised versus decentralised structures | Business | tutor2u.'' [online] Beta.tutor2u.net. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://beta.tutor2u.net/business/reference/centralised-versus-decentralised-structures&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do the jobs which directed and controlled by the top managers.'''(BMS Team, 2013)'''&lt;ref&gt;BMS Team, (2013). ''Important Features of centralization | BMS.co.in.''

'''Citizens for a Sound Economy''' ('''CSE''') (1984–2004) was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[politics|political]] group operating in the [[United States]]. It was established in 1984 by [[Charles Koch|Charles]] and [[David Koch]] of [[Koch Industries]]. [[Ron Paul]] was appointed as the first chairman of the organization. The CSE described itself as "hundreds of thousands of grassroots citizens dedicated to (1) free markets and limited government, and (2) the highest level of personal involvement in public policy activism."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 2002, the CSE designed its [[tea party movement]] website, though the movement did not take off until 2009.&lt;ref name="tobaccocontrol.bmj.com"&gt;{{cite journal |title=‘To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts’: the tobacco industry and the Tea Party |first1=Amanda |last1=Fallin |first2=Rachel |last2=Grana |first3=Stanton A. |last3=Glantz |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/02/07/tobaccocontrol-2012-050815.full |journal=[[Tobacco Control (journal)|Tobacco Control]] |date=February 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Dick Armey]] became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress.&lt;ref name="armey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/dick-armey-to-lead-citizens-for-a-sound-economy |title=Dick Armey to lead Citizens for a Sound Economy |date=January 8, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308214530/http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/dick-armey-to-lead-citizens-for-a-sound-economy |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as [[FreedomWorks]], and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming [[Americans for Prosperity]]. Both organizations played key roles in the Tea party movement beginning in 2009.

==History==
[[File:1523 16th Street, N.W..JPG|thumb|upright|CSE's former headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Between 1986 and 1990, the [[Koch family foundations]] the [[Koch family foundations#Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation|Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation]], the [[Koch family foundations#David H. Koch Charitable Foundation|David H. Koch Charitable Foundation]], and the [[Koch family foundations#Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation|Claude R.

The CSE was one of several organizations that was connected with non-profit organizations that the tobacco industry and other corporate interests worked with and provided funding for after the 1971 [[Powell Memorandum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/02/20/tobaccocontrol-2012-050815.full ‘To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts’: the tobacco industry and the Tea Party], Amanda Fallin, Rachel Grana, Stanton A Glantz; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, San Francisco, California, USA; ''Tobacco Control'', published Feb 8, 2013; viewed Feb 14, 2013, updated to free version March 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brendan DeMelle 2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brendan-demelle/study-confirms-tea-party-_b_2663125.html |title=Study Confirms Tea Party Was Created by Big Tobacco and Billionaire Koch Brothers |first=Brendan |last=DeMelle |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSE was mainly funded by the tobacco, oil, energy and sugar industries, including [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]], [[General Electric]], and [[Exxon]]. Other contributors included [[Microsoft]] and [[Hertz]]. The CSE "received almost $5 million from various Koch foundations between 1986 and 1990, and David Koch and several Koch Industries employees serve[d] as directors of CSE and the CSE Foundation."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

CSE briefly assumed control of the financially troubled [[Tax Foundation]] and operated it as a subsidiary from CSE's offices until the split in 2000. Beginning in 1990, the Tax Foundation "operate[d] as a separate unit" of Citizens for a Sound Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/e5e6abba4dc59512941d0b0e22fb2b85.pdf |title=Tax Features |volume=34 |number=1 |publisher=Tax Foundation |date=January 1990 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1991, the Tax Foundation was again operating as "an independent 501(c)(3) organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/72bbfeab670a2f70339618c556b54d81.pdf |title=Tax Features |volume=35 |number=6 |publisher=Tax Foundation |date=July 1991 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, CSE designed and made public a "tea party" website. The website stated "our US Tea Party is a national event, hosted continuously online and open to all Americans who feel our taxes are too high and the tax code is too complicated".&lt;ref name="tobaccocontrol.bmj.com"/&gt; In 2003, [[Dick Armey]] became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1041986931689098504|title=Citizen Armey|first=Dick|last=Armey|date=8 January 2003|website=Wsj.com|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into [[FreedomWorks]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]], according to the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian20090918&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/18/republicans-internet-barack-obama |title=Republicans steal Barack Obama's internet campaigning tricks |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Armey stayed as chairman of FreedomWorks, while David Koch stayed as chairman of Americans for Prosperity.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On July 23, 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on the organization's tactics in signing up as members people who did not know about the organization, by enrolling them as members during unrelated insurance transactions in order to boost membership numbers.  The group obtained about $638,000 and 16,000 members through the sale of insurance policies in this way, according to the report.&lt;ref name=WithInsurance/&gt; When someone signed up for insurance through "Medical Savings Insurance Company", they were also automatically signed up for Citizens for a Sound Economy without their knowledge, the report asserted. Their information is subject to be rented out as the Medical Savings Insurance Company deemed fit, which is not uncommon for many groups who obtain client contact information. Critics suggested the effort as a way for this group to inflate their membership rosters, and more exactly, by taking dues from people with no interest in the groups' politics.&lt;ref name=WithInsurance&gt;{{cite news

==Activity==
The group produced more than 100 policy papers each year in its run, delivering them to many congressional offices, sending out thousands of pieces of mail, and getting coverage of its viewpoints in thousands of news articles around the [[United States]]. The group's representatives appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows and published hundreds op-ed articles arguing that "environmental conservation requires a commonsense approach that limits the scope of government," [[acid rain]] is a "so-called threat [that] is largely nonexistent," and global warming is "a verdict in search of evidence."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

According to the conservative magazine [[Weekly Standard]], CSE's greatest political success came in 1993 when it opposed [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal for a BTU energy tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/paranoid-style-liberal-politics_555525.html?page=2|title=The Paranoid Style in Liberal Politics|date=4 April 2011|website=Weeklystandard.com|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to fighting tobacco taxes and healthcare reform, the CSE was a member organization of the [[Cooler Heads Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/news-letters-cooler-heads-digest/cooler-heads-0|title=Cooler Heads|publisher=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]|date=December 7, 2004|first=Myron|last=Ebell|authorlink=Myron Ebell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused in 2004 of encouraging [[George W. Bush]] supporters to help get [[Ralph Nader]] on the ballot in [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">'''Encore fellowships''' are temporary work placement&lt;!---Is work placement really a good term to use?  Is there a better one? Seems good to me.---&gt; programs designed to help former [[private sector]] mid-life careerists transition into [[encore career]] work in the [[social sector]].  Similar to how a person might apply for an [[internship]] with a business prior to applying for a full-time position, this temporary [[fellow]]ship allows a person to experience non-profit work first-hand without the long-term commitment of a full-time encore career.&lt;ref&gt;Myrow, Rachel.  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113856732 "Program Taps Retired Execs To Help Nonprofits"], ''[[National Public Radio]]'', 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In recent years, there has been a distinct and growing trend among late-career or retired private-sector employees toward encore careers, or careers in the second half of life in social purpose or [[non-profit organization]]s.  However, despite the growing popularity of the program, many who would otherwise be either interested in encore careers—either as an encore careerist or as an organization seeking to hire an encore careerist—are unable or unwilling to take part in the movement, often lacking experience, information, or communication between the corporate and the social sectors.

In 2009, a [[pilot experiment|pilot program]] centered around using temporary fellowships as a means to reduce the difficulties inherent in transitioning between mid-life and encore careers emerged.  The Silicon Valley Encore Fellows Program experimented with ten encore fellows, each of whom having formerly worked in high-level positions in various corporate departments, working for six to 12 months in community non-profit organizations.  The fellows worked either part- or full-time for a [[stipend]].  Based on these results of this pilot program, Encore.org has decided to continue their program in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Sarah.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/fashion/21age.html "Ready for Life’s Encore Performances"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York, 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act==

Encore fellowships were mentioned specifically in an act signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] known as the [[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act]].
&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Kelly.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123863704304281321 "Law Opens Up 'Encore' Careers"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', New York, 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Section 198C, the bill proposes federal encore fellowships for citizens age 55 or older.  The bill allows for 10 encore fellowships per state.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicservice.evendon.com/ServeAmerActM.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FastTrack Schedule''' is a [[project management software]] program that is used for planning, tracking, and reporting project goals. Available since 1987, it is made by AEC Software, Inc., a small business headquartered in the Washington, D.C. area. 

FastTrack Schedule has a global customer base and has been localized into 6 languages (English, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, and Italian).  Some of their high profile users include: NASA, Nike, Amazon.com, Honda, Pixar, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and The Olympic Games. The application enables users to  organize tasks into project plans, assign resources to tasks, use effort driven scheduling, and view project details in [[Gantt chart]]s, monthly calendars, and resource histograms, and more.  

FastTrack Schedule's capabilities are suited for project management beginners&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Apps/Pings-Packets-from-eWEEK-Labs-%5B14%5D/ Pings &amp; Packets from eWEEK Labs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as experienced project managers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcn.com/print/25_6/40132-1.html The latest version of FastTrack makes it easy to see cause and effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; working in small to mid-sized project teams. Versions are available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maclife.com/article/fasttrack_schedule_9_1 FastTrack Schedule 9.1- MacLife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and files are cross-platform  compatible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbtechnologymagazine.org/magazine/read/archives/articles/article.php?ProposalOnlineID=459 Small Business Technology Magazine - FastTrack Schedule 9 - by Small Business Technology Magazine Labs 2006 Top 10 Products of the Year&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling team members on PCs and Macs to collaborate on projects.

FastTrack Schedule also exchanges data with spreadsheets (including Microsoft Excel), databases, organizers such as [[Microsoft Outlook]] and Apple's [[iCal]], Mindjet [[MindManager]] mind mapping software, and other project management software including [[Microsoft Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,133079/article.html PC World - FastTrack Schedule boosts Mindjet MindManager support&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2012, [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fasttrack-schedule-go-project/id523327102?mt=8 FastTrack Schedule Go] for the iPad was released.  A productivity app sold on Apple iTunes, it allows the user to analyze, present, and take their schedule with them. It works with FastTrack Schedule Mac/Win files, XML, and Microsoft Project files.

==Some Features==
'''Intuitive Interface'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac-project-management-software-review.toptenreviews.com/fasttrack-schedule-details.html FastTrack Schedule 10 Specifications]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Mac product has a Format Bar that was modeled after the iWork suite, while the Windows product uses the Ribbon.  The Format Bar and Ribbon are both context-sensitive and contain key scheduling tools.  In addition, they can be customized by dragging and dropping features you use the most.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Base and Work Calendars'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose Base Calendars such as standard, 24 hour, and night shift calendars, or customize your own. These calendars can be defined per task, so projects can have an unlimited number of Work Calendars.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Effort-Driven Scheduling'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;For tasks that can be completed faster by adding more resources, use Effort-Driven Scheduling for simple schedule compression. Automatically adjust task durations as resources are added or subtracted, while keeping the total work for a task constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Image Columns'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Use Image Columns to add pictures of task items, staff, resources, designs, progress photos, etc, directly into column cells. Images automatically scale as thumbnails to match row heights and display as larger images when you hover over them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Assignment Contouring'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose from eight built-in work contours or customize your own for the ultimate ease and flexibility in resource scheduling. Assignment contouring enables you to quickly re-distribute your resources' efforts on a task for those special cases and must-meet deadlines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Work Usage Inspector'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Monitor resource workloads while making assignments in the Schedule View. The Work Usage Inspector displays Resource Usage Graphs at the base of the Gantt chart to provide a detailed snapshot of a resource's free and busy time, enabling you to make precise assignments and effectively manage resource costs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Address Book Integration &amp; Resource Information Form'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Add address book contacts – including their photo and contact details – directly into your projects. The Resource Information Form organizes work schedules, rates, and all contact information into a single comprehensive form.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''iMedia Browser'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Use the iMedia Browser to add photos, logos, sketches, and other images to your schedule.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Etc.'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resource Management: Collect, organize, and track a resource's Details, Skill Sets, Materials/Supplies, Costs, Groups, by creating from scratch or importation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Collaboration: Work with others using Team Calendars, Timeline, Issue Tracking, Email Integration, and Dashboard.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;Blockquote&gt;Project Management: Includes tools for Task Management, Mind Maps, Task Feedback, Scheduling, Calendars, Timelines, Ganntt Charts, Interactive Gantt Charts, Reporting, Statistics, Work Load, Financials, Document Management, Privacy Settings, Budgetting, Critical Path Method, Project Templates, Baseline, Custom Baseline, Milestones. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Help &amp; Support: A robust and highly praised support system is provided. It includes: Training Courses, FAQ's, Tutorials, User Manual, Email Support, Online Form Support, Telephone Support, and an online forum.

'''Fugazi''' ({{IPAc-en|f|u|ˈ|g|ɑː|z|i}}; {{Respell|foo|GAH|zee}}) is an American [[punk rock]] band that formed in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1987. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists [[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Guy Picciotto]], bassist [[Joe Lally]] and drummer [[Brendan Canty]].

Fugazi are noted for their unique sound, blending of elements of [[dub music|dub]]/[[reggae]] with high energy rock and [[punk rock|punk]]/[[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-styled guitars, as well as for their business practices&lt;ref name="stillinrock.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/anachronique-fugazi-war-punk.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Anachronique : Fugazi (War Punk) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contempt towards the music industry.&lt;ref name="Fugazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fugazi |title=Fugazi |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band, and others from the punk and hardcore scene leading up to the early 1990s, were among the early adopters of what grew to be known as the [[DIY ethic]].

Fugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.&lt;ref name="guitarworld"/&gt; Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1989)===
After the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Minor Threat]] dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and [[guitar]]) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was "like [[The Stooges]] with [[reggae]]", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, "My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKaye recruited ex-[[Dag Nasty]] [[drummer]] [[Colin Sears]] and [[bass guitar]]ist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of [[Rites of Spring]]). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate [[Guy Picciotto]] dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

After some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word "fugazi" from Mark Baker's ''Nam'', a compilation of stories of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, it there being a slang acronym for "Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]".&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a [[Hype man|foil]] in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band [[Happy Go Licky]] broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fugazi EP'' &amp; ''Margin Walker''&amp;nbsp;– ''13 Songs'' (1988–1989)===
Fugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP ''[[Fugazi (EP)|Fugazi]]'' with producer [[Ted Niceley]] and producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as ''[[Margin Walker]]'' the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the ''[[13 Songs (Fugazi album)|13 Songs]]'' release in late 1989.&lt;ref name="stillinrock.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 399"&gt;Azerrad, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Repeater'' and ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' (1990–1992)===

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
With Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into [[Jam session|jamming]] and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as "Merchandise" and "Turnover", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.&lt;ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002"&gt;^ a b c d Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". Guitar World. March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Released on April 19, 1990, through [[Dischord Records]], ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' did not initially reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind ''Repeater'', performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided to stay with  [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] and  refused the offers of those labels. ''Repeater'' ultimately went on to sell more than 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, and more than 2 million worldwide. The album was critically well received and featured an [[alternative rock]] sound that pre-dated significant releases such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Perlah, Jeff 2002"/&gt;

For Fugazi's second studio-album ''[[Steady Diet of Nothing]]'', released in July 1991, the band once again asked [[Ted Niceley]] to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of ''Repeater'' and its subsequent world tour, ''Steady Diet'' was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |year=2001 |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |location=New York |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=1-888451-44-0}} p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In On the Kill Taker'' and ''Red Medicine'' (1993–1996)===
Fugazi recorded its third album ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]'' in the fall of 1992 with [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with [[Ted Niceley]] &amp; [[Don Zientara]]. With the breakthrough of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s, ''In on the Kill Taker''; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album charts, received critical praise from ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', ''[[TIME magazine]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', sold 180,000 copies in its first week of release and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt;

By the ''In on the Kill Taker'' tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] in September 1993, music mogul and [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Ertegün]] met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegün offered the band "anything you want", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers of [[Lollapalooza]] also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norman|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Fugazi began writing the material for ''[[Red Medicine]]'' in late 1994, after touring in support of ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]''. The band worked with engineer [[Don Zientara]], but did not choose to work with producer [[Ted Niceley]] again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of ''In on the Kill Taker'' and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. ''Red Medicine'' would take Fugazi a step further toward [[art rock]]. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===''End Hits'' and ''The Argument'' (1997–2002)===
After the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of ''Red Medicine'', Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] to begin recording what would become the ''[[End Hits]]'' album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release.&lt;ref name="Morphizm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/fugaziguy.html| title=Guy Picciotto of Fugazi:The Argument (2001): Interview | work=Morphizm | publisher=Morphizm.com | accessdate=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. However, critical reaction to ''End Hits'' was mixed. Many critics praised the album's heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.&lt;ref name="Crane, Larry 1999"&gt;Crane, Larry.

Fugazi began work on ''[[The Argument]]'' in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member would bring his own individual riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on what would become the final versions.&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chip|last=Chanko|year=2002|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/5840-fugazi/| title=Interviews:Fugazi|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at [[Inner Ear Studios]] and Dischord House in [[Arlington, VA]], located just outside [[Washington D.C.]] The band once again worked with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]]. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel.&lt;ref name="Modern Drummer"&gt;Perlah, Jeff. (2005). [http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2004/05/brendan-canty/ Brendan Canty]. Modern Drummer Magazine.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[Brendan Canty]] explained to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' that "We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different cymbals, snares, and ways of miking."&lt;ref name="Modern Drummer"/&gt;

''The Argument'' was released by [[Dischord Records]] on October 16, 2001, along with the EP [[Furniture + 2]], almost 4 years after the release of ''[[End Hits]]''. The album was met with critical and commercial success entering the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' charts and selling over 170,000 copies in its first week of release. Arion Berger of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "bracing" and "intellectual"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arion. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-argument-20011113 Fugazi The Argument] Rollingstone.com. Retrieved 4/28/11.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chris True of ''[[AllMusic]]'' referred to the album as "spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once" stating that, "the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again." He also noted that the album had "touched on strange new territory."&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Allmusic ((( ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' &gt; Review )))|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r343128|author=Kellman, Andy|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point Fugazi were on tour less frequently, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments, they performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002 respectively.&lt;ref name="guitarworld"&gt;Perlah, Jeff. "The Independent". ''Guitar World''. March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indefinite hiatus and reunion rumours (2003–present)===
Fugazi went on what they have called an "indefinite hiatus" after the conclusion of their 2002 UK tour following 3 sold-out nights at the [[London Forum]] in [[England]] on November 2, 3, 4, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The hiatus was brought on by the band members' insistence on spending more time with their families and to pursue other professional projects.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating regarding a possible reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the [[Coachella Festival]]. While the band has confirmed that they have been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, they have so far declined the offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/25590 |title=Brendan Canty discusses Fugazi hiatus, "Burn to Shine" and new projects |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has "been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it’s not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://approachingoblivion.blogspot.com/2011/03/ian-mackaye-interview-minor-threat.html |title=Approaching Oblivion: Ian Mackaye Interview (Minor Threat, Fugazi, Dischord Records) |publisher=Approachingoblivion.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, when asked by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001's ''[[The Argument]]'', bassist [[Joe Lally]] stated that "''The Argument'' was a great record that we should try and top. It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we’ll just see."&lt;ref name="Interview: Joe Lally"/&gt;

In August 2014, Dischord announced an official release for ''[[First Demo]]'', an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/news/580/2014/8/fugazi-first-demo-out-this-winter|title=Fugazi "First Demo" Out November 18th|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track "Merchandise." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1714496/fugazi-merchandise-demo/mp3s/|title=Fugazi – "Merchandise" (Demo) - Stereogum|work=Stereogum|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eleven-track album was released on November 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/181/first-demo|title=Fugazi - First Demo|work=Dischord Records|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKaye insists Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2002 hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culturecreature.com/fugazi-reunion/ |title=Fugazi's still around--they just went underground |publisher=culturecreature.com |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2018, in a new interview on Vish Khanna's Kreative Kontrol podcast, Fugazi bassist Joe Lally revealed that the band still occasionally gets together to play. Lally begins, “Yeah, when we’re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we’ll play some music together.” He then shoots down any hopes of a potential reunion: “There’s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.”

==Side projects and related work==
In the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo [[The Evens]] with drummer and singer [[Amy Farina]] (formerly of [[the Warmers]]).

In 2004, MacKaye produced the ''[[DC EP]]'' for former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]], which also featured Jerry Busher.

Canty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio [[Garland Of Hours]] alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with [[Mary Timony]]. Canty also appears on [[Bob Mould]]'s 2005 album ''[[Body of Song]]'' and on Mould's 2008 album ''[[District Line (album)|District Line]]'', and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD ''Circle of Friends''. He is currently working in the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on [[Dischord Records]].

Lally has released three solo albums, ''[[There to Here]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Is Underrated]]'' (2007), and ''[[Why Should I Get Used To It]]'' (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers [[Decahedron]]'s debut album ''Disconnection_Imminent'', as well as on a project with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarists [[John Frusciante]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], known as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].  The group has recorded two albums, ''[[Automatic Writing]]'' (2004) and ''[[AW II]]'' (2007).

Picciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]], and he has performed alongside members of [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] at the [[Jazz]] festival in [[Wels]], [[Austria]]. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two [[Vic Chesnutt]] albums, 2007's "[[North Star Deserter]] and 2009's ''[[At the Cut]]'' (co-producing the latter), for [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]] and performed live with Chesnutt and members of [[Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra]] and The Quavers in [[Jem Cohen]]'s program entitled, "Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009).  Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician [[Kathi Wilcox]] from the band [[Bikini Kill]] and [[The Frumpies]].

In July 2011, Minneapolis based record label [[Doomtree]] released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wugazis-13-chambers-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110713?asid=98b65563 |title=Wugazi's '13 Chambers': A Track-by-Track Breakdown |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2011|author=Joe Gross |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work."&lt;ref name="Interview: Joe Lally"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/joe-lally,64410/ |title=Interview: Joe Lally |publisher=The A.V. Club Chicago |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Chris Lawhorn released ''Fugazi Edits''. The album includes 22 instrumental tracks, which sample 100 songs from Fugazi's discography.&lt;ref name="Cool Hunting: Fugazi Edits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/fugazi-edits-by-chris-lawhorn.php |title=Fugazi Edits |publisher=Cool Hunting |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other cases, the band had no involvement in the production. But, the album was authorized for release by MacKaye, with the proceeds going to charity.&lt;ref name="Creators Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/ifugazi-editsi-is-the-ultimate-mashup-album-combining-up-to-five-tracks-in-one |title=Fugazi Edits is the Ultimate Mash-up Album |publisher=Creators Project |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108051108/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/ifugazi-editsi-is-the-ultimate-mashup-album-combining-up-to-five-tracks-in-one |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Canty and Lally joined with guitarist Anthony Pirog to form [[the Messthetics]], Canty and Lally's first project together since Fugazi's hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.dischord.com/images.d/press_release/filename/35/DIS186_PRESS.pdf |title=Press Release: The Messthetics |publisher=Dischord Records |date=2018-03-23 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2018, the Messthetics released their self-titled debut album and embarked upon a tour of the US and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-messthetics-the-messthetics/ |title=The Messthetics: The Messthetics |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=2018-03-31 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
{{main|Fugazi Live Series}}
[[File:Fugazi guns - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Handmade tickets for a Fugazi concert from 2001 in Indianapolis, Indiana]]
Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 US states and all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via [[Dischord Records]]. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a "[[pay what you want]]" sliding scale option for each download between $1–100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series|title=Fugazi Live Series: A to Z|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For $500 fans can also purchase an "All Access" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/arts/music/fugazi-live-series-a-post-punk-bands-archive-of-shows.html |title=Fugazi Rises Again, In Online Archive |publisher=New York Times |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]] explained to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get." The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s, then eventually digital formats such as [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[CD-R]] and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Pearl Jam]], three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Fugazi combined [[punk rock|punk]] with [[funk]] and [[reggae]] beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], bands that the [[punk rock|punk]] community of the time largely disdained.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's [[dub music|dub]]-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to MacKaye; employing a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to "cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam."&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 399"/&gt; Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt; ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No.&amp;nbsp;86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.&lt;ref name="Spin Magazine 100 Greatest Guitarists"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/spins-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time/?page=1 |title=SPIN's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Spin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and [[anthem]]ic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able [[slogan]]s), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach.&lt;ref name="guitarworld" /&gt; Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, [[soul music|soul]] and [[noise rock|noise]] with an inventively syncopated [[rhythm section]]. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of "[[lead guitar|lead]]" and "[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[chord progression|progressions]] filtered through a hardcore punk lens.

When questioned by ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist [[Ian MacKaye]] responded, "Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music."

Joe Strummer (the lead vocalist of the Clash) recognized Fugazi as the only band who best exemplified punk's spirit in the 2000 Rolling Stone interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation’s Capital|last1=Andersen|first1=Mark|last2=Jenkins|first2=Mark|date=2003|publisher=Akashic Books|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Fugazi's albums since ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' have featured an [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] song. By the time of 1995's ''[[Red Medicine]]'' bassist [[Joe Lally]] also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an "unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements" such as "clattering [[musique concrète]] ... [[piano]] and [[sound effect]]s ... murky [[Dub music|dub]] and lancing [[clarinet]]" and "loose-limbed [[jam band|jammy]] [[funk]] ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers."&lt;ref name="Fugazi"/&gt;

==Business practices==
On their first tours, Fugazi worked out its [[Do it yourself|DIY]] ethic by trial and error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of [[simple living]]: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to [[price gouging]] a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.&lt;ref name="punklives"&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/drawcamp/wp93.htm]  {{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years and at many venues, particularly on the east and west coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions.&lt;ref name="punklives" /&gt;

Fugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, "You find the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted [[slam dancing]] and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] era. [[Michael Azerrad]] quotes Mackaye, "See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it ''freaks'' them out – 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'"&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 392"&gt;Azerrad, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerrad writes, "[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye."&lt;ref name="Azerrad, p. 392"/&gt; Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).

During the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133611/http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796 |date=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye's financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to the ''Washington Post'' in a 1993 interview: "protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+21:05:41 |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvey Samuel Firestone''' (December 20, 1868 – February 7, 1938) was an American businessman, and the founder of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], one of the first global makers of automobile tires.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Family background==
Firestone was born on the [[Columbiana, Ohio]] farm built by his paternal grandfather.  He was the second of Benjamin and Catherine ([[née]] Flickinger) Firestone's three sons; Benjamin had a son and a daughter by his first wife. The original farm was disassembled and moved to [[Greenfield Village]], a {{convert|90|acre|m2|adj=on}} historical site founded by [[Henry Ford]], in 1983 as part of a larger outdoor museum.

Firestone's paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Hans Nicholas Feuerstein, immigrated from [[Berg, Bas-Rhin]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/f/r/a/Scott-O-Fraser/FILE/0022page.html Familytreemaker.genealogy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212063747/http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/f/r/a/Scott-O-Fraser/FILE/0022page.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1753, and settled in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p1670.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 1670" ''ancestry.com''] October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of Nicholas' sons – including Harvey's great-great-grandfather, Johan Nicholas – changed their surname to "Firestone", the English translation of the family's German name "Feuerstein".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p1687.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 1687" ''ancestry.com''] October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 1895, Firestone married [[Idabelle Smith Firestone|Idabelle Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p11749.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 11733" ''ancestry.com''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102191137/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p11749.htm |date=2012-11-02 }} October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually had seven children. Notable great-grandchildren include: [[Andrew Firestone]], [[Nick Firestone]], and [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] (the son of Henry Ford's grandson and Harvey and Idabelle's granddaughter [[Martha Firestone Ford|Martha]]).

==Education and career==
After graduating from [[Columbiana High School]], Firestone worked for the [[Columbus Buggy Company]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] before starting his own company in 1890, making [[rubber]] tires for [[carriage]]s. In 1900 he soon saw the huge potential for marketing tires for automobiles and then founded the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], a pioneer in the mass production of tires. In 1926 he published a book, ''Men and Rubber: The Story of Business'', which was written in collaboration with [[Samuel Crowther (journalist)|Samuel Crowther]].&lt;ref&gt;''Men and Rubber: The Story of Business''. By Harvey Samuel Firestone, in collaboration with [[Samuel Crowther (journalist)|Samuel Crowther]]. London: William Heinemann &amp; Co., printed in U.S.A., 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1938, Firestone died of [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Harvey Firestone is Dead in Florida. Rubber Manufacturer Dies in Sleep at His Miami Beach Estate.

He was 69 years old. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=February 8, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Millionaires' Club==
Firestone, [[Henry Ford]], and [[Thomas Edison]] were generally considered the three leaders in American industry at the time, and often worked and vacationed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zumbrun |first=Francis Champ |title=Famous Travelers - Edison, Ford and Firestone |publisher=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/feature_stories/FamousTravelersPart1.asp |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203060801/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/feature_stories/FamousTravelersPart1.asp |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three were part of a very exclusive group titled "The Millionaires' Club."

==Legacy==
The main library of [[Princeton University]] is named [[Firestone Library]] in his honor. It is among the largest university libraries in the world. On August 3, 1950, the [[Harvey S Firestone Memorial]], a large sculpture ensemble dedicated to Firestone, created by sculptors [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]] and [[Donald De Lue]] was dedicated. It is located at Bridgestone Firestone Inc., 1200 Firestone Parkway in [[Akron, Ohio]]. In 1974, Firestone was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]]. [[Firestone High School]] in [[Akron, Ohio]], is named in his honor. There is a Harvey S Firestone Park in [[Columbiana, Ohio]]. The town [[Harbel]] in [[Liberia]], home to Firestone's rubber plantation, the largest in the world, is named after Firestone and his wife Isabelle.

==Academics and events==
Applicants must take an entrance exam and present a portfolio to be accepted. Freshmen sample all art and design subjects before selecting a major for their sophomore, junior and senior years. Students at Art and Design receive two periods of art instruction per day, choosing from among eight art majors: cartooning, animation, architecture, graphic design, illustration, fashion, photography, and film/video.

Art and Design's Kenny Gallery, named for the school's founding principal John B. Kenny, hosts monthly art exhibits of student work. The gallery is open to the public. The Black Box Theatre was donated by the Friends of Art and Design (FAD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Anemona Hartocollis |publication-date=December 13, 2000 |title=From a Rude Bump, a Lift for a School |work= [[New York Times]] |page=B11 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/nyregion/from-a-rude-bump-a-lift-for-a-school.html|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Van Vuuren''' (born 1984) is a South African entrepreneur and investor. An expert-in-residence at the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], he is the co-founder of Work-Bench, an early stage enterprise technology venture fund.&lt;ref name="Fast co X fund"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burstein|first1=David O.|title=The Xfund, Harvard, And The Student-Entrepreneur|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1826202/xfund-harvard-and-student-entrepreneur|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Fast Company|date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Van Vuuren|url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/hugo|website=cyberlaw.harvard.edu|publisher=Harvard Berkman Center|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Van Vuuren was born in Pretoria, South Africa. In 2003, Van Vuuren began undergraduate studies at Harvard, and graduated with a BA in economics in 2007.  He earned a master's degree in design studies from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2012.&lt;ref name="BostInno"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landry|first1=Lauren|title=How To Turn a Risk Into a Legacy|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2013/03/01/how-to-turn-a-risk-into-a-legacy/|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BostInno|date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While pursuing his postgraduate degree, Van Vuuren was awarded [[fellow]]ships by the [[MIT Media Lab]], [[TED (conference)|TED]] and Pop Tech. He was a graduate student fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University from September 2010 through May 2012, and a scholar at the [[Aspen Institute]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Communication Crises and the Evolution of Personal and Cultural Protocols|url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2011/04/vanvuuren|publisher=Berkman Center|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviva Presser Aiden and Hugo Van Vuuren|url=https://poptech.org/people/aviva_presser_aiden_and_hugo_van_vuuren|website=poptech.org|publisher=Pop Tech|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Harvard Entrepreneurship===
At Harvard, Van Vuuren worked closely on art and science experiments and startup projects with professor David Edwards, whom he had first encountered in 2007 as student in Edwards' "Idea Translation" class. In 2008, along with several others in the class, Van Vuuren co-developed off-grid microbial fuel cells for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The research and project was funded by private investors, the Harvard Institute for Global Health, MIT IDEAS Global Challenge, as well as a $200,000 Lighting Africa grant from the World Bank and a [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] Challenges Grant.&lt;ref name="Edwards book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=David|title=The Lab: Creativity and Culture|date=October 31, 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0674057198|pages=53–64, 142–146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XizCTR5UArgC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=hugo+van+vuuren&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-oPyGmMHMAhVISiYKHX9cAqYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hugo%20van%20vuuren&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY times enerrgy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doty|first1=Cate|title=For Africa, ‘Energy From Dirt’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/giving/11AFRICA.html|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=New York Times|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SEAS receives $100k Grand Challenges Explorations Grant|url=https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2011/04/seas-receives-100k-grand-challenges-explorations-grant|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=Harvard School of Engineering|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009,  Van Vuuren worked with Edwards to establish ArtScience Labs (also known as the Laboratory at Harvard). An interdisciplinary platform for idea experimentation and exhibition in the arts and sciences, it was modeled after Le Laboratoire, an experimental art and design center in Paris.  Van Vuuren served as the lab's director from its 2009 launch until 2012.&lt;ref name="Edwards book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY times enerrgy"/&gt;

===Experiment Fund===
Based on the growing ecosystem of startups at Harvard, and demonstrated in part by the success of the Lab, the Experiment Fund was founded in January 2012.  A seed-stage investment fund co-founded and led by Van Vuuren, it was established specifically to support student start-ups and technologies and platforms created in Cambridge (or by people educated in Cambridge). The Experiment Fund was backed by Breyer Capital, Accel Partners, Polaris Partners, Harvard University, and NEA. Patrick Chung and Harry Weller, both NEA partners, were co-founders of the fund, as were Polaris' Alan Crane, and Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital. Edwards served as an advisor. The company's early investments included [[Kensho]], Philo (formerly Tivli), Zumper, and Rest Devices, among others.&lt;ref name="Fast co X fund" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston globe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrell|first1=Michael B.|title=Harvard makes space for venture capitalist|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/08/the-venture-capitalist-campus/uArvrYnGYzvyb9MUVfcQVP/story.html|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xconomy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Gregory T.|title=Harvard Experiment Fund, Backed by NEA, Joins Crowded Investor Field|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2012/01/31/harvard-experiment-fund-backed-by-nea-joins-crowded-investor-field/#|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=Xconomy|date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe prof"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|title=Harvard dreamer works to link art, science, commerce|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/03/03/what-will-harvard-david-edwards-dream-next/chUZvx1Zb7QpgTMhsI2EhL/story.html|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Van Vuuren partnered with Chung to create Xfund.  Focused on "technically gifted entrepreneurs with a liberal arts mindset,"&lt;ref name="WSJ x fund"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chapman|first1=Lizette|title=Xfund Closes $100 Million Second Fund, Targets Student Entrepreneurs|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/12/04/xfund-closes-100-million-second-fund-targets-student-entrepreneurs/|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Vuuren left the company after a high-profile dispute with Chung.  Chung filed a lawsuit, and Van Vuuren countersued.  The suit was settled privately in 2016.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Dan|title=Top of the Morning|url=https://www.axios.com/pro-rata-2493651882.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=Axios|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inside contracting''' is the practice of hiring contractors who work inside the proprietor's factory.  It replaced the [[putting out system]], where contractors worked in their own facilities.  Inside contracting was the system favored by the [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harper's Ferry]] Armories.  Since the manufacturing system developed in the armories also became popular (the [[American system of manufacturing]]), manufacturers in the early 19th century tended to hire people trained in the armories as managers.  They brought with them the practice of inside contracting.

The manufacturer hired inside contractors and provided materials and machinery.  Each inside contractor was expected to hire his own employees and meet certain production and quality goals, but everything else was left to him.  As a result, the system rewarded ingenuity, but also rewarded local optimization.  For example, it was to the inside contractor's benefit to allow machinery to deteriorate toward the end of his contract since maintenance was costly and he might not reap the long-term benefit if he didn't get another contract.  The system was eventually replaced with the [[factory system]], in which everyone was an employee of the manufacturer directly.

==Corruption allegations==

At the end of July 2018 the freezing of British bank accounts was lifted by London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. It ruled, that the freezing was based on false information.

'''John Keith Bousfield''', [[Military Cross|M.C.]] (17 November 1893 – 29 October 1945) was a British army officer, general manager of the [[Asiatic Petroleum Company]] and member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

He was the son of [[William Robert Bousfield|W. R. Bousfield]], [[King's Counsel|K.C.]], [[Member of Parliament]] (1892–1906). He was educated at [[Uppingham School]] in Rutland, and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].

On the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in November 1914. He embarked for France in August 1915. In early 1917 he was attached as an observer to [[No. 57 Squadron RAF|57 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. He made a number of reconnaissance flights over German lines, but on 6 April 1917 his aircraft was brought down and he was taken [[prisoner of war]]. He was interned at [[Karlsruhe]], [[Krefeld]], [[Ströhen]] and later at [[Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Famous Escape of the 29.|newspaper=Otago Daily Times|date=23 November 1918|page=8 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/OAM19181207.2.58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 1918, he and 28 other officers escaped from the Holzminden camp through a tunnel which had taken 10 months to dig. He made his way to the Dutch frontier in the clothes of a prisoner of war and then returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=29 May 1938|page=12|title=Hong Kong A.P.C. Man who was in Amazing Wartime Escape }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Military Cross]] from [[King George V]] at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for his reconnaissance work during the [[Battle of Somme]] in 1916.

He later became the general manager of the [[Asiatic Petroleum Company]] and also the Asiatic Petroleum Co. (South China). He was appointed a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1939 as the representative of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] during the absence of [[Andrew Lusk Shields|A. L. Shields]]. He was vice-chairman of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. J. K.

'''Julius Meinl V''' (born 9 July 1959) is a British businessman, resident in [[Prague]] [[Czech Republic]] (since end of August 2013). He heads a substantial family business which was originally built upon the production and retailing of food products, and which was founded by his great-great-grandfather, [[Julius Meinl I]], in Vienna in 1862.

==Early life==
Julius Meinl V was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to a wealthy family. To prepare him to join the family business, he was educated at the ''[[Hochschule St. Gallen für Wirtschafts-, Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaften|Ecole des Hautes Etudes Economiques, Juridiques et Sociales]]'', [[St Gallen]], one of the world's leading business schools.  He then gained experience in London with Swiss Bank Corporation and later in the United States with Brown Brothers Harriman, America's oldest and largest private bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/7908472/Banker-Julius-Meinl-V-loses-legal-action-to-magazine-that-portrayed-him-as-Hitler.html|title=Banker Julius Meinl V loses legal action to magazine that 'portrayed him as Hitler'|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 July 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Andrew|last=Alderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/joshua-rozenberg/julius-meinl-s-predicament-should-disturb-common-law-jurisdictions|title=Meinl affair casts shadow over common law jurisdictions|publisher=[[The Law Society Gazette]]|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Joshua|last=Rozenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Meinl V went to school in Austria, before finishing a degree in banking in [[Switzerland]] at the [[University of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref name=tdt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/5334863/Julius-Meinl-I-am-the-most-hated-man-in-Austria-but-I-am-fighting-back.html|title=Julius Meinl: I am the most hated man in Austria but I am fighting back|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 May 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Andrew|last=Alderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family (and family business) history==
The '''[[Julius Meinl]]''' name is synonymous with the family business, and the brand is one of the most well known and prestigious in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vienna-life.com/news/news/94-Meinl_Muddle|title=Meinl Muddle|publisher=Vienna Life|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family fortunes were built initially upon the manufacture and sale of quality ground coffee.  From this beginning the company grew steadily and successfully, retailing an increasingly wide variety of foods.  Over time it become the upmarket grocery multiple, with outlets throughout Austria and in many other Central and Eastern European countries.  It also became one of Austria's largest companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1938, Meinl V's grandfather Julius Meinl III (1903–1991) was forced to leave Austria along with his [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14120267|title=A Viennese grind|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wife and their son Meinl IV, while the rest of the Meinl family remained in Austria. Meinl V's mother's family also fled Austria, just managing to escape in 1940. Meinl III took his family to Britain. For this "act of treachery" the [[German government]] revoked the citizenship of the Meinl family, denouncing them as "enemies of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]". Meinl family became [[naturalization|naturalised]] British citizens in 1946.

During the course of [[World War II]], Meinl III was in close contact with the authorities in Britain, providing advice and assistance on the manner in which the [[Naziism|Nazi Party]] had extended its influence on Central Europe through the infiltration of the management of large retail organisations. After the war, Julius Meinl III assisted the Central Commission for Germany and Austria in the process of [[denazification]] of Austria. Meinl's contribution involved the identification of significant Nazi sympathisers who were occupying positions of authority in Austria and who had remained undetected.  This work merely added to the growing list of those within Austria with a distaste for the name, Meinl.

Nevertheless, the family returned to Austria to begin the task of rebuilding the family business, which they did with considerable success, expanding the range of its retail operations throughout central Europe.  It also ventured into banking, building a simple savings business into a small private bank.

==Career==
After graduating from university in banking, he spent two years in London with [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] and a further two years in New York at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], New York; America's oldest and largest private bank.&lt;ref name=tdt/&gt;

In 1983, at the age of 24, Meinl V assumed the reins of the '''Meinl Bank'''.&lt;ref name=tdt/&gt; In the early 1990s, [[Julius Meinl AG]] reestablished food-retail operations in [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], where it had historically already been present. In 1998/99, the company implemented the divestiture of the food-retailing assets of Julius Meinl AG in Austria and Hungary, following which the group's activities became focused primarily on banking and finance operations. At this time, the activities of Meinl Bank were expanded, covering private and institutional asset management, private banking, and fund management. Meinl Bank became one of the leading Austrian private merchant and investment banks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In 2000, a subsidiary named '''Meinl Capital Markets''' was opened in London to provide broking services specialising in hedge funds and exchange traded funds. However, this operation was closed down in 2001. Also in 2001, the subsidiary '''Meinl Capital Advisors AG''' was founded to provide [[corporate finance]] and [[investment banking]] advisory services to governments and private clients.

In 1998, a Central European and Eastern European real-estate company was launched.  It was introduced on the [[Vienna Stock Exchange]] in 2002 under the name '''Meinl European Land'''. In 2007, '''Meinl Airports International''' and '''Meinl International Power''', specialised airport and energy investment funds, were additionally listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.  The Group's main area of activity is Central and Eastern Europe. Meinl V was not a director of any of the three funds. Also in 2007, after a controversial repurchase of certificates by Meinl European Land, the name "Meinl" appeared in the Austrian media on a negative basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/325977/index.do Börse: FMA prüft Meinl European Land], DiePresse.com, 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2014 Julius Meinl was elected new President of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC), a sub-organization of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) in Jerusalem. For Meinl the main priority in this function is to fight against anti-semitism. In his function as President of the EAJC Meinl is also a member of the Steering Committee of the JWC. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/religion/1563973/Eurasischjudischer-Kongress_Meinl-neuer-Praesident Eurasisch-jüdischer Kongress: Meinl neuer Präsident], Die Presse, 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/nachrichten/oesterreich/1563971/Julius-Meinl-ist-neuer-EAJCPraesident Julius Meinl ist neuer EAJC-Präsident], WirtschaftsBlatt, 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/leaders?tab=4 Steering Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303174125/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/leaders?tab=4 |date=3 March 2014 }}, World Jewish Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal matters==
In 2008, an investigation was commenced in Austria into the collapse in value of shares in Meinl European Land Limited.  The same year, a parallel investigation was commenced in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, Meinl European Land being a Jersey company.
On 1 April 2009, a judge ordered Meinl V to be arrested following an interrogation by Vienna prosecutors.  Meinl, who was at that time suspected of involvement in yet-to-be defined wrongdoing, was required to post bail of 100 million euros, because the judge considered him a flight risk due to his holding a British passport.  Meinl remains uncharged with any offence.

In February 2012, the Jersey Financial Services Commission announced that it had closed its investigation into the affairs of Meinl European Land, having found no evidence of wrongdoing.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release279.asp], "Jersey Financial Services Commission", 7 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?id=1237228961558 "100 Millionen für die Freiheit von Julius"], ''Der Standard'', 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orf.at/090402-36837/index.html "Keine ausreichende Garantie"], ORF.at&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/managementIssues/idUSL261986720090402 "Banker Julius Meinl arrested in Vienna over fraud"], Reuters.com, 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Vienna, most of the record deposit – 90 million euros – was refunded in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Julius_Meinl_erhaelt_90_Millionen_Euro_Kaution_zurueck-MEL-Affaere-Story-355278 Meinl erhält 90 Millionen Euro Kaution zurück], krone.at, 19 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of Meinl Bank, the only logical conclusion after this step is to close the criminal proceedings against Meinl. .&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20130319_OTS0185/meinl-bank-meinl-kaution-wird-zum-groessten-teil-rueckerstattet Meinl Kaution wird zum größten Teil rückerstattet], APA OTS announcement of Meinl Bank, 19 March 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The previous investigations have lasted for more than five years until now (May 2013) and are still without any result. In the course of the proceedings documents were seized by means of police raids, and according to an article in the daily newspaper Die Presse those documents are an absolute mess that was allegedly inflicted by a surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/kordiconomy/1348175/Julius-Meinl-und-die-grosse-Konfusion? Meinl und die große Konfusion], diepresse.com, 22 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2014 Meinl and four other elements of Meinl Bank were charged with dishonesty in relation to a 212 million euro dividend paid out by his private bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20150101/julius-meinl-faces-dishonesty-charges "Julius Meinl V faces dishonesty charges"], "The Local Austria", 1 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; All five defendants, including Julius Meinl, have raised objections to the indictment in due time. In these objections the defendants pointed out that they behaved lawfully and strongly criticized the state prosecutor of Vienna as well as the indictment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/4647823/Causa-Meinl_Staatsanwaltschaft-riskiert-sich-zu-blamieren?from=suche.intern.portal "Causa Meinl: "Staatsanwaltschaft riskiert, sich zu blamieren""], "DiePresse.com", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orf.at//stories/2262743/ "Meinl Bank: Einsprüche gegen Sonderdividenden-Anklage"], "ORF.at", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.format.at/newsticker/meinl-bank-fuenf-einsprueche-sonderdividenden-anklage-5437798 "Meinl Bank - Fünf Einsprüche gegen Sonderdividenden-Anklage"], "Format.at", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As announced on April 17, 2015, the Vienna Higher Regional Court (OLG Wien) upheld the oppositions and rejected the charges against Julius Meinl and other defendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/2000014475419/Staatsanwaltschaft-scheitert-mit-Meinl-Anklage "Staatsanwaltschaft scheitert mit Anklage gegen Meinl"], "DerStandard.at", 17.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7725">'''Kleercut''' is the name of a former campaign conducted by [[Greenpeace]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and others towards [[Kimberly-Clark]]. It lasted from 2004 to 2009.  Kimberly-Clark is the [[Earth|world]]’s largest manufacturer of tissue products, most notably the [[Kleenex]] brand. According to its annual environmental report, the company purchases over 3.1 million metric tonnes (3.4 million tons) of virgin fiber from logging companies annually. The Kleercut campaign claims that this fiber is derived from [[wood pulp]] from [[old growth forest]]s. Kimberly-Clark claims that the forests in question are largely cut for timber. The Kleercut campaign claims that Kimberly-Clark support the [[clearcutting]] of such forests in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], including forests habitat for [[wolverine]] and [[Endangered species|threatened wildlife]] the [[caribou|woodland caribou]]. Kimberly-Clark has responded that many of its supplies are certified by the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] or the Canadian Standards Association.

== Detailed campaign goals ==

The campaign is asking Kimberly-Clark to:

* Stop using [[wood fiber]] from endangered forests such as the [[Boreal forest]]. 
* Stop producing tissue products using only [[virgin wood fibers]] and instead increase the use of [[post-consumer recycled fiber]] in all of its products. 
* Utilize [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) eco-certified forestry operations for what virgin wood fibers it does use.

==Outcome==

The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark and [[Greenpeace]] held a joint press conference, where the company announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources – a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.&lt;ref name=" Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/greenpeace-and-kimberly-clark-settle-feud/?_r=0 |title=Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |date=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1718476/exclusive-how-kimberly-clark-ditched-its-forest-destroying-reputation-and-embraced-greenpeac|title= Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kleercut website read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
5 August 2009: Kimberly-Clark releases new environmental policy.

The Kleercut campaign is over.

Canada's precious Boreal Forest is better conserved today. So are ancient forests around the world.

At a joint news conference in Washington DC, Greenpeace and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the world’s largest tissue-product manufacturer, announced an historic agreement that will ensure greater protection and sustainable management of Canada's Boreal Forest and other ancient forests around the world. 

The agreement also will stand out as a model for forest-products companies worldwide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Grassroots efforts in the Kleercut Campaign ==

The Kleercut campaign was centered around a philosophy that an effective and engaged grassroots is needed for a successful campaign. The majority of grassroots activity pressuring aimed at Kimberly Clark occurred in Canada and the United States.

According to Greenpeace the Kleercut campaign is "one of the more successful online forest campaigns in recent Canadian history," gaining Greenpeace Canada "1,000 new [email] sign-ups each month."&lt;ref&gt;http://kleercut.net/en/open-source-campaigning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Radford]] of [[Greenpeace]] US oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the campaign in the U.S. The campaign included sneaking into Kleenex commercial shoots,&lt;ref name="Kleenex Gets Punk’d"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCym0DB7hA |title=Kleenex Gets Punk’d|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts,&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" About the Student Network"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/getinvolved/get-involved/student-network/a-brief-history-of-the-greenpe/|title= 2005-2009 - Kleercut-Free Campuses and Victory!|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly Clark,&lt;ref name="Forest Friendly 500"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://forestfriendly500.org |title= Forest Friendly 500 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 1,000 protests of the company, mobilizing volunteers to put flyers in Kleenex boxes,&lt;ref name=" More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office | title= More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Ylan Q. |last=Mui |date=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;

==Forest Certification==
One of the main demands to Kimberly-Clark and other large customers of Canadian logging companies operating in ancient forests is to turn to the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), a performance based [[certified wood|forest certification]] program supported by local communities, environmental organizations, aboriginal groups, and industry. Kimberly-Clark currently sources the majority of its pulp (near 3 million tons) from Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified logging operations.

[[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certification has been criticized as well. While the most common criticism is that FSC is overly political, for example in Australia's forest  Minister Abetz said "a limiting feature of the FSC is the involvement of environmental organisations, particularly WWF and Greenpeace. WWF and Greenpeace formed the FSC in 1994 as a vehicle to further their political objectives and to take control of forest management and its regulation away from Governments." [http://www.nafi.com.au/media/view.php3?id=442]. It has also been pointed out that: "The largest certified clearcut in the world is on an FSC certified forest in Ontario." [http://www.healthybuilding.net/news/060427sfi-fsc.html] One organization critical of FSC is  Greenwood Earth Alliance who point that FSC certified forest  "cover large industrial-scale operations involving massive clearcutting and even-aged management" and that at least one FSC certified company operating in Canada "engage in clearcutting, high-grading, even-aged management, [[overlogging]], and very large scale destruction of habitat through industrial logging." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2006/11/08/A_Critique_of_the_Tembec_Certifications__FSC_s_largest_certified_company&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13091">'''R-phrases''' (short for '''risk phrases''') are defined in Annex III of [[European Union]] [[Directive 67/548/EEC]]: ''Nature of special risks attributed to dangerous substances and preparations''. The list was consolidated and republished in Directive 2001/59/EC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0059:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 32001L0059 - EN|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; where translations into other EU languages may be found.

These risk phrases are used internationally, not just in Europe, and there is an ongoing effort towards complete international harmonization using the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) which now generally replaces these risk phrases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28639">'''Mechanical screening''', often just called '''screening''', is the practice of taking [[Granule (geology)|granulated]] [[ore]] material and separating it into multiple [[Ore grade|grade]]s by [[particle size]].

This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and [[mineral processing]], agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.

[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]

==General categories==
Screening fall under two general categories: dry screening and wet screening.  From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally the machines can be categorised into moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.

==Applications==
The mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications.  For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher.  Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with {{convert|0.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick shielding screening.  Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller.  Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range.

==Process==
[[File:Screener model of process.jpg|thumb|Model of Screening Process]]
A screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.

There are physical factors that makes screening practical.  For example, vibration, [[gravity|g force]], bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut.  [[Electrostatic force]]s can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.

As with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is.  Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.

In addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens.  Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.

Finally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.

==Physical principles==
*[[Vibration]] - either [[sinusoidal]] vibration or [[gyratory]] vibration.
**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.
**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.
*[[Gravity]] - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media.
*[[Density]] - The density of the material relates to material stratification.
*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.

==Screening terminology==

Like any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.
*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant ''g'' ([[g-force]]).
*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces
*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darbywiremesh.com/wire-mesh-glossary.html Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.
*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.
**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.
**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.
**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.
*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.
*Frequency - Measured in [[hertz]] (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).
*Gradation, grading - Also called "cut" or "cutting."  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm Soil Gradation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091535/http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ Pit &amp; Quarry - Lesson 7 – Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140310145342/http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ |date=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.
*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mesh -  The number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/woven-wire-mesh-wire-cloth-glossary.htm The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping is removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.

==Types of mechanical screening==

There are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.

*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html WS Tyler » F-Class&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919205532/http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html |date=2007-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhewum.com RHEWUM WA- The original&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gyratory equipment -  This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles.  The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engelsmann.com Engelsmann Separators and Screeners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweco.com/separators_sifters_screeners.html Sweco - Vibratory Screener, Sifters, Separators, Round Screen, Vibratory Separator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Chemical_Tumbler_Screener.png|thumb|Chemical Tumbler Screener]]
*Trommel screens - Does not require vibrations, instead, material is fed into a horizontal rotating drum with screen panels around the diameter of the drum.

===Tumbler screening technique===
{{main|Tumbler screening technique}}

An improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821011917/http://almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |archivedate=2013-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circle-throw vibrating equipment===
{{main|Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment}}

[[Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment]] is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.

This type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.

Also this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.

===High frequency vibrating equipment===
{{main|High Frequency Vibrating Equipment}}
High frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3&amp;nbsp;mm) down to a +150 mesh.

These shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.

These shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.
[[File:Gyratory Screener.gif|thumb|Gyratory Screener]]

===Gyratory equipment===
{{main|Gyratory equipment}}

This type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.

The shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.

These types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.

These shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.

===Trommel screens===
{{main|Trommel screen}}

Trommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.

==Screen Media Attachment Systems==

There are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.

===Tensioned screen media===
Tensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned.  Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box.  When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 Crown curve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313004650/http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).

Commonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tensioned mesh sieves|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/tensioned-mesh-sieves.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular screen media===
Modular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schenckprocess.com/site/screenex/products/Polyurethane-Modular-Screening-Systems.html Panels Dimensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temaisenmann.com/%28S%28nztvbymhap5oxom5nrx0xv55%29A%28RTR6-qEDzgEkAAAANDk4OTk0MGItZGI4Zi00MWI5LThlNmEtZDM0ODcxZTI2NjdlINHvMedPqZ_pCwg2vcJqC7glRzw1%29%29/handbook/pdfs/WS-851.pdf ISEPREN WS 85  brochure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel Modular panels types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002019/http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&amp;hl=fr&amp;q=Screen+and+screen+element#hl=fr&amp;q=vibrating+screen+panel&amp;tbm=pts Google Patent - vibrating screen panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorwire.cc/en/products/flex-mat-3-modular Flex-Mat 3 Modular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Screen Media==
There are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular.

===Woven Wire Cloth ([[Mesh]])===
Woven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.

Today wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO 9044:1999 - Industrial woven wire cloth -- Technical requirements and tests|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28424|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glossary|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/glossary.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;a = \left ( \frac{25.4}{b} \right ) - c&lt;/math&gt;

where a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.

[[File:Woven wire mesh.png|alt=Woven wire mesh|thumb|2 mesh with an intermediate crimp]]
Other calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Woven wire mesh calculator|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/calculator.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their [[standard wire gauge]] (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.

Traditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ Haver &amp; Boeker history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001927/https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528134025833/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 1 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528227359157/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 2 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life.  Slotted opening woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okutanikanaami.co.jp/img/second/kanaami/toncap03-b.jpg Photo of a slotted opening woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html Weave Types (see type E for Flat Top)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002335/http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.

===Perforated &amp; Punch Plate===
On a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates&lt;ref&gt;[http://samscreen.com/product/replacement-punch-plate-screen/ Perforated Plate &amp; Punch Plate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aggregatesandminingtoday.com/improving-the-standard-grizzly-screen,2010-1,823,0,0,featured-story.aspx Grizzly Screen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.

===Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane)===
Synthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216225336/http://rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg |date=2014-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/6262/flex-mat-3-modular-locking-system-options-significantly-increase-open-area-without-costly-screen-box-modifications “7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-Cleaning Screen Media===
Self-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to [[vibration|vibrate]] between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meister-siebe.de/en/screens/wire-cloths/harp-screen-type-b.html “Self-Cleaning” woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires).  One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giron.fr/english/screen-mesh/Anti-clogging.htm Giron’s Anti-clogging products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/s1/4112/flex-mat-vibrating-wire-technology-celebrates-15th-anniversary Flex-Mat 15th anniversary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agg-net.com/news/major-wire-make-it-a-double Hook to hook vibration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggman.com/flex-mat%C2%AE-3-increases-throughput-of-spec-product-while-solving-blinding-pegging-and-clogging-problems/ "Flex-Mat® 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration [[frequency]] of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in [[hertz]]) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">'''[https://www.meridianwater.co.uk/ Meridian Water]''' is a £6bn, 20-year London regeneration programme in [[Upper Edmonton]], in the south-east of the [[London Borough of Enfield]], [[North London]]. Led by the Council, the project will deliver 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs to Enfield, next door to the Lee Valley Regional Park. 

Alongside new homes, public spaces and community facilities, the development will have its own new railway station, unlocking the area for commuters with better connections south to Stratford and London Liverpool Street and north to Stansted and Cambridge.

Meridian Water is being actively led by the Council, who is overseeing the vision for the project, which is based around three pillars, and its delivery:

'''1.  Mixing uses and animating streets'''

'''2.  Park life at your doorstep'''

'''3.  Your place to make and create''' 

==Current site==
Currently best known as the home of [[IKEA]] and [[Tesco]], the 210-acre site is located in the south of the London Borough of Enfield between Edmonton, Tottenham and Walthamstow.

The site is also home to the Ravenside Retail park in the north and a number of large blue warehouse structures, formally owned by British Oxygen Company, or [[The BOC Group|BOC Group]], for the manufacture of liquified gas storage vessels. These buildings are currently being used for storage, industrial and distribution purposes.

It sits next door to the parklands and sports facilities of the 10,000 acre Lee Valley Regional Park, and benefits from the [[River Lee Navigation]] and the adjacent [[Pymmes Brook]] passing right through the site, providing the opportunity for a waterside living and working environment. 

The Council has acquired 87 acres (35 hectares) of land at Meridian Water since April 2014. It currently owns 64% of all developable land within the red line boundary of the site and has to date committed £157m to land acquisition.

==Current development==
Meridian One will see the first 725 homes and retail space built at Willoughby Lane. Outline planning permission was achieved in summer 2016 and enabling works are progressing while the procurement process for a development partner is underway through the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) London Development Panel. 

These homes will be delivered around the brand new Meridian Water station, which is due to open in summer 2019 and serve up to four million passengers each year at its peak.  

A planning application and development partner are also being progressed for Meridian Two at Leeside Road, which will deliver 200 affordable homes, earmarked for ‘makers and creators’ that will use new workspace on the lower floors. This will be complemented by a new employment hub for around 900 new jobs at a 2-3 acre site along the North Circular.

==Future development==
'''Mixing uses and animating streets'''

Meridian Water will create a mixed-use community for the capital – where homes and public spaces are enlivened by a mix of growing industries and surrounding communities.

The 10,000 new mixed-tenure homes will support growth in Enfield and London and provide opportunity for everyone, at all stages of life and across all income scales.

The Council’s aim is to create a 24-hour neighbourhood – a new destination to enjoy nightlife, music, theatre, cinema and much more, all year round.

The area will be linked by a new boulevard, connecting the train station in the west to the Lee Valley Regional Park in the east, passing over the waterways and through a series of public spaces to create one cohesive neighbourhood.

The first new school opened in January 2017, with further investment into schools, health services, community facilities, parks, leisure and culture and transport infrastructure to come. 

'''Park life at your doorstep'''

Meridian Water will be the greenest development in London with waterside-living, next door to the Lee Valley Regional Park. 

Progress is being made to bring open spaces to the area. A new green space is already open for local communities at Ladysmith Park – designed by local residents, groups and schools – with more to come. 

The site has excellent road networks as it is bounded by the North Circular Road (A406), A10 and M11. Along with the new Meridian Water train station and super high-speed broadband, communities will be able to connect with the environment on their doorstep and beyond. 

The Council will strive for the highest quality of design and environmental sustainability standards throughout the development. The new homes and businesses will be supplied by the Council’s own energy company, energetik, with low carbon heat through a series of community heat networks – reducing their carbon footprint for heating by 60%. 

'''Your place to make and create''' 

Meridian Water will create an economy for makers and creators, delivering new jobs and opportunities for local people on a scale which will transform the employment base of the Borough.

This will represent a step-change away from industrial warehousing and logistics type uses, which are relatively plentiful in the Borough, offering higher skilled, higher paid employment opportunities for local people.

A new series of employment offers will be developed across the site, attracting major employers as well as start-ups, including new meanwhile uses, a new cluster for fashion manufacturing and the creation of workspaces for makers, creators and artists. 

Local social-enterprise Building Bloqs, alongside ACAVA (Association for Cultural Advancement through Visual Art) and UKFT (the UK Fashion &amp; Textile Association) will form part of the new employment hub at Meridian Water, providing a boost and new jobs for the ‘maker’ economy.

The Council will also work with a number of operators to deliver temporary projects across the site, making efficient use of land, creating short to medium-term employment opportunities and bringing life and activity to the area early on in the programme. This will include bringing the existing sheds back into use on the site by delivering high quality leisure, arts and culture facilities to support a 24-hour destination.

Throughout the life of the overall regeneration programme, an estimated 10,000 construction jobs will be created. A dedicated training offering to provide a programme of traineeships and apprenticeships and an active schools programme will also be delivered, helping local people gain the skills needed during construction and beyond as well as inspiring the next generation of employees.

As a development planned from scratch, super high-speed broadband will be delivered across the site matched by a pioneering approach to digital infrastructure to maximise the benefits of the sharing economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13836">'''Marcio Moreira''' (born 1947 in [[São Paulo, Brazil]] – June 18, 2014) was a multi-cultural marketing executive who played an influential role in the globalization of advertising. In a 44-year career at [[McCann Erickson|McCann Erickson Worldwide]] (subsequently McCann Worldgroup), Moreira headed the agency’s InterNational Team—referred to by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a "daring experiment in the nascent science of worldwide marketing"&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (March 1, 1989). "Team Tailors Ad Drives So They Can Travel Well".  The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;—customizing global campaigns to address cultural nuances on a country-by-country basis.&lt;ref name="Lippert"&gt;Lippert, Barbara (October 10, 1983). "Elite Creative Team Gets McCann Through Customs".  Adweek.&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreira has been credited with accelerating the cross-border, or ''trans-nationalization'', of brands.&lt;ref name="Ciaffone"&gt;Ciaffone, Andrea (October 8, 2004). "Marcio Moreira: A Brazilian on Top of World Advertising". Forbes (Brazilian Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreira also served for 25 years as worldwide creative director on McCann’s biggest clients, including [[Coca-Cola]], [[General Motors]] and [[Nestlé]].&lt;ref&gt;Lafayette, Jon (February 20, 1989). "Moreira on the move: Adman travels world for McCann". Advertising Age.&lt;/ref&gt;   His multi-cultural expertise attracted the attention of Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and his Under-Secretary [[Charlotte Beers]], who personally recruited Moreira for a special communications program in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].  The project, codenamed "[[Shared Values Initiative|Shared Values]]", helped defuse fear and distrust of the U.S. among Muslim communities overseas and at home.

Moreira is best known for his international work in the [[soft-drink]] marketplace, specifically on the Coca-Cola account for which [[Adweek]] labeled him the "brigadier general" of global advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Seaman, Debbie (September 17, 1984). "Globetrotting for Coke’s Global Creative". Adweek.&lt;/ref&gt;    He oversaw the design and implementation of "Coke Is It", a campaign that ran for five years in the U.S market&lt;ref name="Pendergrast"&gt;[[Mark Pendergrast|Pendergrast, Mark]].  ''For God, Country, and Coca Cola: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It''.  pp. 340, 361.  Books.google.com.  Retrieved on January 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and longer worldwide.  He was also the creative leader on the international introduction of [[Diet Coke]].

In 1985, he was one of the key creative executives helping Coca-Cola launch—and handle the subsequent fallout from – [[New Coke]],&lt;ref&gt;Moreira, Marcio (May 2, 2011).  "How New Coke Went from Market-Changer to Company’s Humbling Biggest Blunder".

Moreira has won more than 100 creative awards in the U.S. and around the world.  In his native Brazil, he was named Advertising Professional of the Year, Decade and, in 2003, the Century.&lt;ref name="Ciaffone" /&gt;

== Early career ==

In 1967, Moreira began his McCann career as a [[projectionist]] and assistant [[TV producer]] in Brazil.  He was promoted to copywriter in 1969 and one year later to associate [[creative director]].  He relocated to the agency’s London office in 1971 and became head of a creative group there.  He subsequently took writer-producer positions in Lisbon, Frankfurt and Copenhagen, before returning to Brazil where he advanced to creative director of Latin America.&lt;ref name="Tusher"&gt;Tusher, Will (August 6, 1987).  "New Col World Marketing Coordinator Moreira Will Keep McCann-Erickson Post".  Variety.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that post, he headed the [[General Motors]] account, particularly the launch of four [[Chevrolet]] models, including [[Chevrolet Opala|Opala]] – the first GM passenger car to be introduced in the Brazilian market.&lt;ref&gt;"Learn more about the Opala: The Chevrolet Opala" [in Portuguese]. http://www.opala.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=50. Accessed January 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency transferred Moreira to New York in 1980 where Phil Dougherty, advertising columnist for The New York Times, wrote that he was "certainly a man to watch."&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Phil (April 7, 1981).  "Advertising: Promotions Are Set By McCann-Erickson."  The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;   Soon after, McCann consolidated its three regional creative units – EuroTeam, AsiaTeam and New York Team – into the InterNational Team.  At the time, McCann had the industry’s most comprehensive global network, with 100 offices in 64 countries.&lt;ref name="Lippert" /&gt;   The firm chose Moreira to head this initiative in 1984.&lt;ref name="Eikenberg"&gt;Eikenberg, Darcy (July 29, 1988). "Marcio Moreira: An International Flair".  Back Stage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The face of global advertising ==

When Moreira took over the InterNational team, it had been conceived as a "firefighting" unit, dedicated to helping affiliates around the world resolve problems, such as pitching new business or writing a critically needed spot for a short-handed office.  Moreira enhanced the vision, approaching the initiative as an opportunity to change the "brown envelope syndrome" in global advertising, which he described as "when something is created in New York and sent in a brown envelope to offices overseas with instructions to translate. &lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (February 27, 1989). "Advertising: International Approach of McCann" The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the first to argue that much of American advertising was "unexportable".&lt;ref name="Lippert" /&gt; In a 1991 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', he discussed the American cultural tendency toward the "hard sell" and "wearing our feelings on our sleeve" versus other world cultures that resist overt [[emotional manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (July 15, 1991). "Advertising Spoken Here: At an International Festival of Television Commercials, the Hottest Spots Reveal a World of Cultural Differences." Time.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternately, he addressed in ''[[USA Today]]'' Americans' customary prudishness toward sexual content in advertising—despite their taste for "titillation in entertainment" - that would be incompatible with advertising in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Melanie and Enrico, Dottie (June 27, 1997). "Racy Ads Unnerve Marketers". USA Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreira advocated for centralized strategies and concepts, but localized execution that reflects cultural nuances.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Cooper, Ann (April 1990).  "As the World Turns: Marcio Moreira Explains Why International Is Hot, Hot, Hot".   Creativity.&lt;/ref&gt;  He often drew on the disparate ways customers around the world perceived product benefits.  For example, as [[diet soda]] brands grew popular in the 80s, he explained:

''"In the American market, if you say a diet drink is to help you keep in shape, it’s like saying a car has four wheels. To be successful, you have to offer that plus tremendous taste and heritage. Overseas, you have to bring to people’s attention that the time has come to look after themselves, and here’s a soft drink that will help [them] with that."''&lt;ref name="Lippert" /&gt;

Yet he reinforced the importance of creating a universal brand experience that transcends culture, even though the execution may require nuanced expression. He described this careful balance using the simultaneous Coca Cola campaigns "You Can’t Beat the Feeling" and "I Feel Coke" that ran in the U.S. and Japan, respectively:

''"Japan is probably the one country whose ads would strike you as having the most unique look due to the cultural and ethnic orientation of the advertising. If you forgot for a minute that those faces were Japanese faces, those people live in a Coca-Cola world. The sounds, words and images are actually quite similar to those you see here or in the U.K. or in Australia... They’re different interpretations of the same idea."''&lt;ref name="Eikenberg" /&gt;

Moreira ultimately held McCann posts in eight nations and insisted that team members have on-the-ground experience in the countries where they were helping develop and execute campaigns.  He encouraged art directors, writers and producers involved in InterNational Team business to accept long-term overseas career opportunities rather than simply periodic travel.  He also maintained that these opportunities needed to be symbiotic throughout the McCann network and not merely involve placement of experts from the New York headquarters around the globe:

''"I don’t mean one-way streets, like Americans or Brits going to see the world; I see a two-way street in which other nationalities will come into these cultures and energize them in their own way."''&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Moreira became an active spokesperson of the new global approach to marketing.  He was often pursued for commentary by major business reporters and regularly published opinion pieces in relevant media.  When [[Advertising Age]] ran a feature on [[global marketing]] as "the new wave", an American executive objected to the decision-making authority vested in "some [[marketing director]] in Chile [who] is probably a bozo".&lt;ref&gt;"Global marketing: The new wave".  Advertising Age. (June 25, 1984.)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreira wrote a scathing response detailing the new realities of multi-cultural marketing and explaining, "That ‘bozo’ is the global agency’s real client", responsible not only for strategy but to profits, given that global work is paid for locally.&lt;ref&gt;Moreira, Marcio (July 23, 1984). "Who’s a ‘bozo’?"  Advertising Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Moreira was promoted to Vice Chairman/[[Chief Creative Officer]], International,&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and later named Chief Creative Officer, McCann Worldgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz, Laurel (June 11, 2001). "The Ghost Ads of Cannes". Advertising Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-90s, McCann Worldwide focused on the [[Far East]], given the re-emergence of China as an economic leader, the rise of the middle class in such markets as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, and the region’s new sensitivity about cultural values in advertising.  McCann named Moreira regional director.  He oversaw strategic as well as creative development and helped revitalize McCann's Asia Pacific presence. He also transitioned the McCann Hong Kong office during the British handover to China, and assumed direct management of McCann Tokyo, the firm’s largest international office.   Likewise, he played a critical role in securing the flagship Coca-Cola account in what had become a highly competitive region.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, David (April 17, 1995). "Asian Global Quarterly: A New Asian Vision for McCann".  Adweek.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
In 2000, Moreira was named McCann’s Vice Chairman, Global Professional Management of McCann Worldgroup responsible for all personnel handling global accounts - in addition to his international creative role.  In 2003, he took his final role as Vice Chairman, Chief Talent Officer and Worldwide HR Director, responsible for worldwide recruitment and career development of thousands of employees.

In recognition of Moreira’s defining role in global marketing, [[Deutsche Bank]] featured him in its 2001 campaign "New Destinations Call for New Maps" that appeared in [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[The Financial Times]] and a full range of international business publications.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Bank Advertisement (April 4, 2001).  The Wall Street Journal, p. A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his major industry awards, Moreira had won a Gold Lion for Coca-Cola, a Silver Lion for [[Bayer]], three [[Clio Award]]s for Chevrolet and another for "Coke Is It!"&lt;ref name="Tusher" /&gt;   He had been one of only three Americans to chair the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|International Advertising Film Festival]] in Cannes, France.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (June 23, 1989). "Advertising: Film Festival Leader".  The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreira retired from McCann in 2011.

== Personal life ==

He is survived by his wife, Maria Moreira; daughter Eliana Moreira, son Joaquim Moreira, and grandson Lucas Moreira&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meioemensagem.com.br/home/comunicacao/noticias/2014/06/19/Morre-Marcio-Moreira.html] Regina Augusto, Meio &amp; Mensagem (June 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalia Ponce de León''' (born c. 1981) is a Colombian woman and crime victim who successfully campaigned for a law targeting perpetrators of [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]] in her country.

==Attack==
Ponce de León, who was a successful business woman, was assaulted by Jonathan Vega,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/sigue-el-juicio-contra-jonthan-vega-el-agresor-de-natalia-ponce-/16643615|title=Avanza el juicio contra Jonathan Vega, el agresor de Natalia Ponce - Bogotá - El Tiempo|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|newspaper=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body on March 27, 2014&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html aljazeera.com retrieved 8th Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; while she was visiting her mother in Santa Barbára.&lt;ref&gt;Charner, Flora.

Retrieved from: http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html&lt;/ref&gt; Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been "obsessed" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship.&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"/&gt; 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Colombia: Man accused of high profile acid attack arrested.

==Public outcry and new law==
However, her case was not an isolated incident. Three years before the attack took place, [[Colombia]] reported one of the highest rates of [[acid attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fucsia.co/personajes/nacionales/article/colombia-lider-vergonzoso-en-ataques-con-acido/49533|title=Colombia, líder vergonzoso en ataques con ácido|website=www.fucsia.co|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack.

The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord" /&gt; The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord" /&gt;

==Media coverage==
Ponce de León bravely spoke publicly with a protective mask during her campaigning. However, she decided to show her face when the book ''El renacimiento de Natalia Ponce de León (The Rebirth of Natalia Ponce de León)'', which tells her story, was published in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/caso-natalia-ponce-de-leon-libro-escrito-por-la-periodista-martha-soto/15555377|title=El renacimiento de Natalia Ponce de León - Justicia - El Tiempo|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|newspaper=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bubble.folly.jpg|thumb|right|The "night singer of shares" sold stock on the streets during the [[South Sea Bubble]]. Amsterdam, 1720.]]

"'''Pump and dump'''" ('''P&amp;D''') is a form of [[securities fraud]]  that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned [[stock]] through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme "dump" sell their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. This is most common with small cap cryptocurrencies and very small corporations, i.e. "microcaps".&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/pumpdump.htm |title=Pump and Dump Schemes |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |date=March 12, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Microcap stock fraud]].

While fraudsters in the past relied on [[cold calling|cold calls]], the [[Internet]] now offers a cheaper and easier way of reaching large numbers of potential investors through spam email, bad data, social media, and false information.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;

Pump and dump schemes may take place on the Internet using an [[e-mail spam]] campaign, through media channels via a fake press release, or through telemarketing from "[[Boiler room (business)|boiler room]]" brokerage houses (such as that dramatized in the 2000 film ''[[Boiler Room (film)|Boiler Room]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NBC News staff  |author2=news wires  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/400-million-buyout-hoax-fooled-many-1C7208011 |title=The $400 million buyout hoax that fooled many - Business on |publisher=Nbcnews.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the [[stock promoter]] will claim to have "inside" information about impending news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wasik|first=John|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2013/06/28/pump-and-dump-schemes-resurface-in-social-media/|title='Pump And Dump' Schemes Resurface In Social Media|publisher=''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters may purport to offer unbiased recommendations, then [[tout]] a company as a "hot" stock, for their own benefit. [[Stock promoter|Promoters]] may also post messages in chat rooms or stock message boards such as [[ADVFN]], urging readers to buy the stock quickly.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;

If a promoter's campaign to "pump" a stock is successful, it will entice unwitting investors to purchase shares of the target company. The increased demand, price, and trading volume of the stock may convince more people to believe the hype, and to buy shares as well. When the promoters behind the scheme sell (dump) their shares and stop promoting the stock, the price plummets, and other investors are left holding a stock that is worth significantly less than they paid for it.

Fraudsters frequently use this ploy with small, thinly traded companies—known as "[[penny stock]]s," generally traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (in the United States, this would mean markets such as the [[OTC Bulletin Board]] or the [[Pink Sheets LLC|Pink Sheets]]), rather than markets such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) or [[NASDAQ]]—because it is easier to manipulate a stock when there is little or no independent information available about the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/pump.htm |title=Pump&amp;Dump.con: Tips for Avoiding Stock Scams on the Internet |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |date=January 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same principle applies in the United Kingdom, where target companies are typically small companies on the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] or [[PLUS Markets Group|OFEX]].

A more modern spin on this attack is known as hack, pump and dump.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Hack, Pump and Dump|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501763.html|work=The Washington Post|date=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, a person purchases penny stocks and then uses compromised brokerage accounts to purchase large quantities of that stock.  The net result is a price increase, which is often pushed further by day traders seeing a quick advance in a stock.  The original stockholder then cashes out at a premium.&lt;ref name=HWS&gt;{{cite book|last=Krinklebine|first=Karlos|title=Hacking Wall Street: Attacks and Countermeasures|year=2009|publisher=Darkwave Press|location=US|isbn=1-4414-6363-1|pages=83–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

====Stratton Oakmont====
In the early 1990s the penny-stock brokerage [[Stratton Oakmont]] artificially inflated the price of owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=Thomas S. |title=Investor Wins $10 Million in Penny-Stock Broker Case |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-17/business/fi-49501_1_arbitration-case |journal=Los Angeles Times |date =April 17, 1997|accessdate= 11 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firm co-founder [[Jordan Belfort]] was criminally convicted for his role in the scheme. He later turned his story into a [[memoir]], [[The Wolf of Wall Street (book)|''The Wolf of Wall Street'']], which was later adapted into an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated [[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|film of the same name]].

====Jonathan Lebed====
During the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com era]], when stock-market fever was at its height and many people spent significant amounts of time on stock Internet message boards, a 15-year-old named [[Jonathan Lebed]] showed how easy it was to use the Internet to run a successful pump and dump. Lebed bought penny stocks and then promoted them on message boards, pointing at the price increase. When other investors bought the stock, Lebed sold his for a profit, leaving the other investors [[Bagholder|holding the bag]].  He came to the attention of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), which filed a [[civil suit]] against him alleging [[Market manipulation|security manipulation]]. Lebed settled the charges by paying a fraction of his total gains. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but promised not to manipulate securities in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html?pagewanted=all |title=Jonathan Lebed: Stock Manipulator, S.E.C. Nemesis – and 15 |last=Lewis |first=Michael |date=February 25, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enron====
As late as April 2001, before the [[Enron scandal|company's collapse]], [[Enron]] executives participated in an elaborate scheme of pump and dump,&lt;ref name="DVD132"&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Magnolia Pictures]]|time=32:58|date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to other illegal practices that fooled even the most experienced analysts on Wall Street. Studies of the anonymous messages posted on the [[Yahoo]] board dedicated to Enron revealed predictive messages that the company was basically a house of cards, and that investors should bail out while the stock was good.&lt;ref name="BMB-NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Gretchen Morgenson|Morgenson, Gretchen]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/business/yourmoney/28WATC.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The Bears on This Message Board Had Enron Pegged |work=The New York Times |date=2002-04-28 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Enron falsely reported profits which inflated the stock price, they covered the real numbers by using questionable accounting practices. Twenty-nine Enron executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="Publici"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Chambers |url=http://publici.ucimc.org/mar2002/32002_7.htm |title=Enron the Symptom, Not the Disease |publisher=publici.ucimc.org |accessdate=2010-04-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622102124/http://publici.ucimc.org/mar2002/32002_7.htm |archivedate=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Park Financial Group====
In April 2007, the U.S. SEC brought charges against Park Financial Group as a result of an investigation into a pump and dump scheme during 2002–2003 of the Pink Sheet listed stock of Spear &amp; Jackson Inc.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wall Street Journal]], April 12, 2007, pg. C2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Langbar International====
Started as Crown Corporation, Langbar was the biggest pump and dump fraud on the [[Alternative Investment Market]], part of the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The company was at one point valued greater than $1 billion, based on supposed bank deposits in Brazil which did not exist. None of the chief conspirators were convicted, although their whereabouts are known. A patsy who made a negligent false statement about the assets was convicted and banned from being a director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/24/langbar-international-fraud-history|title=Langbar International: the greatest stock market heist of all?|first=Simon|last=Bowers|date=24 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investors who lost as much as £100 million sued one of the fraudsters and recovered £30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theel1tetrader.com/2015/02/langbar-international-verified-aim-fraud.html|title=Langbar International - Verified AIM Fraud|first=|last=El1te|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scam==
Pump and dump stock [[scams]] are prevalent in spam, accounting for about 15% of spam e-mail messages. A survey of 75,000 unsolicited emails sent between January 2004 and July 2005 concluded that spammers could make an average return of 4.29% by using this method, while recipients who act on the spam message typically lose close to 5.5% of their investment within two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frieder, Laura and [[Jonathan Zittrain|Zittrain, Jonathan]]|title=Spam Works: Evidence from Stock Touts and Corresponding Market Activity|date=March 14, 2007|publisher=Berkman Center Research Publication No. 2006-11|ssrn=920553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5284618.stm |title=Spammers manipulate stock markets |date=25 August 2006 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Böhme and Holz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Böhme |first1=Rainer |last2=Holz |first2=Thorsten |title=The Effect of Stock Spam on Financial Markets |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=April 2006 |volume=April 2006 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.897431 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228199058_The_Effect_of_Stock_Spam_on_Financial_Markets |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a similar effect. Stocks targeted by spam are almost always penny stocks, selling for less than $5 per share, not traded on major exchanges, are thinly traded, and are difficult or impossible to [[Short (finance)|sell short]].  Spammers acquire stock before sending the messages, and sell the day the message is sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanke |first1=Michael |last2=Hauser |first2=Florian |title=On the Effects of Stock Spam E-mails∗ |url=http://www.ebs.de/fileadmin/redakteur/funkt.dept.finance/DGF/downloads/Paper/No-262.pdf |website=EBS Universitat |accessdate=27 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083412/https://www.ebs.edu/fileadmin/redakteur/funkt.dept.finance/DGF/downloads/Paper/No-262.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with other types of schemes===

A pump and dump scam is a type of [[economic bubble]], with the main difference between this scheme and most other types of bubbles being that the pump and dump bubble is deliberately perpetrated by unlawful activity. A pump and dump scheme is similar in many ways to a [[Ponzi scheme]] (in that both types of scam use misrepresentations in an effort to enrich the promoters and/or initial investors with money from later investors), however, there are a number of differences between the schemes:
* Ponzi-type investments are privately traded, often between individuals that are known to one another, whereas pump and dump schemes are typically marketed to the general public and traded on public stock exchanges and the victims and perpetrators are not acquainted with each other.
* Ponzi schemes typically promise very specific returns on investments and/or include falsified records implying consistent and steady returns, whereas pump and dump schemes only come with general and/or implied promises of substantial profits.
* Ponzi schemes typically come with the expectation of profit over a relatively-extended period of time and typically last for months, years or even decades before their inevitable collapse. By comparison, pump and dump scams are designed to make profits extremely quickly and are executed over a period of weeks, days or even hours.
* Pump and dump schemes are invariably intended to be scams from their conception, whereas Ponzi schemes are occasionally the result of investment vehicles that are originally intended to be legitimate but ultimately fail to perform as expected.
* For all of the above reasons, Ponzi schemes tend to leave a far more extensive trail of [[evidence (law)|evidence]]. They are typically much easier to prosecute after they are discovered, and often result in much stiffer criminal penalties.

Pump and dump differs from many other forms of spam (such as [[advance fee fraud]] emails and [[lottery scam]] messages) in that it does not require the recipient to contact the spammer to collect supposed "winnings," or to transfer money from supposed bank accounts. This makes tracking the source of pump and dump spam difficult, and has also given rise to "minimalist" spam consisting of a small untraceable image file containing a picture of a stock symbol.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Short and distort==
{{main|Short and distort}}
A variant of the pump and dump scam, the "short and distort" works in the opposite manner.  Instead of first buying the stock, and then artificially raising its price before selling, in a "short and distort" the scammer first [[Short (finance)|short-sells]] the stock, and then artificially ''lowers'' the price, using the same techniques as the pump and dump but using criticism or negative predictions regarding the stock.  The scammer then covers their short position when they buy back the stock at a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2002/06/52785| last = Glasner| first = Joanna| title = New Market Trend: Short, Distort| work = Wired| publisher = Condé Nast Digital| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5nSEkhdBd?url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2002/06/52785| archivedate = February 11, 2010| accessdate = February 11, 2010| date = 2002-06-03| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic is commonly used by institutions and brokers to dupe individual traders in the Korean stock market, as only institutional traders are allowed to shortsell stocks.

==Regulation==
One method of regulating and restricting pump and dump manipulators is to target the category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have been the target of heightened enforcement efforts. In the United States, regulators have defined a [[penny stock]] as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, [[market capitalization]], and minimum [[shareholder|shareholder equity]]. Securities traded on a national [[stock exchange]], regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51983.pdf|title=SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION|publisher=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it is thought that exchange traded securities are less vulnerable to [[market manipulation|manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-117.htm |title=SEC Charges Eight Participants in Penny Stock Manipulation Ring |date=May 21, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Citigroup]] (NYSE:C) and other NYSE listed securities which traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as "low priced" securities, were not technically "penny stocks". Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through [[rulemaking|rules]] and [[regulation]]s enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The [[State of Georgia]] was the first state to [[codification (law)|codify]] a comprehensive penny stock securities law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/business/fi-532_1_penny-stock |title=Georgia to OK Tough Law for Penny Stocks |date=March 20, 1990 |author=Stan Darden |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=[[UPI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State [[Max Cleland]], whose office enforced State securities laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ga.gov/securities/ |title=Georgia Secretary of State &amp;#124; Securities |publisher=Sos.ga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], the only [[stockbroker]] in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in [[U.S. District Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/111783/GEORGIA-LAW-WONT-HURT-BROKERS-JUDGE-RULES.html?pg=all |title=GEORGIA LAW WON'T HURT BROKERS, JUDGE RULES |date=July 11, 1990 |work=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[statute]] became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either closing or greatly restricting broker/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson &amp; Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/business/penny-stock-fraud-from-both-sides-now.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Penny-Stock Fraud, From Both Sides Now |author=Diana B. Henriques |date=February 16, 2003 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sanctions under these specific regulations lack an effective means to address pump and dump schemes perpetrated by unregistered groups and individuals.

'''Richard Beale Blaize''' (November 22, 1845 – September 21, 1904) was a [[West African]] businessman, newspaper publisher, financier, and black nationalist of [[Sierra Leonean]] and [[Nigerian]] heritage.

==Early life==
Richard Olamilege Blaize was born in [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone, to the family of [[emancipated]] [[slaves]] of Yoruba origin. His parents were Ojelabi Olapajuokun (who later took the name John Blaize) and Maria Blaize.&lt;ref name="Adeniran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adeniran|first1=Adedapo|title=Nigeria The Case for Peaceful and Friendly Dissolution|publisher=Arymson Publicity|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hDJvxt_O-MC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;dq=richard+Beale+Blaize+olamilege&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=olamilege&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarikh|title=R.B. Blaize: Merchant Prince of West Africa|publisher=Longman, 1966|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, he attended a mission school and was nurtured in the Christian way. He started work as an [[apprentice]] for a printer in Freetown but soon left the country for the [[Lagos Colony]] in 1862.

==Career in business and political activism==

===Business===
After arriving Lagos in 1862, Blaize worked as a printer for Robert Campbell, editor of Anglo-American.&lt;ref name="Teniola"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teniola|first1=Eric|title=Sierra Leon: The Creoles in Nigeria|url=http://www.thisissierraleone.com/sierra-leone-the-creoles-in-nigeria/|website=This Is Sierra Leone|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then left printing for [[merchandise]] trading and importation. In trading, the participants were numerous, especially those from Lagos; most of the traders mainly dealt with exchanging goods with exporters and a few delved into [[exportation]].&lt;ref name="Olukoju"&gt;Ayodeji Olukoju. "Anatomy of Business-Government Relations: Fiscal Policy and Mercantile Pressure Group Activity in Nigeria, 1916-1933", ''African Studies Review'', Vol. 38, No. 1, April 1995, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of traders owned steamers, which were used to navigate the [[Niger River]] to buy goods from groups across river, and some even boasted they showed the imperialists how to move across the river. Blaize was among a few of the Lagos merchants to be very successful in trading; he was an importer and was also involved with trade across the Niger. Though the ruinous approach of competitors led to many indigenous enterprises foundling not the least helped with the dominance of [[sole proprietorships]], Blaize thrived in the midst of strong competition and became one of the wealthiest West Africans of his time.&lt;ref name="Lipschitz"&gt;Mark R. Lipschutz, R. Kent Rasmussen. ''Dictionary of African Historical Biography'', Aldine Pub. Co., 1978, p. 32. {{ISBN|0-520-05179-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in the European Lagos Chamber of Commerce constituted in 1888 and was on the 1898 Commission on Trade in Lagos.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt;

===Political activism===
He was a prominent member of the [[Royal African Society]] during the second half of the nineteenth century. He was also at various times, a [[newspaper publisher]]. He entered the [[newsprint]] business in 1880, with the launch of ''[[The Lagos Times and Gold Coast Colony Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt; The paper brought on Mr [[Mojola Agbebi]], who later became prominent and known for his views on [[cultural]] [[Nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Obichere"&gt;Boniface I. Obichere. ''Studies in Southern Nigerian History'', Routledge, 1982, p. 106, {{ISBN|0-7146-3106-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the life of the newspaper was short, it folded in 1884. He was thereafter approached by [[John Payne Jackson]], a [[Liberia]]n emigrant who wanted to re-invent the Times. After much prodding, Blaize agreed to publish a new rag: the ''Lagos Weekly Times''. Through his newspapers, he took an active part in demanding more education, better representation for Africans in Lagos, self-government, and pushed for a separation of Lagos Colony from the Gold Coast Colony.

Blaize's political clout in [[Lagos Colony]] was demonstrated in 1901 during the contest for the [[Oba of Lagos|Lagos Throne]].  After Governor [[William MacGregor]] refused to accept any of the rival candidates (Oduntan and Ajose Dawudu) for the Obaship, one of the king-makers (Yesufu Omo-Oba) introduced [[Eshugbayi Eleko]] to Blaize, and Blaize in turn introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Governor  MacGregor, who recognized Eleko as Oba of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Apr 17, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Blaize married Emily Cole in 1871 and the couple had 6 children&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Marrying Well: Marriage, Status and Social Change among the Educated Elite in Colonial Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Dec 5, 1985|isbn=9780521307017|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Charlotte Olajumoke, who in 1902,  married Dr [[Orisadipe Obasa]]. Emily Cole died in 1895.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Death, legacy and philanthropy==
In the 1890s Blaize's financial worth was estimated to be about £150,000.&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forrest|first1=Tom|title=The Advance of African Capital: The Growth of Nigerian Private Enterprise|publisher=University of Virginia Press, 1994|isbn=9780813915623|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfHsJMBLWlsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Blaize+advance+of+african+capital&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4_43zxYPRAhWJ3YMKHcdQBWoQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=blaize&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaize donated £500 in memory of [[Mary Kingsley]] to the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]].&lt;ref name="JHK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kopytoff|first1=Jean Herskovits|title=A preface to modern Nigeria: the "Sierra Leonians" in Yoruba, 1830-1890|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press, 1965|pages=283–284|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he died in 1904, he bequeathed £3,000 for the foundation of the Blaize Memorial Institute in Abeokuta, which opened in 1909&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt; and functioned well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=213 n11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blaize kept his connection with Freetown, his place of birth, bequeathing £500 to the Princess Christian Hospital there.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt; Blaize left an estate valued at £60,000 to his children.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2007">'''Risk assurance''' is often associated with [[accounting]] practices and is a growing industry. Risk assurance is very similar to [[Assurance services|assurance]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assurance-services.asp | title=Assurance Services|website=Investopedia.com| date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to think about it is that the Assurance department in a firm is more broader and accounting based while the risk assurance department is a subset, much smaller and specific. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/risk-assurance.html | title=Risk Assurance|website=Pwc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;Auditors that work in the risk assurance department are more focused on auditing Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) and completing a System and Organization Control (SOC 1) reports.&lt;ref name="AHIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.resourcenter.net/images/AHIA/Files/2008/AnnMtg/Handouts/TrackB5.pdf|format=PDF|title=Understanding IT General Controls Understanding IT General Controls|author=Ben Miron|date=September 9, 2008|website=Resourcecenter.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.coso.org/Pages/default.aspx | title=Welcome to COSO|website=Coso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has become a huge part of public accounting firms revenue as the industry trends show that firms and clients are moving towards making technology a huge part of their day to day services. This means risk assurance will become a huge part of their auditors work.&lt;ref name="AHIA"/&gt; It starts with a meeting between the client and auditor to discuss which processes of the client that the auditors will choose to audit. They decide this based off of which processes are significant and what controls are there in place to prevent any error or fraud. An example of this would be access into the journal entry database to ensure that anyone who has access is supposed to and those who do not cannot access the database.

'''Román Ongpin''' was a [[Filipino-Chinese]] businessman and philanthropist who aided Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish and American colonial administration in the Philippine islands.&lt;ref name="dyk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Medina|first=Marielle|title=Did you know: Roman Ongpin|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/675696/did-you-know-roman-ongpin|accessdate=6 June 2016|agency=Inquirer Research|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ongpin was born in [[Binondo]], [[Manila]] in February 28, 1847&lt;ref name="dyk"/&gt; to Simon Ongpin and Sinfrosa Tanbensiang. His father Simon Ongpin is among those who migrated from mainland China to do business in the Philippine islands. Ongpin learned about doing business at a young age.&lt;ref name=sino&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimenez|first1=Fidel|title=Sino si Ongpin ng Binondo?|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/207541/news/ulatfilipino/sino-si-ongpin-ng-binondo|accessdate=6 June 2016|publisher=GMA News|date=4 December 2010|language=Filipino|trans-title=Who is Ongpin of Binondo?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ongpin established his own business in 1883 he dubbed as "El 82" after the cholera outbreak in the Philippine islands a year ago. The name was chosen as a symbol of rebirth of the archipelago from the health disaster. The business of Ongpin was a success, and his wealth and social standing improved. He pioneered the use of [[fixed pricing]] and [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry accounting system]]. One of the exclusive products that El 82 sold was art supplies. Ongpin's wife Pascuala Domingo was a descendant of Filipino artist [[Damián Domingo]]. Through this, Ongpin got involved with the [[illustrados]].&lt;ref name="seapersonalities"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Suryadinata|editor1-first=Leo|title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume I &amp; II|date=2012|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=9789814345217|pages=853–854|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA853&amp;lpg=PA853&amp;dq=Ongpin+Street+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kxjyqZWgSq&amp;sig=rYwskyO6wyKR1uNTwH7pFyZ5eFU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR4M-x5JPNAhXBGpQKHdL-DWM4ChDoAQgtMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Ongpin&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongpin is a financier of the [[Katipunan]],&lt;ref name="seapersonalities"/&gt; letting the revolutionaries use his store as a secret hideout. Ongpin also provided financial aid and food to the revolutionary movement until the end of the [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines]]. Ongpin once again aided the Filipinos following the [[Philippine-American War]] and was imprisoned by the Americans from December 1900 until March 1901.&lt;ref name=sino/&gt;

Despite attaining freedom from imprisonment, Ongpin remained opposed against the United States' occupation of the Philippines. He expressed this sentiment by refusing to sell his products to Americans and teaching his children to be self-sufficient without help from foreigners.&lt;ref name=sino/&gt;

Ongpin also had civic involvements and held posts in organizations. He was the Teniente Primo de Mestizos, president of Casa Asilo de Invalidos Filipinos de Guerra an institution for veterans of Pascual Poblete, and treasurer of Union Obrera de Filipinas of Isabelo de los Reyes. He also had membership at the Philippine Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=sino/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Ongpin died on December 10, 1912,&lt;ref name="dyk"/&gt; due to heart ailment. Before his death, he requested his family to dress his corpse with [[barong tagalog]].&lt;ref name=sino/&gt; He was interred at the [[North Cemetery of Manila]].&lt;ref name="dyk"/&gt;

The Calle Sacrista in Manila was renamed as Ongpin Street on September 17, 1915 and a monument of Ongpin was built at the Plaza de Binondo.&lt;ref name="dyk"/&gt;

'''Sebastian Luke (Seb) Bishop''' (born 1974)&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|last2=Davies|first2=Ian F|title=Highgate School Register 1833-1988|page=432|edition=7th|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the CEO of [[Goop (company)|GOOP]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s lifestyle company, from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Emily|title=Goop CEO quits after Paltrow’s ‘uncoupling’|url=https://pagesix.com/2014/04/16/gwyneths-goop-ceo-quits-in-corporate-uncoupling/?_ga=1.63963820.2064880802.1392929408|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Page Six]]|date=17 April 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining GOOP, Bishop was the International CEO of (RED), the organisation created by [[Bono]] and [[Bobby Shriver]] to raise money for [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. He had previously started the firm [[Espotting]] at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"/&gt;

Bishop was educated at [[Highgate School]]&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt; and began Espotting with his school-friend [[Daniel Ishag]] in a basement flat in 2000. He expanded the business across Europe before merging with US based FindWhat.com in June 2004 in a deal which valued the company at $186m.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miva.com/us/content/about/pressroom/pressreleases/pressrelease.asp?page=070104 |title=Miva Merchant &amp;#124; Ecommerce Software and Hosting |publisher=Miva.com |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121201110/http://www.miva.com/us/content/about/pressroom/pressreleases/pressrelease.asp?page=070104 |archivedate=21 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Chairman of Steak, a search-inspired communications agency.  

In 2007 Bishop was one of 8 British entrepreneurs featured in the Channel 4 documentary 'Millionaires' Mission.' He spent 3 weeks in a remote region of [[Uganda]], using Western entrepreneurial skills to try and bring sustainable relief from poverty to affected communities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/A/africa/index.html |title=Millionaires' Mission |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526054644/http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/A/africa/index.html |archivedate=26 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop and (RED)==
He joined (RED) as their International CEO in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Luke Heads (RED)|journal=The Cholmeleian|issue=Winter 2009|page=7|url=http://www.highgateschool.org.uk/images/news/cholmeleian_winter09.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of (RED) was that the companies could make products using the (RED) logo in exchange for donating up to half their profits from those products directly to the Global Fund for AIDS programs in Africa.  

Since launch (RED) has grown to 9 partners (and growing): American Express (UK only), Converse, Gap, Emporio Armani, Dell, Windows, Apple, Hallmark and Starbucks. On 1 December 2008 (World AIDS Day), (RED)wire was launched – (RED)'s music subscription service.

(RED) partners and events have generated over $120 million to help eliminate AIDS in Africa through The Global Fund (January 2009).

==Espotting and MIVA (now Vertro)==
In 2000, at the age of 26, Bishop founded Espotting – the company that pioneered [[search marketing]] and [[pay per click|Pay-Per-Click]] advertising in Europe. He expanded the business across Europe before merging with US based FindWhat.com in June 2004 in a deal which valued the company at $186m.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"/&gt; In 2005, he led the global rebrand of the combined company under the MIVA name. Following the merger Bishop became President and chief marketing officer of MIVA ({{NASDAQ|MIVA}}). The online advertising model of Pay-Per-Click advertising which Luke pioneered in 2000 has driven much of the growth in the online advertising market, and in 2003 both [[Google]] (with their AdWords programme)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/press/pressrel/adwords_uk.html |title=U.K. news announcements – News from Google – Google |publisher=Google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014}} {{404|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=over&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=456317]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408061217/http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=over&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=456317 |date=8 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently followed Espotting into the UK market.

One of the youngest presidents of a [[NASDAQ]] listed company (appointed to the role at the age of 31), Bishop began working in advertising at the age of 14 at Yellowhammer during his summer holidays and at 19 joined [[Publicis]] as an [[art director]]. From Publicis he moved on to Rainey Kelly Campbell Rolfe and was part of the company when they successfully took over [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] London. During his advertising agency years, Luke created the award-winning campaign that launched [[Coca-Cola]] in Russia as well as campaigns for some of the world's most famous brands including [[Virgin Group|Virgin]], [[Diet Coke]], [[hewlett-packard|HP]], [[Renault]] and [[Nintendo]].

Under Bishop's leadership, Espotting and MIVA have won a number of industry awards including 'Most Dynamic UK Media Company' (Media Momentum Awards), 'Fastest growing IT company' (Europe's 500 Awards) and 'Top 50 Creative Business' (''[[Financial Times]]'').

==''Millionaires' Mission''==
In 2007 Bishop featured in ''Millionairess' Mission'',&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt; a new [[Channel 4]] documentary in which eight British business leaders spend three weeks in a remote region of [[Uganda]], using Western entrepreneurial skills to try and bring sustainable relief from poverty to affected communities.

In the programme, Bishop helped create two businesses within the local communities – a farmer's co-operative and Teach Inn, an innovative eco-tourism hotel.

The first episode of the 4-part series aired on Channel 4 in the UK on 19 September 2007.&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

'''Sidney (or Sydney) Stanley''' (''né'' '''Solomon Wulkan''', alias '''Solomon Koszyski''',&lt;ref name="wb161"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''161&lt;/ref&gt; alias '''Stanley Rechtand''',&lt;ref name="WB136"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''136&lt;/ref&gt; later '''Schlomo ben Chaim'''&lt;ref name="WB246"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''246&lt;/ref&gt;) (1899/1905&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) at ''p.''63 claims that Stanley was 43 at the time of the tribunal but at ''pp''136–137 he suggests that he was 14 in 1913&lt;/ref&gt; – 1969) was a Polish ''émigré'' to the UK who became a dubious businessman of precarious ethics before claiming to be a ''contact man'', able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims that led to a great scandal and investigation by the [[Lynskey tribunal]] of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley [[espionage|spied]] against the UK for the armed nationalist activist [[Irgun]] organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a [[statelessness|stateless person]]. Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to [[France]] and thence to [[Israel]], where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

==Early life==
Stanley was the eldest son of twelve children born in Poland. He had emigrated to Britain with his father&lt;ref name="dispatch"&gt;Account of his wife, published in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' 30 January 1949, quoted in Wade Baron (1966), ''p.''237&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913,&lt;ref name="WB136"/&gt; the rest of the family following when the two had settled in [[Aldgate]].&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt; He later said he was born in [[Oświęcim]]. He was granted a [[Polish passport]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron 1966) ''p.''242&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a fairly ambiguous account of his early career but seems to have been employed from the age of 14 in garment sales and trading, especially in government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''136–137&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's name Koszyski.&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt;

He married his first wife Kate Zeitlin after World War I and the couple lived in [[Stoke Newington]] with Zeitlin's mother.&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt;

Stanley was made bankrupt in 1927, under the name Wulkan, and again in 1936, under the name Blotz.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''143&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deportation]] order was made against him in 1933 for [[conspiracy to defraud]]&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt; though he proved untraceable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''243&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting with Gibson==
According to Stanley, in 1946, he was returning by train from a business trip to [[Manchester]] when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of [[solo whist]] with some other men. He consequently met [[George Gibson (trade unionist)|George Gibson]], a director of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name="WB139"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''139&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''170&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson met Stanley several more times on the Manchester train before, in April 1947, running into him in the company of Marcus Wulkan, an American who had been involved in economic assistance to Britain during World War II and who was slightly known to Gibson. Stanley represented Wulkan as being his brother. Gibson invited the two to dinner, where they now met junior government minister [[John Belcher (politician)|John Belcher]], and after that Gibson visited Stanley's Park Lane home frequently.&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; At a subsequent dinner party attended by [[Morgan Phillips]] and four other [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, Stanley became involved in raising finance for the [[anti-communist]] "Freedom and Democracy" organisation,&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; though he appears to have done little more than donate a cheque for £50 which was dishonoured.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''180&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1946, Stanley approached fur-dealer Cyril Ross, the common acquaintance from the Manchester train, with a business proposition. Ross said that he would be interested in a multiple store such as J.&amp;nbsp;Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for flotation as a public company from the [[Capital Issues Committee]]. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.&amp;nbsp;Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1948, Gibson introduced [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] [[Glenvil Hall]] to Stanley, believing that Marcus Wulkan might be in a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government. At a dinner for Gibson on 23 March, Stanley ensured that he sat next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertaining Mr Belcher==
Belcher was keen to network with industrialists and was flattered by Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher use of a house that he had rented at [[Margate]] for the duration of the 1947 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in [[Cliftonville]] and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley pressed more and more gifts of food and wine, a gold cigarette-case and ultimately a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''23&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Minister of Works]] [[Charles Key]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''121&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people warned of Stanley's unreliability including [[Hugh Dalton]], [[Leonard Joseph Matchan]] and Morgan Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying==
In November 1947 an [[MI5]] report recorded that a man named "Stanley" had been passing information to Irgun from cabinet minister [[Manny Shinwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''360&lt;/ref&gt; Shinwell certainly knew Stanley whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the [[Transjordan Frontier Force]] from some government source.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;

==Football pools==
Harry Sherman was a director of [[Shermans Pools Ltd]] of [[Cardiff]], a [[football pools]] promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the [[Football Pool Promoters' Association]] and to leave the association to share it among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard,18 November 1947 adjournment debate 18 November 1947 (football pools reorganization)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the [[Board of Trade]] to start a [[prosecution]] against the company in January 1948. The [[magistrate]] who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have already discussed the paper problems with Sherman's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, D. "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Generous+Sherman+brothers+should+not+be+forgotten%3B+Time+to+remember.-a080221051|Generous Sherman brothers should not be forgotten; Time to remember]", ''South Wales Echo'', 19 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Stanley introduced Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman sought a public flotation of Shermans Ltd but needed the permission of the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher to stop by his Park Lane apartment. When he arrived he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the prosecution against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed that he had been routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the investigation could get under way, Sherman alleged that he had paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay [[GBP]]2,500 each to Belcher and Sir [[Frank Soskice]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 [[cheque]] made out to Lass &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''29&lt;/ref&gt; The cheque turned out to be a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''32&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt]] should be alerted and asked to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''33–34&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''36&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanley's arrest==
Jacob Harris was a supplier of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through [[service (law)|serving]] a bankruptcy notice on him and had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import [[pinball]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''72&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson to write letters of introduction for his wife, who was about to leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from [[HM Treasury]] foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to the possibility that he was about to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''178&lt;/ref&gt; 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''172&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was arrested on 18 October and held in [[Brixton Prison]]. Spartan though his surroundings were, he was able to order meals from a restaurant and pay another detainee for domestic duties.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''39–40&lt;/ref&gt; He was bailed on 21 October and returned to his Park Lane flat where his movements were restricted under the [[Aliens Order 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;SR&amp;O No.395. of 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribunal==
{{main|Lynskey tribunal}}
A tribunal was convened. Stanley, dapper in appearance, proved a self-important, self-aggrandising witness who amused the tribunal with his idiosyncratic, colourful, yet ambiguous and contradictory, responses to the questioning.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt; The tribunal found that Belcher and Gibson had acted improperly and they were fortunate to escape prosecution, gladly accepting the proffered alternative of resignation. [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] Sir [[Hartley Shawcross]] expressed the opinion that Stanley could not be prosecuted as the notoriety he gained from the tribunal would inhibit a [[fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''232&lt;/ref&gt; The spying allegations were not raised in the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''362&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the tribunal==
On 23 December, Stanley applied for cancellation of his deportation order but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 225&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Gibson and Belcher were resigning in disgrace, Stanley and his wife were enjoying their notoriety and celebrity, attending the [[Chelsea Arts Ball]] at New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 3 February 1949, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] expressed the government view that Stanley should be deported as the deportation would be "conducive to the public good". Attlee was probably principally motivated by the spying allegations and Stanley's Zionist connections.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.'' 362&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the deportation order, the British government found that it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since [[World War II]], the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced that he would not be allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a [[statelessness|stateless person]], and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19490217&amp;id=BwIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-SMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3967,3950397 Britain Has Its Hands Full in Ousting of Stateless Man], February 17, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1949, Stanley applied for [[Israel]]i nationality. On 13 February, his application was rejected on the grounds that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' attacked Stanley as a Jew who "suddenly discovered his love for [[Zion]]" when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19490212&amp;id=14Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162,3671203 Jew Threatens to Sue to Get Into Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was still required daily to report to police but reported for the last time on 1 April and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to [[Ramsgate]], where a personal friend took him by sea to a port near [[Boulogne]] in France, possibly [[Dunkirk]]. He was taken from there by car to [[Abbeville]]. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of [[Passover]] as "an act of grace and mercy". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to [[Marseilles]], where he boarded the Israeli ship ''Atzmaut''. On 9 May, he arrived in [[Haifa]] aboard the ''Atzmaut'' together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now '''Shlomo Ben-Chaim'''. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a "psychological case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19490513&amp;id=RB0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1590,1891857 Stanley Outstays His Welcome in Tel Aviv]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 244–250&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19690526&amp;id=VZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6215,4192005 Death of Sidney Stanley recalls 1949 scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term loan''' is a monetary [[loan]] that is repaid in regular payments over a set period of time. Term loans usually last between one and ten years, but may last as long as 30 years in some cases. A term loan usually involves an unfixed [[interest rate]] that will add additional balance to be repaid.

==Usage==
Term loans can be given on an individual basis, but are often used for [[small business]] loans. The ability to repay over a long period of time is attractive for new or expanding enterprises, as the assumption is that they will increase their [[profit (accounting)|profit]] over time. Term loans are a good way of quickly increasing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] in order to raise a business’ supply capabilities or range. For instance, some new companies may use a term loan to buy company vehicles or rent more space for their operations.

===Considerations===
One thing to consider when getting a term loan is whether the interest rate is [[Fixed interest rate loan|fixed]] or [[Floating interest rate|floating]]. A fixed interest rate means that the percentage of interest will never increase, regardless of the financial market. Low-interest periods are usually an excellent time to take out a fixed rate loan. Floating interest rates will fluctuate with the market, which can be good or bad  for you depending on what happens with the global and national economy. Since some term loans last for 10 years, betting that the rate will stay consistently low is a real risk.

Also, consider whether the term loan you are looking at uses [[compound interest]]. If it does, the amount of interest will be periodically added to the [[Principal sum|principal]] borrowed amount, meaning that the interest keeps getting higher the longer the term lasts. If the loan does use compound interest, check to see if there are any penalties for early repayment of the loan. If you get a [[windfall gain|windfall]] or profits increase spectacularly, you may be able to pay off your entire balance before it is due, preventing you from paying additional interest by waiting for the loan term to end.

Some loaning institutions offer a variety of repayment plans for your term loan. Commonly, you may choose to pay off your debt in even amounts, or the amount you pay will gradually increase over the loan period. If you expect that you will be more financially able to repay in the future, causing an incremental increase may help you and save you interest. If you are unsure of your future monetary position, even payments may help prevent [[Default (finance)|defaulting]] on the loan if things go badly.

Choosing a term loan may be in your best interest, depending on your circumstances. Beware of extremely long repayment periods, as generally speaking, the longer the term, the more you will owe because the interest accrues over a long period of time. For more information, contact a [[financial advisor]] or speak to your bank about loan options they provide.

'''''The Big Short''''' is a 2015 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Adam McKay]] and written by McKay and [[Charles Randolph]], based on the 2010 book ''[[The Big Short|The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]] about the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] which was triggered by the [[United States housing bubble]].&lt;ref name="McKay" /&gt; The film stars [[Christian Bale]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Hamish Linklater]], [[John Magaro]], [[Rafe Spall]], [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]], [[Finn Wittrock]], and [[Marisa Tomei]].

The film is noted for the unconventional techniques it employs to explain complex [[financial instrument]]s. Among others, it features [[cameo appearance]]s by actress [[Margot Robbie]], chef [[Anthony Bourdain]], singer-songwriter [[Selena Gomez]], and economist [[Richard Thaler]], who break the [[fourth wall]] to explain concepts such as [[Subprime lending|subprime mortgages]] and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s as a [[meta-reference]].&lt;ref name="MPilot" /&gt; Several other actors directly address the audience, most frequently Gosling, who serves as the narrator.

The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 11, 2015, followed by a [[wide release]] on December 23 by [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paramount pushes 'The Big Short' into awards season|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-bc-us--film-the-big-short-20150922-story.html|agency=Associated Press|date = September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Big Short {{!}} Trailer &amp; Movie Site {{!}} December 2015|url = http://www.thebigshortmovie.com/|website = The Big Short|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a commercial success, grossing $133 million against a $50 million budget. The film was also highly praised by critics, with many highlighting the cast's performances (particularly Bale, Carell and Gosling), McKay's direction and the screenplay. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] in addition to nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Bale), and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

==Plot==
The film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|2007 housing market crash]].

'''Michael Burry'''

In 2005, eccentric [[hedge fund]] manager [[Michael Burry]] discovers that the United States [[housing market]] is [[Economic bubble|extremely unstable]], being based on high-risk [[Subprime lending|subprime loans]]. Anticipating the market's collapse in Q2 2007, as interest rates would rise from [[adjustable-rate mortgages]], he proposes to create a [[credit default swap]] market, allowing him to bet against market-based [[mortgage backed securities|mortgage-backed securities]], for profit.

His long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks, but as it requires paying substantial monthly [[Insurance|premiums]], it sparks his clients' vocal unhappiness, believing he is "wasting" [[Capital asset|capital]]. Many demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors. Eventually, [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|the market collapses]] and his fund's value increases by 489% with an overall profit of over $2.69 billion.

'''FrontPoint Partners and Jared Vennett'''

[[Deutsche Bank]] salesman Jared Vennett is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap. Using his [[quantitative analyst|quant]] to verify that Burry is likely correct, he decides to enter the market, earning a fee on selling the swaps to firms who will profit when the underlying bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts FrontPoint hedge fund manager [[Steve Eisman|Mark Baum]], who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models. FrontPoint begins buying swaps after a field investigation in South Florida. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) rated at [[Bond credit rating#Credit rating tiers|AAA ratings]] will guarantee their eventual collapse.

In Florida the FrontPoint team discovers that [[mortgage broker]]s are profiting by selling their mortgage deals to [[Wall Street]] banks, who pay higher margins for the riskier mortgages, creating the bubble. In early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and [[Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies]] from an acquaintance at [[Standard &amp; Poor's]]. Baum's employees question Vennett's motives, yet he maintains his position and invites Baum and company to the [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association|American Securitization Forum]] in [[Las Vegas]]. Interviewed by Baum, CDO manager Wing Chau, on behalf of an investment bank, describes how [[synthetic CDO]]s create chains of increasingly large bets on faulty loans – up to 20 times as much money as the loans themselves. Baum horrifyingly realizes that the fraud will completely collapse the global economy. He purchases as much as possible, profiting at the banks' expense and waits until the last minute to sell. Baum's fund reaches $1 billion, and he laments that the banks won't accept blame for the crisis.

'''Brownfield Capital'''

Young investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley accidentally discover a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] by Vennett, convincing them to invest in swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Below the capital threshold for an [[ISDA Master Agreement]] required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of retired [[Security (finance)|securities]] trader Ben Rickert. When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the Forum, learning that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity. They successfully make even more profit than other hedge funds by shorting the higher-rated AA mortgage securities, as they were considered highly stable and carried a much higher payout ratio.

Geller and Shipley are initially ecstatic, but Rickert is disgusted, citing the impending collapse and its effects; when unemployment goes up 1%, 40,000 people will die. Furthermore, they realize the banks and the ratings agency are maintaining the value of their CDOs in order to sell and short them before the inevitable crash. Horrified, they try to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud but nobody believes them. As the market starts collapsing, Ben, on vacation in England, sells their swaps. Ultimately, they make a profit of $80 million, with their faith in the system broken.

'''Epilogue'''

Jared Vennett makes $47 million in commissions selling off the swaps. Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continues to operate their fund. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after unsuccessfully trying to sue the ratings agencies, with Charlie moving to [[Charlotte]] to start a family, and Jamie still running the fund. Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement. Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS [[audits]], now only investing in water commodities. The banks responsible for the crisis escape any consequences for their actions. It is noted that as of 2015, banks are selling CDOs again under a new label: "[[Bespoke portfolio (CDO)|Bespoke Tranche Opportunity]]".

===Development===
In 2013, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] acquired the rights to the 2010 non-fiction book ''[[The Big Short|The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]], to develop it into a film, which [[Brad Pitt]]'s [[Plan B Entertainment]] would produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title='Anchorman's' Adam McKay Boards Financial Drama|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/adam-mckay-big-short-brad-pitt-1201144582/|accessdate=April 18, 2015|work=variety.com|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, 2014, [[Adam McKay]] was hired to write and direct a film about the housing and [[economic bubble]].&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news|title=Paramount Taps 'Anchorman' Helmer Adam McKay To Adapt And Direct Michael Lewis' 'The Big Short' About Economic Meltdown|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/adam-mckay-big-short-movie-michael-lews-703473/|accessdate=April 18, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter [[Charles Randolph]], who co-wrote the film with McKay, said one of the first challenges was finding the right tone for the film. He told ''Creative Screenwriting'', "In general it was trying to find the right tone that was slightly funnier than your average [[Miloš Forman]] comedy, which is all grounded character-based but not so satirical where you got ''[[Wag the Dog]].'' Somewhere between there was what I was shooting for. Once I got the tone down, then I went through the plot. The market's movements provided you with an underlying plot. You make your short deal, then the bank is trying to squeeze you out, and then it all breaks loose.  So that was pretty easy, and it provided character arcs against that."&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/banking-on-the-big-short/|title=Banking on The Big Short|last=Hogan|first=Brianne|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after Randolph wrote his draft, McKay, as director, rewrote Randolph's screenplay. It was McKay's idea to include the celebrity cameos in the film to explain the financial concepts.&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt;

The success of this film is due to the work of the actors who played the characters.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2015_12_23"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/upshot/what-the-big-short-gets-right-and-wrong-about-the-housing-bubble.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur | title=What 'The Big Short' Gets Right, and Wrong, About the Housing Bubble | work=New York Times | date=December 23, 2015 | accessdate=December 27, 2015 | author=Irwin, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie critics with backgrounds in finance also commented on the film. Many agreed with the public that ''The Big Short'' was entertaining and engaging, but also terrifying. [[Glenn Kenny]] reported that the film accurately got the message across even though the lives of the characters were not interconnected, their stories were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-big-short-2015|title=The Big Short Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2015) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Kenny|first=Glenn|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Eisman, who is portrayed as Mark Baum in the film, said that he respects Carell's portrayal but that it was not 100 percent true to his real character. Eisman told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that he felt his character was too funny. Instead of having a sense of humor, he felt that his character should have been angry all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/invest-like-a-legend-the-skeptic-steve-eisman/article28378668/|title=Invest like a legend: Steve Eisman|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Second Bounce of the Ball: Turning Risk into Opportunity'''''  is a [[non-fiction]] book about [[entrepreneurship]], written by [[Sir Ronald Cohen]] and first published in 2007 by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, [[London]]. The book discusses what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, and contains biographical anecdotes from the author and the company he founded, [[Apax Partners]].  The book’s title comes from Cohen’s incorrect belief that the [[Coefficient of restitution|second bounce of a ball]] is difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldcohen.net/|title=Ronald Cohen|accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914000945/http://www.ronaldcohen.net/|archivedate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
The book received positive reviews among the business literary critics. Robert Lenzner, editor of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, refers to Cohen as a modern-day version of [[Georges Doriot]], one of the first American [[venture capitalists]]. In his review, he highlights the biographical aspect of the book, saying that it "is at bottom about how Cohen progressed from boutique [[investment banker]] earning fees on each transaction to the risky business of financing start-up companies, and from there to the more solidly rewarding [[buyout]] or [[private equity]] business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/05/15/croesus-chronicles-doriot-oped-cz_rl_0516croesus.html?feed=rss_author|title=True Blue Gents Of Finance|last=Lenzner|first=Robert|date=May 16, 2008|work=Forbes|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Guthrie, from the [[Financial Times]], disagrees. He says that the book "is not an autobiography. But it is one of the best books written on entrepreneurship in recent years." In the review, he stated that some of the advice provided in the book can be found in other business [[self-help book]]s, but says that Sir Ronald's "analysis of entrepreneurship is broader and subtler than in most titles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=the+second+bounce+of+the+ball&amp;aje=true&amp;id=071112000052&amp;ct=0&amp;nclick_check=1|title=The trick is to stay ahead of the game|last=Guthrie|first=Jonathan|date=November 12, 2007 |publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6208">"'''The Use of Knowledge in Society'''" is a scholarly article written by economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], first published in the September 1945 issue of ''[[The American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519–530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/hayek.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519–530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society - F. A. Hayek|date=1 May 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written (along with ''The Meaning of Competition'') as a rebuttal to fellow [[economist]] [[Oskar R. Lange]] and his endorsement of a [[planned economy]], it was included among the twelve essays in Hayek's 1948 compendium ''[[Individualism and Economic Order]]''.&lt;ref name="hayek book"&gt;{{cite book | title=Individualism and Economic Order| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5BJcBHuvrsMC&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1#PPP1,M1| last=Hayek| first=F. A.| year=1996| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago| isbn=0-226-32093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument ==
Hayek's article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the dynamic and organic nature of market [[price|price-fluctuations]], and the benefits of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="book1"/&gt; He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the [[free market|open market]] because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society.&lt;ref name="kauffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.kauffman.org/cwp/appmanager/research/researchDesktop;jsessionid=GVJKUmhZQ8YdcdEwB2DGgQxpdz26X7E3ZO8TfnqSZE7nuSIAUScJ!973872261?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=research_resourceDetail&amp;keep=all&amp;id=Research/Resource/Journal_Article_2848.htm&amp;_nfls=false |title=The use of knowledge in society (abstract)|accessdate=2007-10-05|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hayek's words, "The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction."  The article also discusses the concepts of 'individual equilibrium' and of Hayek's notion of the divide between information which is useful and practicable versus that which is purely scientific or theoretical.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Menger and his legacy in economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir0g_PW5lAYC&amp;pg=PA393 |editor=Bruce J. Caldwell |year=1990 |pages=392–95 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-1087-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
"The Use of Knowledge in Society" was a sensation among economists, setting off a train of work in the economics of information and other areas, including the work of a number of future Nobel Prize winners, as noted by Nobel winner [[Leonid Hurwicz]]. UCLA economist [[Armen Alchian]] remembers the excitement of reading Hayek's essay and stopping fellow economists in the hallway to ask if they had read Hayek's essay. In 2011 "The Use of Knowledge in Society" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the ''American Economic Review'' during its first 100 years.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{Citation|last1=Arrow|first1=Kenneth J.|last2=Bernheim|first2=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">A [[company (law)|company]] is said to be '''thinly capitalised''' when the level of its debt is much greater than its [[equity capital]], i.e. its [[Gearing (finance)|gearing]], or leverage, is very high. An entity's debt-to-equity funding is sometimes expressed as a ratio. For example, a gearing ratio of 1.5:1 means that for every $2 of equity the entity has $3 of debt. 

A high gearing ratio can create problems for:
* creditors, which bear the solvency risk of the company, and
* revenue authorities, which are concerned about excessive interest claims.

==Credit risk==
If the shareholders have introduced only a nominal amount of paid-up [[share capital]], then the company has lower financial reserves with which to meet its obligations. If all or most of the company's capital comes from debt, which (unlike equity) needs to be serviced, and ultimately repaid, it means that the providers of capital are ultimately competing with the company's trade creditors for the same capital resources.

In general, most common law countries tend not to employ thin capitalisation rules in relation to [[Capital requirement|raising and maintenance of capital]]. However, a number of civil law jurisdictions do.

However, in almost all jurisdictions there are certain types of regulated entity which require a certain amount, or a certain proportion, of paid-up share capital to be licensed to trade. The most common examples of this are [[bank]]s and [[insurance company|insurance companies]]. This is because if such companies were to fail and go into [[liquidation]] the economic effect of such failures can lead to a [[domino effect]], which can have catastrophic consequences for other businesses and, ultimately, national economies.

==Tax issues==
Even where countries’ corporate laws permit companies to be thinly capitalised, revenue authorities in those countries will often limit the amount that a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest, particularly when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (e.g. from connected parties). However, some countries simply disallow interest deductions above a certain level from all sources when the company is considered to be too highly geared under applicable tax regulations.

Some tax authorities limit the applicability of thin capitalisation rules to corporate groups with foreign entities to avoid “tax leakage” to other jurisdictions. The United States “earnings stripping” rules are an example. Hong Kong protects tax revenue by prohibiting payers from claiming tax deductions for interest paid to foreign entities, thus eliminating the possibility of using thin capitalisation to shift income to a lower-tax jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/pdf/e_dipn13a.pdf Profits tax: Deductibility of interest expense]. Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department, Departmental Interpretation and Practise Notes #13A. December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thin capitalisation rules''' determine how much of the interest paid on corporate debt is deductible for tax purposes. Such rules are of interest to [[Financial Sponsor|private-equity firm]]s, which use significant amounts of debt to finance [[leveraged buyout]]s, and in the context of strategic acquisitions, where the purchaser wishes to push debt into higher taxed countries with significant pre-tax income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2004/nz4664.php Article on thin capitalisation rules on AltAssets.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930123139/http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2004/nz4664.php |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Wilson Corcoran''' (December 27, 1798 &amp;ndash; February 24, 1888) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], [[philanthropist]], and [[art collector]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He founded the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title='Tragedy of Errors' Engulfs the Corcoran |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/18/arts/tragedy-of-errors-engulfs-the-corcoran.html |quote=It was founded in 1869 by William Wilson Corcoran, and its permanent collection of 19th-century American art is said to be one of the best in the nation |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 18, 1989 |accessdate=2014-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William Corcoran, full-length portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|William Corcoran in 1867]]
Corcoran was born on December 27, 1798 in [[Georgetown, Washington, DC|Georgetown]] in the [[District of Columbia]]. He was one of 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity, born to [[Thomas Corcoran (mayor)|Thomas Corcoran]] (1754–1830), a well-to-do merchant twice elected as mayor of Georgetown, and Hannah Lemmon (1765–1823). His father was born in Ireland, settled in Georgetown in 1788, and established a leather business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Old Georgetown |year=1933 |publisher=Garrett &amp; Massie, Inc. |author=Ecker, Grace Dunlop |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Corcoran was raised in Georgetown where he studied classics and mathematics at local private schools run by Alexander Kirk and the Reverend Addison Belt, and also took classes for a year at Georgetown College, the predecessor of [[Georgetown University]]. Instead of finishing his education, he joined the family business and developed a successful business career.

==Career==
Corcoran entered business at the age of 17, working in dry goods store owned by two brothers, and opened his own branch store two years later. Corcoran brothers established a wholesale auction and commission business, but their ventures failed after the [[Panic of 1819]]. He worked in another family business,&lt;ref name="ecker126"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Old Georgetown |year=1933 |publisher=Garrett &amp; Massie, Inc. |author=Ecker, Grace Dunlop |pages=126–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1828, he took control of large amount of real estate from his father.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art Treasures of Washington: An Account of the Corcoran Gallery of Art |author=Henderson, Helen Weston |year=1915 |publisher=L. C. Page &amp; Company |pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corcoran was employed as a clerk at the Bank of Columbia at Georgetown branch, and then as a real estate and loan manager at the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in Washington.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;Janet L. Coryell. [http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-00335.html Corcoran, William Wilson]. ''American National Biography Online''. February 2000. Retrieved December 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, Corcoran established a brokerage firm on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] at 15th Street. He was successful and in 1840 entered into a partnership with [[George Washington Riggs]], a son of [[Elisha Riggs]]. The Corcoran and Riggs private banking firm enjoyed the patronage of Treasury Secretary [[Levi Woodbury]] and prospered after it re-sold to investors $5 million of U.S. Treasury notes in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chevychasetrust.com/blog/index.php/tag/bank-of-columbia/ Chevy Chase Trust Company and Its Heritage – Part 1: From Corcoran to Riggs]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, it purchased the former Second Bank of the United States building located on 15th Street at [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]].&lt;ref name="ecker126"/&gt;

In Spring 1847, the ''Corcoran and Riggs'' sold to investors at home and abroad the bulk of two issues of the U.S. Treasury [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] bonds; Corcoran's earnings were $1 million. In 1854, Corcoran retired from ''Corcoran and Riggs'' to focus on his investments in real estate, land grants, armaments, railroads, as well as pursue pleasure and philanthropic endeavors.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

===Philanthropy===
In 1854, after his retirement, he devoted himself and his substantial fortune to art and [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt;  In 1848, Corcoran had purchased 15 acres (6 ha) of land for [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]], which overlooks [[Rock Creek Park]].  He organized the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to oversee the cemetery, which was formally incorporated by [[Act of Congress]] on March 3, 1849.  Corcoran paid for the construction of a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] chapel in Oak Hill Cemetery, commonly known as the [[Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel (Washington, D.C.)|Renwick Chapel]].&lt;ref name=chronicles&gt;{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Richard Plummer | title = The Chronicles of Georgetown, D.C., from 1751-1878 | publisher = R. O. Polkinhorn | location = Washington, D.C. | year = 1878 | pages = 264&amp;ndash;268 | oclc = 2276711 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VFUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Oak+Hill+Cemetery%22+%22Georgetown%22 | accessdate = July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corcoran also established a $10,000 fund, administered by the Benevolent Society, to purchase firewood for the poor in Georgetown. Corcoran also gave many gifts to several universities, including [[The George Washington University]], the [[Maryland Agricultural College]], the [[College of William and Mary]], and [[Washington and Lee University]].  Corcoran also contributed to a fund to purchase [[George Washington]]'s [[Mount Vernon]] estate, after his family could no longer keep it up, and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] refused to purchase it.&lt;ref name="ecker126"/&gt; One of William Wilson Corcoran's longtime business associate and friend was the renowned [[George Peabody]].

===Art===
[[File:William Wilson Corcoran, by William Oliver Stone.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait by [[William Oliver Stone]]]]
In contrast to many contemporary art patrons, Corcoran was not exclusively interested in European works, and he assembled one of the first important collections of [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref name="drum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capital and Culture: William Wilson Corcoran and the Making of Nineteenth-Century America|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/16525|website=drum.lib.umd.edu|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1850s his pictures and sculpture were overflowing his [[mansion]] on [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] and he  hired the foremost [[architect]] of the day, James Renwick, to build a picture gallery in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. Before it was ready, however, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, and Corcoran, a Southern sympathizer, left Washington for [[Paris]], where his son-in-law, [[George Eustis Jr.]], was a representative of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

Architect James Renwick was commissioned in 1859 to a museum building to house William Wilson Corcoran’s growing art collection.  Corcoran was a southern sympathizer and good friend of Robert E. Lee, and felt it opportune to leave for Europe during the Civil War. The half-finished building designed by Renwick was taken over by the U.S. Government and used as a supply depot. When the war was over, Corcoran returned to Washington; the building was finished in 1869 and the Corcoran Gallery of Art opened in 1874, but the structure was soon outgrown. A new building for the Corcoran Gallery of Art and its nascent school of art (now the Corcoran College of Art + Design) was designed by American architect Ernest Flagg in the Beaux-Arts Style and completed in 1897, nine years after Corcoran’s death. The façade of the building reflects the “Neo-Grec,” an offshoot of the Beaux-Arts style that attempted to reflect the functions of the building by revealing detailed and decorative accents on the exterior. The Corcoran’s first home is now the Renwick Gallery, a Smithsonian museum.&lt;ref name="siarchives"&gt;{{cite web|title=William Wilson Corcoran|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_6068|website=siarchives.si.edu|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corcoran made many other important bequests to the people of Washington, among them the [[Louise Home for Women]], several departments of the Columbian University (now the [[George Washington University]]), and the land and half the construction costs for what is now the [[Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes]]. Corcoran was also the President of the Corporation of Columbian (George Washington) University. Early in 1883, Corcoran arranged to have the body of [[John Howard Payne]] returned to the United States, an expense he personally bore. Payne, actor, poet, and author of "[[Home! Sweet Home!]]" had been the United States Consul to the [[Bey]] of [[Tunis]] in 1852 and had died there. Payne had been good friends of Corcoran and his business partner, George W. Riggs in 1850, prior to Payne's second appointment as Consul to Tunis.&lt;ref name="Brainard"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1835, Corcoran eloped and married Louise Morris (1818–1840), who was the daughter of Commodore [[Charles Morris (naval officer)|Charles Morris]] (1784–1856) and the older sister of [[Robert Murray Morris]] (1824–1896).  Before his wife's early death on November 21, 1840, they had three children, however, only one survived into adulthood:&lt;ref name="ecker126"/&gt;

* Harriet Louise Corcoran (1836–1837), who died in infancy.
* Louise Morris Corcoran (1838–1867), who married [[George Eustis, Jr.]] (1828–1872) in 1859.&lt;ref name="whitehousehistory"/&gt;
* Charles Morris Corcoran (1840–1841), who also died in infancy.

After his wife died in 1840, Corcoran chose not to marry again. He died on February 24, 1888 in [[Washington, DC]] and is buried in [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=A Philanthropist's Death.

Corcoran joined the Potomac Lodge No. 5 of [[Freemasonry#North America|Free and Accepted Masons]] in Georgetown and was raised as a Master Mason on July 26, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[http://potomac5.org/gavel_today.php Potomac Lodge #5: The Gavel Today], ''The Masons of Gergetown''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planning.dc.gov/planning/frames.asp?doc=/planning/lib/planning/New_Inventory_Sep_2004.pdf District of Columbia list of historic sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130074837/http://planning.dc.gov/planning/frames.asp?doc=%2Fplanning%2Flib%2Fplanning%2FNew_Inventory_Sep_2004.pdf |date=2009-01-30 }}, ''DC.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants===
Through his surviving daughter Louise, he was the grandfather of [[William Corcoran Eustis]] (1862–1921)&lt;ref name="WCEObit1921"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01EFD9113CE533A25756C2A9679D946095D6CF |title=Wm.

===Legacy===
The bank Corcoran co-founded in 1840 existed as [[Riggs Bank]] up until 2005, when it was taken over by [[PNC Bank]]. The [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. was one of the oldest American private museums focusing on American art until it was dissolved in 2014 with its holdings transferred to the [[National Gallery of Art]]. Corcoran has a street named after him in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood in the [[District of Columbia]] between Q street and R street NW, one block away from Riggs Street.  As well, the Corcoron neighborhood in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] which is bounded by East Lake Street to the north, East 36th Street to the south, Hiawatha Avenue to the east, and Cedar Avenue to the west, is named for William Corcoran.

'''Workforce productivity''' is the amount of [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that a [[worker]] produces in a given amount of time. It is one of several types of [[productivity]] that [[economics|economists]] measure. Workforce productivity, often referred to as '''[[Productivity#Labor productivity|labor productivity]]''', is a measure for an organization or company, a process, an industry, or a country.

Workforce productivity is to be distinguished from [[employee productivity]] which is a measure employed at ''individual level'' based on the assumption that the overall productivity can be broken down to increasingly smaller units until, ultimately, to the individual employee, in order be used for example for the purpose of allocating a benefit or sanction based on individual performance (see also: [[Vitality curve]]).

In 2002, the [[OECD]] defined it as "the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input".&lt;ref&gt;OECD Manual: ''Measuring Productivity; Measurement of Aggregate and Industry-Level Productivity Growth''. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Volume measures of output are normally [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) or [[gross value added]] (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for [[inflation]]. The three most commonly used measures of input are:

# workforce jobs; and
# number of people in employment.

== Measurement ==
Workforce productivity can be measured in 2 ways, in physical terms or in price terms.
* the intensity of labour-effort, and the quality of labour effort generally.
* the creative activity involved in producing technical innovations.
* the relative efficiency gains resulting from different systems of management, organization, co-ordination or engineering.
* the productive effects of some forms of labour on other forms of labour.

These aspects of productivity refer to the ''qualitative'' dimensions of labour input. If an organization is using labour much more intensely, one can assume it's due to greater labour productivity, since the output per labour-effort may be the same. This insight becomes particularly important when a large part of what is produced in an economy consists of services. Management may be very preoccupied with the productivity of employees, but the productivity gains of management itself is very difficult to prove. While labor productivity growth has been seen as a useful barometer of the U.S. economy’s performance, recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008–2009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp694.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''The Labor Productivity Puzzle'', May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of international comparisons of labour productivity can be limited by a number of measurement issues. The comparability of output measures can be negatively affected by the use of different valuations, which define the inclusion of taxes, margins, and costs, or different deflation indexes, which turn current output into constant output.&lt;ref&gt;International Labor Comparisons Program [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/prod4.pdf International comparisons of manufacturing productivity and unit labor costs trends].

The preferred conversion factors are [[Purchasing Power Parity|Purchasing Power Parities]], but their accuracy can be negatively influenced by the limited representativeness of the goods and services compared and different aggregation methods.&lt;ref&gt;International Labor Comparisons Program [http://www.bls.gov/fls/flsgdp.pdf International comparisons of GDP per capita and per employed person]. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate international comparisons of labor productivity, a number of organizations, such as the [[OECD#Statistics|OECD]], the [http://www.ggdc.net/ Groningen Growth Centre], [[Division of international labor comparisons|International Labor Comparisons Program]], and The Conference Board, prepare productivity data adjusted specifically to enhance the data’s international comparability.

In a survey of manufacturing growth and performance in Britain and Mauritius, it was found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"The factors affecting labour productivity or the performance of individual work roles are of broadly the same type as those that affect the performance of manufacturing firms as a whole. They include: (1) physical-organic, location, and technological factors; (2) cultural belief-value and individual attitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors; (3) international influences – e.g. levels of innovativeness and efficiency on the part of the owners and managers of inward investing foreign companies; (4) managerial-organizational and wider economic and political-legal environments; (5) levels of flexibility in internal labour markets and the organization of work activities – e.g. the presence or absence of traditional craft demarcation lines and barriers to occupational entry; and (6) individual rewards and payment systems, and the effectiveness of personnel managers and others in recruiting, training, communicating with, and [[Employee motivation|performance-motivating employees]] on the basis of pay and other incentives."&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;''Manufacturing In Britain: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Growth &amp; Performance'', ISR/Google Books, revised 3rd edition. 2003, page 58. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-30-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=z_xxhBtL8uAC]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was further found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"The emergence of computers has been noted as a significant factor in increasing labor productivity in the late 1990s, by some, and as an insignificant factor by others, such as R.J. Gordon. Although computers have existed for most of the 20th century, some economic researchers have noted a lag in productivity growth caused by computers that didn't come until the late 1990s."&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt;
