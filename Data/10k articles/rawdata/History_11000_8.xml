'''Aleksander Ludwik Birkenmajer''' (8 July 1890 – 30 September 1967) was a Polish historian of [[exact sciences]] and [[philosophy]], bibliologist, professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] and of the [[Warsaw University]].

==Biography==

He was the son of astronomer and historian of science Ludwik Antoni Birkenmajer. Aleksander was educated in Chernikhov and in the [[Zakład Naukowo-Wychowawczy Ojców Jezuitów w Chyrowie|Jesuit high school]] in Chyrow. In 1908-1912 he studied [[classical philology]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[history]] at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. In 1914 defended there his PhD thesis based on the monograph about [[Henri Bate de Malines]] as an astronomer and philosopher of the 13th century, and annotated to him, Critics of the King Alphons tables ([[Alfonsine tables]]). The dissertation was prepared under the supervision of [[Władysław Natanson]]. During the studies he also worked in the Jagiellonian Astronomical Observatory. Since 1919 he cooperated with the [[Jagiellonian Library]], where in 1924 he became a curator of the Department of Manuscripts and Old Prints. After presenting and defending of the next monograph on the Renaissance of mathematical and natural sciences in the Middle Ages he became a professor and the head of the History of Exact Sciences Department of the University in Kraków. In 1938 he became a full [[extraordinary professor]]. But earlier in 1931 he resigned the post in the History of Exact Sciences Department to protest against the lack of activity of the Polish Ministry of Religious Denominations and Public Instruction and the Jagiellonian University authorities, because of their absence of endeavors to develop Polish science.

In November 1939 he was arrested and imprisoned in the [[KZ Sachsenhausen]] during the [[Sonderaktion Krakau]]. Released in the autumn of 1940 he got back to the library as a simple librarian,&lt;ref&gt;Olszewska B., Dobrzycki J., Kurdziałek M., Róziewicz J., Aleksander Birkenmajer 1890-1967, ,,Kwartalnik Historii Nauki i Techniki", 1968, nr 1, p. 107-126.&lt;/ref&gt; and struggled to save and secure the collections during the war. In the midst of 1944 he was fired from Library, because some valuable manuscripts - previously destined to be sent to [[Nazi Germany]] - had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he was simultaneously the director of the [[Jagiellonian Library]] and the [[University of Poznan]] Library, till 1947. In 1951 he became an [[ordinary professor]] of [[Warsaw University]], and the head of the [[Endowed chair|Bibliology Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40323965, Marek Sroka, "Bibliologist or Information Specialist? Library Education in Poland after 1989", Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, Vol. 43, No.  3 (Summer, 2002), pp. 214-222. Publisher: Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE), Article DOI: 10.2307/40323965&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the organizers of the future [[Institute for the History of Science, Polish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1954-1966 he conducted its Section of the History of Mathematical, Physico-Chemical and Geological-Geographical Sciences in the Department of the History of Science and Technology of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], as well as was the president of its Academic Counsel.

==Scientific output==

Birkenmajer prepared the first edition of the ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1953). He studied also a scientific output of [[Witelo]], revealed the authorship of the opus Philosophia Pauperum of [[Saint Albert the Great]], he studies [[Aristotle]]. He became quickly a renown international expert in the field of research of Copernicus and Aristotle' heritage. He was member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] in Kraków (1936), International Academy of the History of Science (1935), and its vice-president in 1959-1965, and also a member of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in London, and a member of the Association of Czech Librarians in [[Prague]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13435">In the first decade of the 21st century, a paragraph alleged to come from a 1956 interview of [[Ariel Sharon]], conducted by an [[Israel Defense Forces]] general named Ouze Merham, was quoted in a number of publications. The paragraph advocates burning Palestinian children and raping Palestinian women and Arab girls, as well as Sharon claiming to have killed 750 Palestinian civilians during the [[Suez Crisis]]. The interview, the paragraph, and the existence of Ouze Merham himself have been denounced as fabrications. In 1956 Sharon, who later became [[Prime Minister of Israel]], was a [[major]] in the IDF.

==The alleged interview==
According to the allegations, Sharon was interviewed by a general named Ouze Merham about his service in the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], and said the following:

{{quote|“I don’t know something called International Principles. I vow that I’ll burn every Palestinian child (that) will be born in this area. The Palestinian woman and child is more dangerous than the man, because the Palestinian child’s existence infers that generations will go on, but the man causes limited danger. I vow that if I was just an Israeli civilian and I met a Palestinian I would burn him and I would make him suffer before killing him. With one hit I’ve killed 750 Palestinians (in Rafah in 1956). I wanted to encourage my soldiers by raping Arabic girls as the Palestinian women is a slave for Jews, and we do whatever we want to her and nobody tells us what we shall do but we tell others what they shall do.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/node/220313 The old will die and the young will forget: David Ben Gurion | Arab News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Media usage==
The disputed quotation was published by a number of media outlets and websites in the [[Muslim world]] and elsewhere in conjunction with [[anti-Israel]] commentary, including on [[IslamOnline]];&lt;ref name="IO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/News/2002-04/01/article14.shtml |title=I Don't Know Something Called International Principles: Sharon |accessdate=2008-03-24 |date=April 1, 2002 |work=News |publisher=[[Islam Online]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021192348/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2002-04/01/article14.shtml |archivedate=October 21, 2006 }}

Retrieved March 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As'ad Abdul Rahman, chairman of the ''[[Palestinian Encyclopedia]],'' used the quote as his [[News style#Terms and structure|lede]] for an opinion piece about alleged Jewish control of the world media in the ''[[Gulf News]]'' of December 4, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = The latest furor erupted after the newspaper published a letter to the editor last month in which a student claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon once said he wanted to 'burn every Palestinian child.' Although the quote has been widely disseminated, Jewish groups say there is no evidence Sharon ever made the statement. Wednesday, the paper's editors apologized for running the 'inaccurate information.' What's most disturbing, some said, is the same quote appeared in an opinion piece by student columnist Mariam Sobh last year. In the spring, Sobh admitted the quote was false and apologized.

According to the [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] (CAMERA, a pro-Israel media research group), there is no record of any Israeli general named "Ouze Merham" existing, nor any record of Sharon giving such an interview in 1956.&lt;ref name = "JH-Camera"&gt;Hollander, Ricki. [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_print=1&amp;x_article=766&amp;x_context=2 "Exposing False Zionist Quotes (Quote Busters)"], [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]], October 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear why an Israeli general would interview Sharon (who, at the time, was only a major), and then publish the interview.&lt;ref name=camera20040324&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=22&amp;x_article=651 "Anti-Israel Venom at University of Illinois Paper"], [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]], March 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; CAMERA has also stated that the quote cannot be found in any text book, news article, or published record.&lt;ref name = "JH-Camera" /&gt;

The quotation was reportedly put on the website of [[MIFTAH]], a Palestinian organization founded by [[Hanan Ashrawi]], who is on the executive committee of the group's governing board. MIFTAH has been accused by the pro-Israeli group [[NGO Monitor]] of fabricating the quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Islamic Human Rights Commission award==
Based on the reported Ouze Merham interview, the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] announced Sharon as the winner of the "Most Islamophobic International Politician of the Year" award at the 2003 Annual Islamophobia Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name = "IHRC2003"&gt;{{cite web

In a June 9, 2004 interview on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''The Religion Report'', interviewer [[Stephen Crittenden]] challenged [[Arzu Merali]], the organizer of the Islamophobia awards, on the Sharon presentation. Crittenden pointed out that the IHRC's own website stated that the alleged interview could not be corroborated. Merali replied "Well you know, I can take that further with the people who researched that, but pretty much everything that went out last year was well researched.

'''Allen George Debus''' (August 16, 1926 – March 6, 2009) was an American [[historian of science]], known primarily for his work on the history of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. In 1991 he was honored at the [[University of Chicago]] with an academic conference held in his name. Paul H. Theerman and [[Karen Parshall|Karen Hunger Parshall]] edited the proceedings, and Debus contributed his [[autobiography]] of which this article is a digest.

==Early life==
Allen Debus attended the [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] public school system where he showed an early interest in [[history]]. A great aunt passed on her legacy of an epoch of music to him in the form of a 1908 [[Victrola]] and a [[music record|record]] collection up to 1923. Due to the topical material and dialect songs, he wrote "studying this music gave me an opportunity early on to place past events in their historical context". In the contextual approach to history, developments should be compared across fields, and this is a feature of the school of [[Alexandre Koyre]], [[I. Bernard Cohen]], and [[Walter Pagel]], the latter two being teachers of Debus.

==Higher education==
Debus studied [[chemical engineering]] and history, graduating with a major in chemistry in the summer of 1947 from [[Northwestern University]]. He pursued his master's degree at [[Indiana University]] where he had followed John J. Murray. In June 1949 he presented his master's thesis ''[[Robert Boyle]] and Chemistry in England 1660-1700'' under John J. Murray. Subsequently, he worked towards a master's in chemistry at the same institution. He went to work for [[Abbott Laboratories]], a company for which he filed five [[patent]]s. He wrote that slow reaction times for some of his work provided reading time for broader investigations in history of science and chemistry literature. In fall 1956 he began his [[Ph.D.]] studies at [[Harvard]] under [[I. Bernard Cohen]]. His teaching assistant work was supervised by Leonard K. Nash. In a seminar with [[W. K. Jordan]] he presented a paper on the English followers of [[Paracelsus]] which received the [[Bowdoin prize|Bowdoin Prize]] in the Natural Sciences, the first of two from his years at Harvard. In September 1959 he went to London, England to delve more deeply into the topic. There he met regularly with [[Walter Pagel]] and attended [[University College of London]] courses given by Douglas McKie. Returning to Harvard, he completed the requirements for a Harvard Ph.D. in history of science.

==Professor==
In 1961, Debus took up a position at the University of Chicago under [[William McNeill (historian)|William McNeill]] in the Department of History, with one-third of the time as assistant professor in history of science, and two-thirds in undergraduate physical science coursework. In 1965 he was raised to Associate Professor on the strength of his book ''The English Paracelsians''. For the school-year 1966/7 he went on an overseas fellowship to [[Churchill College, Cambridge]]. Back at the University of Chicago, Debus described attempts by the philosophy department to intrude on the history of science program in the history department.

Debus was instrumental in the development of the ''Morris Fishbein Center'': he served as its first director for two three-year terms. In 1978 he was elected to the academic chair at University of Chicago established in honor of [[Morris Fishbein]]. Allen G. Debus developed a three-quarter sequence in history of science, leading from ancient science to the beginning of the twentieth century. He also led seminars in Renaissance science and medicine. He was at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] working on the Renaissance chemical philosophy. He was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal]] (1994) and the [[Pfizer Award]] (1978) from the [[History of Science Society]].  He was also awarded the [[Dexter Award]] (1987) of the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[Edward Kremers Award]] of the [[American Institute of the History of Pharmacy]]. In 1984 he received an honorary Ph.D. from the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]].

==Family==
Allen G. Debus noted that his [[academia|academic career]] was an innovation in his familial lineage. His father formed the company ''Modern Boxes'', where Allen served as salesman for a time in 1950. Allen met Brunilda Lopez Rodriguez from [[Puerto Rico]] at Indiana University. They married in 1951, and studied Latin, French, and German together preparing for Debus' push for the Ph.D. They had three children: Allen (1954), Richard (1957–2007), and Karl (1961).

'''Antonio Valeriano''' (c. 1521–1605) was a [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|colonial Mexican]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] [[scholar]] and [[politician]]. He was a collaborator with fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] in the creation of the twelve-volume ''General History of the Things of New Spain'', the [[Florentine Codex]],&lt;ref&gt;Ricard, pp. 42, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[governor|judge-governor]] of both his home, [[Azcapotzalco]], and of [[Tenochtitlan]], in Spanish colonial [[New Spain]].

==Career==
Antonio de Valeriano was the most accomplished pupil and then native scholar at the Franciscan [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]]. As with other students at the colegio, Valeriano was taught literacy in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin.  [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] singled out Valeriano as "one of my collaborators ... collegians expert in grammar. The principal and most learned of them was Antonio de Valeriano of Atzcapoltzalco."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ricard, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also praised by Franciscan Fray Juan Bautista, who preserved the last letter that Valeriano wrote him in Latin. Valeriano says that "my hands are trembling, my eyes are clouded, and my ears closed" [''manus namque vacillant, oculi calignant, et aures occlusae''] and signing as "Your most loving, but unworthy, Antonius Valerianus" [''Tui amantissimus etsi indignus. Antonius Valerianus''].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Latin and English translation in Ricard, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valeriano and other pupils and former pupils of the colegio are to be credited with their collaboration with the Franciscans in creating religious texts, dictionaries, and other texts such as Sahagún's magnum opus of the ''General History of the Things of New Spain'', the [[Florentine Codex]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricard, pp. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question of authorship of the Nican Mopohua==
The question of Valeriano's authorship of the [[Nahuatl]] text known as ''[[Nican Mopohua]]'' has become a point of contention in the long-running dispute over the historicity of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary (under the title [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]) to [[Juan Diego]] in 1531.  The ''Nican Mopohua'' was published in 1649 by Luis Lasso de la Vega as part of a composite text known from its opening words as the ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'', and de la Vega's claims of authorship in the preface to that work notwithstanding, the ''Nican Mopohua'' has long been attributed to Valeriano.  This attribution is based on a tradition dating back to the [[Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666]] and the assertions of Luis Becerra Tanco and, subsequently, Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]] as to Valeriano's authorship and as to their acquaintance with the relative manuscripts in his hand-writing.&lt;ref&gt;Brading, pp.117-118, cf. p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions have been made that its content is incompatible with someone (such as Valeriano) who had close bonds with the Franciscans,&lt;ref&gt;Karttunen, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; and others have suggested that the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'' is a unitary work which – despite the considerable objections against such a possibility – de la Vega wrote, with the assistance of a collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Sousa, Stafford Poole, and [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], pp. 8, 17-18, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the general consensus among Mexican scholars (ecclesiastical and secular) remains that Valeriano is indeed the author of the ''Nican Mopohua''.&lt;ref&gt;Trasloheros offers a succinct overview of opinions&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boris Fausto''' ([[São Paulo]], 8 December 1930) is a Brazilian historian, political scientist and writer.

During his career, he carried out studies on the political history of Brazil in the republican period, about mass immigration to Brazil, crime and criminality in São Paulo and authoritarian thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130628043057/http://www.abc.org.br/resultado.php3?codigo=bfausto Academia Brasileira de Ciências]. Retrieved on 18 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his main works is ''Revolução de 1930 - historiografia e história'' ([[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|The 1930 Revolution]] - historiography and history), first published in 1970, in which he confronts visions that defend the state of São Paulo during the 1930 revolution and the subsequent [[Constitutionalist Revolution|1932 Constitutionalist Revolution]].

== Early life ==
Fausto was born to a family of [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jewish immigrants]]. His mother, Eva, was born in [[Turkey]], while his father Simon, was born in [[Transylvania]], current [[Romania]]. He attended [[Colégio Mackenzie]] as an elementary student and [[Colégio São Bento]] at high school. He graduated in [[Law]] in 1953 and then mastered in [[History]] in 1966 at [[University of São Paulo]] (USP). In 1965, he became an assistant professor at the School of Philosophy and Human Sciences of the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo|Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]] (PUC-SP) In 1968 he post-graduated at USP and, in the same year, obtained his doctor's degree. In 1975 he became an Associate Professor of political sciences at USP and from 1988 to 1997, he was a retired professor-collaborator of the Political Sciences Department of USP. In 2001, he was nominated for the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1961, he married educator and co-founder of [[Escola Vera Cruz]], Cynira Stocco Fausto (1931-2010), with whom he had two sons, sociologist Sérgio Fausto and anthropologist Carlos Fausto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,historias-de-um-pensador-de-domingo,652674,0.htm Histórias de um pensador de domingo]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215015017/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso%2Chistorias-de-um-pensador-de-domingo%2C652674%2C0.htm |date=December 15, 2013  }} Estadão.com.br. 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Frederick Lawrence''' (April 15, 1873 – June 29, 1940) was an [[antiquarian]]  who discovered a number of [[Neolithic]] [[Celt (tool)|celts]] in [[Middlewich]] in [[Cheshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prehistoric Northwich | url=http://www.northwichuk.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=11 | accessdate=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C F Lawrence was also the clerk to Middlewich [[town council]], and wrote two histories of the town.

==Life==
Charles Lawrence was the eldest son of John Lawrence, a builder in Middlewich.  He was educated at the [[Church of England]] [[School]], and in 1893 married Hannah Ramsell of [[Sandbach]], at St. Mary's church, Sandbach.  He was appointed the [[clerk (position)|clerk]] to Middlewich Council in 1904 and remained in this position until retiring in 1938.&lt;ref name=BARRY&gt;{{cite book | first=Mary | last=Barry |  title=Memories of Middlewich | year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Quite accidentally [Lawrence] realised his greatest antiquarian ambition when he found a [[Neolithic]] stone celt among some stones which had been thrown out in digging in Lawrence Gardens. This led to a considerable amount of spare-time digging, with the result that some rudely worked stones were unearthed in the underlying gravel, which have been pronounced to be [[Paleolithic|Palæolithic]].  These are now in the [[Grosvenor Museum]], [[Chester]].  A beautifully chipped Neolithic spear-head of flint, of the shouldered form rarely found in England, a [[bone]] needle, a done pin, two stone celts, and a [[bronze]]-flanged socketed celt, have also been discovered, some of which are preserved at Chester, and others in the town."

The '''''Chronica''''' or '''''Cronaca Gallica of 511''''', also called the '''''Gallic Chronicle of 511''''', is a chronicle of [[Late Antiquity]] preserved today in a single manuscript of the thirteenth century now in [[Madrid]]. It resembles in all its traits another late antique Gallic chronicle, the ''[[Chronica Gallica of 452]]'', of which it may be a continuation. 
 
Like the chronicle of 452, it was written in the south of [[Gaul]], possibly at [[Arles]] or [[Marseille]]. The sources of its author include the earlier chronicle, the chronicle of [[Sulpicius Severus]], that of [[Hydatius]], that of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], and the imperial [[consul]]ar records. It was added to a compilation of texts in Spain in 733. 

The chronicle covers the period from 379 to 509/511, from which derives its name. Its entries are short and pointed, but only (approximately) datable by the rare reference to the regnal year of an emperor and by the (assumed) chronological ordering of events. Among the events for which there is no other extant source is the defeat and death of [[Anthemiolus]] around 471.

'''Chunyun''' ({{zh|t=春運|s=春运|p=Chūnyùn|first=t}}), also referred to as the '''Spring Festival travel season''' or the '''''Chunyun'' period''', is a period of travel in [[China]] with extremely high traffic load around the time of the [[Chinese New Year]]. The period usually begins 15 days before Lunar New Year's Day and lasts for around 40 days. The number of passenger-journeys during the Chunyun period is projected to be hitting over 2.9 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called the largest annual human migration in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7813267.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Asia-Pacific - China's holiday rush begins early|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Passenger rail transport in China|Rail transport]] experiences the biggest challenge during the period, and myriad social problems have emerged. This phenomenon is also seen in parts of East Asia such as Taiwan, Vietnam and South Korea.
{{annual_human_migration_world_map.svg}}

==Origin==
[[File:Hefei Railway Station square - extra ticket offices for the Chinese New Year season - P1050225.JPG|thumb|Temporary ticket offices in the square outside of [[Hefei Railway Station]], open for the Year 2011 ''chunyun'' period]]
Three main factors are responsible for the heightened traffic load during the Chunyun period.

First, it is a long-held tradition for most Chinese people to reunite with their families during [[Chinese New Year]]. People return home from work or study to have [[Reunion dinner]] with their families on New Year's Eve. Since the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|Chinese economic reform]]s of the late 1970s, new economic opportunities have emerged, often at a considerable distance from people's hometowns.  Places such as the [[Special Economic Zone]]s and the wealthy coastal regions offer employment and often, a more sought-after lifestyle.  Consequently, there has been a massive migration from rural to urban areas over the course of the last few decades, reminiscent of other [[industrial revolution]]s around the world.  The number of these [[migrant worker]]s was estimated at 50 million at 1990 and unofficially estimated at 150 million to 200 million in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/population/Story/0,2763,413615,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Gittings | title=Population not Taiwan 'is China's challenge' | date=2000-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Chunyun period, many of these laborers return to their home towns.

Second, [[Chinese education reform]]s have increased the number of university students, who often study outside of their hometown. The Spring Festival holiday period falls around the same time frame as their winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/04/content_405832.htm|title=Students prove a large market force|last=|first=|date=2005-01-04|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 194 million railway passengers of the 2006 Chunyun period were 6.95 million university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.cn/showfeature.asp?aid=9438&amp;slug=CHINA-TRAVEL|title=Natural gas news, analysis and intelligence - Natural Gas Daily|website=Interfax Global Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, because the Spring Festival Period is one of the week-long holiday periods in the People's Republic of China (the only other being National Day, Oct 1), many people choose to travel for pleasure around this time.  Tourism in mainland China is reaching record levels, further adding to the pressure on the  transportation system.

These factors exacerbate current problems with China's current inter-city transportation systems. The railway network is insufficient to handle the number of passengers, and does not reach enough places. The locations not serviced by rail must rely on buses for transportation, which faces problems such as inadequate equipment and road network.

==Impact on transportation systems and related problems==
The most affected modes of transportation are inter-city surface passenger transportation systems, namely [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|railway]] and [[road]] networks. Most Chinese middle-class citizens cannot readily afford air transport. International, urban and waterway transportation are slightly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/21/content_4080119.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213131933/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/21/content_4080119.htm |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2007, due to the high demand, the prices of tickets are increased during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-01/10/content_511054.htm|title=Railway ticket prices to be increased during Spring Festival|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007's Chunyun period (Feb 4-March 14), however, the government imposed strict regulations against inflated prices on railway tickets.

In 2012, the PRC government announced that national highways would be toll free for Golden Week, and as a result 86 million people traveled by road (13% increase compared to the previous year).&lt;ref&gt;Joe Weisenthal, 2012-09-30, [http://www.businessinsider.com/golden-week-huge-traffic-james-in-china-2012-9 It's 'Golden Week' In China, And The Traffic Jams Are Like Nothing You've Ever Seen], Business Insider&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, 7.6 million people traveled via domestic airlines, and 60.9 million people traveled via railway.&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Li, 2012-10-08, [https://archive.is/20130119212524/http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/182000-visitors-and-other-china-golden-week-records-419951?hpt=hp_c4 34 million visitors and other China Golden Week records], CNN Go&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways and buses===
The Ministry of Railways estimated that 340 million passengers would take trains during the 2009 Chunyun period. However, the average daily capacity of the Chinese railway system is 3.4 million. The shortage of railway resources led many passengers to pay double or even triple-priced tickets from scalpers or to wait in lines for up to a day at railway stations.

[[Image:20060729120356 - T27 - Ticket.jpg|thumb|200px|A Chinese railway ticket from 2006]]

Because of the extremely long waiting period, many customers become frustrated and search for solutions even cutting in line, often resulting in conflict. Fighting over places in line is often seen, and as people get closer to the ticket booth, much pushing and shoving ensues. The overworked ticket booth workers are generally frustrated with the repetitive and dull nature of their work, which, in most places in the country, come in long shifts every time, and therefore reflect a largely negative and frustrated image to the customers. Inquiries by customers are not always answered correctly or at all; customers are not offered many options to begin with, if time is allotted for indecision the customer is usually pushed aside by the next person in the line. The same problem is found with phone lines, which saves the anxiety of waiting in line, but are severely overloaded and the reception is often rude when a ticket agent finally picks up after several hours of waiting. In [[Shenzhen]] it is estimated that 23 days worth of tickets can be gone in a matter of 14 minutes if telephone was the only method employed. An internet system is present, but at times inadequate.

To fit demand, hundreds of "temporary trains" (''[[L-series trains|Linke]]'') and hundreds of thousands of temporary buses are operated during this period, the number of ticket offices is increased and selling periods are extended to cope with the demand, with temporary booths springing up. Batch orders from schools and factories are organized to distribute tickets ahead of time. These measures, however, are generally inadequate and often tampered with. For example, during the 2005 Chunyun period, the ticket offices in [[Shenzhen]] had tens of telephone lines, and at times got millions of calls per hour. In the [[Guangzhou]] area, the number of calls reached 19.91 million per hour. [[Guangzhou Railway Group]] increased the number of telephone lines at their ticket offices to 8,000 in the 2006 Chunyun period.

Due to the basic nature of Chinese railway tickets and the loosely set limitations on the number of "standing tickets" (which is basically a pass to get on a crowded railway car), [[ticket resale|Scalpers]] (''[[piaofanzi]]'' 票贩子 or ''huangniu'' 黄牛, lit. ''yellow bull'' in Chinese) profit greatly during the Chunyun period. Organizations of scalpers have emerged, and the scalpers inside the sometimes intricate network work collectively to make the most gain out of the tickets. They pick up tickets in great numbers minutes after they go on sale, and then deal them out in and around the railway station at highly inflated prices. A significant problem has also emerged with the illegal dealing of tickets through obsolete ticket modification or even printing outright fake tickets using computer technology. Although measures have been put in place to prevent fake tickets, passengers who purchase the tickets become extremely frustrated when the authenticity of their tickets is questioned only upon arrival at the ticket validation officer, what would be minutes before boarding the train. Because of the worsening nature of the problem, the government has issued many warnings and began various campaigns to crack down on the scalpers. Unfortunately, because of the complicated nature of the problem and the social networks which surround the scalper organizations, police and other authorities who are supposed to be in charge of the crackdown often become involved in the illicit activity themselves, and take many bribes from the scalpers.

There has also developed a significant safety risk during the Chunyun season. Theft, robbery, fraud and other crimes are the most flagrant during the time period. Passenger supervision and checks on luggage become stricter. The common belief in the safety of railway travel is undermined by the fact that many railway cars are severely overcrowded. Bus companies, in order to gain a bigger profit, overwork the bus drivers on irregular schedules, overloading people every round, causing a higher accident rate. Trains also face a problem with scheduling, as an overcrowded network cannot ensure the overall accuracy of train schedules, and some trains are habitually late hours at a time, cause unease and frustration with passengers. The government has taken to passing legislation to regulate late trains, and make a public notice and apology for late trains mandatory.

The passenger flow during the Chunyun period is usually imbalanced. Before the Spring Festival, passengers usually gather in developed coastal cities, railway interchange cities such as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]] and [[Guangzhou]], and basically flow from more developed urban areas to less developed rural areas. The passenger flow direction is reversed after the Spring Festival. In addition, passenger flow is very sensitive to disruption, such as bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/20/AR2006012001814.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Edward | last=Cody | title=A China-Size Travel Delay | date=2006-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, round-trip train tickets became available for college students.&lt;ref name="chinadaily.com.cn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/06/content_776084.htm|title=Spring Festival severe transport test|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe snow storms in late January 2008 stranded many thousands of migrant workers as they attempted to get home. At one time over 100,000 people were at the main railway station in the southern city of [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7212007.stm | work=BBC News | title=Snow hampers China New Year plans | date=2008-01-27 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1.3 million troops and reservists were drafted in around the country to clear blocked roads and rail lines to enable people to travel.

==="Real name and ID" requirement for train tickets===
[[File:Ticket of Z4013 (20151104230709).jpg|thumb|200px|A Chinese railway ticket with real name and ID (blocked in the photograph) issued in 2015]]
Despite initial opposition from the [[Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Railways]], train tickets were upgraded in late 2009 to accommodate [[QR code]]s on a ticket, thus enabling personal information to be stored. This would link the ticket with its legal purchaser, paving the way for a "real name and ID" requirement to be implemented. Such a policy went into effect on a trial basis beginning early 2010 (for the duration of the Chunyun period on all non high-speed trains). In 2011, the "real name and ID" requirement expanded to more cities in China, and was made permanent for the [[Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] even after the Chunyun period. The requirement became mandatory for all CRH high speed trains with effect from June 1, 2011 and was expanded to nearly all passenger trains on January 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2012-01/02/content_14370521.htm | work=China Daily | title=Real-name ticket sales for all trains | date=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now policy for station staff and rail police to check all riders against their document of identity and to deny boarding to those without a ticket or with no linked ID.

As a result, stations that see large passenger flow, such as the [[Beijing West Railway Station]], are obliged to set up extra ticket inspection counters to allow only legal holders of train tickets to enter the waiting area or the station area at all, especially during the Spring Festival travel peak. The result has been a requirement for more passengers to arrive earlier at stations. It did not completely eradicate scalpers, but did reduce their activity significantly.

===Air===
Air transportation is less affected as most travelers are workers who cannot afford air transport, but nevertheless the Chunyun impact is increasing. In 2008 roughly 28 million passengers used air transportation as their method of travel inside China. [[Xiamen Airlines]], for example, added nearly 210 flights to its roster during the Chunyun period, with thirty flights especially placed to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and another ten flights to international destinations in Southeast Asia and Korea. [[Three Links|Cross-strait flights]] between [[Taiwan]] and mainland China were also permitted during this period before regular year-round flights were established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.ccpit.org/servlet/org.servlet.fronthomepage.org.en.OrgOrgNewsViewEnG?org_id=29&amp;id=10835]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent accidents in the air, the Chinese government has brought in very strict regulations on not overloading planes. The [[General Administration of Civil Aviation of China]] (CAAC) estimates at least 36 million passengers will fly during the 2009 Chunyun period.&lt;ref name="chinadaily.com.cn"/&gt;

==Taiwan==
In Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. 

The majority of transportation before the Lunar New Year in western Taiwan is southbound long distance travel, in which people travel from the urbanized north to their hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and between Taiwan and outlying islands is somewhat less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in 2003 as part of [[Three Links]], mostly for "Taiwanese businessmen" to return to Taiwan for the New Year. After the New Year, there are many local family tours throughout the holidays. On the second and the third day, there is a second wave of medium-long distance travel when the families go to the hometowns of the wives. Near the end of the holidays there is a wave of northbound returning travels which is less concentrated than the southbound travels. In 2012, on the second day of the Lunar New Year, there were an estimated 3 million cars on the island's freeways, and on the 8th day (the Friday of the holiday week) there were "2.7 million vehicles, about 1.7 times the average daily traffic volume of about 1.6 million." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftsstadt}}) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) is located in Darmstadt, as well as [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]], where several chemical elements such as [[bohrium]] (1981), [[meitnerium]] (1982), [[hassium]] (1984), [[darmstadtium]] (1994), [[roentgenium]] (1994), and [[copernicium]] (1996) were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wanted: Suitable name for unstable, heavyweight element |publisher=The Guardian|year=2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jun/11/element-112-name-periodic-table|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the following elements were also confirmed at [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]]: [[nihonium]] (2012), [[flerovium]] (2009), [[moscovium]] (2012), [[livermorium]] (2010), and [[tennessine]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of new elements|publisher=GSI Darmstadt|year=2016|url=https://www.gsi.de/en/researchaccelerators/research_an_overview/neue_elemente.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211110/https://www.gsi.de/en/researchaccelerators/research_an_overview/neue_elemente.htm|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research]] (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility under construction. Darmstadt is also the seat of the world's oldest pharmaceutical company, [[Merck Group|Merck]], which is the city's largest employer.

Darmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign country, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] and its successor, the [[People's State of Hesse]], a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous [[duchy]], the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/30/socialsciences.research City of London richest area in Europe], ''The Guardian'', 30 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (later information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city's economy. It is also home to the football club [[SV Darmstadt 98]].

=== Origins ===
The name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as ''Darmundestat''. Its origins are unknown.&lt;ref name="DARM"/&gt; 'Dar-mund' in Middle Low German is translated as "Boggy Headlands", but it could be a misspelling in local dialect of another name. It is sometimes stated that the name derives from the 'Darmbach' (a small stream formerly running through the city).{{fact|date=August 2017}} In fact, the stream received its current name much later, after the city, not ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name="DARM"&gt;"[http://www.darmbach.de/Projekt/documents/Wokommterherwowillerhin.pdf Wo kommt er her, wo will er hin?]" – ''Darmstädter Echo'', 2007-12-03, in German. Retrieved 28 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darmstadt was chartered as a city by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Ludwig the Bavarian]] in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]].&lt;ref name="FACTS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | title = Essential Facts (brochure from the official city website)| format=PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319082609/http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | archivedate=2009-03-19 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, then called ''Darmstait'', became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.&lt;ref name="HISTKatz1"&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/burgenseitedarmstadt.html Nebenresidenz Darmstadt (darmstait)] (from the 'Graf v. Katzenelnbogen' website, in German. Retrieved 5 January 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]], and was seat of the ruling [[Landgraf|landgraves]] (1567–1806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]].&lt;ref name="HISTKatz2"&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/geschichtedemandt.html Die Geschichte des Grafenhauses ] (from the 'Graf v. Katzenelnbogen' website, in German. Retrieved 5 January 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city grew in population during the 19th century from little over 10,000 to 72,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="darmstadt-history"&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = (from the official city website)
| title     = Population growth in Darmstadt

In the beginning of the 20th century, Darmstadt was an important centre for the art movement of [[Jugendstil]], the German variant of [[Art Nouveau]]. Annual architectural competitions led to the building of many architectural treasures of this period. Also during this period, in 1912 the chemist [[Anton Kollisch]], working for the pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], first synthesised the chemical [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) in Darmstadt. Darmstadt's municipal area was extended in 1937 to include the neighbouring localities of Arheilgen and Eberstadt, and in 1938 the city was separated administratively from the surrounding district (''Kreis'').

=== Nazi Germany ===
Darmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for "endangering communal order and tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/lechlecha/features.htm Beginning of the End] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015541/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/lechlecha/features.htm |date=30 September 2007 }}'' – Musman, Moshe; from ''Borne Aloft On The Wings Of A Dove'' (in-depth feature on [[Dei'ah veDibur]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;[http://www.darmstadt.de/kultur/geschichte/02648/ Darmstädter Stadtgeschichte 20. Jahrhundert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410004257/http://www.darmstadt.de/kultur/geschichte/02648/ |date=10 April 2007 }} (from the official city website, in German, less detailed also in English)&lt;/ref&gt; where most eventually died.

Several prominent members of the German resistance movement against the Nazis were citizens of Darmstadt, including [[Wilhelm Leuschner]] and [[Theodor Haubach]], both executed for their opposition to Hitler's regime.

Darmstadt was first bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war's end. The old city centre was largely destroyed in a [[Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II|British bombing raid]] on 11 September 1944. This attack was an example of the ''firestorm'' technique, which was subsequently used against the historic city of [[Dresden]] in February 1945. To create a firestorm, a number of [[incendiary bombs]] are dropped around the city before the explosive blast bombs are dropped, thus beginning a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed. Darmstadt was selected as the secondary target for the raid, but was promoted to the primary target after clouds were observed over the primary which would have hindered any [[reconnaissance]] of the after-effects. During this fire attack an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants burned to death, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; Over three quarters of Darmstadt's inner city was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/city/hist.html Darmstadt history] (from the website of the [[Technical University of Darmstadt]])&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city's capture on 20 March 1945 by the American [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]].

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Darmstadt became home to many technology companies and research institutes, and has been promoting itself as a "city of science" since 1997. It is well known as a high-tech centre in the vicinity of [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt Airport]], with important activities in spacecraft operations (the [[European Space Operations Centre]], [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]]), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications (substantial [[Deutsche Telekom]] presence) and mechatronics. In 2000, its region also scored Rank 3 amongst 97 German regions in the ''[[WirtschaftsWoche]]'' test ranking Germany's high-tech regions.&lt;ref name="FACTS"/&gt;

The roots of [[Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences]] goes back to 1876&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.h-da.de/mse/msc_brochure.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]](''the first electrical engineering chair and inventions fame''), when both these Universities were an integrated entities, a need for a separate industry based research educational institution was felt in the early 1930s, finally University of Applied sciences emerged as a separate industry based research educational institution in 1971 and is the largest [[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences]] in [[Hesse]] (German: [[Hessen]]) with about 11,000 students.

The [[Darmstadt University of Technology|TU Darmstadt]] is one of the important technical institutes in Germany and is well known for its research and teaching in the Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering disciplines. Together with other tertiary institutions, the TU is responsible for the large student population of the city, which stood at 33,547 in 2004.&lt;ref name="FACTS"/&gt;

&lt;!--{{Main|Transport in Darmstadt}}--&gt;

Darmstadt is highly connected to all means of transportation, including the [[Autobahn|Autobahn Network]], the [[Intercity-Express|Intercity-Express Network]] and a major international airport.

=== Roads ===
Darmstadt is connected to a number of major roads, including two [[Autobahn]]en ([[Bundesautobahn 5]] and [[Bundesautobahn 67]]). The main road passing west-east is the [[Bundesstraße 26]], the [[Bundesstraße 3]] runs north-south. The rural areas east of the city in the [[Odenwald]] are accessed by several secondary roads.

=== Public transport in Darmstadt ===
{{Main article|Trams in Darmstadt}}
The extensive public transport system of Darmstadt is integrated in the [[Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund|RMV]] (the transportation authority of the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area|Frankfurt Metropolitan Area]]). The backbone of public transport in Darmstadt is its modern [[Tram|tram system]] with 9 lines and a local bus service serving all parts of the city. Darmstadt is furthermore connected to the [[Frankfurt S-Bahn|Frankfurt S-Bahn system]] and being served by regional bus lines. Furthermore, regional rail lines (R64, R65, R66) connect six secondary railway stations within the city.

=== Regional rail links ===
Darmstadt is connected to the Frankfurt [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|rapid transit network]] by [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main|S-Bahn]] line S3. Besides that, a number of regional trains connect secondary railway stations within Darmstadt and the region with [[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof]] (main station), offering a net of inner city and regional train links.

=== National rail links ===
[[File:Darmstadt Hbf (5946442195).jpg|254px|thumb|right|[[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof]] - Train hub for southern Hesse]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
By its main railway station "[[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof]]", which is located in the western part of the central city, Darmstadt is connected to the rest of Germany and Europe by the [[Intercity-Express]] network and other long-distance trains. Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof is a busy station with 12 platforms which serves as a [[transportation hub]] for the southern Hesse/[[Odenwald]] region.

=== Airports ===
* '''[[Frankfurt International Airport]]'''
Darmstadt can be easily accessed from around the world via Frankfurt Airport (''Flughafen Frankfurt am Main'') which is located
{{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from central Darmstadt and connected to it via [[Autobahn]] 5, [[S-Bahn]], several bus lines and a direct express bus-link ("''Airliner''").

=== Castles and historical buildings ===
[[File:Residenzschloss Darmstadt 539-Gdh.JPG|thumb|254px|Ducal Palace and Market Square]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
Darmstadt was the [[Capital city|capital]] of an independent country (the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]) until 1871 and the capital of the German state of [[Hesse]] until 1945. It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by [[Georg Moller]] who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Due to the fact that the last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst Ludwig]] was a grandson of [[Queen Victoria]] and brother to [[Alexandra of Hesse|Empress Alexandra]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its grand-ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre (at Karolinenplatz) and the Russian Chapel by [[Leon Benois]]. The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas' mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian imperial family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's brother and family in Darmstadt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050209/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand-ducal palace of Darmstadt is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of [[County of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], later as [[Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Grand Dukes of Hesse]] by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned a hunting lodge in [[Kranichstein]] which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is [[Frankenstein Castle]] due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley's decision to choose the name [[Frankenstein]] for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.

=== Modern architecture ===
[[File:Darmstadt-Waldspirale-Hundertwasser3.jpg|thumb|left|254px|The Waldspirale]]
Darmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several ''"Meisterbauten"'' (''Masterful Architectonic Creations'') were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the [[Waldspirale]] ('Forest Spiral') was built, a residential complex by Austrian [[Hundertwasser|Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]. As an almost [[Surrealism|surreal]] building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser's work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.

=== Art Nouveau ===
Darmstadt was a centre of the [[Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau movement]]. Surviving examples of the [[Jugendstil]] period include the Rosenhöhe, a landscaped English-style rose garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/rosenhoehe/index.html Rosenhöhe – planted with roses] (from the official city website)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mathildenhöhe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/mathildenhoehe/index.html Mathildenhöhe (Artists' Colony)] (from the official city website)&lt;/ref&gt; with the ''Hochzeitsturm'' ('Wedding tower', also commonly known as the 'Five-Finger-Tower') by [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], the [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil ("young style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus, it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.

=== Squares ===
The ''Luisenplatz'', the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the ''Ludwigsäule'' (called ''Langer Lui'', meaning ''Long Ludwig''), a 33-metre column commemorating [[Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Ludwig I]], first Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the ''Marktplatz'' (see image) near the old city hall and the ''Sabaisplatz'' at the ''Mathildenhöhe''.

=== Parks ===
[[File:Darmstadt Eingang Rosenhöhe.jpg|thumb|254px|Park Rosenhöhe]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
The city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style ''Herrngarten'' in central Darmstadt. In former times it was part of the Royal Gardens used exclusively by the dukes of Darmstadt. Today it is a public park, heavily used in every season of the year. Other important parks are the French style parks ''Prinz-Georgs-Garten'' and ''Orangerie'', the modern style ''Bürgerpark'' ("People's Park") in northern Darmstadt and the mystical ''Park Rosenhöhe'', ("Rose Heights") which also serves as the cemetery for the dukes, with two impressive mausoleum buildings in its remote parts. The [[Botanischer Garten der TU Darmstadt|Botanischer Garten]] in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the Darmstadt University of Technology with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.

=== Churches ===
[[File:Russian Chapel in Darmstadt, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|254px|Russian Chapel Darmstadt]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
The [[Protestant]] [[Evangelical Church in Germany|''Stadtkirche'' church]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Stadtkirche (Darmstadt)|German wikipedia Protestant ''Stadtkirche'' church]]&lt;/ref&gt; built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bockshaut.de/EN/ Historic hotel Bockshaut]&lt;/ref&gt; The church has [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] elements along with [[renaissance]] and [[baroque]], it houses the [[Royal family|royal]] [[crypt]]. Hotel Bockshaut was built in 1580 for a church presbytery. The most important [[Catholic]] Church is ''St. Ludwig'' in central Darmstadt. The [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] is a [[Russian orthodox church]] which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], whose wife [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Tsar outside the [[Russian Empire]]. It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar's private chapel on it.

=== Festivals ===
Every year on the first weekend of july the [[Heinerfest]] festival is held in the streets surrounding the old ducal palace. It is a traditional German festival with music acts, [[beer hall]]s, [[amusement ride]]s and booths selling trinkets and food. The similar 'Schloßgrabenfest', which is more [[live music]]-oriented, is held in the same location every year in May.
These two festivals attract 700,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080126230241/http://www.darmstadt.de/infos/heinerfest/ Information about the Heinerfest] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and 400,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlossgrabenfest.de/2006/sgf_aktuelles_14.html Schloßgrabenfest 2006] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; visitors respectively.

== Culture ==
[[File:Darmstadt Staatstheater Zuschauerraum vom Rang.jpg|thumb|right|254px|State Theater Darmstadt - Grand Hall]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
Darmstadt has a rich cultural heritage. The [[Staatstheater Darmstadt]] (''State Theatre Darmstadt'') dates back to the year 1711. The present building has been in use since 1972 and has three halls which can be used independently. The "Grand Hall" (''Großes Haus'') provides seats for 956 people and serves as Darmstadt's opera house. The "Small Hall" (''Kleines Haus'') is mostly used for plays and dance and has 482 seats. A separate small hall (''Kammerspiele'') with 120 seats is used for [[chamber play]]s.

Among the museums in Darmstadt the most important are the ''Hessisches Landesmuseum'' (Hessian State Museum), the ''Porcelain Museum'' (exhibition of the ducal [[porcelain]]), the ''Schlossmuseum'' (exhibition of the ducal residence and possessions), the ''Kunsthalle Darmstadt'' (exhibitions of modern art), the exhibition centre ''Mathildenhöhe'' and the ''Museum Künstlerkolonie'' ([[Art Nouveau]] museum).

The Jazz-Institut Darmstadt is Germany's largest publicly accessible [[jazz]] archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzinstitut.de/us.htm Jazz-Institut Darmstadt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427174332/http://www.jazzinstitut.de/us.htm |date=27 April 2007 }} (official institute website)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt, harboring one of the world's largest collections of [[post-war]] [[sheet music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imd.darmstadt.de/ Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt] (official institute website, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; also hosts the biennial ''[[Darmstadt New Music Summer School|Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik]]'', a summer school in [[contemporary classical music]] founded by [[Wolfgang Steinecke]]. A large number of avant-garde composers have attended and given lectures there, including [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[John Cage]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], and [[Helmut Lachenmann]].

The [[Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung]] provides writers and scholars with a place to research the German language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutscheakademie.de/ Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung] (official academy website, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's annual [[Georg Büchner Prize]], named in memory of [[Georg Büchner]], is considered the most prestigious literary award for writers of German language.

==Geography==
[[File:Bergstrasse westblick bei heppenheim ds wv 11 2007.jpg|thumb|left|254px|Vineyards south of Darmstadt - View to the Rhine Plain]]&lt;!-- this image is forced to imagebox width --&gt;
Darmstadt is located in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] (German: Oberrheinische Tiefebene), a major rift, about 350&amp;nbsp;km long and on average 50&amp;nbsp;km wide, between the cities of Frankfurt in the north and Basel in the south. Darmstadt's southeastern boroughs are located in the spurs of the [[Odenwald]], a low mountain range in Southern Hesse between the Main and Neckar rivers.

===Climate===
Southern Hesse is well known for its mild climate which allows [[winegrowing]] on a large scale in the region south of Darmstadt. The weather is often volatile with the summers being warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms, the winters mostly relatively mild with frequent periods of [[high fog]]. Snowfall is most likely in January and February, but mild winters without considerable snowfall can occur.

==Institutions==

===Technology===
[[File:Views in the Main Control Room (12052189474).jpg|right|thumb|The [[European Space Operations Centre|ESOC]] European Space Operations Command in Darmstadt.]]

Darmstadt is home to many research institutions such as the [[Fraunhofer Society]] (Fraunhofer IGD, Fraunhofer LBF, Fraunhofer SIT) and the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI, "Society for [[heavy ion|Heavy Ion]] Research"), which operates a [[particle accelerator]] in northern Darmstadt. The GSI, amongst other elements, discovered the [[chemical element]] [[darmstadtium]] ([[atomic number]]: 110), named after the city in 2003. This makes Darmstadt one of only eight settlements with elements named after them (the others being [[Ytterby]] in Sweden (four elements); [[Stockholm]] in Sweden ([[holmium]]); [[Strontian]] in Scotland; [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark (whose Latin name gives [[hafnium]]); Paris (whose Latin name gives [[lutetium]]); [[Berkeley, California]]; and [[Dubna]] in Russia). Various other elements, including [[meitnerium]] (atomic number: 109) (1982), [[hassium]] (atomic number: 108) (1984), [[roentgenium]] (atomic number: 111) (1994) and [[copernicium]] (atomic number: 112) (1996) were also synthesized in the Darmstadt facility.

The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) of the [[European Space Agency]] is located in Darmstadt. From here, various deep-space exploration spacecraft and Earth-orbiting satellites are operated for the purposes of scientific research, and technology development and demonstration.

[[EUMETSAT]], the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, operates the principal European [[meteorological]] [[satellite]]s from its headquarters, including the first and second generations of [[Meteosat]] geostationary satellites, and the polar-orbiting [[Metop]] series.

Darmstadt is a centre for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, with Merck, Röhm and [[Carl Schenck|Schenck RoTec]] (part of The Dürr Group) having their main plants and centres here.

===United States military presence===
U.S. forces entered the city of Darmstadt on 25 March 1945. At the end of World War II, Darmstadt was among the 112 communities where U.S. forces were stationed. Early units stationed here included elements of the U.S. Constabulary, Air Force units and a Quartermaster School.

Over the years, the U.S. military community Darmstadt — under a variety of designations — served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby [[Babenhausen, Hesse|Babenhausen]], [[Griesheim, Hesse|Griesheim]] and [[Münster, Hesse|Münster]], plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as [[Bensheim]] and [[Aschaffenburg]]. The military newspaper European ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the [[Frankfurt-am-Main|Frankfurt]] area.

As part of the U.S. Army's ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated [[U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt]], inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Group]] at the Dagger Complex on Eberstädter Weg,.&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|49.843786|8.584211}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws its support from the nearby [http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/ U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden]. The website of the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade claims they moved out in 2008, but Google Maps and Bing satellite imagery still show a respectively full and quarter-full parking lot,{{Original research inline|date=January 2018}} and the U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden's website mentions the unit still being active in Darmstadt, and a Marine Corps company being stationed there as well. With the exception of Dagger Complex, all remaining US installations are now empty and closed to the public, pending property disposal by the German authorities.

'''Einsiedeln Abbey''' ({{lang-de|Kloster Einsiedeln}}) is a [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in the village of [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]], Switzerland. The abbey is dedicated to Our Lady of the Hermits, the title being derived from the circumstances of its foundation, for the first inhabitant of the region was [[Saint Meinrad]], a [[hermit]]. It is a [[territorial abbey]] and, therefore, not part of a [[diocese]], subject to a [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]. It has been a major resting point on the [[Way of St. James]] for centuries.

== History ==
Meinrad was educated at the abbey school on [[Reichenau Island]], in [[Lake Constance]], under his kinsmen, Abbots Hatto and Erlebald, where he became a monk and was ordained a priest. After some years at Reichenau, and at a dependent [[priory]] on [[Lake Zurich]], he embraced an eremitical life and established his [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] on the slopes of the mountain of [[Etzel (mountain)|Etzel]]. He died on January 21, 861, at the hands of two robbers who thought that the hermit had some precious treasures, but during the next 80 years the place was never without one or more hermits emulating Meinrad's example. One of them, named Eberhard, previously [[provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Strassburg]], erected in 934 a monastery and church there, of which he became first abbot. 

The church was miraculously consecrated, so the legend runs, in 948, by Christ himself assisted by the [[Four Evangelists]], [[St. Peter]], and St. [[Gregory the Great]]. This event was investigated and confirmed by [[Pope Leo VIII]] and subsequently ratified by many of his successors, the last ratification being by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1793, who confirmed the acts of all his predecessors. 

In 965 Gregory, the third Abbot of Einsiedeln, was made a prince of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by Emperor [[Otto I]], and his successors continued to enjoy the same dignity up to the cessation of the empire in the beginning of the 19th century. In 1274 the abbey, with its dependencies, was created an independent [[principality]] by [[Rudolf I of Germany]], over which the abbot exercised temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction. It remained independent until 1798, the year of the French invasion. It is still a territorial abbey, meaning that it is located in a territory that is not part of any diocese which the abbot governs "as its proper pastor" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1C.HTM Canon 370, ''Codex Juris Canonici'']) with the same authority as a diocesan bishop.

For the learning and piety of its monks, Einsiedeln has been famous for a thousand years, and many saints and scholars have lived within its walls. The study of letters, printing, and music have greatly flourished there, and the abbey has contributed largely to the glory of the Benedictine Order. It is true that discipline declined somewhat in the fifteenth century and the rule became relaxed, but Ludovicus II, a monk of [[St. Gall]] who was Abbot of Einsiedeln 1526-44, succeeded in restoring the stricter observance. 

In the 16th century the religious disturbances caused by the spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Switzerland were a source of trouble for some time. [[Zwingli]] himself was at Einsiedeln for a while, and used the opportunity for protesting against the famous pilgrimages, but the storm passed over and the abbey was left in peace. Abbot Augustine I (1600–29) was the leader of the movement which resulted in the erection of the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the Order of St. Benedict in 1602, and he also did much for the establishment of unrelaxed observance in the abbey and for the promotion of a high standard of scholarship and learning amongst his monks.

[[File:Kloster Einsiedeln MG 2740.JPG|thumb|upright|Details of the ceiling paintings]]
[[File:Kloster Einsiedeln MG 2745.JPG|thumb|upright|Details of the ceiling paintings]]
The pilgrimages, just mentioned, which have never ceased since the days of St Meinrad, have tended to make Einsiedeln the rival even of [[Rome]], the [[Basilica della Santa Casa|Holy House of Loreto]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]], serving as a major stopping point on the [[Way of St. James]] leading there. Pilgrimages constitute one of the features for which the abbey is chiefly celebrated. The pilgrims number around one million, from all parts of Catholic Europe or even further. The statue of Our Lady from the 15th century, enthroned in the little chapel erected by Eberhard, is the object of their devotion. It is the subject of the earliest preserved print of pilgrimage, by the [[Master E.S.]] in 1466.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Suzanne Karr. [https://artinprint.org/article/printed-bodies-and-the-materiality-of-early-modern-prints/ "Printed Bodies and the Materiality of Early Modern Prints,"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 1 No. 1 (May-June 2011), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel stands within the great abbey church, in much the same way as the Holy House at Loreto is encased in a marble shrine and is elaborately decorated.

September 14 and October 13 are the chief pilgrimage days, the former being the anniversary of the miraculous consecration of Eberhard's basilica and the latter that of the translation of St Meinrad's relics from Reichenau Island to Einsiedeln in 1039. The millennium of St Meinrad was kept there with great splendour in 1861 as well as that of the Benedictine monastery in 1934. The great church has been many times rebuilt, the last time by Abbot Maurus between the years 1704 and 1719. The last big renovation ended after more than twenty years in 1997. The [[library]] contains nearly 250,000 volumes and many priceless manuscripts. The work of the monks is divided chiefly between prayer, work and study. At pilgrimage times the number of confessions heard is very large. 

In 2013 the community numbered 60 monks. Attached to the abbey are a seminary and a college for about 360 pupils who are partially taught by the monks, who also provide [[spiritual direction]] for six convents of [[Religious Sister]]s.

==Expansion to America==
In 1854, when the monastery was again facing suppression, a colony was sent to the United States from Einsiedeln to minister to the local German-speaking population and to develop a place of refuge, if needed. The delegation started a new foundation, now [[St. Meinrad Archabbey]] in [[St. Meinrad, Indiana]], which became part of the [[Swiss-American Congregation]] formed in 1881. As of 01 April 2018, the Swiss-American Congregation consists of 14 monasteries from Canada to Guatemala, five of which were founded from St. Meinrad Archabbey and its daughter houses.

==School==
One of the abbey's apostolates is a school (''Gymnasium'') for the seventh to twelfth grades which has existed in its present form since 1848.  It is the continuation of a tradition of education that dates to the early Middle Ages. Its distinguished alumni include [[Gall Morel]], [[Franz Fassbind]], [[Philipp Etter]], [[Hans Hürlimann]] and his son [[Thomas Hürlimann]], [[Bruno Frick]], and [[Anatole Taubman]].

==Fahr Monastery==
{{main|Fahr Monastery}}
Located in separate cantons, Einsiedeln Abbey and [[Fahr Monastery]], a community of Benedictine nuns, form a [[double monastery]], both under the authority of the Abbot of Einsiedeln.

==Ufenau island, Einsiedlerhaus and Endingen area in Rapperswil==
{{main|Ufenau|Einsiedlerhaus}}
The western lake shore town wall respectively the fortifications of [[Rapperswil]] probably were built in the early 13th century by the [[Counts of Rapperswil]]. The so-called ''Endingen'' area in Rapperswil was given as a fief by the Einsiedeln Abbey which is still owner of the land, including the site where the [[Kapuzinerkloster Rapperswil|Capuchin monastery]] was built. That's why the adjoint building traditionally was named ''[[Einsiedlerhaus]]'', meaning "house of the Einsiedeln abbey". Historians mention a 10th-century ferry station located there – in 981 AD as well as the abbey's vineyard on the [[Lindenhof (Rapperswil)|Lindenhof hill]] – between [[Kempraten]] on [[Kempratnerbucht]], the [[Lützelau]] and [[Ufenau]] islands and assumably present [[Hurden]]. The ferry services allowed the pilgrims towards Einsiedeln to cross the lake before the prehistoric [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] at the [[Seedamm]] isthmus was re-built between 1358 and 1360. Endingen, the ''Einsiedlerhaus'', and even the lake area are still in the possession of the Einsiedeln abbey, as well as the Ufenau island.&lt;ref name="kapuzinerkloster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klosterrapperswil.ch/das-einsiedlerhaus-in-rapperswil-wechselt-den-besitzer/|title=Das Einsiedlerhaus in Rapperswil wechselt den Besitzer|publisher=[[Kapuzinerkloster Rapperswil]], published by Markus Turnherr, [[Rathaus Rapperswil#Stadtarchiv|Stadtarchivar]], in ''[[Obersee Nachrichten]]''|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Vlora]], the son of [[Syrja bej Vlora|Syrja Bey Vlora]], member of one of the wealthiest landowning families of the south. He was related both to [[Ismail Qemali]] and also to his main political opponent [[Esad Pasha Toptani|Esad Pasha]], who were both his uncles from his father's and mother's side respectively. He was educated at the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]], 1899–1903, and studied law and religion in [[Istanbul]], 1904. After working for the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Foreign Ministry for a time, including a three-month tour of duty at the Ottoman embassy in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1907, and years of travel in Europe, Albania and the Orient, he joined his uncle [[Ismail Qemali]] in the movement for Albanian independence. During these travels he met some of the most important personalities of the time, including [[Herbert Kitchener]], [[Franz Conrad von Hotzendorf]], several Arab sheikhs who would become the monarchs of the Arab countries and also a young lieutenant, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who would eventually become the president of [[Turkey]]. According to Vlora's memoirs, members of his family were ''de facto'' (not ''de jure'') [[sanjakbey]]s of [[Sanjak of Avlona]] in period 1481—1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vlora |first=Eqrem  |title=Lebenserinnerungen |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_3/AH1968.html  |volume=1 |date= |origyear= |year=1968 |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page= |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= The members of his family held this position almost without interruption from 1481 to 1828, hereditarily not de jure, but de facto.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balkan Wars==
In mid-October, Vlora arrived in Vienna after being sent on a mission by Albanian notables of middle and south central Albania to seek support from Austro-Hungarian officials regarding Albania's future and its borders especially along the [[Kalamas]] river and the inclusion of [[Chameria]] up to [[Preveza]].&lt;ref name="Skendi453455"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Ekrem%20Vlora&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=453–455.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Balkan Wars]], he was given the rank of reserve major and the command of a territorial battalion for the defense of Vlora by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] commander in [[Ioannina]]. After several successful skirmishes with the Greek forces in the area of [[Himarë]], he was recalled to Vlora by his uncle, Ismail bey.

In 1912, he was made deputy president of the senate. He was sent in Neuwied to meet the Prince [[Wilhelm of Wied]], chosen to rule [[Albania]]. Later, he served in the Foreign Ministry during the Prince's reign and was distinguished as the commander of a volunteer artillery battery during the attack of [[Peasant Revolt in Albania|peasant rebels]] on  [[Durrës]]. He also received the Order of the Eagle for gallantry shown during the siege. He was a known supporter of the [[Central Powers]] during [[World War I]] for which reason he kept under arrest in Italy during most of the war but subsequently became a promoter of close relations between Italy and Albania. He was friendly towards the [[Italy|Italian]] commanders during the Italian invasion of Vlora in 1920. Vlora was elected to parliament in 1924, representing a conservative wing and, in 1925, became a senator for a short period of time. His relations with [[Ahmet Zogu]] were tenuous, though he served the latter on various diplomatic missions abroad. He was a close friend of the Bavarian baroness [[Marie Amelie von Godin|Marie Amelie, Freiin von Godin]], with whom he translated the ''[[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]]'' of [[Lekë Dukagjini]] into German.

Vlora welcomed the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian invasion]] of April 1939 and had close links to the Italian fascists. In 1942, [[Mustafa Merlika-Kruja]] appointed him Minister for [[Kosovo]], the western half of which had been incorporated to Albania. His anti-Slavic policies, however, gave rise to widespread resistance among the [[Serbs in Kosovo|Serbs]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the summer of 1944, he was made Foreign Minister and Minister of Justice before going into Italian exile during the communist takeover. He died in Vienna and was buried at the [[Neustift am Walde]] Cemetery till 30 March 2014. Since 30 March 2014 his remains were [[Burial#Exhumation|reinterred]] in Vlorë.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2014/03/30/eqerem-bej-vlora-rivarroset-ne-atdhe/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer==
As a writer, Eqrem bej Vlora is remembered for his monograph ''Aus Berat und vom Tomor: Tagebuchblätter'' ('From [[Berat]] and [[Tomorr]]: Pages of a Diary', {{Lang-sq|Nga Berati në Tomorr dhe kthim : ditar}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/aus-berat-und-vom-tomor/oclc/781262835&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat Catalog entry]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sarajevo]] 1911, and, in particular, for his two-volume German-language memoirs, published posthumously as ''Lebenserinnerungen'' ('Memoirs'), Munich 1968, 1973, which provide insight into the world of an early 20th-century Albanian nobleman. They have recently been translated into Albanian as ''Kujtime'' ('Memoirs'), Tirana 2002, and Turkish as ''Osmanli Arnavutluk'undan anilar, 1885-1912'' ('Notes from Ottoman Albania, 1885-1912'), [[Istanbul]] 2006. Unpublished remains his monumental 1200-page typescript ''Beiträge zur Geschichte der Türkenherrschaft in Albanien: eine historische Skizze'' ('Contributions to the History of Turkish Rule in Albania: an Historical Sketch'), from which this account of the noble families of [[Medieval Albania]] is taken.

'''Farkas Bethlen de Bethlen''' (1639&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1679)&lt;ref name='Markó_100'&gt;Markó 2006, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble and chronicler in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], who served as [[Chancellor of Transylvania]] from 1678 to 1679.

==Life==
Farkas was the son of Ferenc Bethlen, [[Ispán]] (Count; ''comes'') of [[Fehér County]], Marshal of [[George II Rákóczi]], and Kata Kemény de Magyargyerőmonostor. He had three sisters and five brothers. He married Borbála Ostrosith.

He studied in the [[John Sigismund Unitarian Academy|Unitarian Academy]] at [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]] (today: ''Cluj-Napoca, Romania''). After that his educator was Pál Keresztúri in the court of George II Rákóczi. He participated in the Prince's unsuccessful campaign against the [[Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1657. In the next year Rákóczi commissioned him to negotiate with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Habsburg Hungary]] in [[Pressburg]] and [[Vienna]] to organize an alliance against the [[Ottoman Empire]] which did not tolerate Rákóczi's foreign policy.

Farkas Bethlen served as Master of doorkeepers since March 1659. He also functioned as Ispán of Fehér County from 1661 until his death with a short break. After the death of Rákóczi he was a supporter of princes [[John Kemény (Prince)|John Kemény]] and [[Michael I Apafi]]. He was a member of the Royal Council since 1664. He took part in the Battle of Nagyszőlős, where John Kemény was killed. He served as acting Chancellor between 1676 and 1677 when his distant relative [[János Bethlen (1613–1678)|János Bethlen]] was charged with conspiracy. Farkas became Chancellor in 1678 however he died suddenly in the next year. The position remained vacant after his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5239">Frei '''João Álvares''' ([[Torres Novas]], {{circa}} 1400 – Paço de Sousa c. 1490) was a 15th-century [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[friar]] of a [[Military order (society)|military Order]], [[chronicle]]r and writer.
__NOTOC__
Álvares served as chamberlain and secretary of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] royal prince or ''[[infante]]'' [[Ferdinand the Saint Prince|the holy Ferdinand]], the youngest of the '[[Illustrious Generation (Portugal)|Illustrious Generation]]' ({{lang-pt|Ínclita Geração}}) – the children of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] and [[Philippa of Lancaster]]). He accompanied Ferdinand on the ill-fated [[Battle of Tangier (1437)|Portuguese campaign to conquer]] [[Tangier]] from [[Marinid]] Morocco in 1437. To preserve his army from destruction, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], commander of the expedition, signed a treaty that agreed to deliver [[Ceuta]] ([[Battle of Ceuta|captured]] by the Portuguese earlier in 1415) back to Morocco. Henry handed over his brother Ferdinand to the Marinids as a noble hostage to ensure the delivery of Ceuta. As a member of his household, Álvares accompanied Ferdinand into Moroccan captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 2000:p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

As it turns out, the Portuguese refused to honor the treaty and deliver Ceuta, with the result that Ferdinand was left in Marinid captivity, first at [[Asilah]], then at [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], where he eventually died in 1443. However, Álvares was successfully ransomed in 1448, five years after his master's death.&lt;ref&gt;Álvares, ''Chronica'', p.347&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Morocco in 1450 to ransom remaining captives and to collect the [[relic]]s of Ferdinand, who was now starting to be religiously [[saint|cultivated]] as the [[Ferdinand the Saint Prince|Holy Prince]] (''Infante Santo'') in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Álvares, ''Chronica'', p.347-48&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to [[Portugal]], Prince Henry commissioned Álvares to draft a chronicle of Ferdinand's life. Written by Álvares between 1451 and 1460 and first published in [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]] in 1527, it is one of the few eyewitness accounts of the Battle of Tangiers and the captivity of Ferdinand. Its details are often at odds with the account of official royal chronicler [[Rui de Pina]] and, despite being commissioned by Henry, often unflattering of Henry's leadership during the Tangier campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 2000:p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Intended as Christian [[hagiography]] to promote the [[saint]]ly [[cult (religious practice)#Roman Catholic ''cultus''|cult]] of Ferdinand, Álvares's chronicle details Ferdinand's patient endurance of the humiliations and sufferings he underwent in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] captivity. But Álvares refrains from endorsing the popular view that Ferdinand had volunteered for [[martyrdom]], making it reasonably clear that Ferdinand originally expected the treaty to be honored and his release to be secured swiftly.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 2000: p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before 1460, Álvares accompanied [[Isabella of Portugal (1397–1471)|Isabella of Portugal]] (Duchess of Burgundy) to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. He is also known to have traveled to Rome in 1470, seeking spiritual [[indulgences]] attached to the veneration of Ferdinand.

João Álvares was a member of the [[Military order (society)|military order]] of the [[Order of Aviz|Knights of St. Benedict of Aviz]] and in 1461 was named [[commendatory abbot]] of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at Paço de Sousa (near [[Penafiel Municipality|Penafiel]] in northern [[Portugal]]). He translated several religious works into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], including the first edition of ''[[The Imitation of Christ (book)|The Imitation of Christ]]'' of [[Thomas à Kempis]]. He died in Paço de Sousa around 1490.

A '''geofact''' (a portmanteau of "geology" and "artifact") is a natural [[Rock (geology)|stone]] formation that is difficult to distinguish from a man-made [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]. Geofacts could be fluvially reworked and be misinterpreted as an artifact, especially when compared to paleolithic artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demeter | first1 = F | last2 = Patole | first2 =  | last3 = Edoumba | first3 = E | last4 = Duringer | first4 = P | last5 = Bacon | first5 = AM | last6 = Sytha | first6 = P | last7 = Bano | first7 = M | last8 = Laychour | first8 = V | last9 = Cheangleng | first9 = M | last10 = Sari | first10 = V | year = 2010 | title = Reinterpretation of an archaeological pebble culture from the Middle Mekong River Valley, Cambodia | doi = 10.1002/gea.20298 | journal = Geoarchaeology | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the proposed criteria for distinguishing geofacts from artifacts for paleolithic specimens resembling debitage have been subjected to evaluation by experimental and actualistic studies. If the artifact has two or more of the following, then the artifact is more than likely to be a geofact.

Distinguishing geofacts from lithic debitage, through experiments and comparisons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440314003392 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2014.09.006 | volume=52 | title=Comparative methods for distinguishing flakes from geofacts: a case study from the Wenas Creek Mammoth site | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | pages=308–320 | year=2014 | last1 = Lubinski | first1 = Patrick M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible examples include several purported prominent ancient artifacts, such as the [[Venus of Berekhat Ram]] and the [[Venus of Tan-Tan]]. These are thought by many in the archaeological community to be geofacts.  A site which shows an abundance of what are likely geofacts is [[Marine archaeology in the Gulf of Cambay|the Gulf of Cambay]].

Geofacts versus artifacts or as British scientists refer “artefacts” are just one of the battles archaeologists go through while excavating a site. In the article, “Artefact-Geofact Analysis of The Lithic Material from The Susiluola Cave,” by Hans-Peter Schulz (2007) whom explained Geofacts are multi-shaped rocks that can be found while archaeologists are trying to find true artifacts during past glacial periods. Glacial periods such as the Eemian interglacial and the Middle Weichselian glaciation located in the northern parts of the world melted and began to move rocks from their original areas while they scraped everything around them. The rock movement created sometimes weapon like spears from smaller rocks and appear as artifacts but instead are just a product of glacial melting. Another element Schulz explained is the mixing of natural and salt water during the glaciations, which changed sediment locations within rocks such as the Susiluola cave located in Finland. Once the ice melted the sediment and ice created some artificial markings on pebble sized rocks. Some elements that could morph rock shapes in caves include sandstone, siltstone and quartzite creating a kinetic process of shaping the rocks. There are measurements Schulz created to distinguish a geofact such as blow angles from a sandstone or quartzite rock with a limit between 45 and 90 degrees, and if the abrasions were rounded these are considered geofacts.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, P. H.  (2007, December 20). Artefact-Geofact Analysis of The Lithic Material from The Susiluola Cave. www.sarks.fi/fa, 64-75. Retrieved from http://www.sarks.fi/fa/PDF/FA24_64.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are interpreted as geofacts so often that they have entire articles filled with correcting excavations. Archeological geologist Paul V. Henrich (2002) corrects journalist Graham Hancock in article, “Artifacts or Geofacts? Alternative Interpretations of Items from the Gulf of Cambay” of his alleged artifacts found in the Gulf of Cambay, India is geofacts. Henrich illustrates in pictures that these designed artifacts were a combination of cement, layered coarse and fine laminated sand stacked tightly together from lamented lake silts with enough porosity appearing rigid to look like a human design. Other corrections Henrich made were Hancock’s “Cambay pendants” large flat rock objects with a hole in between assumed as jewelry but are naturally formed holes created by marine organisms. Henrich claims during excavations the team should have a geologist on site because they are experts in rock formations to help distinguish between an artifact and geofact.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, V. P. (2002, May 8). Artifacts or Geofacts? Alternative Interpretations of Items from the Gulf of Cambay. Intersurf.com, 1-16. Retrieved from http://www.intersurf.com/~chalcedony/geofact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts mixed with human remains can certainly contain mixtures of Geofacts. In the article, “The alleged Early Paleolithic artefacts are in reality geofacts: a revision of the site of Konczyce Weilkie 4 in the Moravian Gate, South Poland,” Wiśniewski et. all. (2014), explain when geofacts are mixed with artifacts in a fluvial gravel pit it becomes very difficult to distinguish between the two. Another issue Wisniewski questioned is if the site was livable during the Paleolithic period because artifacts are mobile and therefore would not be found in situ however, rocks that are native to the area would usually be a geofact. A helpful hint to decide if an item is an artifact or geofact is if there are multiple rocks that have similar edges and shapes and this type of rock is in its natural environment then it is most likely a geofact. An argument the previous excavators claimed was that some rocks were found over 140 meters from their original environment meaning they could have been artifacts moved by humans. However this was quickly refuted because evidence in glacial moraines and fluvial-glacial deposits caused many rocks to move a similar distance from their original environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiśniewski |first1=A. |last2=Badura |first2=J. |last3=Salamon |first3=T. |last4=Lewandowski |first4=J. |year=2014 |title=The alleged early palaeolithic artefacts are in reality geofacts: A revision of the site of kończyce wielkie 4 in the moravian gate, south poland |url=http://xerxes.calstate.edu/fullerton/articles/record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-g588-b71d672a071acee89b281df1b7ca311cb5181354c6b7bb57f02ae79bb7f1caa43 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=52 |issue= |pages=189–203 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2014.07.022 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly distinguishing geofacts from artifacts is not a simple task however, if excavators stick with the proper requirements and assumptions there will be far less misinterpretations in the future.

{{Aztecbox}} 
The [[Aztecs]] were a Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]]n people of central [[Mexico]] in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. They called themselves Mexicah (pronounced [meˈʃikaʔ]). 
 
The capital of the [[Aztec Empire]] was [[Tenochtitlan]]. During the empire, the city was built on a raised island in Lake Angels. Modern-day [[Mexico City]] was constructed on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish colonisation of the Americas reached the mainland during the reign of [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] Moctezuma II (Montezuma II). In 1521, [[Hernán Cortés]], along with an allied army of other Native Americans, conquered the Aztecs through germ warfare (germ theory not being established until 1560 by earliest records, this was an unintentional result of Europeans coming to the New World), siege warfare, psychological warfare, and from direct combat.

From 1376 until 1572, the Mexicah were a tributary of [[Azcapotzalco]]. The Aztec rulers [[Acamapichtli]], [[Huitzilihuitl]] and [[Chimalpopoca]] were, in fact, vassals of [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]], the [[Tepanec]] ruler of Azcapotzalco.

When Tezozomoc died in 1421, his son [[Malazia]] ascended to the throne of Azcapotzalco. Matla (nick name) sought to tighten Azcapotzalco's grip on the nearby city-states in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. In the process, Chimalpopoca, [[tlatoani]]  of Tenochtitlan, was assassinated by Maxtla's agents while [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] was forced into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/474227/pre-Columbian-civilizations/69388/The-historical-annals?anchor=ref583519|title=Pre-Columbian civilizations|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in the Valley of Mexico==

In the Valley of Mexico (c. AD 1250), there existed numerous city-states, including Chalco, Xochimilco, Tlacopan, Culhuacan, and Atzcapotzalco. The most powerful were Culhuacan on the south shore of Lake Texcoco and Azcapotzalco on the west shore.
 
As a result, when the Mexica arrived in the Valley of Mexico as a semi-nomadic tribe, they found most of the area already occupied. In roughly 1248,&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1984) p. 173.  In arriving at 1248, Smith averages together dates from [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]] (1245), the [[Annals of Tlatelolco]] (1257), the [[Annals of Cuauhtitlanzx]] (1246), [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc]] (1247), and [[Diego Duran]] (1245).&lt;/ref&gt; they first settled on Chapultepec, a hill on the west shore of Lake Texcoco, the site of numerous springs.
 
In time, the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco ousted the Mexica from Chapultepec and the ruler of Culhuacan, Cocoxtli, gave the Mexicah permission to settle in the empty barrens of Tizaapan in 1299. There they married and assimilated into Culhuacan culture.
 
In 1323, they asked the new ruler of Culhuacan, Achicometl, for his daughter, in order to make her the goddess Yaocihuatl. Unknown to the king, the Mexicah actually planned to sacrifice her. The Mexicah believed that by doing this the princess would join the gods as a deity. As the story goes, during a festival dinner, a priest came out wearing her flayed skin as part of the ritual. Upon seeing this, the king and the people of Culhuacan were horrified and expelled the Mexicah.
 
Forced to flee, in 1325 they went to a small island on the west side of Lake Texcoco where they began to build their city Tenochtitlan, eventually creating a large artificial island. It is said that the Aztec god, Huitzilopochtli, instructed the Aztecs to found their city at the location where they saw an eagle, on a cactus, with a snake in its talons (which is on the current Mexican flag). The Aztecs, apparently, saw this vision on the small island where Tenochtitlan was founded.
 
Another Mexica (meːˈʃiʔkaʔ) group settled on the north side of this island: this would become the city of Tlatelolco. Originally, this was an independent Mexicah kingdom, but eventually it was absorbed by Tenochtitlan, and treated as a "fifth" quadrant. The famous marketplace described by Hernán Cortés and Bernal Diaz del Castillo was actually located in Tlatelolco.
 
In 1376 the Mexica elected their first tlatoani, Acamapichtli, following customs learned from the Culhuacan. These customs required cleaning daily nonstop as a ritual.

==Aztec Triple Alliance==
{{main|Aztec Triple Alliance}}

The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], and [[Tlacopan]] would, in the next 100 years, come to dominate and extend its power to both the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] shores. From the beginning of the Triple Alliance, Tenochtitlan was mostly in charge of the military and conquest, whereas the other two cities had other responsibilities. This military dominance of Tenochtitlan gradually led to this city becoming the dominant power in the alliance. When the alliance received tributes 2/5 went to Tenochitlan, 2/5 to Texcoco, and 1/5 to Tlacopan.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Mexico and Central America&lt;/ref&gt;

===The reign of Itzcoatl 1427–1440===
The first Tlatoani of the Triple Alliance was Itzcoatl and he, along with his Texcocan co-ruler [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], began expanding the territory dominated by the alliance towards the south, conquering Nahua-speaking cities like [[Cuauhnahuac]] (now [[Cuernavaca]]), and towards [[Huexotla]], [[Coatlinchan]], and [[Tepoztlan]] in the modern-day state of [[Morelos]] which was then dominated by the [[Tlahuica]]. During this period the Nahuan cities immediately on the lakeside, such as [[Xochimilco]], [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] and [[Mixquic]] were also subdued.

===Moctezuma I and Tlacaelel 1440–1469===
Two of the primary architects of the Aztec empire were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I]].  They were sons of [[Huitzilíhuitl]], the 3rd ''Hueyi Tlatoani'', half-brothers to have they were called ---&gt; [[Chimalpopoca]], the 4th ''Hueyi Tlatoani'', and nephews of [[Itzcoatl]], the 5th.  [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the 6th ''Hueyi Tlatoani'' in 1449.   Tlacaelel became the power behind the throne and reformed both the Aztec state and the Aztec religion.

Moctezuma I began the expansion in earnest. First he had to reconquer towns which were first conquered by Itzcoatl, but had since rebelled. He asked a number of smaller cities to contribute to the construction of a new Great Temple, and only [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]] refused, which caused Moctezuma to start a war against them which lasted for several years. He then conquered Huastec territory under a pretext of securing Aztec merchants in that area, and then he went to war against the Mixtecs of Coixtlahuaca. Coixtlahuaca was successfully conquered although the Mixtec ruler Atonal received military assistance from the Nahua states of Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco, by now enemies of the Aztecs. After the defeat of Coixtlahuaca many Mixtec artisans were relocated to the Aztec capital.&lt;ref&gt;According to Richard Townsends "The Aztecs" pp88. Thames and Hudson 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Moctezuma marched upon the Totonacan cities of Vera Cruz and conquered ''[[Xalapa]]'', ''Cosamaloapan'', Cotaxtla (modern day Cuetlachtlan), Ahuilizapan (Modern day [[Orizaba]]) and north into Huastec territory conquering [[Tuxpan]] and Xilotepec.

====Tlacaelel====
Tlacaelel was one of the primary architects of the Aztec empire.  Rising to prominence during the war against the Tepanec in the late 1420s, Tlacaelel wielded power as something of a [[vizier|Grand Vizier]] during the reigns of four ''Hueyi Tlatoani'', until his death in 1487.

Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a [[chosen people]] and elevated the tribal god/hero [[Huitzilopochtli]] to the top of the pantheon of gods.  In tandem with this, Tlacaelel increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Durán). During the reign of Moctezuma I, he instigated the [[flower war]]s in which the Aztecs fought [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other Nahuan city-states.

To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce [[sumptuary]] laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks.

At the start of Tlacaelel's tenure, the Mexica were vassals.  By the end, they had become the Aztecs, rulers of a socially stratified and expansionistic empire.

===The reigns of Axayacatl 1469–1481 and Tizoc 1481–1486===
Moctezuma I's son, [[Axayacatl]], ascended to the throne in 1469.  During his reign, Tenochtitlan absorbed the kingdom of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].  Axayacatl's sister was married to the ''tlatoani'' of Tlatelolco, and, as a pretext for war, Axayacatl declared that she was mistreated.

He went on to conquer the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] and [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] cities of [[Tollocan]], [[Ocuillan]], and [[Malinalco]] west of the Valley of Mexico.

At this point Tenochtitlan experienced a brief "civil war" when the small city of Tlatelolco, considered a part of Tenochtitlan by the Aztecs, rebelled under their Tlatoani [[Moquihuix]], who sought to ally himself with the longstanding enemies of the Tenochca, the Chalca, Tlaxcalteca, Chololteca and Huexotzinca. The Tlatelolca were defeated and Axayacatl then ordered the execution of all the rulers who had aided him, including the ruler of Xochimilco.

Continuing campaigns in the west in 1479, he suffered an unprecedented defeat by the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]]. This was the Aztecs' first great defeat; once recovered he had to consolidate control of the [[Huasteca]] region which had already been conquered by his predecessor.

In 1481 Axayacatl's brother [[Tizoc]] ruled briefly, but his rule was marred by the humiliation he received  in his coronation war: fighting the [[Otomi people|Otomi]]es at Metztitlan he brought home only 40 prisoners for sacrifice at his coronation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Richard 1992. pp 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After this defeat Tizoc had to fight principally to maintain control of the already conquered territories, and failing to subdue new towns he was replaced, possibly poisoned, by his younger brother [[Ahuitzotl]].

===The reign of Moctezuma II Xocoyotzin===
Moctezuma II was, although many sources depict him otherwise, a notable warrior who extended the tributary system, and consolidated the conquests made by his predecessors as well as conquering new territories. His campaigns reached as far south as Tapachula in the Soconusco region and the Chontal Maya states of Xicallanco in Tabasco. Only the Aztec archenemies of Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco and the Purépecha remained undefeated, as well as the Mixtec kingdoms of [[Tututepec]] and Yopitzinco which didn't interest the Aztecs. Thus the Aztec Empire had its largest geographical extent when the Spaniards arrived in 1519. In some sources, it claims that Moctezuma II, and the Aztecs, believed the arriving Spanish to linked to the supposed return of an exiled god, [[Quetzlcoatl]], who was supposed to return pale and bearded.

==Fall of the Aztec Empire==
:''For more on the conquest of Mexico by Spain, see also [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico]], [[Siege of Tenochtitlan]], and [[Hernán Cortés]].''

The Aztecs were conquered by Spain in 1521 after a long [[Siege of Tenochtitlan|siege of the capital, Tenochtitlan]], where much of the population died from hunger and [[smallpox]]. Cortés, with 508 Spaniards, did not fight alone but with as many as 150,000 or 200,000 allies from [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], and eventually other Aztec tributary states. It was not difficult for Cortes to find allies to fight with him, the Aztecs were not generally liked by the neighbouring city-states. [[Cuauhtémoc]], the last ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' surrendered to Cortés on August 13, 1521.

It took nearly another 60 years of war before the Spaniards completed the conquest of Mesoamerica (the [[Chichimeca]] wars), a process that could have taken longer were it not for three separate epidemics, including a rare strain of [[paratyphoid fever]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/16/mexico-500-years-later-scientists-discover-what-killed-the-aztecs|title=Mexico: 500 years later, scientists discover what killed the Aztecs|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|via=The Guardian|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that took a heavy toll on the remaining Native American population.  The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] took almost 170 years.

After the fall of Tenochtitlan, most of the other Mesoamerican cultures remained intact. In fact, the conquest of the Aztec empire did not have an immediate impact on other Mesoamerican cultures.

As allies of the Spaniards, the Tlaxcalans gained the most.  The Spaniards would eventually break the alliance, but not until decades later.

Dr. '''Josip Mikoczy-Blumenthal''' ({{lang-hu|Mikóczy-Blumenthal József}}; February, 1734 in [[Zagreb]] &amp;ndash; 22 March 1800 in Zagreb) was a [[Croatia]]n historian and founder of the [[Croats#Origins|Theory of Croatian Kurdish origin]] in 1797.

== Biography ==
Josip Mikoczy-Blumenthal was born in Zagreb on 2 March 1734.&lt;ref&gt;Fališevac, Dunja - Nemec, Krešimir - Novaković, Darko - (2000)''Leksikon hrvatskih pisaca''. Zagreb: Školska knjiga&lt;/ref&gt; He finished [[Jesuit]] gymnasium in Zagreb and became professor in university in [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]. Since 1773 he worked as a professor of rhetoric and [[Greek language]]. He became librarian in Faculty of Law in Zagreb in 1792 and from 1793 until 1797 he worked in its historiographical department. Dr. Mikoczy-Blumenthal died in 1800.

== Work ==
Important works of Dr. Mikoczy-Blumenthal include ''Josephi Mikocsi otiorum Croatiae liber unus'' in 1806 which was the first historiographical debate in Croatia and ''Banorum Dalmatiae, Croatiae et Slavoniae ad seculum XIV. perducta series 1792'' in which he gave detailed and thorough list of all Croatian bans through five centuries. Others non published works include ''Lexicon historicum et topographicum'' and ''Geographica descriptio Croatiae et Slavoniae''.

However, his most important work is "'''Hrvati rodom Slaveni, potekli od Sarmata potomaka Medijaca'''" (eng. "[[Croats]] of [[Slavs|Slavic]] group originated from [[Sarmatians]] descending from [[Medes|Medians]]") which he defended as a doctoral dissertation in Royal Academy in Zagreb in 1797. With this work he became the founder of Croatian Iranian origin theory. According to him Croats were people descending from Medes from western [[Iran]]. His dissertation mysteriously disappeared during [[Yugoslavia]] in which this theory was officially banned and punishable by law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">The '''Lenaia''' ({{lang-grc|Λήναια}}) was an annual [[Athenian festival]] with a [[drama]]tic [[Agon|competition]]. It was one of the lesser festivals of [[Athens]] and [[Ionia]] in [[ancient Greece]]. The Lenaia took place in Athens in the month of [[Attic calendar|Gamelion]], roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of [[Dionysus|Dionysus Lenaios]].&lt;ref name=B20/&gt; 

"Lenaia" probably comes from "''lenos''" 'wine-press' or from "''lenai''", another name for the [[Maenad]]s (the female worshippers of Dionysus).

==Overview==
The Lenaia is depicted on numerous vases, which show both typical Maenad scenes and those of aristocrats and [[wine]]-mixing rituals. It is unknown exactly what kind of worship occurred at the festival, but it may have been in honor of Dionysus as a youth or the rebirth of Dionysus after his murder by the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It may have also had some connection with the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], as some of the same religious officials were involved (such as the ''[[Archon basileus]] '' and the ''[[epimeletai]]''). These officials led the procession (πομπή ''pompe''), which probably ended with a [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] of some kind.

In Athens, the festival was originally held in the Lenaion (possibly a theatre outside the city or a section of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]]) but probably moved to the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] by the mid-fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Slater (1998, 123)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the second half of the 5th century BCE, plays were performed (as they were at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] festival later in the year). The audiences for the Lenaia were usually limited to the local population, since travel by sea at that time of year was considered unsafe.&lt;ref name=B20&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 20).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metic]]s, however, were apparently allowed to both participate and act as [[Choregos|''choregoi'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theposthole.org/read/article/314|title=Reconstructing the Lenaia|last=Swallow|first=Peter|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 442 BCE, new comic contests were officially included in the Lenaia, though plays may have been performed there earlier on an informal basis.&lt;ref name=B20/&gt; At first, the festival held dramatic competitions only for [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]], but in 432 BCE a [[Tragedy|tragic]] contest was introduced. Many of [[Aristophanes]]' plays were first performed there, such as 'Knights'. As with the competition at the City Dionysia, five comedies usually competed (except during the [[Peloponnesian War]] when only three were staged). When the contest for tragedy was introduced, two tragedians competed, each presenting two plays. No contests for [[satyr play]]s, nor for the singing and dancing of [[dithyramb]]s, were included.&lt;ref name=B21&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 21).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the century, the festival's plays were performed in the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] (though it is unclear when this location was first used).&lt;ref name=B20/&gt; It is unknown when the Lenaia was abandoned, but contests of some sort continued into the 2nd century BCE.

[[File:Yagan of the Bibbulmun cover.png|thumb|right|A black and white scan of the cover of Mary Durack's 1976 children's novel ''Yagan of the Bibbulmun'', with illustrations by [[Revel Cooper]].]]

'''Dame Mary Durack''' [[Order of Australia|AC]], [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (20 February 1913 – 16 December 1994) was an Australian author and historian. She wrote ''[[Kings in Grass Castles]]'' and ''Keep Him My Country''.

==Childhood==
Mary Durack, born in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, to [[Michael Durack|Michael Patrick Durack]] (1865–1950) and Bessie Durack (née Johnstone), and her siblings lived at the remote [[Argyle Downs]] and [[Ivanhoe Station|Ivanhoe]] [[Station (Australian agriculture)|cattle stations]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of [[Western Australia]]. In the late 1920s and early 1930s Mary and her sister Elizabeth would manage the Ivanhoe cattle station, whilst their brother would leave to manage Argyle Downs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durack|first=Elizabeth|last2=Walsh-Smith|first2=Joan|date=2000|title=Mary Durack: A Tribute|url=|journal=Studies in Western Australian History|volume=20|pages=170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these times they would live and work very closely with the indigenous people who worked on, and lived near the station. They learnt from the local indigenous women everything from how to cook to how to muster cattle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Durack family were pioneers in the settlement of the area by Europeans. The story of her family's history, beginning with the mid-19th century migration from Ireland, is presented by Durack in ''[[Kings in Grass Castles]]'', and its sequel, ''Sons in the Saddle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/durack-michael-patrick-6062|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=G. C.|last=Bolton|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=4 August 2016|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
In 1935 Mary and her sister, [[Elizabeth Durack|Elizabeth]], were to publish their first collaboration. The text in ''All About: The Story of a Black Community on Argyle Station'' was supplied by Mary and the illustrations were by Elizabeth. The collaboration was to produce a number of children's books: ''Chunuma'' in 1936; ''Son of Djaro'' and the ''Way of the Whirlwind'' in 1940–1941;''The Magic Trumpet'' in 1946 and ''To Ride a Fine Horse'' (1963).

Mary Durack wrote under the name "Virgilia" for [[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]] between 1934–38, in a column for women and children in rural areas called Virgilians' Friendly Corner. The column represented some of the first work Durack published as a paid writer, however, she felt limited by the demands of her readers and would often hide in her office to avoid meeting with fans of 'The Corner'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=True North: The Story of Mary and Elizabeth Durack|last=Niall|first=Brenda|publisher=The Text Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=59-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 she wrote the novel ''Keep Him My Country''. Other important works include the saga of the Durack family, ''Kings in Grass Castles'' (1959) and its sequel, ''Sons in the Saddle''; and a play, ''Swan River Saga: Life of Early Pioneer Eliza Shaw'' (1976). A biography, ''To Be Heirs Forever'', also used [[Eliza Shaw]] as a subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Durack also continued to write children's literature, most notably the story of the [[Nyungar]] man, [[Yagan]], which was published in 1964 as ''The Courteous Savage: Yagan of the Bibbulmun''&lt;ref&gt;Later published as simply ''Yagan of the Bibbulmun''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tjakamarra: Boy between two worlds.''

Other works by Mary Durack included a two–act play, ''Ship of Dreams''; an Australian Settler (1968);&lt;ref&gt;Published in Australia as ''A Pastoral Immigrant''&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rock and the Sand'' (1969) is a history of missionaries in the state; ''The Aborigines in Australian Literature'' (1978) is part of the non-fiction component of her work, a subject often forming the basis of many of her works of fiction.

Durack adapted ''Keep Him My Country'' into the libretto for a one-act opera, ''Dalgerie'', by [[James Penberthy]]; it premiered in [[Perth]] on 22 January 1959.  On 25 July 1973, along with [[Larry Sitsky]]'s ''The Fall of the House of Usher'', it was one of the first two operas to be given an evening performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref name="GriffelBlock1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Ross Griffel|author2=Adrienne Fried Block|title=Operas in English: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxIKAQAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-25310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the philosophical concept|the Italian political concept|Meliorism (politics)}}

'''Meliorism''' is an idea in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] thinking holding that [[Progress (history)|progress]] is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world.  It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary [[liberal democracy]] and [[human rights]] and is a basic component of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/SPRCFile/dp068.pdf|title=Liberalism, gender and social policy|author=Shaver, S.|date=July 1996|editor=T. Eardly|publisher=Social Policy Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].

Meliorism has also been used by [[Arthur Caplan]] to describe positions in [[bioethics]] that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]] is that of [[perfectibility of man]].  

Condorcet's statement, "Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the ''perfectibility of man'' is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the controul of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/condorcet-outlines-of-an-historical-view-of-the-progress-of-the-human-mind "Outlines of an historical view of the progress of the human mind"] [1795]&lt;/ref&gt; anticipates James' meliorism.

Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J. J., (1754). [http://www.liupoliticalphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/5019_Rousseau_Discourse_on_the_Origin_of_Inequality.pdf "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality"(Translated by G. D. H. Cole)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''New Atheism''' is a term coined in 2006 by the [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] journalist [[Gary Wolf (journalist)|Gary Wolf]] to describe the positions promoted by some [[History of atheism#Twenty-first century|atheists of the twenty-first century]].&lt;ref&gt;Lois Lee &amp; Stephen Bullivant, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XguDDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48 A Dictionary of Atheism]'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html?pg=1&amp;topic=atheism&amp;topic_set= Wolff, Gary, in ''The New Atheism'', The Church of the Non-Believers reprinted in Wired Magazine, November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This modern-day [[atheism]] is advanced by a group of thinkers and writers who advocate the view that [[superstition]], [[religion]] and [[irrationalism]] should not simply be tolerated but should be [[Antireligion|countered]], [[Criticism of religion|criticized]], and exposed by rational argument wherever their influence arises in government, education, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|title=New Atheists|website=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=The New Atheists are authors of early twenty-first century books promoting atheism. These authors include Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens.

New Atheism lends itself to and often overlaps with [[secular humanism]] and [[antitheism]], particularly in its criticism of what many New Atheists regard as the [[indoctrination]] of children and the perpetuation of [[ideologies]] founded on belief in the supernatural. Some critics of the movement characterise it pejoratively as "militant atheism" or "fundamentalist atheism".{{efn|The term is sometimes used benignly, for example by atheists such as Frans de Waal.&lt;ref name=DeWaal/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=DeWaal&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans |authorlink1=Frans de Waal|title=Has militant atheism become a religion? |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/25/militant_atheism_has_become_a_religion/ |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=9 March 2017 |date=25 March 2013 |quote=Why are the 'neo-atheists' of today so obsessed with God's nonexistence that they go on media rampages, wear T-shirts proclaiming their absence of belief, or call for a militant atheism?

==History==
===Early history===

The Harvard botanist [[Asa Gray]], a believing Christian and one of the first supporters of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], commented in 1868 that the more worldly Darwinists in England had "the English-materialistic-positivistic line of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet The ''Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), page 310&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] was openly skeptical, as the biographer Janet Browne describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Huxley was rampaging on miracles and the existence of the soul. A few months later, he was to coin the word "agnostic" to describe his own position as neither a believer nor a disbeliever, but one who considered himself free to inquire rationally into the basis of knowledge, a philosopher of pure reason [...] The term fitted him well [...] and it caught the attention of the other free thinking, rational doubters in Huxley's ambit, and came to signify a particularly active form of scientific rationalism during the final decades of the 19th century. [...] In his hands, agnosticism became as doctrinaire as anything else--a religion of skepticism. Huxley used it as a creed that would place him on a higher moral plane than even bishops and archbishops. All the evidence would nevertheless suggest that Huxley was sincere in his rejection of the charge of outright atheism against himself. He refused to be "a liar". To inquire rigorously into the spiritual domain, he asserted, was a more elevated undertaking than slavishly to believe or disbelieve. "A deep sense of religion is compatible with the entire absence of theology," he had told [Anglican clergyman] Charles Kingsley back in 1860. "Pope Huxley", the [magazine] ''Spectator'' dubbed him. The label stuck." —Janet Browne&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet ''The Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), pages 309-310&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent history===

The 2004 publication of ''[[The End of Faith|The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]]'' by [[Sam Harris]], a bestseller in the United States, was joined over the next couple years by a series of popular best-sellers by atheist authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/09/hitchens200709|title=God Bless Me, It's a Best-Seller!|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=...in the last two years there have been five atheist best-sellers, one each from Professors Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and two from the neuroscientist Sam Harris.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was motivated by the events of [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], which he laid directly at the feet of Islam, while also directly criticizing [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Sam |authorlink=Sam Harris |date=11 August 2004 |title=The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason |publisher=[[W.

In a 2010 column entitled "Why I Don't Believe in the New Atheism", [[Tom Flynn (author)|Tom Flynn]] contends that what has been called "New Atheism" is neither a movement nor new, and that what was new was the publication of atheist material by big-name publishers, read by millions, and appearing on bestseller lists.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Flynn | first = Tom | authorlink = Thomas W.

On 6 November 2015, the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' published an article entitled, ''Is the New Atheism dead?''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/123349/new-atheism-dead ''Is the New Atheism dead?] by Elizabeth Bruenig, New Republic, 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The atheist and evolutionary biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]] wrote, "The world appears to be tiring of the New Atheism movement.."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/article/the-new-atheism-as-a-stealth-religion-five-years-later/ The New Atheism as a Stealth Religion: Five Years Later] by David Sloan Wilson, Evolution Institute website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[PZ Myers]] who formerly considered himself a new atheist, publicly renounced the New Atheism movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/07/31/the-new-atheism-is-dead-long-live-atheism/ The New Atheism is dead.

[[Sam Harris]] is the author of the bestselling non-fiction books ''[[The End of Faith]]'', ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'', as well as two shorter works, initially published as e-books, ''Free Will''&lt;ref name="Free Will"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Harris (author)|year=2012|title=Free Will|publisher=The Free Press |isbn=978-1451683400|page=96 |id= {{ASIN|1451683405|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Lying''.&lt;ref name=Lying&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|title=Lying|year=2013|publisher=Four Elephants Press|isbn=978-1940051000|page=108|id= {{ASIN|1940051002|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris is a co-founder of the Reason Project.

He is the founder of the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]]. He wrote: "I don't object to the horseman label, by the way. I'm less keen on 'new atheist': it isn't clear to me how we differ from old atheists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 10th anniversary edition, Black Swan, 2016, page I15 (new introduction for the 10th anniversary edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Hitchens served on the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. In 2010 Hitchens published his memoir ''[[Hitch-22]]'' (a nickname provided by close personal friend [[Salman Rushdie]], whom Hitchens always supported during and following [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''The Satanic Verses'' controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitch22 |year=2010 |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-843-54922-2 |page=448 |id= {{ASIN|1843549220|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its publication, Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which led to his death in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christopher Hitchens dies at 62 after suffering cancer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16212418 |publisher=BBC News|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Hitchens published a collection of essays and articles in his book ''Arguably'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=Arguably|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-0857892584|id= {{ASIN|0857892584|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short edition ''Mortality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher |title=Mortality |year=2012 |publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1848879218|id= {{ASIN|1848879210|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published posthumously in 2012. These publications and numerous public appearances provided Hitchens with a platform to remain an astute atheist during his illness, even speaking specifically on the culture of [[deathbed conversion]]s and condemning attempts to convert the [[terminally ill]], which he opposed as "bad taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Is there an afterlife? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbzd6ZbCowY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitchens and Paxman interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-s9AyNQyCw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Plus one horse-woman"====
After the death of Hitchens, [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (who attended the 2012 [[Global Atheist Convention]], which Hitchens was scheduled to attend) was referred to as the "plus one horse-woman", since she was originally invited to the 2007 meeting of the "Horsemen" atheists but had to cancel at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=sOMjEJ3JO5Q|title=Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris &amp; Ayaan Hirsi Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was born in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], fleeing in 1992 to the [[Netherlands]] in order to escape an [[arranged marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/individual_member/2663/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became involved in Dutch politics, rejected faith, and became vocal in opposing Islamic ideology, especially concerning women, as exemplified by her books ''Infidel'' and ''The Caged Virgin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan |authorlink=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|title=The Caged Virgin|year=2008 |isbn=978-0743288347 |id= {{ASIN|0743288343|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was later involved in the production of the film ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'', for which her friend [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] was murdered with a death threat to Hirsi Ali pinned to his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial film maker killed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/controversial-filmmaker-shot-dead-531777.html | location=London | work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event resulted in Hirsi Ali's hiding and later immigration to the United States, where she now resides and remains a prolific critic of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Christians in the Muslim world |url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/02/05/ayaan-hirsi-ali-the-global-war-on-christians-in-the-muslim-world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regularly speaks out against the treatment of women in Islamic doctrine and society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsi Ali |first=Ayaan|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Protecting Women From Militant Islam |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-on-Protecting-Women-From-Militant-Islam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a proponent of free speech and the freedom to offend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=The Right to Offend|url=http://www.project-reason.org/archive/item/the_right_to_offend_a_speech_by_ayaan_hirsi_ali/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Muslim Rage and the Last Gasp of Islamic Hate|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/09/16/ayaan-hirsi-ali-on-the-islamists-final-stand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspective==
Many contemporary atheists write from a scientific perspective. Unlike previous writers, many of whom thought that science was indifferent or even incapable of dealing with the "[[God]]" concept, Dawkins argues to the contrary, claiming the "God Hypothesis" is a valid [[hypothesis|scientific hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | title = The God Delusion | location = Boston | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having effects in the physical universe, and like any other hypothesis can be tested and [[falsifiability|falsified]]. The late [[Victor Stenger]] proposed that the personal [[Abrahamic religions#The Supreme Deity|Abrahamic God]] is a scientific hypothesis that can be tested by standard methods of science. Both Dawkins and Stenger conclude that the hypothesis fails any such tests,&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] is sufficient to explain everything we observe in the universe, from the most distant galaxies to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], the existence of different species, and the inner workings of the brain and [[consciousness]]. Nowhere, they argue, is it necessary to introduce God or the [[supernatural]] to understand reality. New Atheists reject [[Jesus]]' divinity.&lt;ref name=Jr.2008&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Albert Mohler Jr.|title=Atheism Remix: A Christian Confronts the New Atheists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaM4GEDD0MC&amp;pg=PA56|date=25 July 2008|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-2262-8|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific testing of religion===
Non-believers assert that many religious or supernatural claims (such as the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] and the [[afterlife]]) are scientific claims in nature. They argue, as do [[deists]] and [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christians]], for instance, that the issue of Jesus' supposed parentage is not a question of "values" or "morals" but a question of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name=freeinquiry&gt;{{cite journal| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 | title = When Religion Steps on Science's Turf : The Alleged Separation Between the Two Is Not So Tidy | journal = Free Inquiry Magazine | volume = 18 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational thinkers believe science is capable of investigating at least some, if not all, supernatural claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Yonatan | last = Fishman | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/Yon/test_supernatural2007.pdf | title = Can Science Test Supernatural Worldviews? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions such as the [[Mayo Clinic]] and [[Duke University]] are attempting to find [[empiricism|empirical]] support for the [[Studies on intercessory prayer|healing power of intercessory prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/supernatural_science300106.htm | title = Supernatural Science | first = Victor J. | last = Stenger | authorlink=Victor J Stenger | publisher = mukto-mona }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stenger, these experiments have thus far found no evidence that intercessory [[prayer]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=The new atheism : taking a stand for science and reason|date=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=[[Amherst, New York]]|isbn=978-1-59102-751-5|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical arguments===
Stenger also argues in his book, ''[[God: The Failed Hypothesis]]'', that a God having [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] attributes, which he termed a ''3O God'', cannot [[logic]]ally exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=God : the failed hypothesis : how science shows that God does not exist|date=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst (New York)|isbn=978-1-59102-481-1|edition=[Nachdr.]|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar series of logical disproofs of the existence of a God with various attributes can be found in [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] and Ricki Monnier's ''[[The Impossibility of God]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Michael Martin (philosopher) | first1 = Michael | last1 = Martin | authorlink2 = Ricki Monnier | first2 = Ricki | last2 = Monnier | title = The Impossibility of God | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Theodore M. Drange's article, "Incompatible-Properties Arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Incompatible-Properties Arguments | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html | journal = Philo | year = 1998 | issue = 2 | pages = 49–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on non-overlapping magisteria===
Richard Dawkins has been particularly critical of the conciliatory view that science and religion are not in conflict, noting, for example, that the Abrahamic religions constantly deal in scientific matters.  In a 1998 article published in ''Free Inquiry'' magazine&lt;ref name=freeinquiry /&gt; and later in his 2006 book ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins expresses disagreement with the view advocated by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] that science and religion are two [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA), each existing in a "domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution". In Gould's proposal, science and religion should be confined to distinct non-overlapping domains: science would be limited to the empirical realm, including theories developed to describe observations, while religion would deal with questions of ultimate meaning and [[morality|moral value]]. Dawkins contends that NOMA does not describe empirical facts about the intersection of science and religion: "It is completely unrealistic to claim, as Gould and many others do, that religion keeps itself away from science's turf, restricting itself to morals and values. A universe with a supernatural presence would be a fundamentally and qualitatively different kind of universe from one without. The difference is, inescapably, a scientific difference. Religions make existence claims, and this means scientific claims."

===Science and morality===
{{main|Science of morality}}
Popularized by Sam Harris is the view that science and thereby currently unknown objective facts may instruct human morality in a globally comparable way. Harris' book ''The Moral Landscape''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=The Moral Landscape|year=2012|publisher=Black Swan|isbn=978-0552776387|id= {{ASIN|0552776386|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanying TED Talk ''How Science can Determine Moral Values''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=How Science can Determine Moral Values|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose that human well-being and conversely suffering may be thought of as a landscape with peaks and valleys representing numerous ways to achieve extremes in human experience, and that there are objective states of well-being.

===Politics===
New Atheism is politically engaged in a variety of ways. These include campaigns to draw attention to the biased privileged position religion has and to reduce the influence of religion in the public sphere, attempts to promote cultural change (centering, in the United States, on the mainstream acceptance of atheism), and efforts to promote the idea of an "atheist identity". Internal strategic divisions over these issues have also been notable, as are questions about the diversity of the movement in terms of its gender and racial balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kettell | first = Steven | url = http://www.secularismandnonreligion.org/article/view/snr.al/12 | title = Faithless: The Politics of New Atheism | journal = [[Secularism and Non Religion]] | volume = 2 | pages = 61–78 | year = 2013|doi=10.5334/snr.al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===Accusations of Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism===
The theologians Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey take issue with what they regard as "the [[Evangelism|evangelical]] nature of the New Atheism, which assumes that it has a Good News to share, at all cost, for the ultimate future of humanity by the conversion of as many people as possible." They believe they have found similarities between New Atheism and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]] and conclude that the all-consuming nature of both "encourages endless conflict without progress" between both extremities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|page=35|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=Beating 'God' to Death: Radical Theology and the New Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist William Stahl said, "What is striking about the current debate is the frequency with which the New Atheists are portrayed as mirror images of religious [[fundamentalist]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Stahl|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|pages=97–108|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=One-Dimensional Rage: The Social Epistemology of the New Atheism and Fundamentalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atheist [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Michael Ruse]] has made the claim that Richard Dawkins would fail "introductory" courses on the study of "[[philosophy]] or [[religion]]" (such as courses on the [[philosophy of religion]]), courses which are offered, for example, at many educational institutions such as colleges and universities around the world.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dougherty, T|author2=Gage, LP|editor1-last=Oppy|editor1-first=Graham|title=The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon and New York|isbn=9781844658312|pages=52–53|chapter=4/ New Atheist Approaches to Religion, pp. 51-62|quote=Michael Ruse (2009) claimed that Dawkins would fail 'any philosophy or religion course'; and for this reason Ruse says The God Delusion made him 'ashamed to be an atheist'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruse|first1=Michael|title=Why I Think the New Atheists are a Bloody Disaster|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html|website=Beliefnet|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation as a columnist of Beliefnet|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=August 2009|quote=… the new atheists do the side of science a grave disservice … these people do a disservice to scholarship ... Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course. Proudly he criticizes that whereof he knows nothing … the poor quality of the argumentation in Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and all of the others in that group … the new atheists are doing terrible political damage to the cause of Creationism fighting. Americans are religious people ... They want to be science-friendly, although it is certainly true that many have been seduced by the Creationists. We evolutionists have got to speak to these people. We have got to show them that Darwinism is their friend not their enemy We have got to get them onside when it comes to science in the classroom. And criticizing good men like Francis Collins, accusing them of fanaticism, is just not going to do the job. Nor is criticizing everyone, like me, who wants to build a bridge to believers – not accepting the beliefs, but willing to respect someone who does have them … The God Delusion makes me ashamed to be an atheist …  They are a bloody disaster …}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse also claims that the movement of New Atheism—which is perceived, by him, to be a "bloody disaster"—makes him ashamed, as a professional philosopher of science, to be among those holding to an atheist position, particularly as New Atheism does science a "grave disservice" and does a "disservice to scholarship" at more general level.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage /&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet /&gt;

[[Paul Kurtz]], editor in chief of [[Free Inquiry]], founder of [[Prometheus Books]], was critical of many of the new atheists.&lt;ref name="Kurtz kurtz_27_2"/&gt; He said, "I consider them atheist fundamentalists... They're anti-religious, and they're mean-spirited, unfortunately. Now, they're very good atheists and very dedicated people who do not believe in God. But you have this aggressive and militant phase of atheism, and that does more damage than good".&lt;ref name="A Bitter Rift Divides Atheists"/&gt;

[[Jonathan Sacks]], author of ''The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning'', feels the new atheists miss the target by believing the "cure for bad religion is no religion, as opposed to good religion". He wrote: 
{{quote|Atheism deserves better than the new atheists whose methodology consists of criticizing religion without understanding it, quoting texts without contexts, taking exceptions as the rule, confusing folk belief with reflective theology, abusing, mocking, ridiculing, caricaturing, and demonizing religious faith and holding it responsible for the great crimes against humanity. Religion has done harm; I acknowledge that. But the cure for bad religion is good religion, not no religion, just as the cure for bad science is good science, not the abandonment of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jonathan |title=The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning |date=2011 |publisher=Schocken |location=New York |isbn=978-0-805-24301-7 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political biases===
The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] contends that the new atheist movement overlaps with [[scientism]], which he finds to be philosophically unsound. He writes: "What I do object to is the tendency, found among many New Atheists, to expand the definition of science to pretty much encompassing anything that deals with 'facts', loosely conceived..., it seems clear to me that most of the New Atheists (except for the professional philosophers among them) pontificate about philosophy very likely without having read a single professional paper in that field.... I would actually go so far as to charge many of the leaders of the New Atheism movement (and, by implication, a good number of their followers) with anti-intellectualism, one mark of which is a lack of respect for the proper significance, value, and methods of another field of intellectual endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pigliucci|first1=Massimo|title=New Atheism and the Scientistic Turn in the Atheism Movement|date=2013|publisher=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist professor [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] has criticised the New Atheists' mocking of religion as being inimical to their goals and claims that they haven't achieved anything politically.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/professor-jacques-berlinerblau-tells-atheists-stop-whining/2012/09/14/0fdaf7f4-feab-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_story.html Professor Jacques Berlinerblau tells atheists: Stop whining!

Professor '''Nikola Iliev Milev''' ({{lang-bg|Никола Илиев Милев}}) (1881–1925) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[historian]], [[publicist]], public figure, [[diplomat]], and a participant in the Macedonian revolutionary movement.

== Biography ==
Milev was born in [[Mokreni]] (today [[Variko]], [[Florina (regional unit)|Florina regional unit]], [[Greece]]), a [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Bulgarian]]-populated village in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], then in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He finished the Bulgarian primary school in his birthplace and went with his father to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], where he lived for a period. He continued his education in [[Galatasaray High School]] in [[Tsarigrad]] ([[Istanbul]]). In 1902, he was a teacher in Istanbul and worked for [[Simeon Radev]]'s newspaper ''Evening Mail''. He then studied at the [[Sofia University]], from where he graduated in history (1903–1909). With the recommendations of Professor [[Vasil Zlatarski]] and with a Marin Drinov scholarship, Milev specialized history in [[Vienna]], [[Florence]] and [[Rome]] from 1910 to 1912.

During the [[Balkan Wars]], Milev was an interpreter at the headquarters of the Second Bulgarian Army. After the Balkan Wars, he became an associate professor at the Department of Bulgarian History and History of the Balkan Nations at Sofia University (1915–1922).

In 1918 Milev, became director of the press at the Bulgarian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. He was among the founders of the political party People's Accord (''Naroden sgovor'') in 1921. In 1922, he worked as the head of the daily newspaper ''Slovo'' ("Speech"). As President of the Association of the Journalists in Sofia, he protected the freedom of speech and press and, as grandmaster of the Zora [[freemason]]'s [[Masonic Lodge|lodge]], he advocated for the cause of the Macedonian Bulgarians and an autonomous [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Regardless of his negative attitude towards the policy of the Bulgarian Premier [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], Milev was included in the Bulgarian delegation at the [[Conference of Lausanne]] in 1922.

Nikola Milev was considered among the potential foreign ministers of the new government after the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1923]], but was rejected for of fear of the reaction of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and Greece. He was member of [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|Bulgarian parliament]] in 1923–1925 and served as adviser to the Bulgarian representation in the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]].

In 1925 Milev was selected as the representative of Bulgaria in the [[United States]], but was killed days before his departure. The decision to kill Milev was taken by a group of Macedonian figures around [[Dimitar Vlahov]]. It is believed that Milev was one of the main ideological opponents to the [[Comintern]] and its supporters in the Macedonian movement. The decision to murder Milev was approved by [[Stanke Dimitrov]] and the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Марков, Георги. Покушения, насилие и политика в България 1878-1947, София 2003, с. 217 (Markov, Georgi. Attempts, violence and politics in Bulgaria 1878-1947, Sofia 2003, p. 217)&lt;/ref&gt;

Milev's funeral on 15 February 1925 was one of the most crowded in Sofia in those years. His murder increased tension in the Bulgarian society in this period. The actual killer was captured by Macedonian workers, and after his confession was killed by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO), but instead of the actual instigators, their supporters deputies Todor Strashimirov and Haralampi Stoyanov were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Марков, Георги. Камбаните бият сами. Насилие и политика в България 1919-1947, София 1994, с. 69 (Markov, Georgi. The bells beat themselves. Violence and politics in Bulgaria 1919-1947, Sofia 1994, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milev in the Macedonian movement ===
[[Image:Nikola-Milev-Plaque-Sofia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Memorial plaque at Milev's place of assassination in Sofia]]

Nikola Milev joined [[IMORO]] as a student in 1898, but more actively joined the activities of the organizations of Macedonian Bulgarians after 1919. He participated in the activities of the Macedonian brotherhood in Sofia and cooperated with the periodicals of the Macedonian Bulgarians. Although he wasn't an IMRO member after World War I, along with the professors [[Lyubomir Miletich]] and Ivan Georgov Nikola Milev was advisor to the leader of IMRO [[Todor Aleksandrov]]. Milev was one of the opponents of the communist attempts to take control over Macedonian organizations.

Nikola Milev was one of the moral and intellectual leaders of the refugees from Macedonia. [[Ivan Mihailov]] describes him thus:

"''He possessed a combination of humility and firm conviction. His all person and especially his speech exhales an angelic warmth and security. He spoke simply and cordially. And all that he said was in due measure. He won with by means of his tact, amazed with his mind, conquered through his modesty... He had a chosen place among the elite of Bulgarian intellectuals that was difficult to fill again.''”&lt;ref&gt;Михайлов, Иван. Спомени, т. III, 1967, с. 585 (Mihailov, Ivan. Memoirs, vol. 3, 1967, p. 585)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikola Milev became one of the founders of the [[Macedonian Scientific Institute]] in 1923 and was elected to its first Board of Directors.

== Scholarly work ==

Nikola Milev's research covers various periods of the historical development of the Bulgarian people: from the 7th century until the time of the [[Bulgarian Revival]]. He published his first studies in the scientific journals ''Periodical Journal'', ''Proceedings of the Bulgarian Historical Society'' and others. The most famous of his works are those dealing with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] propaganda in Bulgaria during the Ottoman period and the [[Roman Catholicism in Bulgaria|Catholic Bulgarians]]. His monography of 1914 ''Catholic Propaganda in Bulgaria in the 18th Century'' is highly appreciated and it paved the way to his career of a university professor. This book has been defined as "brilliant" in the Bulgarian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Георгиева, Цветана. Развитие и тенденции върху проучванията на българския народ през XV-XVІІ век, - в: България през XV-XVІІІ век. Историографски изследвания, т. І, София 1987, с. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period 1914-1923 Nikola Milev was a free associate professor of history at Sofia University, and from 1923 on was a professor.

In 1923 Nikola Milev became one of the founders of the [[Macedonian Scientific Institute]] and was elected to his first Board of Directors.

The '''Ob-Ugric creation myth''' is the genesis story of the world in the mythology of the [[Khanty]] and [[Mansi people|Mansi]] people of [[Western Siberia]]. Their creation myth is very similar to the creation myths of other [[Uralic peoples]], sharing a lot of common elements, such as the skygod, the primordial waterfowl, the primordial waters, etc, but is also similar to the creation myths of many peoples of the northern hemisphere such as the [[Cherokee]]s, [[Yukaghir people|Yukaghirs]], [[Chukchi people|Chukchis]] and [[Ainu people|Ainus]]. It is categorised as an [[Creation myth|Earth diver myth]].&lt;blockquote&gt;''There once lived an old man and an old woman (skygod [[Num-Torum|Numi-Toorum]] and fertility goddess [[Kaltes-Ekwa|Kaltaš]]). They lived in a cottage in the middle of an ocean. They lived like that for a long time, until one day a rumble was heard from the upper sky. The old man looked outside of the window and saw that from the sky fell a [[loon]], who landed on the water and was looking for land. It dived into the water three times, until it finally found a bit of mud and flew with it back to the sky. The next day, a rumble was heard again. The same loon came down from the sky and was looking for land again. After diving into the water three times, it came out with mud on it's beak. The loon rubbed the mud on the house where the old man and old woman lived, and flew back to the sky once again. The mud grew and grew and after three days, the whole world was covered in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/tagused/nr4/obugri1.htm#kaur|title=Obiugri mütoloogiast I|website=www.folklore.ee|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Peter Dawkins''' (born 12 November 1945) is a philosopher, seer, geomancer, historian, author, lecturer, workshop leader and teacher.

Dawkins is a particular specialist in 'landscape temples' and sacred space, the Western wisdom traditions, the 'matter' of Britain, and Baconian and Shakespearean studies.

After practising as an architect for nine years in both [[England]] and [[Scotland]], from 1978 onwards Dawkins has devoted himself full-time to research, education and healing work in connection with the world's wisdom traditions, mythology, architecture and landscape, with an especial focus on the intimate relationship between the human being, the landscape and the [[Ten spiritual realms|spiritual realms]]. He teaches, runs courses and leads wisdom tours and geomantic pilgrimages in several countries. He has written many books, newsletters and articles, advised teachers, actors, directors and film-makers, and been interviewed internationally on TV, radio and documentaries.

Dawkins is founder and principal of The Francis Bacon Research Trust (FBRT), co-founder and elder of Gatekeeper Trust, and founder of the Zoence Academy and Mystery School which he runs in partnership with his wife Sarah. He has also served as a trustee of the [[Shakespeare Fellowship|Shakespearean Authorship Trust]] and of the British Council of the UN [[University for Peace|University of Peace]].

==Early life and education==
Dawkins was born Anthony Peter Dawkins in [[Birmingham]], England, the son and eldest child of David George Dawkins and Jeanne Mary Jefferies. He has one sister, Sally, wife of John Stenning. From childhood he has always had an artistic and visionary gift, including the ability to see [[angel]]s, etc., which has never left him, but developed further.

Dawkins was educated first at [[Hallfield School (Edgbaston)|Hallfield Preparatory School, Edgbaston]], Birmingham (1952–59), then at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward VI High School]], Edgbaston, Birmingham (1959–1964). In October 1964 he went to [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]], Cambridge, to study architecture on a 3-year degree course (1964–67) followed by a post-graduate 2-year diploma course (1967–69). Whilst at Cambridge he played as a drummer in the South Side Jazz Band and took part in rowing eights. His other main interests were hill-walking and exploring the landscape generally, sacred and [[Megalithic architectural elements|megalithic architecture]], classical philosophy and the ancient wisdom traditions. It was during this time that he began to appreciate the powerful effect that the environment has on people in different ways, including health, consciousness and behaviour, and therefore where best to build or not to build, etc., and thought that there should be a proper science concerning this. He also began to perceive earth energies and chakra systems in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peterdawkins.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After Cambridge Dawkins entered architectural practice, first with A. G. Sheppard Fidler &amp; Associates in their Birmingham office (1969–1972), becoming a registered architect in October 1971), then with Rowand Anderson Kininmonth &amp; Paul in their Edinburgh office (1972–76), and finally with [[Scottish Special Housing Association|The Scottish Special Housing Association]] (1976–78), working in both [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]].

During this time Dawkins continued his landscape researches and wisdom studies, together with meditation and other spiritual practices. In addition, shortly after marrying in March 1973, Dawkins was given extraordinary instructions in a dream that threw him directly into research work concerning the philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] and the Rosicrucians, and the rich heritage that they have left for us today. Then, in 1978, following a powerful inner calling given in meditation and vision, Dawkins left the practice of architecture to devote himself full-time to research and educational work in connection with the wisdom traditions, the landscape and environment generally, and the Baconian-Rosicrucian-Shakespeare mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peterdawkins.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Dawkins had met [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet|Sir George Trevelyan]] who invited him to speak at [[Wrekin Trust]] events, encouraged him to make his landscape research and discoveries known publicly, and introduced him to the poetry and wisdom of Shakespeare. In this way Dawkins started to become a lecturer and teacher. Dawkins had also met Hope Brameld, secretary of the Francis Bacon Society, and the research work started with her in 1973 led eventually, with the help of the [[Marquess of Northampton]] and others, to the founding of the Francis Bacon Research Trust as an educational charity in 1980. Dawkins also met Stanley Messenger in the 1970s and, together with him and a group of friends, started a movement that gave rise to the Gatekeeper Trust, registered as an educational charity in 1982. Dawkins was also a trustee and honorary president of the British Council of the UN University for Peace (1986–87), and a trustee of the [[Shakespeare Fellowship|Shakespearean Authorship Trust]] (2002–2013).

From 1980 onwards Dawkins’ public educational work started in earnest, first of all by means of the FBRT and Gatekeeper Trust, and then also with Zoence Academy, co-founded with his wife Sarah Dawkins in 1994. All three organisations continue to exist and flourish.

The educational work and [[Geomancy|geomantic]] [[pilgrimage]]s in which Dawkins is involved are or have been in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[South America]] and the [[United States|USA]].

Dawkins received an award for distinguished scholarship in Shakespeare Authorship Studies from [[Concordia University]], [[Portland, Oregon]], USA, in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;3. The Vero Nihil Verius Award of Scholarly Excellence, presented to Peter Dawkins by Daniel L. Wright, Director of the Shakespeare Authorship Research Centre, Department of Humanities on 4 April 2008 at Concordia University, Portland, Oregon. www.cu-portland.edu/ctas/humanities. www.authorshipstudies.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wisdom of Shakespeare===
The philosophy and wisdom embodied in the Shakespeare plays has been an important part of Dawkins’ studies, and as a result he has given Wisdom of Shakespeare seminars, summer schools and other events since the mid-1980s, first with Sir George Trevelyan in [[Warwickshire]], then with [[Mark Rylance]] at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre, London (1997–2005), and since then with Jill Line in Warwickshire and Mark Rylance elsewhere.

==Personal life==
Dawkins married Sarah Hiscock on 31 March 1973. They have three children: John, Elene and Samuel.

==Organisations==

===Zoence===
Concerned especially with the harmonious relationship of humanity with both the spiritual and natural worlds, Dawkins’ pioneering researches, begun in the 1960s, have led directly to a developing art and science of ‘landscape temples’ and ‘geomantic pilgrimage’, and their association with the spiritual or archetypal realms of existence and underlying wisdom or laws of life. This ‘geocosmology’, together with a synthesis of the heart truths of the various wisdom traditions, has been named ‘Zoence’—a word coined by Peter and Sarah Dawkins and meaning ‘science of life’ or ‘pathways of the soul’. Since the 1970s Dawkins has introduced many people of different nations to the concept and experience of both sacred landscape and townscape, as ‘landscape temples’ and ‘townscape temples’, and how to live, serve and pilgrimage within them in healing and life-enhancing ways. The word ‘Zoence’ is registered to Peter Dawkins and Zoence Academy is his business partnership with his wife Sarah. Zoence Academy runs a regular programme of events and hosts an informative website.

===The Francis Bacon Research Trust===
The FBRT specialises in research into Francis Bacon, Shakespeare, the Rosicrucians and the Western Wisdom Tradition, and their involvement with the extraordinary 50-year blossoming of the English Renaissance that, to a large degree, powered the birth of modern science, law, culture and society. The Baconian work, which is involved with knowledge of the landscape as well as history, philosophy, mythology, culture and consciousness, concerns one of the great doorways into the otherwise esoteric Western Wisdom Tradition. Shakespeare, Freemasonry and the Rosicrucians are part of this story. The FBRT shares its research via a programme of talks, seminars, summer schools and wisdom tours, its informative website, and a newsletter plus various articles for FBRT friends. The FBRT is a UK Registered Charitable Trust (# 280616) and has a governing board of trustees. Dawkins is the principal of the Trust.

===The Gatekeeper Trust===
The Gatekeeper Trust is devoted to personal and planetary healing through pilgrimage and the arts, such as sacred song and dance. It seeks to rediscover the ancient art of pilgrimage as a way of journeying with an awareness of and respect for the sacred nature of our environment, and for the wisdom and archetypal patterns that underlie it. It researches both ancient and modern knowledge about the landscape, and shares that knowledge through an annual programme of journeys, workshops, talks and conferences, and an informative website. As well as nationally organised events, the Gatekeeper Trust has several active local groups, and it runs a friendship scheme. Gatekeeper Trust is a UK Registered Educational Charity (# 326416) and has a governing board of trustees. Dawkins was a founder-trustee and is now an elder of the Trust.

==''That Noble Dream''==
''That Noble Dream: The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' questions the origins and prevalence of the notion of [[wikt:objectivity|objectivity]] in current and 20th century history.

'''Petrus Ryff''' (&lt;small&gt;Swiss&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-de|rif|lang}}; {{lang-la|Petrus Ryffius}}; May 8, 1552 – May 19, 1629) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[physician]] and [[chronicle]]r from [[Basel]].

== Life and work ==
Petrus Ryff was born in [[Basel]], [[Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]]. He was the son of Daniel Ryff (1529–1612), and Ursula Zimmermann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Stroux  | first =  Ulrich  | title = Genealogie der Familie Stroux - Speiser  | url = http://www.stroux.org/patriz_f/stQV_f/Rf_f.pdf | accessdate = 10 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the grandnephew of Basler chronicler [[Fridolin Ryff]].

Petrus Ryff enrolled in the University of his hometown in 1569; he received the [[Baccalaureus]] in 1572 and the ''[[Master of Philosophy|Magister Philosophiae]]'' degree in 1576. He continued to study Medicine, following the lectures of [[Theodor Zwinger]], [[Thomas Erastus]], [[Felix Plater]], and [[Johann Nicolaus Stupanus]]. He was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|Medical Doctor]] in 1584. After that he practiced medicine for a few years, until he succeeded [[Christian Wursteisen]] as Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Basel]] in 1586, a position he held until his death in 1629. In 1596 he became a Consultant of the School of Medicine, where he was an active member and 7 times Dean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Miescher |first= Friedrich |title= Die Medizinische Facultät in Basel und ihr Aufschwung unter F.

He was the author of several books of mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. Among the last is a prognostication for 1594.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thorndike |first= Lynn |title= A History of Magic and Experimental Science: Volumes V and VI, the Sixteenth Century |publisher= [[Columbia University Press]] |year= 1943 | isbn= 0-231-08795-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgKm55wQMGUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA143,M1 |pages= 143 |chapter=Chapter XXXIII Astrology after 1550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Petrus Ryff is best remembered for continuing and publishing the Basler Chronicles his granduncle Fridolin Ryff maintained between 1514 and 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vischer | first = Wilhelm |author2=Alfred Stern | title = Basler Chroniken | publisher = Hirzel, Historische und Antiquarische Gesellschaft zu Basel | year = 1872 | location = Leipzig | pages = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G7YBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#PPA13,M1 | oclc= 19455191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thommen | first = Rudolf | title = Geschichte der Universität Basel, 1532-1632 | publisher = C.

He continued the chronicles from 1543–1585, and in 1585 he published the chronicles. The ''Basler Chroniken'' were edited and re-published in 1872 by the ''Historische und Antiquarische Gesellschaft zu Basel''. They provide an invaluable source of information about the history of Basel, and that part of Europe in the 16th century.

'''Philip Arthur Barker''' (22 August 1920 &amp;ndash; 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=nr89-18074|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British archaeologist most famous for his work on [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] methodology.

He left school with no qualifications and served in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during the [[Second World War]] before training as a teacher. He became interested in archaeology and later became an academic at the [[University of Birmingham]]. For many years he was the archaeologist at [[Worcester Cathedral]].

During the 1970s and '80s he worked to help establish [[Rescue (British Archaeological Trust)|Rescue]] and the [[Institute of Field Archaeologists]] and undertook excavation work at [[Wroxeter]] and [[Hen Domen]].

" Philochorus." Brill’s New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and , Helmuth Schneider. Brill Online , 2012. Reference. 21 September 2012 &lt;http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/philochorus-e920850&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greek historiography|Greek historian]] and [[Atthidographer]] of the 3rd century BC, and a member of a priestly family. He was a seer and interpreter of signs, and a man of considerable influence.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}

==Biography==
Philochorus was strongly anti-[[Macedon]]ian in politics, and a bitter opponent of [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]]. When [[Antigonus Gonatas]], the son of the latter, besieged and captured Athens (261 BC), Philochorus was put to death for having supported [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] of Egypt, who had encouraged the Athenians in their resistance to Macedonia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greek-civilization/26532/Greek-civilization-in-the-4th-century#ref298285 Ancient Greek civilization in the 4th century: Historical writings] at the [[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His investigations into the usages and customs of his native [[Attica, Greece|Attica]] were embodied in an ''[[Atthis (Philochorus)|Atthis]]'', in seventeen books, a history of Athens from the earliest times to 262 BC. Considerable fragments are preserved in the lexicographers, scholiasts, [[Athenaeus]], and elsewhere. The work was epitomized by the author himself, and later by Asinius Pollio of Tralles (perhaps a freedman of the famous [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}

Philochorus also wrote on [[oracle]]s, [[divination]] and sacrifices; the mythology and religious observances of the [[Tetrapolis (Attica)|tetrapolis of Attica]]; the myths of [[Sophocles]]; the lives of [[Euripides]] and [[Pythagoras]]; the foundation of [[Salamis, Cyprus]]. He compiled chronological lists of the ''[[archon]]s'' and [[Olympic Games|Olympiads]], and made a collection of Attic inscriptions, the first of its kind in Greece.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}

'''Prehistoric medicine''' is any use of [[medicine]] from before the [[invention]] of [[writing]] and the documented [[history of medicine]]. Because the timing of the invention of writing varies per [[culture]] and region, the term "prehistoric medicine" encompasses a wide range of time periods and dates.&lt;ref name='OCR'&gt;{{cite book |title=Medicine Through Time |last=Kelly |first=Nigel |first2=Bob |last2=Rees |first3=Paul |last3=Shuter |year=2003 |publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |isbn=978-0-435-30841-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qiFEQ1tAHQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=prehistoric+medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] medicine relies heavily on [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[Cadaver|human remains]], and on [[anthropology]]. Previously [[uncontacted peoples]] and certain [[indigenous peoples]] who live in a traditional way have been the subject of anthropological studies in order to gain insight into both contemporary and ancient practices.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web |title=Traditional Medicine |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/traditional_medicine/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease and mortality ==
Different diseases and ailments were more common in prehistory than today; there is evidence that many people suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], probably caused by the lifting of heavy objects which would have been a daily and necessary task in their societies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} For example, the transport of [[latte stone]]s, though this practice only started during the neolithic era which involved hyper extension and torque of the lower back, while dragging the stones, may have contributed to the development of micro fractures in the spine and subsequent [[spondylolysis]].  Things such as cuts, bruises, and breakages of bone, without antiseptics, proper facilities, or knowledge of germs, would become very serious if infected, as they did not have sufficient ways to treat infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History of Medicine, Pre-history | url = http://www.britishempire.co.uk/boniface/humanities/history/year10/prehistoric.htm |website=Student reference and support materials | publisher = [[St Boniface's College]] | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=This institution is a secondary school, not a full college.|date=December 2011}}
There is also evidence of [[rickets]], bone deformity and bone wastage ([[Osteomalacia]]),&lt;ref name='Short journey'&gt;{{cite web | title = Babylon to Birmingham, A short journey through medicine to the end of the 18th Century | url = http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/babylon-to-birmingham/ |website=Revolutionary Players | publisher=History West Midlands | accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is caused by a lack of [[Vitamin D]].

The life expectancy in prehistoric times was low, 25&amp;ndash;40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schools History Project |title=Medicine &amp; Health Through Time: an SHP Development Study |url= |location= |publisher=[[Hodder Education]] |page= |date=26 September 1996 |isbn=978-0719552656}}&lt;/ref&gt; with men living longer than women; archaeological evidence of women and babies found together suggests that many women would have died in childbirth, perhaps accounting for the lower life expectancy in women than men.  Another possible explanation for the shorter life spans of prehistoric humans may be malnutrition; also, men as hunters may have sometimes received better food than the woman, who would consequently have been less resistant to disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Prehistoric Medicine | url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6303/1/Prehistoric-Medicine.html | publisher = HealthGuidance.Org | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatments for disease ==

Unlike the ancient civilisations which could source plant materials internationally, prehistoric societies would have been restricted to localised areas, though [[nomadic]] tribes may have had a greater variety of plant materials at their disposal than more stationary societies.

The effects of different plant materials could have been found through trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/ancient/prehistoriccivilisationrev1.shtml |title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize, Prehistoric Civilisation |author=Schools History Project |date= |website=GCSE Bitesize |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date= |quote=They have done this through a process of trial and error and natural selection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}  Gathering and dispensing of plant materials was in most cultures handled by women, who cared for the health of their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthy.net/Health/Article/An_Outline_of_The_History_of_Herbalism_An_Overview_and_Literature_Resource_List/901 |title=Herbal Medicine: An Outline of The History of Herbalism An Overview and Literature Resource List |last1=Hobbs |first1=Christopher |date= |website=healthy.net |publisher=HealthWorld Online |access-date=December 30, 2015 |quote=... women prepared food and healing potions--women generally practiced herbalism on a day to day basis, taking care of the ills of other members of the family or tribal unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant materials were an important cure for diseases throughout history.&lt;ref name='HistoryWorld'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa52 |title=Primitive Medicine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=HistoryWorld |publisher= |access-date=December 30, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fund of knowledge would have been passed down orally through the generations.
   
The ''[[Piptoporus betulinus|birch polypore]]'' fungus, commonly found in alpine environments, may have been used as a laxative by prehistoric peoples living in Northern Europe, since it is known to bring on short bouts of diarrhoea when ingested, and was found among the possessions of a mummified man.&lt;ref name='Iceman'&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilford |first=John Noble |date=December 8, 1998 |title=Lessons in Iceman's Prehistoric Medicine Kit |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DD173AF93BA35751C1A96E958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |access-date=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The use of earth and clays===
Earths and [[clays]] may have provided prehistoric peoples with some of their first medicines. This is related to [[geophagy]], which is extremely widespread among animals in the wild as well as among domesticated animals. In particular, geophagy is widespread among contemporary non-human primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krishnamani |first=R. |last2=Mahaney |first2=William C. |year=2000 |title=Geophagy among primates: Adaptive significance and ecological consequences |url= |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=59 |issue= |pages=899–915 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, early humans could have learned about the use of various [[healing clay]]s by observing animal behaviour. Such clay is used both internally and externally, such as for treating wounds, and after surgery (see below).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Geophagy, and the external use of clay are both still quite widespread among aboriginal peoples around the world, as well as among pre-industrial populations.

=== Surgery ===
''[[Trepanning]]'' (sometimes ''Trephining'') was a basic [[surgical operation]] carried out in prehistoric societies across the world,&lt;ref name='Neuro' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00006123-199907000-00033 |vauthors=Piek J, Lidke G, Terberger T, von Smekal U, Gaab MR |title=Stone age skull surgery in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: a systematic study |journal=[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=147–51; discussion 151 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10414577 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-396X&amp;volume=45&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=147}} A small but informative text&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence shows a concentration of the practice in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="HistoryWorld"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Neuro'&gt;{{cite web |title=Pre-Columbian Trephination |url=http://www.neurosurgery.org/cybermuseum/pre20th/treph/trephination.html |website=NEUROSURGERY://ON-CALL/Cyber Museum of Neurosurgery |publisher=[[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]] and [[Congress of Neurological Surgeons]] |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/classes/osci/osci590/6_2Trephination.htm |title=Trephination, An Ancient Surgery |author= |date= |website=UIC Oral Sciences OSCI 590: Hominid Evolution, Dental Anthropology, and Human Variation |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] |access-date=December 30, 2015 |quote=In Peruvian practice there is considerable evidence that many of the operations were performed for the naturalistic purpose of removing a bone fragment ... and trephination undertaken as a supernatural curative procedure by shamans (sancoyoc) with little technical ability as surgeons. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170855/http://www.uic.edu/classes/osci/osci590/6_2Trephination.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several theories question the reasoning behind trepanning; it could have been used to cure certain conditions such as [[headache]]s and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brain-surgery.com/history.html |title=History of Brain Surgery |last1=Siegfried |first1=Juliette |date= |website=Brain-Surgery.com |publisher= |access-date=December 30, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osler |first=Sir William |date=1922 |title=The Evolution of Modern Medicine: A Series of Lectures Delivered at Yale University on the Silliman Foundation in April, 1913 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.16616738;view=1up;seq=30 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=6–9 |isbn=}} See the section "Origin Of Medicine"&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many prehistoric peoples,{{Which|date=December 2011}} where applicable (geographically and technologically), were able to set broken or [[fracture]]d bones using clay materials. An injured area was covered in clay, which then set hard so that the bone could heal properly without interference.&lt;ref name='OCR' /&gt; Also, primarily in the [[Americas]], the pincers of certain ant species were used to close up wounds from infection; the ant was held above the wound until it bit, where its head would be removed allowing the pincers to remain and hold closed the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gudger |first=E.

It consists of magic formulas, prayers, and drumming. The medicine man then, from patients' recalling of their past and possible offenses against their religion or tribal rules, reveals the nature of the disease and how to treat it.

They were believed by the tribe to be able to contact spirits or gods and use their supernatural powers to cure the patient, and, in the process, remove evil spirits. If neither this method nor trepanning worked, the spirit was considered too powerful to be driven out of the person.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Medicine men would likely have been central figures in the tribal system, because of their medical knowledge and because they could seemingly contact the gods.

Archaeologists in [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province in the present day [[Pakistan]] discovered that the people of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] from the early [[Harappa]]n periods (c. 3300 BC) had knowledge of medicine and [[dentistry]]. The [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] who carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the [[University of Missouri]], made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men.  Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled dating to 7,000 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm |work=BBC News |title=Stone age man used dentist drill |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The problem of evidence ==
There is no written evidence which can be used for investigation into the prehistoric period of history by definition. Historians must use other sources such as [[Cadaver|human remains]] and anthropological studies of societies living under similar conditions. A variety of problems arise when the aforementioned sources are used.

Human remains from this period are rare and many have undoubtedly been destroyed by burial rituals or made useless by damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kented.org.uk/ngfl/subjects/history/medhist/page9_pkent.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202061022/http://www.kented.org.uk/ngfl/subjects/history/medhist/page9_pkent.html |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |title=Prehistoric Medicine In Kent |last1=Coulson |first1=Ian |date= |website=The History of Health and Medicine in Kent |publisher=Kent County Council |access-date=December 30, 2015 |quote=It is a matter of luck because only some skeletons survive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[WP:CIRCULAR]] [[Ötzi the Iceman#Body|Wikipedia's Ötzi the Iceman Article]] '..three or four of his right ribs had been squashed when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body.'&lt;/ref&gt; The most informative archaeological evidence are [[mummies]], remains which have been preserved by either freezing or in [[peat bog]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913114114/http://www.mydigiguide.com/dgx/wbl.dll?a=6&amp;h=49&amp;PID=23519 ''Mystery of the Mummies, Five Documentary'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malam |first=John |date=2001 |title=Secret Worlds: Mummies, and the Secrets of Ancient Egypt |series=Megabites |url= |location= |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK Children]] |page= |isbn=978-0-78947976-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; no evidence exists to suggest that prehistoric people mummified the dead for religious reasons, as [[Ancient Egypt]]ians did.

Not technically classed as 'written evidence', prehistoric people left many kinds of paintings, using paints made of minerals such as lime, clay and charcoal, and brushes made from feathers, animal fur, or twigs on the walls caves. Although many of these paintings are thought to have a spiritual or religious purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Anita |last1=Ganeri |first2=Hazel Mary |last2=Martell |first3=Brian |last3=Williams |date=2007 |title=World History Encyclopedia: A Complete and Comprehensive Guide to the History of the World |url= |location= |publisher=[[Parragon]] |page= |isbn=978-1-40549120-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some, such as a man with antlers (thought to be a medicine man), which have revealed some part of prehistoric medicine. Many cave paintings of human hands have shown missing fingers (none have been shown without thumbs), which suggests that these were cut off for sacrificial or practical purposes, as is the case among the [[Pygmies]] and [[Khoikhoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Janssens PA |title=Medical Views on Prehistoric Representations of Human Hands |journal=[[Medical History (journal)|Med Hist]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=318–22 |date=October 1957 |pmid=13476920 |pmc=1034309 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300021499 }} Pages 318–21 are of particular interest in this subject&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of certain cultures (such as the Romans) can be used as evidence in discovering how their contemporary prehistoric cultures practiced medicine. People who live a similar nomadic existence today have been used as a source of evidence too, but obviously there are distinct differences in the environments in which nomadic people lived; prehistoric people who once lived in [[Great Britain|Britain]] for example, cannot be effectively compared to aboriginal peoples in [[Australia]], because of the geographical differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationforum.co.uk/prehistoricmedicine.htm |title=Prehistoric Medicine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=History GCSE / History of Medicine Lessons |publisher=Education Forum |access-date=December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Celtic mythology}}

The '''pseudoarchaeology of Cornwall''' concerns aspects of the study of [[Cornwall]] that fall outside mainstream [[archaeology]], [[History of Cornwall|history]], and [[Culture of Cornwall|cultural]] studies. [[Pseudoarchaeology|Pseudoarchaeological]] approaches differ from the mainstream disciplines in methodology, which often leads to very different ideas. Mainstream scholars generally do not consider the methodologies used in [[pseudoarcheology]] to be valid, since they do not follow the [[scientific method]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Pseudohistorical myths associated with Cornwall, notably the [[Arthurian]] tradition and the [[Brutus]] myth form an important part of cultural history and have had great influence.

The density and antiquity of archaeological sites in Cornwall has attracted many, including people associated with the [[New Age]], and [[neo-pagan]] movements.

Pseudoarchaeology and ideas like it may go by other names including "alternative archaeology" and [[Earth mysteries]].

==Pseudohistory of Cornwall==
There is a Cornish legend of the lost land of [[Lyonesse]], which was lost to the sea in the past. The exact location of Lyonesse is in doubt. It is claimed to represent the folk memory of the flooding of the [[Isles of Scilly]] and [[Mount's Bay]] near [[Penzance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|title=Iktin|journal=The Geographical Journal|date=June 1960|volume=126|issue=2|pages=160–167|jstor=1793956|doi=10.2307/1793956}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Cornish name of St Michael's Mount is ''Karrek Loos y'n Koos'', literally, "the grey rock in the wood". The [[Breton mythology|Breton]] legend of [[Ys]] is a similar concept.

Some people believe that the [[Cornish language]] was not the first language spoken in Cornwall after the end of the [[Last glacial period|most recent glacial]] period within the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]]. One idea is that [[Vasconic languages]], related to present day [[Basque language|Basque]] were spoken in Cornwall and other areas of Europe. This idea has been advanced by mainstream scholars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venneman|first=Theo|title=Basken, Semiten, Indogermanen: Urheimatfragen in linguistischer und anthropologischer Sicht|url=http://www.lrz.de/~vennemann/#back%20Urheimatfragen|work=Europa Vasconica – Europa Semitica (Trends in Linguistics: Studies and Monographs, 138)|publisher=personal website at Leibniz-Rechenzentrum der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been used by others in support of pseudohistorical assertions.

Links with the ancient Middle East are also involved in pseudohistorical claims related to Cornwall and the wider Celtic Britain, including speculation concerning the identity of the [[Picts]]. Some have associated the Cornish [[pixy|piskies]] of folklore with the Picts.&lt;ref name=piskies&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans-Wentz|first=W. Y.|title=The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries – Section VI – In Cornwall|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/ffcc/ffcc125.htm|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity and origins of the Picts have attracted various speculations, including a Middle Eastern [[Semitic people|Semitic]], or [[Ancient Egyptian Language|pharaonic Egyptian]] origin to the [[Pictish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maclean|first=Diane|title=Scotland's founding Pharaoh|url=http://heritage.caledonianmercury.com/2010/10/04/scotland%E2%80%99s-founding-pharaoh/001497|publisher=Caledonian Mercury|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mainstream scholars believe the Pictish language to have been [[P-Celtic]] (i.e. an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] branch), and there is no real evidence that legends of piskies are related to the historical Picts.

There is evidence that there was [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times|long-distance trade]] in [[tin]] or copper from Cornwall in [[Iron Age]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Taylor (historian) |title=Saint Michael's Mount|origyear=1932|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-13796-9|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/saint-michaels-mount/oclc/468978401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that the traders were of [[Phoenicia]]n or [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] origin. Timothy Champion found it likely that the trade of the Phoenicians with Britain was indirect and under the control of the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;Champion, Timothy "The appropriation of the Phoenicians in British imperial ideology", in ''Nations and Nationalism'', volume 7/4, pp 451–465&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a legendary tradition concerning a visit by the biblical [[Joseph of Arimathea]] to Cornwall, which in some forms, makes the claim that the boy [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] accompanied him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lundy, Isle of Avalon|url=http://www.lundyisleofavalon.co.uk/godsetc/joseph3.htm|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. A. (1936) ''The Child Christ at Lammana: a legend of Looe and Talland''; 2nd ed. (with suppt). [Falmouth: the author]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cornish language]] is also a topic that has attracted pseudohistorical interpretations and [[folk etymologies]], notably the origin of the Cornish word ''kyttrin'', meaning in English, bus (motorbus) (in the context of public transport)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Ken|title=An Gerlyver Meur: Cornish-English, English-Cornish dictionary|year=2009|publisher=Cornish Language Board|location=Hayle|isbn=978-1-902917-84-9|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology has also been associated with [[Cornish surnames#Anglicised names and folk etymology|surnames]] derived from the Cornish language. The Cornish language is however of mainstream [[linguistics|linguistic]], [[history of Cornwall|historic]], and [[Cornish culture|cultural]] interest.

[[John Boson (writer)|John Boson]] writes in 1710 (transliterated into a revived Cornish orthography):

* ''Gomar mab Jafet mab Noy a veu an kensa den a wrug clappya Kernowak i’n termyn a veu Tour Babel derevys'' – which translates as: "Gomer son of Japhet son of Noah was the first man to talk Cornish at the time when the Tower of Babel was built"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernowek.net/kernowak-revision-16.pdf|page=182|title=Sentences from the Traditional Texts |work=Kernowek Standard: an orthography for the Cornish language|publisher=Evertype|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a variety of traditional [[Cornish folklore]] which includes stories concerning [[Jack the Giant Killer#Cornish giants|giants]], [[pixy|piskies]] and other folkloric beings. The [[Brutus]] myth, is an important phase in the pseudohistory of Cornwall, wherein [[Corineus]] defeated the giant [[Gogmagog (folklore)|Gogmagog]] and founded the [[kingdom of Cornwall]].

The pre-Christian era [[Celtic polytheism|religious beliefs]] in Cornwall are also important. The preeminent pseudohistoric personage in Cornwall is [[King Arthur]]. Although details concerning his life are difficult to separate from later medieval interpretations, he does seem to be based on a historical leader of the [[Britons (historical)|Celtic Britons]]. The [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|legendary Dukes of Cornwall]] also feature in pseudohistory. The Cornish strand of the [[Arthurian tradition]] has been summarised and reviewed in a book entitled ''Inside Merlin's Cave: a Cornish Arthurian reader 1000–2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amy Hale, [[Alan M. Kent]] and [[Tim Saunders]] (editors)|title=Inside Merlin's Cave: a Cornish Arthurian reader 1000–2000|year=2009|publisher=Francis Boutle|isbn=978-1-903427-04-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEMcAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century [[Celtic revival]], [[Neo-Paganism]], and the [[New Age]] movements draw greatly on the pseudohistory of Cornwall.

==Pseudogeography==

[[Ley lines]] are a popular concept in pseudoarchaeology, although some, including Andy Norfolk, have considered [[Australian Aboriginals|Aboriginal]] [[songlines]] in the context of [[Cornwall]]. The pseudogeography of Cornwall has been studied by Carl Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Carl|title=Mystical Geographies of Cornwall|url=http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/744/1/Mystical_Geographies_of_Cornwall.pdf|work=Thesis submitted to the University of Nottingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difference between ley lines and [[songlines]], are that ley lines are straight, whereas songlines may not be.

{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|''From the restoration of the Republic to the 1910 Revolution, the State of Jalisco provided three presidential cabinet members, all three belonging to my family: General Pedro Ogazón, Minister of War and attorney at Law, [[Ignacio Luis Vallarta]], Minister of Interior and of Foreign Affairs; and my father, who was Minister of War and of the Navy. Among the most illustrious of my ancestry are also Don Lorenzo Camarena and Dr Don Francisco de Paula Verea y González de Hermosillo, Bishop of Linares from 1853 to 1879, and later Bishop of Puebla. I have appropriated this last one due to a tradition of affection: he was a dear friend, but not a relative of my family, though he was always considered and respected as family because two Verea brothers married two Vallarta y Ogazón sisters.

In 1952 the Governor of the State of Jalisco, [[José González Gallo|José Jesús González Gallo]] (1900–1957), appointed Lancaster-Jones as [[Curator]] of the ''Museo Regional de Guadalajara'', serving this post until 31 December 1953.&lt;ref name="Lajoie 1972, p. 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno Pérez, Raquel; "¿Quién fue el Ingeniero Ricardo Lancaster-Jones?", Boletín del Archivo Histórico de Jalisco, volumes 1-2, Guadalajara, 1983, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; During the two years he was in office, he reorganized the exhibition rooms, commanded the restoration of priceless works of art, and made a detailed inventory of the various museum collections.&lt;ref name="Vázquez-Tagle 1988, pp. 10-12"/&gt;

===Major contributions===
[[File:Francisco Marquez.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Francisco Márquez's name was inscribed among the ''Illustrious People'' of the State of Jalisco in 1947.]]
*1941 – '''Documents of Our Lady of Zapopan'''. According to a published speech given by Lancaster-Jones in 1970 for the unveiling ceremony of the sculpture of Friar Antonio de Segovia (1500–1570), he located the original documents which validate the authenticity of the image that is venerated at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] (documents which date from 16th to 18th centuries). Those were secreted for safe keeping by Friar Luis de Palacio y Basave (1868–1941) in the early 20th century during the religious persecution that happened after the [[Mexican Revolution]] and caused the [[Cristero War]]. In 1941, the friar's heirs asked Lancaster-Jones to make an appraisal of the friar's library. He found those important documents and purchased them from Friar Palacio's heirs; later on, he gave those documents, as a gift, to Dr [[Jose Garibi y Rivera]] who was Archbishop of the [[Archdiocese of Guadalajara]] in those days. Lancaster-Jones was inspired by those documents to write his work ''Tríptico Mariano'', first published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster-Jones y Verea, Ricardo; "Fray Antonio de Segovia y Nuestra Señora de Zapopan", Guadalajara, 1970, pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;
*1947 – '''Francisco Márquez's Baptismal Certificate'''. The discovery of [[Francisco Márquez]]'s Baptismal Certificate in Guadalajara helped to rewrite Márquez's biography.&lt;ref&gt;"El Informador" newspaper, 15 August 1947&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[Niños Heroes]] who died at the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican–American War]]. Márquez's early years remained a mystery until then. Through this fact, it can be proved that Márquez was actually born in Guadalajara and the real date of his birth was 8 October 1834. He was baptized nine days later, on 18 October, as ''Francisco de Borja Jesús Benito'', his godparents were his maternal grandparents: Gerónimo Paniagua y María Prudencia Falcón.&lt;ref&gt;Certified copy of the Baptismal Certificate, issued on request of Ricardo Lancaster-Jones by the Parroquia del Sagrario's Parish, Dr. Higinio Gutiérrez López, Guadalajara, 4 August 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Through a Confirmation Certificate (also found by Lancaster-Jones), it can be proved that Márquez moved to [[Mexico City]] and the reason why he joined the army: his Confirmation's godparents where his mother Micaela Paniagua and the General [[Leonardo Márquez]]. His widowed mother remarried, to Francisco Ortiz, a cavalry captain, by the time Márquez joined the [[Heroico Colegio Militar]] on 14 January 1847.&lt;ref&gt;"El Acta de Francisco Márquez en Guadalajara", revista "Gráfica Social", Año I, Número 1, 1° Junio 1973, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Mexican historian Ricardo Covarrubias have credited to Lancaster-Jones for such discovery at his work ''Las Calles de Monterrey''.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, Ricardo; "Las Calles de Monterrey", volume  3, Editorial Vallarta, Monterrey, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, Márquez has been listed among the ''Illustrious People'' (''Personajes Ilustres'') of the State of [[Jalisco]] at its official webpage.&lt;ref name="e-local1"/&gt;
*1949 – '''Domingo Lazaro de Arregui's papers of intestate'''. Two articles published by Lancaster-Jones in the newspaper ''El Informador'' (23 October 1949 and 5 March 1950) helped to form an accurate biography of Domingo Lazaro de Arregui, who wrote the earliest geographical description of former Kingdom of [[New Galicia|Nueva Galicia]] (''Descripción de la Nueva Galicia'', 1621). Guadalajaran academic José María Muriá claims this fact helped French historian [[François Chevalier]] to rewrite De Arregui's biography on his prominary study for the second edition (1980) of  his work ''Descripción de la Nueva Galicia'',&lt;ref&gt;Muriá, José María; "Nueve ensayos sobre historiografía regional: Estado de Jalisco", 2003, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; (the first one was published in [[Seville]], 1946).&lt;ref&gt;Arregui, Domingo Lazaro de; "Descripción de la Nueva Galicia", prominary study by François Chevalier, Unidad Editorial del Gobierno de Jalisco, Guadalajara, 1980, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francisco primo de verdad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos's name was inscribed with gold at the main hall of the Congress of the State of Jalisco in 1960.]]
*1951 – '''Origin of the name of [[Los Altos (Jalisco)|Los Altos]] region'''. In his published work ''La Hacienda de Santa Ana Apacueco'' (1951), Lancaster-Jones refers a land grant document  issued in 1606 naming Jalisco's high lands as ''Los Altos de Villanueva''.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster-Jones y Verea, Ricardo; "La Hacienda de Santa Ana Apacueco", Imprenta Gráfica, Guadalajara, 1951, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, historians whose especial interest is the after mentioned region like Mariano González-Leal, have credited to Lancaster-Jones for the discovery of the origin of such name of ''Los Altos''.&lt;ref&gt;González Leal, Mariano; "Retoños de España en Nuevo Galicia", volume 1, Universidad de Guanajuato, México, 1982, pp. 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Ortiz, César; "Etnografía situacional de la Memoria Histórica en la Región de los Altos de Jalisco", Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, 2008, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until then, Primo de Verdad was thought to be from [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]]. Through this, his correct birthplace was ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster-Jones, Ricardo; "Primo Verdad, Jalisciense Neto", ''Gazeta de Guadalajara'', #228, 1959, pp. 8-14&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1960, Primo de Verdad's full name was inscribed with gold at the main hall of the Congress of the State of Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Decree number 7521, dated on 24 November 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, [[Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos]] has been listed among the ''Illustrious People'' (''Personajes Ilustres'') of the State of [[Jalisco]] at its official webpage.&lt;ref name="e-local1"/&gt;

According to Ricardo Lancaster-Jones y Verea: an [[hacienda]] in all its types: [[plantations]], [[mining|mines]], business [[factories]], etc., was the medium that made possible the population of large dispersed areas (sometimes isolated); it was the base of the acculturation process and the core around which the incorporation to civilized life by the indigenous took place.
Given the extension of the territory of [[New Spain]] (now [[Mexico]]), the haciendas became excellent autonomous centers. Their inhabitants lived in a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] that allowed them to channel their spiritual and material needs.

The haciendas that existed in the ancient Kingdom of [[Nueva Galicia|New Galicia]] were located through a diverse and rich geography. Local circumstances changed the regional customs in the haciendas of this area, distinguishing them from the rest of [[New Spain]]. The origin of the features that distinguish Mexico in the world today: [[charreria]], [[mariachi]] and [[tequila]], can be found in the Haciendas of [[Jalisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster-Jones y Verea, Ricardo; [[Haciendas de Jalisco y Aledaños (1506–1821)]], Financiera Aceptaciones S.A., Guadalajara, 1974, pp. 4, 12, 34, 56, 60-66, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandoval Godoy, Luis; “Haciendas”, Impre-Jal, Guadalajara, 1986, pp. 189-197&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rif War''' was an armed conflict fought from 1920 to 1927 between the colonial power [[History of Spain|Spain]] (later joined by [[History of France|France]]) and the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the [[Rif]] mountainous region. Led by [[Abd el-Krim]], the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using [[guerrilla tactics]] and captured European weapons. After France's military intervention against Abd el-Krim's forces and the major landing of Spanish troops at [[Alhucemas landing|Al Hoceima]], considered the first amphibious landing in history to involve the use of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]], Abd el-Krim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Porch, "Spain's African Nightmare," ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History'' (2006) 18#2 pp 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Rifian tribes aggressively confronted Spanish workers of the iron mines of the Rif, near [[Melilla]], which led to the intervention of the [[Spanish Army]]. The military operations in [[Jebala people|Jebala]], in the Moroccan West, began in 1911 with the [[Larache]] Landing. Spain worked to pacify a large part of the most violent areas until 1914, a slow process of consolidation of frontiers that lasted until 1919 due to [[World War I]]. 

The following year, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Fez]], the northern Moroccan area was adjudicated to Spain as a protectorate. The Riffian populations strongly resisted the Spanish, unleashing a conflict that would last for several years. In 1921, the Spanish troops suffered the catastrophic [[Battle of Annual|Disaster of Annual]], the biggest defeat in the [[Military history of Spain|history of Spain]], in addition to a rebellion led by Rifian leader [[Abd el-Krim]]. As a result, the Spanish retreated to a few fortified positions while Abd el-Krim ultimately created an entire independent state: the [[Republic of the Rif]]. The development of the conflict and its end coincided with the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]], who took on command of the campaign from 1924 to 1927. In addition, and after the Battle of Uarga in 1925, the French intervened in the conflict and established a joint collaboration with Spain that culminated in the [[Alhucemas landing]] which proved a turning point. By 1926 the area had been pacified; Abd-el-Krim surrendered in July 1927; and the Spanish regained the previously lost territory.

The Rif War is still considered controversial among historians. Some see in it a harbinger of the decolonization process in North Africa. Others consider it one of the last colonial wars, as it was the decision of the Spanish to conquer the Rif — nominally part of their Moroccan protectorate but ''de facto'' independent — that catalyzed  the entry of France in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cairn.info/revue-strategique-2009-1-page-319.htm Jan Pascal, ''L’Armée française face à Abdelkrim ou la tentation de mener une guerre conventionnelle dans une guerre irrégulière 1924-1927''], Cairn.Info, 2009, p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rif War left a deep memory both in Spain and in Morocco. The Riffian insurgency of the 1920s can be interpreted as a precursor to the [[Algerian war of independence]], which took place three decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Entelis|first1=John P.|title=La Guerre du Rif: Maroc (1925–1926)|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|date=9 March 2017|volume=22|issue=3|pages=500–503|doi=10.1080/13629387.2017.1300383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
During the early 20th century, Morocco was divided into protectorates ruled by France and Spain. The Rif region had been assigned to Spain, but given that the Sultans of Morocco had been unable to exert control over the region, Spanish sovereignty over the Rif was strictly theoretical. For centuries, the Berber tribes of the Rif had fought off any attempt of outsiders to impose control on them.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Though nominally [[Muslim]], the tribes of the Rif had continued many pagan animist practices, such as worshipping water spirits and forest spirits.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"/&gt; Attempts by the Moroccan sultans to impose orthodox Islam on the Rif had been successfully resisted by the tribesmen.

For centuries, Europeans had seen the Rif mountains and people on the mountains from ships in the Mediterranean Sea, but almost no European had ever ventured into the area.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"/&gt; [[Walter Burton Harris]], the Morocco correspondent for ''The Times'', who covered the war, wrote that as late as 1912 only "one or two Europeans had been able to visit the cedar forests that lie south of Fez. A few had traveled in the southern Atlas and pushed on into the Sus...and that was almost all".&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"/&gt; As Harris wrote, the Berbers "were often as inhospitable to the Arab as they were to the foreigner", and generally killed any outsiders who ventured into their territory.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"/&gt;

[[Vincent Sheean]], who covered the war for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the Rif was a truly beautiful countryside of "Crimson mountains flung against a sky of hieratic blue, gorges magnificent and terrifying, peaceful green valleys between protecting precipices", a place that reminded him of his native Colorado.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 273"/&gt; The Rif was also rich in high-grade iron, which could be easily extracted via [[open pit mining]].&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 274"&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of the Spanish state collecting revenues in the form of taxes and royalties from iron mining here was incentive for it to bring the Rif under its control. 

The Crown granted the concession to mine iron in the Rif to the millionaire Don [[Horacio Echevarrieta]]. By 1920 he had brought out 800,000 tons of valuable high grade iron through relatively inexpensive open pit mining.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, José "Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925" pages 75-98 from ''The Journal of Military History'', Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999 page 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Though profitable, the iron mining caused much environmental damage and required the displacement of the native people. As they received no share of the profits, the Rifians soon began to oppose the mining in their territory.

When King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] ascended to the throne in 1886, Spain was considered a world power, with colonies in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 274"/&gt; But in the [[Spanish–American War]], Spain lost Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and in 1899 it [[Spanish-German Treaty of 1899|sold]] the [[Marianas Islands|Mariana]] and [[Caroline Islands]] to Germany, retaining only some footholds on the Moroccan coast and [[Spanish Guinea]].&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 274"/&gt; To compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia, there emerged a powerful ''[[Africanist (Spain)|africanist]]'' faction in Spain led by Alfonso, who wanted a new empire in Africa.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 274"/&gt; Finally, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was politically powerful in Spain, and much of the Spanish clergy preached the need for new crusade to continue the ''[[Reconquista]]'' by conquering Morocco, thus adding their voices to the ''africanist'' choir.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 274"/&gt; For all these reasons, Spain began pushing into the Rif in 1909.

==Forces involved==
===Rifian forces===
The Berber tribesmen had a long tradition of fierce fighting skills, combined with high standards of fieldcraft and marksmanship. They were capably led by [[Abd el-Krim]], who showed both military and political expertise. However, the Rifian regular army was never a very large force.&lt;ref name="pennell"/&gt; The elite of the Rifian forces formed regular units which according to Abd el-Krim, quoted by the Spanish General [[Manuel Goded Llopis|Manuel Goded]], numbered 6,000 to 7,000. Other sources put it much lower, at around 2,000 to 3,000.&lt;ref name="pennell"&gt;C. R. Pennell – [http://dtl.unimelb.edu.au/R/G6ASL7MRH56N6D62EU994G2H78TRSHEP44P8A82S36SQ5YGCSJ-01131?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=274378&amp;pds_handle=GUEST ''A Country with a government and a Flag: The Rif War in Morocco, 1921–1926''], Outwell, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England: Middle East &amp; North African Studies Press Ltd, 1986, {{ISBN|0-906559-23-5}}, page 132; (University of Melbourne – University Library Digital Repository)&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Rifians were tribal militia selected by their [[Qaid|Caids]]; they were not liable to serve away from their homes and farms for more than 15 consecutive days. General Goded estimated that at their peak, in June 1924, the Rifian forces numbered about 80,000 men,&lt;ref name="woolman"&gt;"Rebels in the Rif" pages&amp;nbsp;149–152, David S. Woolman, Stanford University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Abd el-Krim]] was never able to arm more than 20,000 men at a time. However, this force was largely adequate in the early stages of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Woolman, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; In the final days of the war, Rifian forces numbered about 12,000 men.&lt;ref name="pennell1"/&gt; In addition Rifian forces were not well armed, with weapons badly maintained and in poor condition.&lt;ref name="pennell1"&gt;Pennell, C. R.; page 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish forces===

Initially, the Spanish forces in Morocco were largely composed of conscripts and reservists from Spain itself. These "Peninsular" troops were poorly supplied and prepared, few had marksmanship skills and proper battle training,&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 98 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and widespread corruption was reported amongst the officer corps, reducing supplies and morale.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 57 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Spanish troops in Morocco in 1921, well over half were completely illiterate conscripts from the poorest elements of Spanish society who had been sent to Morocco with minimal training.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 277&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Silvestre's assurances that his equipment was sufficient to defeat the Rifians, in fact about three-quarters of the rifles at the Melilla arsenal were in shoddy condition due to poor maintenance, and a report from late 1920, which Silvestre had never bothered to read, warned that many of the rifles held there were either unusable or more of a danger to the soldier firing them than to the enemy.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 278&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tropas en el puerto de Pasaia antes de partir a la guerra de África (3 de 5) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish troops in [[Pasaia]], prior to their departure to the war.]]
The average Spanish soldier in Morocco in 1921 was paid the equivalent of thirty-four US cents per day, and lived on a simple diet of coffee, bread, beans, rice and the odd piece of meat.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; Many soldiers bartered their rifles and ammunition at the local markets in exchange for fresh vegetables.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; The barracks that the soldiers lived in were unsanitary and medical care at the few hospitals very poor.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; Up in the mountains, Spanish soldiers lived in small outposts known as ''blocaos'', which the American historian Stanley Payne observed: "Many of these lacked any sort of toilet, and the soldier who ventured out of the filthy bunker risked exposure to the fire of lurking tribesmen".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:General Silvestre en Melilla.jpg|thumb|[[Manuel Fernández Silvestre|General Silvestre]] in [[Melilla]], 1921.]] Continuing a practice first begun in Cuba, corruption flourished amongst the venal Spanish officer corps, with goods meant for the troops being sold on the black market and the funds intended to build roads and railroads in Morocco ending up in the pockets of senior officers.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; A high number of Spanish officers could not read maps, which explains why Spanish units so frequently got lost in the Rif mountains.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; In general, studying war was not considered to be a good use of an officer's time, and most officers devoted their time in Melilla in words of the American journalist James Perry to "gambling and whoring, sometimes molesting the native Moorish women".&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; Morale in the Army was extremely poor and most Spanish soldiers just wanted to go home and leave Morocco forever.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; Because of the prostitutes from Spain, who attached themselves in great number to the Spanish bases in Morocco, venereal diseases were rampant in the Spanish Army.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; Silvestre was well aware of the poor morale of his soldiers, but he did not regard this as a problem, believing that his enemy was so inferior that the problems afflicting his troops were not an issue.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt;

Even with their numerical superiority, the "Peninsular" troops proved no match for the highly skilled and motivated Rifian forces. Accordingly, much reliance came to be placed on the mainly professional units comprising Spain's [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]]. Since 1911, these had included regiments of Moroccan [[Regulares]], who proved to be excellent soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 44 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; 
The initiative was unpopular in parts of Spain as well. In 1909, during early conflicts with the Rif tribesmen, an attempt by the Spanish government to call up reservists led to a working class uprising in Barcelona known as [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]]. The Catalan trade unions, many led by anarchists, argued that the working class of Barcelona had no quarrel with the people of the Rif.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Jose "Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925" pages 75-98 from ''The Journal of Military History'', Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999 page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09412, Primo de Rivera und der König von Spanien.jpg|thumb|[[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] (front row left) with King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] and other high ranking Spanish officers.]] After the Tragic Week of 1909, the Spanish government starting in 1911 tried to raise as many ''Regulare'' units as possible to avoid further working class resistance to colonial wars as much of the Spanish working class had no desire to see their sons sent to Morocco, beginning a policy of what the Spanish historian Jose Alvarez called "Moroccanizing" the conquest of the Rif.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Jose "Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925" pages 75-98 from The Journal of Military History, Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999 page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the difficulties and setbacks that it had experienced in 1909-11, the Spanish army began to adopt much in organization and tactics from the French North African forces garrisoning most of Morocco and neighboring Algeria. Particular attention was paid to the [[French Foreign Legion]] and a Spanish equivalent, the [[Spanish Legion|''Tercio de Extranjeros'']] ("Foreigners brigade"), known in English as the "Spanish Legion", was formed in 1920. The regiment's second commander was then-[[Colonel|Col]]. [[Francisco Franco]], having risen rapidly through the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 68 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rif war, it was the ''Regulares'' and the Spanish Foreign Legion founded in 1919 that provided the elite forces that won Spain the war.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Jose "Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925" pages 75-98 from The Journal of Military History, Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999 page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 25% of this "Foreign Legion" were, in fact, non-Spanish. Harshly disciplined and driven, they quickly acquired a reputation for ruthlessness. As their number grew, the Spanish Legion and the Regulares increasingly led offensive operations after the disasters that had been suffered by the conscript forces.

===Early stages===
{{See also|Second Melillan campaign}}

As an outcome of the [[Treaty of Fez]] (1912) Spain gained possession of the lands around [[Melilla]] and [[Ceuta]]. In 1920, the Spanish commissioner, General [[Dámaso Berenguer]], decided to conquer the eastern territory from the Jibala tribes, but had little success. The second-in-command was General [[Manuel Fernández Silvestre]] who commanded the eastern sector. Silvestre had spread out his troops out in 144 forts and ''blocaos'' from Sidi Dris on the Mediterranean across the Rift mountains to Annual and Tizi Azza and on to Melilla.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 278"/&gt; A typical ''blocao'' held about dozen men while the larger forts had about 800 men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Silvestre, known for his boldness and impetuosity  had pushed his men too deep into the Rif mountains hoping to reach Alhucemas Bay without undertaking the necessary work to build a logistical support network capable of supplying his men out in the ''blocaos'' up in the Rif mountains.&lt;ref name="Alvarez pages 75-98"&gt;Alvarez, Jose "Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925" pages 75-98 from  ''The Journal of Military History'', Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999 page 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Krim had sent Silvestre a letter warning him not to cross the Amekran river or else he would die.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 279&lt;/ref&gt; Silvestre commented to the Spanish press about the letter that: "This man Abd el-Krim is crazy. I'm not going to take seriously the threats of a little Berber ''caid'' [judge] whom I had at my mercy a short time ago. His insolence merits a new punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Krim allowed Silvestre to advance deep into the Rif, knowing the Spanish logistics were in the words of the Spanish historian Jose Alvarez "tenuous" at best.&lt;ref name="Alvarez pages 75-98"/&gt;

On 1 July 1921, the Spanish army in north-eastern Morocco under the command of General [[Manuel Fernández Silvestre]] collapsed when defeated by the forces of [[Abd el-Krim]], in what became known in Spain as the [[disaster of Annual]], some 8,000 soldiers and officers reported killed or disappeared out of some 20,000. The final Spanish death toll, both at Annual and during the subsequent rout that took Rifian forces to the outskirts of Melilla, was reported to the [[Cortes Generales]] as totaling 13,192.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 96 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish were pushed back and during the following five years, occasional battles were fought between the two. The Rifian forces advanced to the east and captured over 130 [[Spanish people|Spanish]] military posts.&lt;ref name="dirk"/&gt;

[[File:Kaid Sarkash (Riffian leader) 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Berbers]] carrying captured rifles. A [[Mauser|Spanish Mauser]] and a French [[Berthier rifle|Berthier Carbine]].]]
By late August 1921, [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]] lost all the territories it had gained since 1909. Spanish troops were pushed back to Melilla, which was their biggest base in the eastern [[Rif]].&lt;ref name="dirk"/&gt; Spain still had 14,000 soldiers in Melilla.&lt;ref name="dirk"/&gt; However, [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] ordered his forces not to attack the town.  He subsequently told the writer J. Roger-Matthieu that since citizens of other European nations were residing in Melilla, it was feared they would intervene in the war should their citizens come to harm.&lt;ref name="dirk"/&gt; Other reasons included the dispersal of Rifian fighters from several loosely allied tribes following the victory at Annual; and the arrival in Melilla of substantial reinforcements from the Legion and other Spanish units recalled from operations in western Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Barea, pp. 313-314 ''The Forging of a Rebel'', SBN 670-32367-5, The Viking Press 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of August Spanish forces at Melilla numbered 36,000 under General [[Jose Sanjurjo]] and the slow process of recovering the lost territory could begin.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, pp. 95–102 "Rebels in the Rif",  Stanford University Press 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the Spanish could keep their biggest base in the eastern [[Rif]]. Later Abd el-Krim would admit: ''"I bitterly regret this order. It was my biggest mistake. All the following tenor of events happened because of this mistake."''&lt;ref name="dirk"&gt;Dirk Sasse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tvcyZYwX0hcC&amp;dq=%22annual+disaster+1921%22&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Franzosen, Briten und Deutsche im Rifkrieg 1921–1926''], Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2006, {{ISBN|3-486-57983-5}}, pg&amp;nbsp;40–41 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1922 the Spanish had retaken their major fort at Monte Arruit (where they found the bodies of 2,600 of the garrison) and had reoccupied the coastal plain as far as Tistutin and Batel. The Rifian forces had consolidated their hold of the inland mountains and stalemate was reached.

The Spanish military suffered losses even at sea; in March the transport ship ''Juan de Joanes'' was sunk in [[Al Hoceima|Alhucemas]] Bay by Riffian coastal batteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Juan de Joanes – Trasmeships|url = http://www.trasmeships.es/246.html|website = www.trasmeships.es|accessdate = 2015-10-14|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926235315/http://www.trasmeships.es/246.html|archive-date = 2015-09-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 1923, while shelling Riffian positions, the [[Spanish battleship España|battleship ''España'']] ran aground off [[Cape Three Forks|Cape Tres Forcas]] and was eventually scrapped ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Spanish Dreadnoughts of the España class.

In a bid to break the stalemate, the Spanish military turned to the use of [[Chemical weapons in the Rif War|chemical weapons against the Riffians]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Strike_from_the_Sky.html?id=ZAdtAIMTReEC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Strike from the Sky: The History of Battlefield Air Attack, 1910–1945''], Richard P.

[[File:Spanishbuildingruins.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of a Spanish camp near [[Chefchaouen]].]]  The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the ''[[Africanist (Spain)|africanistas]]'' who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the ''abandonistas'' who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 286.&lt;/ref&gt; After the "Disaster of the Annual", Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging on to Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"/&gt; In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied at the railway stations, other soldiers in Malaga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the Rif Republic was waved about.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"/&gt;

With the ''africanists'' comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the military coup d'état later in 1923.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"/&gt; On September 13, 1923, [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marqués de Estella]], seized power in a military coup d'état. General Primo de Rivera was in the words of the American journalist James Perry a "moderate dictator" who was convinced that the divisions between the ''africanists'' vs. the ''abandonistas'' had pushed Spain to the brink of civil war, and who had seized power to find a way out of the crisis.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"/&gt; General Primo de Rivera soon concluded that the war was unwinnable, and considered pulling back his troops to the coast with the aim of at least temporarily abandoning the Rif.&lt;ref name="Perry, James page 286"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 131 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 1924, Primo de Rivera  visited a Spanish Foreign Legion post at Ben Tieb in the Rif, and was served a banquet of eggs in different forms. In Spanish culture, eggs are a symbol of the testicles, and the dishes were intended to send a clear message. Primo de Rivera responded calmly that the army would be required to abandon only the minimum of territory and that junior officers should not dictate the measures necessary to resolve the Moroccan problem.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 132 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However he subsequently modified the plans for withdrawal, pulling the Spanish forces back from [[Chaouen]] and the Wad Lau region to a prepared fortified boundary named the "Primo Line".&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 133 ''Rebels in the Rif'', Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===French intervention===
[[File:Rif cordon sanitaire.jpg|thumb|Contemporary map showing border and French military posts.]]
In May 1924, the French Army had established a line of out-posts north of the [[Oureghla]] River in disputed tribal territory. On 12 April 1925, an estimated 8,000&lt;ref&gt;Martin Windrow, p15 "French Foreign Legion 1914–1945, {{ISBN|1-85532-761-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rifians attacked this line and in two weeks over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned. French casualties exceeded 1,000 killed, 3,700 wounded and 1,000 missing – representing losses of over 20 percent of their forces deployed in the Rif.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xlD0JS16w9oC&amp;dq=rif+war+french+posts&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The French empire between the wars: imperialism, politics and society''], Martin Thomas, Manchester University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7190-6518-6}}, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; The French accordingly intervened on the side of Spain, employing up to 160,000&lt;ref&gt;David S. Woolman, page 186 "Rebels in the Rif", Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; well trained and equipped troops from Metropolitan, Algerian, [[Senegalese tirailleurs|Senegalese]] and Foreign Legion units, as well as Moroccan regulars ([[tirailleurs]]) and auxiliaries ([[goumiers]]). With total Spanish forces now numbering about 90,000 the Rifian forces were now seriously outnumbered by their Franco-Spanish opponents.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abd el-Krim|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak – Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final French deaths from battle and disease, in what had now become a major war, were to total 8,628.&lt;ref&gt;General R. Hure, page 252 "L'Armee d'Afrique 1830–1962", Paris-Limoges, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
[[File:Desembarco de Alhucemas, por José Moreno Carbonero.jpg|thumb|[[Alhucemas landing]], by [[José Moreno Carbonero]]]]
For the final attack commencing on 8 May 1925, the French and Spanish had ranged 123,000 men, supported by 150 aircraft, against 12,000 Rifians.&lt;ref name="pennell1"&gt;Pennell, C. R.; page 214&lt;/ref&gt; Superior manpower and technology soon resolved the course of the war in favour of France and Spain. The French troops pushed through from the south while the Spanish fleet and army secured [[Al Hoceima|Alhucemas]] Bay by an [[amphibious landing]], and began attacking from the north. After one year of bitter resistance, [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]], the leader of both the tribes, surrendered to French authorities, and in 1926 [[Spanish Morocco]] was finally retaken.

However, the unpopularity of the war in Spain and the earlier humiliations of the Spanish military contributed to the instability of the Spanish government and the [[Spain under the Restoration#Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923–1930)|military coup of 1923]].

[[File:Vasse Presentation.jpg|thumb|Rupert Gerritsen]]
'''Rupert Gerritsen''' (1953&amp;ndash;2013) was an Australian historian and a noted authority on Indigenous Australian prehistory. Coupled with his work on early Australian cartography, he played an influential part in re-charting Australian history prior to its settlement by the British in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/rupert-gerritsen-r-o-n-1953-2013/&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Canberra, A.C.T. on Sunday 3 November 2013.

==Early years==
Rupert Gerritsen was born in [[Geraldton]],&lt;ref name="Fremantle Press"&gt;[http://www.fremantlepress.com.au/illustrators/282/Rupert+Gerritsen?PeopleGroup=2 Fremantle Press Authors "G"] Fremantle Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Australia]] in 1953, of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] parents.&lt;ref name="Fremantle Press"/&gt; He grew up in [[Geraldton]] where he experienced first hand the excitement of the discovery of the wreck of the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]] in 1963 and came to know some of those involved in its discovery and the discovery of other 17th and 18th century shipwrecks on the coast of [[Western Australia]].

From 1960s through to the 1980s he was involved in radical politics and social activism and promoted social justice and empowerment.

Professionally he was engaged for many years in [[Western Australia]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] in youth work, community work and mental health, and specialise in developmental work.&lt;ref name="Mental Health Foundation ACT Staff"&gt;[http://www.mhf.org.au/mhf/AboutUs.aspx?a=4&amp;s=58&amp;c=140 Mental Health Foundation ACT Staff] Mental Health Foundation ACT, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rupert Gerritsen Consulting"&gt;[http://rupertgerritsen.tripod.com/home.htm Rupert Gerritsen Research and Consultancy] Rupert Gerritsen Research and Consultancy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous Prehistory and Early Australian Historical Research==
Although not his first work published, ''And Their Ghosts May Be Heard'', (1994, 2nd edition in 2002),&lt;ref name="NLA"&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11253387 National Library of Australia] National Library of Australia Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the best known. It is a detailed exploration of the fate of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mariners castaway on the [[Western Australian]] coast in the 1600s and early 1700s.

Gerritsen was involved in establishing that possibly some 16% of [[Nhanda language|Nhanda]], an Aboriginal language of the central west coast of [[Western Australia]], was derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as a result of interaction with marooned sailors.&lt;ref name="Nhanda"&gt;Anonymous 1995 ‘''Example of How Not to Use Historical Sources''.’ In Paper and Talk: ''A Manual for Reconstituting Materials in Australian Indigenous Languages from Historical Sources'', edited by N. Thieberger, 146. Canberra: Aboriginal Studies Press; Editor 1997 ''‘Editorial.’'' Australian Aboriginal Studies 1997/II: 1; Gerritsen, R. 1997 ''‘The Note on Page 146 of ‘Paper and Talk’: A Response.’'' Australian Aboriginal Studies 1997/II: 55-57; Blevins, J. 1998 ''‘A Dutch Influence on Nhanda? Wanyjidaga innga!’'' Australian Aboriginal Studies 1998/I: 43-46; Gerritsen, R. 2001 ''‘A Dutch influence on Nhanda?: A Reply to Blevins.’'' Australian Aboriginal Studies 2001/I: 69-73. Blevins, J. 2001 ''A Dutch influence on Nhanda? Malya kanangga!’'' Australian Aboriginal Studies 2001/I: 74-75. Blevins, J. 2001 ''Nhanda: An Aboriginal Language of Western Australia'': Oceanic Linguistics Special Publication No. 30. Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press; Gerritsen, R. 2004 ''Historical problems and methodological issues regarding Nhanda, an Aboriginal language of Western Australia.'' Anthropological Linguistics 46(1):84-99.&lt;/ref&gt; This groundbreaking discovery has led to major reevaluation in the perceptions of the early prehistory in that [[Aboriginal Australians]] were not mute witnesses to the unfolding events history but active participants who embraced parts of European culture long before the [[British people|British]] settlement of the continent.

On a more specific level, Gerritsen also researched the location where two mutineers from the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]] mutiny, possibly Australia’s first European settlers, were marooned on 16 November 1629.&lt;ref name="Playford"&gt;Playford, P. E. 1959 ‘''Wreck of the [[Zuytdorp]] on the Western Australian coast in 1712''.’, Journal and Proceedings of the Western Australian Historical Society 5(5):37-8; Gerritsen, R. 1994 ''And Their Ghost May Be Heard'', South Fremantle: Fremantle Arts Centre Press, pp.271-87; Playford P. E. 1996, ''Carpet of Silver: The Wreck of the [[Zuytdorp]]'', Nedlands: University of Western Australia Press, pp.237-42; Gerritsen, R. 2007 ''‘The debate over where Australia’s first European residents were marooned in 1629 – Part 1.’'' Hydrographic Journal 126:20-25; Gerritsen, R. 2009 ''‘The debate over where Australia’s first European residents were marooned in 1629 – Part 2.’'' Hydrographic Journal 128-9:35-41.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of his research Gerritsen established that [[Hutt River (Western Australia)|Hutt River]], 500 kilometres north of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was the site where Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye first set foot on mainland [[Australia]]. These discoveries wrought a complete change in the methodology of recording early [[Western Australian]] pre-history. Many subsequent scholars have embraced this new historical paradigm in their works.&lt;ref name="Drake"&gt;Drake-Brockman, H. ''1963 Voyage to Disaster'', Sydney: Angus and Robertson, pp.295-300; Gerritsen, R, Slee, C. and Cramer, M. 2003/2005 ''The Batavia Legacy, Geraldton'': Batavia Coast Maritime Heritage Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is the ending of triumphal history which described the inevitability of growth of wealth and prosperity of [[Western Australia]] under the shroud of [[British colonialism]]. Such a view suppressed the inclusiveness of other voices which, through the march of time, proved to be an anathema to a [[multicultural]] society.

After the appearance of ''Ghosts'', Gerritsen published a range of papers and monographs in diverse fields, from [[archaeology]] to [[historical linguistics]], and another book, ''Australia and the Origins of Agriculture''. This work put forward evidence that some [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] groups in [[Australia]] in traditional circumstances were engaged in food production, including [[agriculture]], and lived in large permanent settlements.

==Other Research==
Gerritsen undertook research and published extensively on a diverse range of subjects. This included:
 
* Identification of the oldest ceremonial object in the world, a 28,000-year-old cylcon found at [[Cuddie Springs]].
* Ethnographic and ethnogenic evidence of interaction between Indigenous Australians and [[megafauna]].
* A study of the global prehistory of water craft and island colonisation, leading to a new theory on the original colonisation of Australia.
* Various co-authored papers on the ''Freycinet Map of 1811'', the first full map of Australia to be published, and identifying the first world map showing a full map of Australia, published in 1810.
* A number of papers identifying events during the Batavia Mutiny in 1629 as the first criminal prosecutions, the first military conflict and the first naval engagements in Australian history.

==Awards==
In recognition of his work on Australian pre-history and its [[Netherlands|Dutch]] influence, in 2007, [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] of the [[Netherlands]] conferred upon Gerritsen the honour of Knight of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].

In August 2012 Gerritsen was awarded the Dorthy Prescott Prize for the paper, "Getting the strait facts straight", he gave at the Brisbane International Geospatial Forum.

==Australia on the Map==
Gerritsen was co-founder, along with Peter Reynders, of ''[[Australia on the Map]]: 1606–2006'', and was that organisation’s National Secretary.&lt;ref name="Australia on the Map"&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/43016/20070706-0837/www.australiaonthemap.org.au/index.html Australia on the Map] Australiaon the Map: 1606-2006, Australia on the Map, a division of the Australasian Hydrographic Society, on Tuesday, 5 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At his death he was Chair of its successor organisation, the ''[[Australia on the Map]]'' Division of the [[Australasian Hydrographic Society]] which aims to make Australians more aware of Australia's early history and heritage, beginning in 1606.&lt;ref name="Map"&gt;[http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au Australia on the Map, a division of the Australasian Hydrographic Society] [[Australia on the Map]], a division of the Australasian [http://www.ahs.asn.au/ Australasian Hydrographic Society] Hydrographic Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Australia on the Map Division of the Australasian Hydrographic Society, Gerritsen had sole or joint responsibility for a number of projects, including the "Search for the Deadwater Wreck".

==Current Research==
Gerritsen was a Petherick Researcher at the [[National Library of Australia]] since April 1995.&lt;ref name="Petherick "&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/11779/20040524-0000/www.nla.gov.au/ntwkpubs/gw/61/p09a01.html Petherick Researcher] Mary Gosling, Petherick Librarian, Gateways, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and focussed his research and writing on early Australian history.

==Background==
{{See also|Euromaidan|2014 Ukrainian revolution|History of Crimea|1954 transfer of Crimea}}

Despite being an independent country since 1991, Ukraine has been perceived by [[Russia]] as being part of its [[sphere of interest]]. Iulian Chifu and his co-authors claim that in regard to Ukraine, Russia pursues a modernized version of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] on "limited sovereignty", which dictates that the sovereignty of Ukraine cannot be larger than that of the [[Warsaw Pact]] prior to the [[Revolutions of 1989|demise]] of the [[Soviet sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name="Chifu"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cpc-ew.ro/pdfs/the_russian_georgian_war.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Russian Georgian War: A trilateral cognitive institutional approach of the crisis decision-making process|chapter=Russia–Georgia War of August 2008: Ukrainian Approach |publisher=Editura Curtea Veche|publication-place=Bucharest|year=2009|isbn=978-973-1983-19-6|author=Iulian Chifu|author2=Oazu Nantoi|author3=Oleksandr Sushko|page=181|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This claim is based on statements of Russian leaders that [[Ukraine-NATO relations|possible integration]] of Ukraine into [[NATO]] would jeopardize Russia's national security.&lt;ref name="Chifu" /&gt;

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, both nations retained very close ties. At the same time, there were several sticking points, most importantly Ukraine's significant [[Nuclear weapons and Ukraine|nuclear arsenal]], which Ukraine agreed to abandon in the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]] on the condition that Russia (and the other signatories) would issue an assurance against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. In 1999, Russia was one of signatories of [[1999 Istanbul summit|Charter for European Security]], where it "reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Istanbul Document 1999|url = http://www.osce.org/node/39569|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|date=19 November 1999|accessdate = 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; both would prove worthless in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;nbc 18 March 2014 [http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/how-toothless-nato-over-russia-crimea-n55896], ukrainesolidaritycampaign [http://ukrainesolidaritycampaign.org/2015/01/28/ukraine-the-oligarchic-rebellion-in-the-donbas/ the oligarchic rebellion in the donbas]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second point was the division of the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Ukraine agreed to lease the [[Sevastopol]] port so that the Russian Black Sea fleet could continue to occupy it together with Ukraine. Starting in 1993, through the 1990s and 2000s, Ukraine and Russia engaged in several [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes|gas disputes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite contribution|last1=Overland| first1=Indra| contribution=The Hunter Becomes the Hunted: Gazprom Encounters EU Regulation |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309502480| editor-last1=Anderson | editor-first1=Svein |editor-last2=Goldthau|editor-first2=Andreas|editor-last3=Sitter|editor-first3=Nick|title="Energy Union: Europe's New Liberal Mercantilism?"|place=Blasingstoke|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|pages=115130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Ukraine, along with Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, formed a group called [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]], which was seen by Russia as a direct challenge to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], the Russian-dominated trade group established after the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=-5141|title=Axis of Evil Shaping Against Moscow|work=Kommersant|accessdate=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520122050/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=-5141|archivedate=20 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was further irritated by the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004, which saw the Ukrainian populist [[Viktor Yushchenko]] elected president instead of the pro-Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579399320362286500|title=Russia Stung By Ally Yanukovych's Defeat in Ukraine|first=Gregory L. |last=White|date=23 February 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Yanukovich. Moreover, Ukraine continued to increase its cooperation with [[NATO]], deploying the third-largest contingent of troops to Iraq in 2004, as well as dedicating peacekeepers to NATO missions such as the [[ISAF]] force in Afghanistan and [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] in [[Kosovo]].

A pro-Russian president, [[Viktor Yanukovich]], was elected in 2010 and Russia  felt that many ties with Ukraine could be repaired. Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017. However, Yanukovich signed a new lease and expanded allowable troop presence as well as allowing troops to train in the Kerch peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/21/ukraine-black-sea-fleet-russia|title=Ukraine extends lease for Russia's Black Sea fleet|first=Luke|last=Harding|work=The Guardian|date=22 April 2010|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many in Ukraine viewed the extension as unconstitutional because Ukraine's constitution states that no permanent foreign troops shall be stationed in Ukraine after the Sevastopol treaty expired. Yulia Tymoshenko, the main opposition figure of Yanukovich, was jailed on what many considered trumped up charges, leading to further dissatisfaction with the government. In November 2013, Viktor Yanukovich declined to sign an association agreement with the European Union, a treaty that had been in development for several years and one that Yanukovich had earlier approved of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukoych-flexes-but-will-resist-eu-over-jailed-rival-322990.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410033941/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukoych-flexes-but-will-resist-eu-over-jailed-rival-322990.html|archivedate=10 April 2013|title=Yanukovych flexes but will resist EU over jailed rival|work=Kyiv Post|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yanukovich instead favored closer ties with Russia.

In September 2013, Russia warned Ukraine that if it went ahead with a planned agreement on free trade with the [[European Union|EU]], it would face financial catastrophe and possibly the collapse of the state.&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt; [[Sergey Glazyev]], adviser to President Vladimir Putin, said that, "Ukrainian authorities make a huge mistake if they think that the Russian reaction will become neutral in a few years from now. This will not happen." Russia had already imposed import restrictions on certain Ukrainian products and Glazyev did not rule out further sanctions if the agreement was signed. Glazyev allowed for the possibility of separatist movements springing up in the Russian-speaking east and south of Ukraine. He suggested that, contrary to international law, if Ukraine signed the agreement, Russia would consider the bilateral treaty that delineates the countries' borders to be void. Russia would no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Russia.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia|title=Ukraine's EU trade deal will be catastrophic, says Russia|first=Shaun|last=Walker|work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euromaidan and Anti-Maidan===
Following months of protests as part of the [[Euromaidan]] movement, on 22 February 2014, protesters [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|ousted]] the government of Viktor Yanukovych, who had been [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|democratically elected in 2010]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; The protesters took control of government buildings in the capital city of [[Kiev]], along with the city itself. As the police abandoned their posts across the capital Kiev and the opposition established control over key intersections and the parliament, President Yanukovych fled Kiev for [[Kharkiv]] in the east of Ukraine, where he traditionally has had more support.&lt;ref name="worldtime"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/22/ukraines-president-flees-protestors-capture-kiev/|work=Time|title=Ukraine Protestors Seize Kiev As President Flees|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident, the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] voted to restore the 2004 [[Constitution of Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine parliament votes in favor of return to old constitution|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/21/us-ukraine-crisis-constitution-idUSBREA1K17420140221|website=Reuters|date=21 February 2014|accessdate=12 June 2015|first=Richard|last=Balmforth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remove Yanukovych from power.&lt;ref name="RadioFreeEurope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aljz01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine President Yanukovich impeached|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/ukraine-parliament-ousts-president-yanukovich-2014222152035601620.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vote on the resolution that stated that Yanukovych "is removing himself [from power] because he is not fulfilling his obligations"&lt;ref name="worldtime"/&gt; emerged 328–0 in support.

One of the first issues the parliament approached was that of the language, annulling a bill that provided for Russian to be used as a second official government language in regions with large Russian-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/ukraine-crisis-western-nations-eu-russia |title=Western nations scramble to contain fallout from Ukraine crisis |date=24 February 2014 | work=The Guardian |first=Ian|last=Traynor|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament adopted a [[bill (law)|bill]] to repeal the 2012 [[Legislation on languages in Ukraine|law on minority languages]], which protected the status of languages other than Ukrainian.

In the meantime, on the morning of 27 February, [[Berkut (Ukraine)|Berkut]] special police units from Crimea and other regions of Ukraine, which had been dissolved on 25 February, seized checkpoints on the [[Isthmus of Perekop]] and [[Chonhar peninsula]].&lt;ref name="wsj-feb28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="armyansk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armyansk.info/news/news-archive/120-2014/4592-pod-armyansk-styanulis-siloviki-iz-berkuta |script-title=ru:Под Армянск стянулись силовики из "Беркута" |date=27 February 2014|website= armyansk.info|language=ru |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ukrainian MP [[Hennadiy Moskal]], former chief of the Crimean police, these Berkut had [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, [[grenade launcher]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, machine guns, and other weapons.&lt;ref name="armyansk" /&gt; Since then, they have controlled all land traffic between Crimea and continental Ukraine.&lt;ref name="armyansk" /&gt;

===Russian political actions===
In August 2016 the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) published telephone intercepts from 2014 of [[Sergey Glazyev]] (Russian presidential adviser), [[Konstantin Zatulin]], and other people where they discussed covert funding of pro-Russian activists in Eastern Ukraine, occupation of administration buildings and other actions that in due course led to the armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2016/08/22/besedy-sergeya-glazieva-o-kryme-i-besporyadkah-na-vostoke-ukrainy-rasshifrovka|title=Беседы "Сергея Глазьева" о Крыме и беспорядках на востоке Украины.

{{See also|War in Donbass|Timeline of the war in Donbass}}

The war in Donbass is an armed conflict in the [[Donbass]] region of [[Ukraine]]. From the beginning of March 2014, demonstrations by [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] and anti-government groups took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] oblasts of Ukraine, together commonly called the "Donbass", in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] and the [[Euromaidan]] movement. These demonstrations, which followed the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], and which were part of a wider group of [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine]], escalated into an [[War|armed conflict]] between the Russia-backed [[Separatism|separatist forces]] of the self-declared [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic|Lugansk]] People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412131249/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html |archivedate=12 April 2014 |title=Armed pro-Russian insurgents in Luhansk say they are ready for police raid |work=Kyiv Post |date=12 April 2014  |accessdate= 11 April 2015|last=Grytsenko |first=Oksana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-special-forces-sent-eastern-city-retake-buildings-082049113.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414125950/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-special-forces-sent-eastern-city-retake-buildings-082049113.html |archivedate=14 April 2014 |title=Ukraine to deploy troops to quash pro-Russian insurgency in the east |work=Yahoo News Canada |date=14 April 2014 |agency=Associated Press |last=Leonard |first=Peter | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] claimed key commanders of the rebel movement during the beginning of the conflict, including [[Igor Girkin|Igor Strelkov]] and [[Igor Bezler]] were Russian agents.&lt;ref name="tg0x01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/three-pro-russia-rebel-leaders-suspects-over-downed-mh17|title=Three pro-Russia rebel leaders at the centre of suspicions over downed MH17|author=Alec Luhn|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tgox02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/-sp-ukraine-rebel-igor-bezler-interview-demon|title=An audience with Ukraine rebel chief Igor Bezler, the Demon of Donetsk|author=Shaun Walker|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister of Donetsk People's Republic from May to August 2014 was a Russian citizen [[Alexander Borodai]].&lt;ref name="REUeuada"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/27/us-ukraine-crisis-rebels-insight-idUSKBN0FW07020140727 |title=Pushing locals aside, Russians take top rebel posts in east Ukraine |agency=Reuters |date=27 July 2014 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 2014 all top positions in Donetsk and Lugansk have been held by Ukrainian citizens.&lt;ref name="nytimes0x01"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/europe/plenty-of-room-at-the-top-of-ukraines-fading-rebellion.html|date=20 August 2014|title=Plenty of room at the top of Ukraine's fading rebellion|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2014|first=Andrew E.|last=Kramer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jamestown-20140815"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42756&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=27&amp;cHash=d9a2b36398fb823841ea5b668577feca#.U-8Yxdr3-yw Strelkov/Girkin Demoted, Transnistrian Siloviki Strengthened in 'Donetsk People's Republic'], [[Vladimir Socor]], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Russian citizens are reported to make up from 15% to 80% of the combatants,&lt;ref name="REUeuada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumedia.biz/news/3037 Представитель ДНР назвал процент российских добровольцев в местной армии] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225025500/http://rumedia.biz/news/3037 |date=25 February 2015 }}. 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.censor.net.ua/resonance/295448/rossiyiskiyi_naemnik_polovina_opolchentsev_iz_rossii_mne_pomogayut_sponsory_my_vozmem_lvov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727190415/http://m.censor.net.ua/resonance/295448/rossiyiskiyi_naemnik_polovina_opolchentsev_iz_rossii_mne_pomogayut_sponsory_my_vozmem_lvov|archivedate=27 July 2014 |title=Российский Наемник: "Половина Ополченцев - Из России.

Separatist leaders such as [[Aleksey Mozgovoy]] visited Moscow and were evasive about who was supplying their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plclJv-V2Z0|title=Secret training base for Ukraine's militias - BBC News|date=19 May 2014 |accessdate= 11 April 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting held on 7 July, in the city of Donetsk, Russian politician [[Sergey Kurginyan]] held a press conference with representatives of the [[Donbass People's Militia]], including [[Pavel Gubarev]], and said that Russia did provide significant military support for the separatists. During a discussion among the participants, Gubarev complained that the arms that had been sent were old, and not fully functional. In response, Kurginyan listed specific items, including 12,000 automatic rifles, grenade launchers, [[2S9 Nona]] self-propelled mortars, two [[BMP development|BMPs]], and three tanks, that he knew had been supplied to the separatists by Russia. He also said he saw new, fully functional weapons unloaded at locations in [[Donbass]] which he would not "disclose as we are filmed by cameras". Kurginyan admitted that Russia had initially sent "4th category weapons", but since 3 June had supplied equipment that was fully functional. He also said one of his goals whilst in Donetsk was to ensure that military support from Russia was increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Catherine A.|last=Fitzpatrick|url=http://www.interpretermag.com/novorossiya-theory-meets-novorossiya-reality-in-donetsk/|title=Novorossiya Theory Meets Novorossiya Reality in Donetsk|publisher=The Interpreter Magazine|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Catherine A.|last=Fitzpatrick|url=http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-this-week-lurid-anti-ukraine-propaganda-broadcast-on-state-tv/|title=Russia This Week: Kurginyan Brags About Sending Repairman for Buks (14–19 July)|publisher=The Interpreter Magazine|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAOnrGxpdgk|title=Full press conference of Kurginyan in Donetsk|date=7 July 2014|author=[[Pavel Gubarev]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hromadske.tv/society/boioviki----dnr----zhaliyutsya-shcho-rosiya-pogano/|script-title=uk:Ідеолог сепаратистів: Росія постачає 'ДНР' сучасною бронетехнікою|trans-title=Ideologue of the separatists: Russia supplies the 'DPR' with modern armaments|language=uk|publisher=Hromadske.tv|date=8 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826040011/http://www.hromadske.tv/society/boioviki----dnr----zhaliyutsya-shcho-rosiya-pogano/|archivedate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.pn/ru/RussiaInvadedUkraine/108347|title=Terrorists of DNR admitted that Russia delivers them the weapon and equipment, but complain of quality|date=8 July 2014|publisher=News.pn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Tim Judah]] wrote in the [[The New York Review of Books|NYR]] blog about the scale of the devastation suffered by Ukrainian forces in southeastern Ukraine over the last week of August 2014 that it amounted "to a catastrophic defeat and will long be remembered by embittered Ukrainians as among the darkest days of their history." The scale of the destruction achieved in several ambushes revealed "that those attacking the pro-government forces were highly professional and using very powerful weapons." The fighting in Ilovaysk had begun on 7 August when units from three Ukrainian volunteer militias and the police attempted to take it back from rebel control. Then, on 28 August, the rebels were able to launch a major offensive, with help from elsewhere, including Donetsk—though "not Russia," according to Commander Givi, the head of rebel forces there. By 1 September it was all over and the Ukrainians had been decisively defeated. Commander Givi said the ambushed forces were militias, not regular soldiers, whose numbers had been boosted, 'by foreigners, including Czechs, Hungarians, and "niggers."

In total, over 8,000 soldiers had fought there at different moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eurasianintelligence.org/news.php?new=108&amp;num |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016232436/http://eurasianintelligence.org/news.php?new=108&amp;num |archivedate=16 October 2014 |title=Russian units participating in combat actions in Ukraine |publisher=Center for Eurasian Strategic Intelligence |date=22 October 2014 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] stated that the Russian separatists enjoyed technical advantages over the Ukrainian army since the large inflow of advanced military systems in mid-2014: effective anti-aircraft weapons ("Buk", MANPADS) suppressed Ukrainian air strikes, Russian drones provided intelligence, and Russian secure communications system thwarted the Ukrainian side from communications intelligence. The Russian side also frequently employed electronic warfare systems that Ukraine lacked. Similar conclusions about the technical advantage of the Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31146595 |title=Ukraine crisis: Russia tests new weapons |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |first=Keir|last=Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, [[Igor Girkin]] gave a long interview to the extreme right-wing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4348334/Russia_-_The_Uses_of_Extremism_The_Emergence_of_Three_Far-Right_Discussion_Clubs_and_Their_Links_to_the_Kremlin_Spell_More_Bad_News_for_East-West_Relations|title=Russia&amp;nbsp;— The Uses of Extremism: The Emergence of Three Far-Right Discussion Clubs and Their Links to the Kremlin Spell More Bad News for East-West Relations|first=Andreas|last=Umland|publisher=|accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; nationalist newspaper ''Zavtra'' ("Tomorrow") where for the first time he released details about the beginning of the conflict in Donbass. According to Girkin, he was the one who "pulled the trigger of war" and it was necessary because acquisition of Crimea alone by Russia "did not make sense" and Crimea as part of the Novorossiya "would make the jewel in the crown of the [[Russian Empire]]". Girkin had been directed to Donbass by [[Sergey Aksyonov]] and he entered Ukraine with a group of 52 officers in April, initially taking Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and then other cities. Girkin also talked about the situation in August, when separatist forces were close to defeat and only a prompt intervention of Russian "leavers" (ironic term for "soldiers on leave") saved them. Their forces took command in the siege of Mariupol as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zavtra.ru/content/view/kto-tyi-strelok/ |script-title=ru:"Кто ты, "Стрелок"?" |work=Zavtra |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2014 |first1=Alexander|last1=Prokhanov|authorlink1=Alexander Prokhanov |first2=Igor|last2=Strelkov |trans-title=Who are you, Strelok? |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uatoday.tv/politics/former-insurgent-chief-s-claim-punctures-kremlin-denials-392885.html |title='We started Ukraine war', confesses insurgent leader Girkin |publisher=Ukraine Today |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to internal criticism of the Russian government's policy of not officially recognizing Russian soldiers in Ukraine as fulfilling military service and leaving their families without any source of income if they are killed, president Vladimir Putin signed a new law in October entitling their families to a monthly compensation.

Alexandr Negrebetskih, a deputy from the Russian city of [[Zlatoust]] who fought as a volunteer on the side of separatists, complained in an interview that "the locals run to Russia, and we have to come here as they are reluctant to defend their land" which resulted in his detachment being composed of 90% Russians and only 10% locals from [[Donetsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ura.ru/articles/1036263086 |title=Из-за неграмотного командования нас расстреливают в упор! |publisher=URA.ru |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6T3JI3G0t?url=http://ura.ru/content/chel/01-10-2014/articles/1036263086.html |archivedate=3 October 2014 |trans-title=Because of poor command we are being killed! |language=ru |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Lev Shlosberg published a response from a military attorney's office to questions he asked about the status of Pskov paratroopers killed in Ukraine in August. The office answered that the soldiers died while "fulfilling military service outside of their permanent dislocation units" (Pskov), but any further information on their orders or location of death was withheld as "classified". A political expert Alexey Makarkin compared these answers to those provided by Soviet ministry of defence during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] when the [[USSR]] attempted to hide the scale of their casualties at any cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2014/11/10/6297181.shtml |script-title=ru:Гостайна о гибели псковских десантников |publisher=Gazeta.ru |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=11 November 2014 |trans-title=Classified response on death of Pskov paratroopers |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous reports of Russian troops and warfare on Ukrainian territory were raised in [[United Nations Security Council]] meetings. In 12 November meeting, the representative of the United Kingdom also accused Russia of intentionally constraining [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] observatory missions' capabilities, pointing out that the observers were allowed to monitor only two kilometers of border between Ukraine and Russia, and drones deployed to extend their capabilities were being jammed or shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webtv.un.org/meetings-events/security-council/watch/ukraine-security-council-7311th-meeting/3888744131001 |title=Ukraine&amp;nbsp;— Security Council, 7311th meeting |publisher=United Nations |date=12 November 2014 |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Armament Research Services published a detailed report on arms used by both sides of the conflict, documenting a number of "flag items". Among vehicles, they documented the presence of T-72B Model 1989 and T-72B3 tanks, armoured vehicles of models BTR-82AM, MT-LB 6MA, MT-LBVM, and MT-LBVMK, and an Orlan-10 drone and 1RL239 radar vehicle. Among the ammunition, they documented [[9K38 Igla]] (date of manufacture 2014), ASVK rifle (2012), RPG-18 rocket launchers (2011), 95Ya6 rocket boosters (2009) MRO-A (2008), [[9M133 Kornet]] anti-tank weapons (2007), PPZR Grom (2007), MON-50 (2002), RPO-A (2002), PKP (2001), OG-7 (2001), and VSS rifles (1987). These weapons, mostly manufactured in Russia, were used by pro-Russian separatists in the conflict zone, but never "were in the Ukrainian government inventory prior to the outbreak of hostilities". The report also noted the use of PPZR Grom [[MANPAD]]s, produced in Poland and never exported to Ukraine. They were however exported to Georgia in 2007 and subsequently captured by the Russian army during the [[Russian-Georgian War 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armamentresearch.com/Uploads/Research%20Report%20No.%203%20-%20Raising%20Red%20Flags.pdf|title=Raising Red Flags: An Examination of Arms &amp; Munitions in the Ongoing Conflict in Ukraine|format=PDF|publisher=Armaments Research Services|date=2012|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November, [[Pantsir-S1]] units were observed in separatist-controlled areas near [[Novoazovsk]], which were never part of the UAF's inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nemtsova|first=Anna |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/10/in-ukraine-winter-is-coming-and-so-are-the-russians.html |title=Ukraine Could Explode in the Next 48 Hours |work=The Daily Beast |date=10 November 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bellingcat]] maintains a dedicated database of geolocated images of military vehicles specific to each side of the conflict, mostly focused on Russian military equipment found on Ukrainian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bellingcat-vehicles.silk.co/ |title=Bellingcat Vehicles |publisher=Bellingcat |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, [[Novaya Gazeta]] published an interview with a Russian soldier, Dorzhi Batomunkuev, who operated a tank in the [[Battle of Debaltseve]] and was wounded. He confirmed that the tanks came from his military unit in [[Ulan-Ude]] in Russia and that his unit "painted over the serial numbers and unit signs straight away on the rail platforms". In November 2014, Batomunkuev was sent as a conscript to [[Rostov-on-Don]], where he became a contract soldier. Traveling by train with his unit from Ulan-Ude, Batomunkuev said he saw "plenty of such trains" travelling along with them "day after day". After three months at Kosminskiy training facility, their unit of 31 tanks and 300 soldiers in total (mostly [[Buryats]]) was given an order to move on 8 February 2015 and crossed the Ukrainian border in the night, arriving in Donetsk in the morning.

A report by [[Igor Sutyagin]] published by the [[Royal United Services Institute]] in March 2015 stated that a total of 42,000 regular Russian combat troops have been involved in the fighting, with a peak strength of 10,000 in December 2014. The direct involvement of the Russian troops on Ukrainian territory began in August 2014, at a time when Ukrainian military successes created the possibility that the pro-Russian rebels would collapse. According to the report, the Russian troops are the most capable units on the anti-Ukrainian side, with the regular Donetsk and Luhansk rebel formations being used essentially as "cannon fodder".&lt;ref name=42k&gt;{{cite news|title=Scale of Russian military intervention in Ukraine revealed, says report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/russia-struggling-ukraine-military-operations-report|accessdate=11 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RUSI2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/201503_BP_Russian_Forces_in_Ukraine_FINAL.pdf |title=Russian Forces in Ukraine |publisher=[[Royal United Services Institute]] |date=March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508220714/https://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/201503_BP_Russian_Forces_in_Ukraine_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] stated that the Russian separatists enjoyed technical advantages over the Ukrainian army since the large inflow of advanced military systems in mid-2014: effective anti-aircraft weapons ("Buk", MANPADS) suppressed Ukrainian air strikes, Russian drones provided intelligence, and Russian secure communications system thwarted the Ukrainian side from communications intelligence. The Russian side also frequently employed electronic warfare systems that Ukraine lacked. Similar conclusions about the technical advantage of the Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies Research Centre.&lt;ref name="RUSI2015" /&gt;

He described the arrival of Russian military vehicles and personnel from across the border as critical to the success of large-scale operations such as the [[battle of Debaltseve]]. Russian high-rank officers planned the operations and regular Russian army units with DPR forces carried them out jointly. In Sapozhnikov's opinion, "everyone knows that" and it's "no secret", but he was surprised to find out that it is not so widely acknowledged in Russia when he returned to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Sapozhnikov1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.vice.com/article/russian-soldiers-have-given-up-pretending-they-are-not-fighting-in-ukraine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090708/https://news.vice.com/article/russian-soldiers-have-given-up-pretending-they-are-not-fighting-in-ukraine | archivedate=2015-04-02 | title=Russian Soldiers Have Given Up Pretending They Are Not Fighting in Ukraine | publisher=Vice News | date=31 March 2015 | accessdate=1 April 2015 |first=Alec |last= Luhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, a group of Russian volunteers returning to [[Ekaterinburg]] complained in an interview to local media about a lack of support from the local population, who sometimes called them "occupiers", and their highly ambiguous status while in Donbass: Ukraine and "the court in Madrid" considered them to be terrorists; the DPR considered them "illegal armed groups" and offered them contracts, but if they signed they would become mercenaries under Russian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-422297.html | title="Местные называли нас оккупантами": больше сотни уральских добровольцев вернулись с Украины в Екатеринбург | publisher=Ekaterinburg On-line | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=15 April 2015 |first=Ilya |last= Kazakov |trans-title="Locals call us occupiers": over a hundred of volunteers from Ural returned from Ukraine to Ekaterinburg|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another volunteer, a citizen of [[Latvia]] nicknamed [[Latgalians|"Latgalian"]], told on his return from Donbass that he was disappointed with how the situation there differed from what he had seen in the Russian media: he saw no support and sometimes open hostility to the insurgents from the local civilians, presence of Russian troops and military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grani.lv/world/52916-latgalec-rasskazal-ob-uvidennom-v-dnr.html | title=Латгалец рассказал об увиденном в ДНР | publisher=Grani.lv | date=22 April 2015 | accessdate=24 April 2015 |trans-title=Latgalian described what he saw in DPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in early April, a number of Russian [[spetznaz]] soldiers took pictures of themselves changing their military uniforms into "miner's [[battledress]]" used by the insurgents, and posted them on their [[VK (social networking website)|VK]] pages, where they were picked up by Ukrainian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://podrobnosti.ua/2029738-spetsnazovets-iz-tambova-kak-rossijskaja-armija-pereodevaetsja-pered-donbassom.html | title=Спецназовец из Тамбова: как россиян переодевают в "шахтеров" перед отправкой на Донбасс (фото) | publisher=Podrobnosti.ua | date=21 April 2015 | accessdate=24 April 2015 |first=Oleg |last=Kamkov |trans-title=Spetsnaz soldier from Tambov: how Russian soldiers turn into "miners" before being sent to Donbass|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another volunteer, Bondo Dorovskih, who left to Donbass to "fight fascism" gave a long interview to Russian media on his return, describing how he found himself "not in an army, but in a gang", involved in large-scale looting.

On 22 April 2015, the [[US Department of State]] accused the "combined Russian-separatist forces" of accumulating air defence systems, UAV along with command and control equipment in eastern Ukraine, and of conducting "complex" military training that "leaves no doubt that Russia is involved in the training".

In May 2015, [[Reuters]] interviewed a number of Russian soldiers, some named and some speaking under condition of anonymity, who were serving in Donbass as truck drivers, crew of a T-72B3 tank and of a "Grad" launcher. Some of their colleagues resigned when asked to go to Donbass by their commanders, which was "not an easy decision" because the salary offered was between 20 and 60,000 rubles per month. The members of the "Grad" launcher crew confirmed they were shelling targets in Ukraine from Russian territory, around 2&amp;nbsp;km from the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0NV06Q20150510?irpc=932 | title=Special Report: Russian soldiers quit over Ukraine | publisher=Reuters | date=10 May 2015 | accessdate=10 May 2015 |first=Maria |last= Tsvetkova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, two GRU soldiers, Alexander Alexandrov and Yevgeny Yerofeyev, were captured alive in a battle near Schastie and were later interviewed by press, admitting to being on active duty at the time of capture.

Vladimir Yefimov, leader of one of such organisations, explained in details in an interview how the process works in [[Ural (region)|Ural]] area. The organisation recruits mostly army veterans, but also policemen, firefighters etc. with military experience. The cost of equipping one volunteer is estimated at around 350,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (around $6500) plus cost of the volunteer's salary from 60,000 to 240,000 rubles per month depending on their experience. The volunteers are issued a document claiming that their participation is limited to "offering humanitarian help" to avoid Russian [[mercenary]] laws. In Russia's anti-mercenary legislation a mercenary is defined as someone who "takes part [in fighting] with aims counter to the interests of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref name=RuamlKP&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/russia-trolls-world-by-saying-it-cannot-stop-its-citizens-from-fighting-in-ukraine-392006.html Russia trolls world by saying it cannot stop its citizens from fighting in Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (25 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The recruited travel to the conflict zone without weapons, which are given at the destination.

Another leader of a "patriotic organisation" from [[Orsk]], Pavel Korovin, estimated that a total of around 12,000 fighters for Donbass had been recruited from Russia. A significant proportion were people in difficult financial situations, attracted by a high salary (one of the volunteers was promised 100,000 rubles or $1600). Responding to concerns about crossing the Ukrainian border, he explained that "there is a green light for the volunteers on the border" and "all that is covered by appropriate structures". The family of a killed volunteer, when asking about help in bringing back the body, is advised to "speak to the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], only they are controlling everything there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvrain.ru/teleshow/reportazh/kto_verbuet_rossijskih_dobrovoltsev_i_chto_im_obeschajut_istorija_odnogo_naemnika_ekskljuziv_dozhdja-382605/ | title=Кто вербует российских добровольцев, и что им обещают.

The [[Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia]] started actively questioning the government's policy of "secret war" after a number of Russian soldiers officially sent for "training" to Rostov area died for reasons never officially revealed to the families. These cases were further investigated by non-mainstream media in Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defence always denied the presence of any Russian soldiers in Ukraine and, when presented with undeniable evidence about specific individuals, suggested that they might have crossed the border "by mistake", were "on holiday" at the time, or that their contracts were cancelled (but actually backdated).

Discussing Russian volunteers in an interview with [[RIA Novosti]] on 22 June 2015, [[Nikolai Patrushev]], secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]], stated: "We don't call on anyone to do this, we don't encourage it. But realistically, to stop them would be impossible".&lt;ref name=RuamlKP/&gt; While Russia has charged one of its citizens, Roman Zheleznov, for fighting in the Ukrainian [[Azov Battalion]], as of 25 June 2015, it has charged no one for fighting alongside the separatists.&lt;ref name=RuamlKP/&gt; Since counting began on 1 September 2014 until 1 June 2015, the European monitoring mission on the Russian side of the border has recorded 20,021 men in military uniforms crossing to and from rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian Town Near Ukraine, Once Quiet, Now Buzzes With Military Activity|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/europe/russian-town-near-ukraine-once-quiet-now-buzzes-with-military-activity.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 19 July 2015|access-date = 21 July 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Andrew E.|last = Kramer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, a number of Russian contract soldiers at "Kadamovskiy" poligon ([[Rostov Oblast|Rostovskaya oblast]]) were charged with [[desertion]] after they refused to go into Ukraine as "volunteers".

====Russian medal count====
Citizen journalist [[Eliot Higgins]] has pointed to the unusual spike in medals awarded to Russian troops coinciding with major battles occurring in Ukraine. It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014. In fact in the time period between 24 November 2014 and 25 January 2015 more of the medals were awarded then all of 2013 combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/08/31/russias-war-ukraine-medals-treacherous-numbers/|title=Russia's War in Ukraine: The medals and Treacherous Numbers|publisher=Bellingcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Training facility====

In a press briefing by the Ukrainian Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council (NSDC), [[Andriy Parubiy]] stated that militants were trained in a military facility in [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia. "Near Rostov-on-Don, there is a big military base where terrorists are preparing for deployment into the territory of the Ukrainian state. This is confirmed not only by our intelligence, but also Russian prisoners who were detained, and they testify about this base," Parubiy said. He added that more than a thousand militants are trained by Russian instructors, and then they in small armed groups try to break into the territory of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/terrorists_for_ukraine_trained_in_rostov_on_don_parubiy_says_321765|title=Terrorists for Ukraine trained in Rostov-on-Don, Parubiy says- Ukrinform|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May, Ukraine detained a Russian citizen trying to enter the country; he had military experience and was found to have recently trained in the Rostov facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/920457-v-harkove-zaderjali-snaypera-dvuh-chechenskih-kampaniy.html|script-title=ru:В Харькове задержали снайпера двух чеченских кампаний|trans-title=Two Chechen campaign snipers were arrested in Kharkiv|language=ru|work=unian.net|date=21 May 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russian 'volunteer' insurgent organiser Aleksandr Zhuchkovsky, [[Rostov-on-Don]] acts as a staging area, where soldiers live in hotels, rented flats and tent camps.&lt;ref name=nytj9&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Andrew E.|title=Russians Yearning to Join Ukraine Battle Find Lots of Helping Hands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/world/europe/russians-yearning-to-join-ukraine-battle-find-lots-of-helping-hands.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes|work=The New York Times|date=9 June 2014 |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the New York Times reports that the small village of [[Golovinka (Neklinovskiy district)|Golovinka]] (about {{convert | 60 | km }} northwest of Rostov-on-Don) and nearby Kuzminka military base is a staging area for Russian soldiers and weapons headed to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/europe/russian-town-near-ukraine-once-quiet-now-buzzes-with-military-activity.html | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 19 July 2015 | last = Kramer | first = Andrew E. | title = Russian Town Near Ukraine, Once Quiet, Now Buzzes With Military Activity | accessdate = 20 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Reuters]] published a logbook of an [[9K38 Igla]] missile that was signed out of military storage in [[Moscow]] for a military base in [[Rostov-on-Don]], and ended up with insurgents in Donbass, where it was eventually taken over by the Ukrainian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/29/us-ukraine-crisis-arms-specialreport-idUSKBN0FY0UA20140729?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |title=Special Report: Where Ukraine's separatists get their weapons |agency=Reuters |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014 |author1=Thomas Grove |author2=Warren Stroble }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] observers arrived at [[Gukovo]] border crossing on 9 August, they reported that there was a stream of multiple groups of people wearing military-style dress crossing the border between Russia and Ukraine, in both directions, some of them clearly identifying themselves as members of DNR militia. They also observed several ambulance evacuations of wounded supporters of the DPR and LPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/om/122613 |title=Weekly update from the OSCE Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk, for the period 6–12 August 2014 |publisher=OSCE |date=14 August 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, a group of Spanish nationals were arrested in [[Madrid]] for fighting in the war in Donbass on the separatist side. Travelling through Moscow, they were met by a "government official" and sent to Donetsk, where they were provided with accommodation, uniforms and weapons, but they fought as volunteers. They stated there are "a few hundreds" of Western volunteers, mostly from [[Serbia]] and [[France]], "half of them communists, half Nazis", fighting jointly for the "liberation of Russia from Ukrainian invasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/27/inenglish/1425051026_915897.html | title=We fought together, communists and Nazis alike, for the liberation of Russia | publisher=El Pais | date=27 February 2015 | accessdate=5 March 2015 | author=Patricia Ortega Dolz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Germany's [[Bild]] reported that minutes from an October 2015 meeting of the "Interministerial Commission for the Provision of Humanitarian Aid for the Affected Areas of the Southeast of the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions" indicated that Russia was running militant-controlled parts of east Ukraine. According to Bild, "It is notable that no members of the self-declared people's republics in eastern Ukraine are on the commission".&lt;ref name=Bild-shadow&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-konflikt/donbass-shadow-government-45102202.bild.html |title= Secret document exposes Putin's shadow government for Donbass |work= [[Bild]] |date= 29 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukrainian response===
Interim Ukrainian President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] accused Russia of "provoking a conflict" by backing the seizure of the Crimean parliament building and other government offices on the Crimean peninsula. He compared Russia's military actions to the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]], when Russian troops occupied parts of the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the breakaway enclaves of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] were established under the control of Russian-backed administrations. He called on Putin to withdraw Russian troops from Crimea and stated that Ukraine will "preserve its territory" and "defend its independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine-abroad/turchynov-russia-waging-war-of-aggression-in-crimea-337972.html|work=Kyiv Post|title=Turchynov: Russia starts aggression in Crimea|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March, he warned, "Military intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10669670/Ukraine-live-Crimea-leader-appeals-to-Putin-to-help-as-Obama-warns-of-costs-to-Moscow.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302002603/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10669670/Ukraine-live-Crimea-leader-appeals-to-Putin-to-help-as-Obama-warns-of-costs-to-Moscow.html|archivedate=2 March 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Ukraine live: Prime Minister of Ukraine says Russian military invasion would lead to war|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014|location=London|first=Barney|last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[OSCE]] Parliamentary Assembly published a statement (the "Baku Declaration") discussing the events in Ukraine in detail. Specifically, it pointed out that Russia is a signatory of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and committed to observing its rules, including respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other member countries, as well as the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]] that specifically guaranteed the integrity of Ukraine's borders. As noted by OSCE, "Russian Federation has, since February 2014, violated every one of the ten Helsinki principles in its relations with Ukraine, some in a clear, gross and thus far uncorrected manner, and is in violation with the commitments it undertook in the Budapest Memorandum, as well as other international obligations". OSCE condemned actions of the Russian Federation, calling them "coercion" and "military aggression" that are "designed to subordinate the rights inherent in Ukraine's sovereignty to the Russian Federation's own interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscepa.org/publications/all-documents/annual-sessions/2014-baku/declaration-2/2540-2014-baku-declaration-eng/file |title=The Baku Declaration |publisher=OSCE |date=2 July 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006111553/http://www.oscepa.org/publications/all-documents/annual-sessions/2014-baku/declaration-2/2540-2014-baku-declaration-eng/file/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 OSCE deputy mission head in Ukraine Alexander Hug summarized the mission's two years of observations stating that "since the beginning of the conflict" the mission has seen "armed people with Russian insignia", vehicle tracks crossing border between Russia and Ukraine as well as talked to prisoners who were declaring themselves Russian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/osce-sees-russian-soldiers-weapons-in-ukraine-for-two-years-410764.html|title=OSCE 'sees Russian soldiers, weapons in Ukraine for two years'|website=www.kyivpost.com|access-date=2016-03-26 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) accepted a resolution that noted "the direct involvement of the Russian Federation in the emergence and worsening of the situation in these parts of Ukraine" and called both sides to fully respect the terms of Minsk Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=5401&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=8 | title=South-east Ukraine: the ceasefire must be respected to ease the humanitarian crisis | publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) | date=26 January 2015 | accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the [[United Nations Human Rights Office]] estimated that 8000 casualties had resulted from the conflict, noting that the violence has been "fuelled by the presence and continuing influx of foreign fighters and sophisticated weapons and ammunition from the Russian Federation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UN News - Close to 8,000 people killed in eastern Ukraine, says UN human rights report|url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51819#.VfB9txUveUk|website = UN News Service Section|accessdate = 9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After pointing out that Russia has increased its military exercise and intelligence gathering activity in the Baltic and Northern areas violating Nordic borders and jeopardizing civilian air traffic, the declaration states the intention of the Nordic countries to face this new situation with solidarity and increased cooperation. The Nordic unity commitment is extended to include solidarity with the Baltic countries and to a collaboration within NATO and EU to strengthen also the unity within these entities and to maintain the cross-Atlantic link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Fem-nordiske-ministre-i-felles-kronikk-Russisk-propaganda-bidrar-til-a-sa-splid-7967230.html |title= Fem nordiske ministre i felles kronikk: Russisk propaganda bidrar til å så splid |first1= Ine Eriksen |last1= Søreide |authorlink1= Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide |first2= Nicolai |last2= Wammen |authorlink2= Nicolai Wammen |first3= Carl |last3= Haglund |authorlink3= Carl Haglund |first4= Gunnar Bragi |last4= Sveinsson |authorlink4= Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson |first5= Peter |last5= Hultqvist |authorlink5= Peter Hultqvist |date= 9 April 2015 |accessdate= 12 April 2015 |newspaper= [[Aftenposten]] |trans-title= Five Nordic ministers in joint feature article: Russian propaganda contributes to sowing discord |language= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2014 survey by the [[Levada Center]] reported that only 13% of those Russians polled would support the Russian government in an open war with Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/05/vladimir-putin-russians-dying-ukraine|title=Putin walks a tightrope as evidence mounts of Russians dying in Ukraine|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 September 2014|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Russian vice-minister of foreign affairs Giorgi Kunadze said that if Western policy toward Russia had been tougher in 2008, during the [[Russo-Georgian War]], "there would be no Crimea nor Lugandon" (the latter was a reference to the [[Lugansk People's Republic|LPR]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://tvrain.ru/teleshow/dzjadko_vechernee_shou/esli_by_reaktsija_zapada_v_2008_godu_byla_bolee_zhestkoj_ne_bylo_by_ni_kryma_ni_lugandona_byvshij_zamglavy_mid_rossii_o_shodstvah_i_razlichijah_sanktsij_v_otnoshenii_rossii_i_irana-390927/|title = "Если бы реакция Запада в 2008 году была более жесткой, не было бы ни Крыма, ни Лугандона".|date = 14 July 2015|accessdate = |language=ru|website = tvrain.ru|publisher = TV Rain }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Putin khuilo!}}

A poll of the Ukrainian public, excluding Russian-annexed [[Crimea]], was taken by the [[International Republican Institute]] from 12–25 September 2014.&lt;ref name="IRI14OCT"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/iri-ukraine-pre-election-poll-shows-strong-opposition-russian-aggressi |title=IRI Ukraine pre-election poll shows strong opposition to Russian aggression, support for Kyiv Government |publisher=International Republican Institute |date=14 October 2014 |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016232411/http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/iri-ukraine-pre-election-poll-shows-strong-opposition-russian-aggressi |archivedate=16 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 89% of those polled opposed 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. As broken down by region, 78% of those polled from [[Eastern Ukraine]] (including [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]) opposed said intervention, along with 89% in [[Southern Ukraine]], 93% in [[Central Ukraine]], and 99% in [[Western Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="IRI14OCT" /&gt; As broken down by native language, 79% of Russian speakers and 95% of Ukrainian speakers opposed the intervention. 80% of those polled said the country should remain a [[Unitary state|unitary]] country.&lt;ref name="IRI14OCT" /&gt;

===International reaction===
In March 2014, Estonia's president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said: "Justification of a military invasion by a fabricated need to protect ethnic "compatriots" resuscitates the arguments used to annex [[Sudetenland]] in 1938."&lt;ref name=Ilves14032f7&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/toomas-hendrik-ilves-the-united-states-and-europe-need-a-new-rulebook-for-russia/2014/03/27/e15dad62-b5bb-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html |title= Toomas Hendrik Ilves: The United States and Europe need a new rulebook for Russia |first= Toomas Hendrik |last= Ilves |authorlink= Toomas Hendrik Ilves |work= The Washington Post |date= 27 March 2014  |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 G-20 Brisbane summit|Group of 20]] (G-20) summit of world leaders in [[Brisbane, Australia]] in November 2014, an incident occurred during private meetings that became quite public. At the private leaders' retreat, held the weekend before the official opening of the summit, [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] told [[Government of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] "I guess I'll shake your hand but I have only one thing to say to you: You need to get out of Ukraine."  The incident occurred as Putin approached Harper and a group of G-20 leaders and extended his hand toward Harper. After the event was over, a "spokesman for the Russian delegation said Putin's response was: 'That's impossible because we are not there'."&lt;ref name=cbcn20141115&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Harper at G20 tells Vladimir Putin to 'get out of Ukraine' : Annual summit dominated by Western anger towards Putin|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/stephen-harper-at-g20-tells-vladimir-putin-to-get-out-of-ukraine-1.2836382|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=CBC News|publisher=cbc.ca|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7452">'''Saul M. Ginsburg''' (Sha'ul Moiseevich Ginsburg, שאול גינזבורג; born Minsk, 1866 – died New York, 16 November 1940) was a Jewish-Belarusian American author, editor, and historian of Russian Jewry.

== Biography ==
Ginsburg was born in [[Minsk]], in the [[Russian Empire]].  He received both a traditional Jewish and a secular education. In 1891 he graduated with a law degree from the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Slutsky"&gt;Slutsky, Yehuda. "Ginsburg, Saul." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Vol. 7. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 612.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;Moss, Kenneth B.  "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Ginsburg_Shaul Ginsburg, Sha'ul]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe'' [online version of print edition 2008]. 7 June 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Ginsburg began writing for the Russian-Jewish periodical [[Voskhod (magazine)|Voskhod]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], where he remained for the next several decades. His contributions to ''Voskhod'' included articles on Russian Jewish history, and a regularly appearing survey of the Hebrew press (under the pseudonym "Ha-Kore"). In 1899 he became a member of the editorial board.&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Together with Pesach Marek, Ginsburg compiled an anthology of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-language folk songs (''Evreiskiia narodnyia piesni v Rossii''), which was published as a supplement to ''Voskhod'' in 1901, and came to be regarded as a landmark work in Jewish folklore.&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt;

In 1903 Ginsburg founded ''[[Der fraynd]]'' (The Friend), the first Yiddish-language newspaper to be published in St. Petersburg, and the first Yiddish daily in the Russian Empire.  With its high literary and orthographic standards, the paper is credited with helping to shape the development of modern Yiddish culture.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Ginsburg withdrew as an editor at ''Der fraynd'' in 1908 and in the following years devoted himself more fully to studies of the political, social, and cultural history of Russian Jewry. In 1913 he published a study of Russian Jews at the time of the [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (''Otechestvennaya voina 1812 goda i russkie yevrei''). He also co-edited the Russian-language journal ''Perezhitoe'' (1908–1913), which specialized in the publication of primary sources for Russian Jewish history.&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

In 1919 Ginsburg became a professor of Jewish history at the newly opened Institute of Higher Jewish Studies&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; in Petrograd – as St. Petersburg was by then known – which offered the first university-level program in Jewish studies in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Beizer, Mikhail. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MK0IAD6p2DoC&amp;pg=PA137 ''The Jews of St. Petersburg: Excursions Through a Noble Past'']. Translated by Michael Sherbourne and edited by Martin Gilbert.  Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1989. 137-139.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to teach there until the institute closed, in 1925, by which time the [[Soviet Union]] had been established (in 1922), and the city had been renamed Leningrad (in 1924).

Ginsburg emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1930, settling at first in Paris. Around 1933 he immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City.&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt;  There he published popular historical essays regularly in the Yiddish-language newspaper [[The Jewish Daily Forward|''Forverts'']] (Jewish Daily Forward).&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt; A three-volume Yiddish-language collection of Ginsburg's historical writings on Russian Jewry (''Historishe verk'') was published in New York in 1937–1938; two additional volumes of collected writings were published posthumously, in 1944 and 1946.&lt;ref name="Slutsky"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Saul Ginsburg was married to Bronislawa Berchine Ginsburg. The couple had one son, Michael Ginsburg,  who, like his parents, emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Saul Ginsburg" [obituary].

{{Marxism|Economics}}

In Marxist theory, '''socialism''' (also called the '''socialist mode of production''') refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of [[Social relations of production|social relations]] that supersede [[capitalism]] in the schema of [[historical materialism]]. The Marxist definition of socialism is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is [[use-value]] and therefore the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity. Marxist [[production for use]] is coordinated through ''conscious'' [[economic planning]], while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of ''[[to each according to his contribution]]''. The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the [[means of production]] and the means of their livelihood, either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and [[Workers' self-management|self-management]], so that the [[Surplus value|social surplus]] accrues to the working class and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialism |title=Socialism |author= |date= |website= Glossary of Terms |publisher=Marxism.org |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is consistent with, and helped to inform, early conceptions of socialism where the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity, and thus monetary relations in the form of [[exchange-value]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[interest]] and [[wage labor]] would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |month= |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=20 |quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories – such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent – and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Marxian conception of socialism stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism, most notably early forms of [[market socialism]] based on [[classical economics]] such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Unlike the Marxian conception, these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange (markets) for labor and the means of production, seeking to perfect the market process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McNally |first=David |title=Against the Market: Political economy, market socialism and the Marxist critique |publisher=Verso |year=1993 |month= |isbn=978-0-86091-606-2 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to [[utopian socialism]].

Although [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote very little on socialism and neglected to provide any details on how it might be organized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gasper |first=Phillip |title=The Communist Manifesto: a road map to history's most important political document |publisher=Haymarket Books |date=October 2005 |isbn=978-1-931859-25-7 |page=23 |quote=Marx and Engels never speculated on the detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The key task for them was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. If and when that movement was successful, it would be up to the members of the new society to decide democratically how it was to be organized, in the concrete historical circumstances in which they found themselves.}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous social scientists and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] have used Marx's theory as a basis for developing their own models of [[Socialist economics|socialist economic systems]]. The Marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the [[socialist calculation debate]].

==Mode of production==
Socialism is a post-[[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] economic system, meaning that production is carried out to directly produce [[Use value|use-value]] (to directly satisfy human needs, or economic demands) as opposed to being produced with a view to generating a profit. The stage in which the accumulation of capital was viable and effective is rendered insufficient at the socialist stage of social and economic development, leading to a situation where production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a supposedly ''planned'' fashion. Although Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels understood ''planning'' to involve the input and decisions of the individuals involved at localized levels of production and consumption, planning has been interpreted to mean [[Planned economy|centralized planning]] by [[Marxist-Leninist]]s during the 20th century. However, there have been other conceptions of economic planning, including [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized-planning]] and [[participatory planning]]. It is important to notice and to not make the mistake that Marx' theory and thinking output has anything to do with what Stalin has made from it. Marx' main manuscript, a postum work is called 'Grundrisse' was published in 1953 (the year Stalin died). In this work, most areas of Marx' thinking output are explored: production, consumption, distribution, social impact of capitalism, communism as the next level after capitalism as a live model for humans emphasizing fair distribution of goods, equality and the optimum environment for humans to live in to develop themselves to their best capabilities (art, politics, philosophy) in order to achieve happiness and to satisfy intrinsic needs (whatever they may be). The goal of Marx was to design a social system which eliminates the differences in classes between the poor (proletarians) and the rich (bourgeoise). By achieving this elimination, the tension and the power differences are gone to force the workers to work under bad conditions with way too low salaries (loans). Capitalism was, according Marx, a system which was guarateed to lead to a secured downfall because big companies will buy small companies leading to monopolism, so there will be a very small population owning all the money (and power) and there will be a huge amount of people having no money and therefore no potential to buy products from the capitalistic production system. For sure a revolution would happen. What Marx' oversaw was that the loanworkers were paid as such that they were and still are able to buy products from the capitalistic production system, in other words, the workers became as essential part to assure the capitalistic system is still alive and dominant in most of world's nations.   

In contrast to capitalism, which relies upon the coercive market forces to compel capitalists to produce use-values as a byproduct of the pursuit of profit, socialist production is to be based on the rational planning of use-values and coordinated investment decisions to attain economic goals.&lt;ref&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. From "The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism" (P.61-63): "More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs...Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology...It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result,  the [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]] that occur in a capitalist market economy will not be present in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labor, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system.

Socialism would make use of incentive-based systems, and inequality would still exist but to a diminishing extent as all members of society would be worker-owners. This eliminates the severity of previous tendencies towards inequality and conflicts arising over ownership of the means of production and property income accruing to a small class of owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html | title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism | author= SCARLETT| date= | website= | publisher=EconomicTheories.org | accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic meritocracy, along the principle of "[[To each according to his contribution|from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Critique of the Gotha Programme'', Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advanced stage of socialism, referred to as "[[Pure communism|upper-stage communism]]" in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', is based on the socialist mode of production but is differentiated from lower-stage socialism in a few fundamental ways. While socialism implies public ownership (by a state apparatus) or cooperative ownership (by a worker cooperative enterprise), communism would be based on [[common ownership]] of the means of production. Class distinctions based on ownership of capital cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A superabundance of goods and services are made possible by automated production that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm ''Karl Marx'' - Critique of the Gotha Programme. 1875] Full Text. Part 1: "In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly -- only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social relations==
The fundamental goal of socialism from the view of Marx and Engels was the realization of human freedom and individual autonomy. Specifically, this refers to freedom from the alienation imposed upon individuals in the form of coercive social relationships as well as material scarcity, whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive (to reproduce his or herself). The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom, and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the [[surplus product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch06.htm | title=Marx's Concept Of Socialism | author= Erich Fromm| year= 1961| website=Marx's Concept of Man | publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing | accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a set of social relationships, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the associated producers, so that the surplus product produced by socialized assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of labor power would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social division of labor (which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labor which would still exist in socialism).&lt;ref&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. From "Definitions of market and socialism" (pp. 58–59): "For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process...The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else."&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment, so that an individual laborers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder.

===Role of the state===
In Marxist theory, the state is "the institution of organised violence which is used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#state | title=State | author= | date= | website= Marxism.org Glossary of Terms| publisher=Marxism.org | accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state is thus seen as a mechanism that is dominated by the interests of the ruling class and utilized to subjugate other classes in order to protect and legitimize the existing economic system.

After a workers' revolution, the state would initially become the instrument of the working class. Conquest of the state apparatus by the working class must take place to establish a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes as class distinctions (based on ownership of the means of production) gradually deteriorate due to the concentration of means of production in state hands. From the point where all means of production become state property, the nature and primary function of the state would change from one of political rule (via coercion) over men by the creation and enforcement of laws into a scientific administration of things and a direction of processes of production; that is the state would become a coordinating economic entity rather than a mechanism of class or political control, and would no longer be a state in the Marxian sense.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', on Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm: "In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]''' was initiated by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and completed by his grandson and successor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in a series of military campaigns lasting from 1512 to 1524. The war ended in 1528, confined by then to [[Lower Navarre]], north of the Pyrenees. Ferdinand was both the king of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and regent of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in 1512. When [[Pope Julius II]] declared a Holy League against France in late 1511, Navarre attempted to remain neutral. Ferdinand used this as an excuse to attack Navarre, conquering it while its potential protector, [[France]], was beset by [[England]], [[Venice]], and Ferdinand's own Italian armies.

Several attempts were made to reconquer Iberian Navarre immediately following the Castilian invasion. There was a half-hearted attempt in 1516 and a full-fledged Franco-Navarrese campaign in 1521. All attempts were defeated by the Spanish and clashes came to a halt to the north of the [[Pyrenees]] in 1528, when Spanish troops withdrew from Lower Navarre. The [[Treaty of Cambrai]] between Spain and France in 1529 sealed the division of Navarre along the Pyrenees; the [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|independent Kingdom of Navarre]] survived in Lower Navarre, ruled by the House of Albrets and united with their principality of Béarn It maintained close links with France. The kingdom was absorbed into France in 1620 (nominally in 1790).

==Background==
{{see also|Kingdom of Navarre}}
Navarre was mired in instability over the throne since the mid-15th century. At the same time, the Navarre nobility split into two warring factions in the [[War of the Bands]]: the [[Beaumont party (Navarre)|Beaumonts]]; and the Agramonts. This caused ramifications both within and out of Navarre and made it susceptible to external meddling.

When Queen [[Catherine of Navarre]] married [[John III of Albret]], many in Navarre contested this arrangement. Starting in 1474 the King of Castile, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], instituted a combination of alliances and military efforts aimed at securing the control of neighbouring kingdoms. This included attempting to turn Navarre into a ''de facto'' protectorate of Castile in 1476. However, during the following decade the Aragonese king and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] focused their military efforts on subduing [the [Emirate of Granada]] during [[Granada War|a 10-year war]]. This ended in 1492 with Castile annexing the emirate and putting an end to the [[Reconquista]]. After the fall of Granada, pressure on Navarre intensified.

After Isabella's death in 1504, Ferdinand unexpectedly married the French princess [[Germaine of Foix]], daughter of a claimant to the throne of Navarre [[John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne]]. Any children from Ferdinand's marriage would have a claim on the crown of Navarre. Ferdinand also wanted to spite his son-in-law and successor [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]], the new King of Castile. As of 1507, with Ferdinand again administering the politics of Castile as a regent, the defiant count of [[Lerín]] Louis Beaumont, Ferdinand's key ally in Navarre, revolted along with other lords. However, the royal authority—Catherine and John III—warned Ferdinand that this time no demands from the count would be accepted and no pardon would be granted to the Count of Lerín. It was in 1507, during the fight for [[Viana, Spain|Viana]], that the ''condottiero'' [[Cesare Borgia]], then in the service of John, was killed by Beaumont knights. In 1508, after a year-long stand-off, the crown launched an offensive to quell the Count's rebellion. Lerín was occupied, and a severe defeat inflicted on Louis.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

Relations between Ferdinand and King Louis XII improved after the former's marriage to Germaine of Foix. The French king put pressure on the Albrets to give up on their principalities outside Navarre—Béarn, [[Bigorre]], [[County of Foix]], etc.—but was met with their strong refusal. In 1507 the Parliament of Navarre appointed a diplomatic task force to France led by John of Jaso—president of the Royal Council of Navarre and father of [[Francis Xavier]]—and the bishop of Lescar. The effort was weak, as were other diplomatic approaches.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|21}} Louis XII coveted the Albrets' territories and resorted to the Parliament of Toulouse, which issued a confiscation decree. When the Parliament of Navarre (''The Three States'') and the States-General of Béarn were confronted with the possibility of a French takeover in 1510, a military mobilization was decreed and a bill passed to create a Béarn-Navarre confederation and a permanent joint defense provision against external assault. Ferdinand II again searched for allies among the Navarrese Beaumont party.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"&gt;Monreal, G./Jimeno, R.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21, 87}}

In summer 1510 the international scene took a sharp turn in the Italian Wars. [[Pope Julius II]] was one of the most ambitious Popes of the era. He had declared a Holy League against Venice in 1508, and defeated it. Then the formerly allied [[Papal States]] and [[Early Modern France|France]] went to war with one another. Julius II declared a new Holy League against France on 4{{nbs}}August 1511 after siding with King Ferdinand in the French-Spanish struggle for power in Italy. Navarre refused to join and declared neutrality. Ferdinand II declared war on France in March 1512. A month later, [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston of Foix]] died, meaning that Ferdinand's wife Germaine of Foix was able to claim the Pyrenean territories of the Albrets.

King Louis became more conciliatory with Queen Catherine and King John III, backing down on his territorial demands. Catherine and John III negotiated with Ferdinand too, who intertwined proposals and menaces with the movement of troops to the borders of Navarre.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|23}} In February 1512, Ferdinand allied with England in a move leading to military intervention in the [[Crown lands of France|French royal territory]] of [[Guyenne]], present-day region Aquitaine.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|18}} The Navarrese authorities made arrangements for the defense, while Ferdinand designed a plan to invade the kingdom This included a propaganda scheme in which the Navarrese crown would be labeled as schismatic with the support of a papal bull from Pope Julius.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|23}} To obtain papal agreement to this, Castilian diplomats negotiated with Rome for months.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Invasion of Navarre===

In June 1512, tension mounted when the Holy League made a formal petition to send English and Castilian troops through Navarre to France. At the same time a Navarrese diplomatic mission sent to France was holding talks with Louis XII lasting a month, while Ferdinand threatened to cross the border if an agreement was reached. The talks led to the Fourth [[Treaty of Blois]] on 18{{nbs}}July 1512, providing for mutual assistance to keep Navarre's neutrality. It also brought attention to the English threat to France after their disembarkation in [[Hondarribia]], Gipuzkoa in Basque territory [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] to Castile.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|23, 88–91}} The next day Ferdinand sent his troops across the border from Álava into Navarre, commanded by General [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], who had been involved in the conquest of Granada. By that time a Gipuzkoan militia had broken into Navarre from the north-west and captured [[Goizueta, Navarre|Goizueta]], a village and fortress bordering on [[Gipuzkoa]] on 10{{nbs}}July.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

In a few days Castilian troops advanced without resistance to the outskirts of Pamplona, where Ferdinand's ally Count John of Beaumont played host to the invading troops in his fortified palace of Arazuri. The assault troops of the expedition numbered 6,000 veterans, but the whole caravan including the rearguard amounted to 15,000. The population of Pamplona was less than 10,000. Catherine and John III left for Tudela hoping to raise troops among loyal lords, but managed to recruit only 500.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Overwhelmed by the sheer size of the Spanish expedition, the loyalists veered east to [[Lumbier|Lumbier (Irunberri)]], and on to [[Lower Navarre]]. Catherine, John III and their troops retreated to [[Orthez]], Béarn.

Pamplona's outer walls were flimsy, and the threat of [[looting|a sack]] pronounced by the Duke of Alba loomed over the town. In view of the royal family's retreat to Lumbier, the local authorities surrendered on 25{{nbs}}July. Without delay, messengers were sent out by the Castilians to the main fortresses across Navarre demanding that they follow suit. Most of them submitted, except for [[Amaiur]] ([[Baztan, Navarre|Baztan]]), [[Estella-Lizarra]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]].&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|21–22}} The authorities of Pamplona were required to vow loyalty to Ferdinand, but they alleged that they could not as they had pledged allegiance to [[John III of Navarre|John III]], their natural lord, and he was alive. In late August 1512 Ferdinand claimed that he was King of Navarre in law:''de jure propio''.

Tudela in turn was besieged, and resisted the Aragonese assault led by Alfonso of Aragon, a bastard son of Ferdinand II and archbishop of Zaragoza, who was commanding 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The determined loyalty of the local authorities to the Navarrese crown could not hide their low morale on account of the Pope's bull and the hopelessness of their resistance, as set down on letters to the King by the defenders. The town surrendered by 9{{nbs}}September 1512 in order to avoid being sacked, further confiscations, and futile bloodshed. Alfonso took an oath to respect the Navarrese laws, following his father Ferdinand's instructions.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

By late August 1512, virtually all [[Navarre|Iberian Navarre]] was under Spanish rule. The Duke of Alba, commanding a force of 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry supported by a further 400 artillerymen, occupied the Pyrenean valleys of [[Aezkoa]], Salazar, and Roncal. They crossed the Pyrenean passes northbound, taking the Chapel of Roncevaux by surprise, and setting fire to the village. The Castilian forces spearheaded by Colonel Villalba (or the Beaumont party lord Martin of Ursua, depending on sources) arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on 10{{nbs}}September, only to find that its garrison under the lord of Miossens (an Albret) was abandoning the stronghold.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|43}} The Castilian forces set about pillaging, burning and terrorising the villages of Lower Navarre, a tactic the Castilian commander tried to justify in his letters. The Church appears to have approved of the enslavement of the Navarrese population.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

The Castilians demanded the submission of all the lords in Lower Navarre (''Ultrapuertos, Deça-Ports''), while the Duke of Alba ordered the pulling down of all the [[tower house]]s in the territory. The orchards in the Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Donibane Garazi in Basque) area were cut down, leaving the local population struggling for subsistence.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|44}} At this point, Ferdinand demanded a capitulation of Catherine and John III, but offered to negotiate their hold on the throne on condition that they sent their heir apparent Henry to be raised in the court of Castile. The demand was met with a flat refusal.

Meanwhile, a French army was stationed in [[Bayonne]] ([[Labourd]], in [[Guyenne]]) guarding against possible English or Castilian moves. Ferdinand still planned to invade Guyenne, home to both Albrets' possessions and French royal lands, or at least [[Bayonne]], a strategic port for Navarre. However, time was running out for the Castilians in Lower Navarre, short of food, supplies and under adverse weather conditions. 1,000 discontented veteran troops in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port mutinied. The Duke of Alba negotiated their removal to the less hostile area of Burgui and Salazar, breaking up the uprising.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|47–48}}

===Navarrese counterattack===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Gipuzkoa (1466-1979).svg|thumb|right|The images of the cannons and king were removed from the coat of arms of Gipuzkoa (1979) as a gesture of friendship with Navarre]]	
[[File:Coat of Arms of Ferdinand II of Aragon (1513-1516).svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King Ferdinand II of Aragon as of 1513, with Navarre added]]
By mid-October, John III had raised an army of 15,000 Navarrese, [[Gascony#History|Gascons]] and [[landsknecht]]s ready to counterattack. Three columns advanced into Gipuzkoa and the heartland of Navarre. The first laid siege to Hondarribia and [[Donostia]], and occupied a number of small towns of the area. This was to divert the attention of any Castilian relief attempt for the besieged troops in Pamplona. By then, tired of Ferdinand II's unreliability, the English had decided to leave the theatre of war, after sacking a number of villages and towns ([[Errenteria]]).&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|48}} The second column, commanded by the [[Duke of Longueville]], was made up of 8,000 Gascons, 1,000 Navarrese, 1,500 landsknechts, and corresponding artillery. It set off from [[Peyrehorade]], engaged the Castilians in [[Ainhice-Mongelos|Ainhize]], and defeated them on 19{{nbs}}October.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

The third column crossed the Pyrenees from [[Roncal – Erronkari|Roncal]] (Erronkari) and reached Burgui. Fearful of having his communications with Pamplona cut, the Duke of Alba withdrew to the capital, leaving a well equipped garrison in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. The Navarrese column advanced from Salazar towards Pamplona. On hearing the news of the Navarrese army's approach, [[Estella-Lizarra]] and the fortress of Monjardin next to it revolted against the occupiers.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|38}} On 24{{nbs}}October 1512, the Duke of Alba reached Pamplona, followed by Navarrese loyalist forces, who laid siege to the capital.

In Estella-Lizarra, the rebels led by John Ramirez de Baquedano and Jaime Velaz de Medrano were soon opposed by the forces of Pedro de Beaumont, supported by the Castilians the Duke of Nájera and the [[Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Arellano, marqués de Comares|Marquis of Comares]]. The Navarrese leaders made a last stand at the Monjardin fortress, but eventually a [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] was signed.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|39}} The investment of Pamplona lasted for a month, but the coming of winter and the arrival of reinforcements from Castile thwarted any prospects of a successful conclusion to the operation. The loyalists retreated and the Castilian troops made their way back across the Pyrenees to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and Lower Navarre, engaging in regular skirmishes with the disgruntled Beaumont party Lord of [[Luxe-Sumberraute|Luxe]].

On 7{{nbs}}December 1512, a detachment of the Navarrese army's decimated landsknechts who were escorting twelve artillery pieces when they encountered a patrol led by the governor of Gipuzkoa Juan de Silva at the [[Ultzama|Belate]] pass. The Gipuzkoan militia took on the landsknechts, who retreated in disarray, and were pursued and largely slaughtered. The skirmish was later exaggerated to a wholesale battle, with the cannons seized being added in 1513 to the official coat of arms of [[Gipuzkoa]].&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

===Spanish reoccupation and aftermath===
As of December 1512, the clashes were confined to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and its hinterland, still occupied by the Castilians. Between 13 and 23{{nbs}}March 1513 the Parliament of Navarre, reduced to the Beaumount party representatives who had sided with the Castilian conquest, was called and accepted Ferdinand as their "natural lord and king." Ferdinand in turn agreed to keep Navarrese institutions and identity. At the same time, the first Castilian viceroy, [[Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Arellano, marqués de Comares|Diego Fernández de Córdoba]], took an oath to respect Navarrese law, known as the ''[[Fueros#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|fueros]]''.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|36}}

Initially the kingdom was attached to Ferdinand—and therefore to the Crown of Aragon—as an ''earned good'', falling back on the Papal bulls. [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] was a Pyrenean realm with a similar confederate institutional make-up, as opposed to the authoritarian [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Castillian pressure resulted in the bequeathing of Navarre to Castilian Queen Isabella's daughter, [[Joanna of Castile]], and annexing the [[History of the Basque people#Modern Period|Basque]] kingdom to Castile in 1515.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|35–41}} The annexation was confirmed after Ferdinand took an oath to respect Navarre's laws and institutions, the ''pactum subjectionis''. On 11{{nbs}}June 1515 the ''Cortes'' of [[Burgos]] met. It was not attended by any Navarrese representatives. Even the Navarrese count of Lerin Louis of Beaumont, Ferdinand II's accomplice up to that point, protested at this annexation to Castile, and was incarcerated.

Castile and Navarre had different institutional and legal systems, and dissimilar social and ethnic make-ups. Once the Castilian and Aragonese military confirmed their occupation of all the strongholds, the ground was paved for a progressive institutional takeover marked by the centralizing drive of the Spanish-Castilian Crown. This was the source of frequent frictions and tensions. The diplomat and writer [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] anticipated a prompt and easy understanding by Ferdinand II with France "on the only condition of keeping Navarre, giving up instead the Duchy of Milan for its vicinity to the Helvetians."&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

==Construction of the case for the conquest==
[[File:Julius II anomyous portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Julius II, died in the wake of his ''Pastor Ille Caelestis'' bull, written at the Chancery of Aragon in Rome]]
[[File:Retrato de Antonio de Nebrija.jpg|thumb|right|Antonio de Nebrija, an able scholar at the service of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile]]
Ferdinand wished to present his military intervention as legally justified. He commissioned a report by the legal specialists [[Antonio de Nebrija]] and Juan López de Palacios Rubios in order to make the case for his actions with a wide range of claims over the Basque kingdom.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|26}} During the following decades and centuries these reports were to become a reference point for debates on the morality of the Spanish conquest. Both scholars were acting as servants of their masters King Ferdinand II and the [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] when they accepted these propaganda assignments, as pointed out by the historian Alfredo Floristan.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|49}} López de Palacios would later develop the doctrine legitimizing the Spanish conquest of the [[Spanish West Indies|West Indies]].

In late August 1512, once the conquest of the heartland of Navarre was completed, Ferdinand issued a statement defending his right to attack Navarre according to the ''iure belli'' or "fair war" doctrine passed by the Roman Church in 1511.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|27}} With Pamplona on his hands and the royal family in [[Béarn]], Ferdinand further justified his claim on the Crown of Navarre by ''de iure propio'', entitlement in his own right.

Another claim involved a so-called "right of way" across Navarre in order to achieve military goals in [[Guyenne]], supported by Ferdinand's [[divine right of kings|divine right as a king]]. Ferdinand also claimed that he was "observing international treaties" by invading Navarre in order to help his ally England.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|28}} An additional claim was that the Navarrese lineage starting with [[Iñigo Arista]] (824–851) was an usurpation of the rightful Castilian claimant, the alleged heir to the Visigothic kingdom via the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], the Visigoths being the holders of Roman [[Emperor Honorius]]' mandate for Hispania.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|28}} Lastly, Ferdinand advanced a number of claims to the Navarrese throne related to his marriage to Germaine of Foix, and to his, father John II of Aragon.

Ferdinand was informed by spies of the progress of the negotiations between Navarrese diplomats and Louis XII at Blois. On the eve of the invasion, 17{{nbs}}July 1512, Ferdinand had a forged draft copy of the Treaty of Blois, signed on 18{{nbs}}July, circulated. This aimed to smear both parties.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|19}} The Papal ruling ''Pastor Ille Caelestis'' issued on 21{{nbs}}July, just three days after the start of the invasion, authorized Ferdinand to wage war on Church enemies and to claim their lands and subjects providing they lie outside Italy, which would apply to [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]]'s France and the "heretic" crown of Navarre. This provision was added at the instigation of Ferdinand in December 1511.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

On 5{{nbs}}June 1512, Ferdinand had addressed a letter to the Pope Julius II urging him to issue a bull excommunicating "everyone in the kingdom of Navarre and the principality of Béarn" and allocating him Navarre, or failing that, the right to take it over, and appealing to the Pope's own interests in Spain. "You just need a scroll and ink" he added).&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"&gt;Urzainqui, T./Esarte, P./Et al.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} On 7{{nbs}}June 1512 Ferdinand addressed another letter to his ambassador in Rome urging him to secure the bulls as soon as possible, for "our army is up and the artillery ready" to invade Navarre.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

However, the Navarrese crown was not cited explicitly in the ''Pastor Ille Caelestis'' bull. Echoing Ferdinand's claim in late August 2012, the ''Exigit Contumatium'' [[Papal bull]] was issued half a year later, on 18{{nbs}}February 1513. Catherine and John III were labelled as schismatic and therefore unworthy holders of the royal title, excommunicating them and confiscating their properties.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|24}} The members of the Parliament of Navarre attending the session held in Pamplona on 13–24{{nbs}}March 1513 accepted Ferdinand II as king.

Despite the papal support to his actions, Ferdinand—and his successors— was haunted by allegations of tyranny and usurpation, and these concerns were to leave an imprint in the status of Navarre after the invasion. Ferdinand arranged to present the invasion as a mere dynastic change, attempting to conceal the fact of the military takeover. Despite Navarre being considered an "earned good" for the free disposition of Ferdinand, the ''pactum subjections'' was applied—taking an oath to respect the Navarrese law and identity. Navarre was no Granada, which was considered not only a legitimate conquest by Roman Catholic standards but a "reconquest" of the Visigoth Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|48}} On the other side, Navarre was widely held to be an old Christian kingdom, with secular institutions and an entrenched identification of its population with the native social order.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|34}} ''Prior tempore, potior iure'', or "earlier in time, stronger in law": the kingdom was stronger than the crown itself.

==1516 reconquest attempt==
[[File:castillo javier.jpg|thumb|The Castle of Xavier, home to John of Jaso, was partially demolished on orders of Cardinal Cisneros]]
[[File:Ujué.jpg|thumb|[[Ujué|Uxue]] (central Navarre), featuring a fortification spared thanks to an attached religious site]]
By 1516 Ferdinand was dead and his sixteen-year-old grandson by Isabella, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]], had ascended to the throne of both Castile and Aragon. However, in 1516 he still lived in the Burgundian Netherlands. John III of Navarre saw an opportunity to reconquer Iberian Navarre. He raised an army in [[Sauveterre-de-Bearn]] made up of two columns, one commanded by himself and the other by [[Pedro, Marshal of Navarre]].&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|49}} This small army aimed at reaching [[Sanguesa]] and [[Lumbier]], and there inciting an uprising against the Castilians.

The first column led by John III failed to overcome the Castilian garrison occupying [[St-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], while the second was no more successful. Pedro advanced towards Roncevaux on 12{{nbs}}March 1516, but Cardinal Cisneros had been informed of the Navarrese intentions and had Colonel Villalba waiting him at Roncevaux. Pedro in turn decided to avoid Roncevaux by way of Salazar and Roncal, but weather and the little sympathy shown by the local population (except for Roncal) eroded the 600-strong column.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|60}} The column was engaged in battle and defeated by Colonel Villalba near Isaba, in the valley of Roncal, and the survivors taken prisoner. Pedro was assassinated years later while in custody at [[Simancas]], although it was presented as a suicide.

Among the captured were several lords, including Valentin of Jaso, cousin of [[Francis Xavier]]. The prisoners were taken to [[Atienza]] and held in chains with restricted communications. Extreme security measures were taken and no Navarrese were allowed into the town, with any resident hosting a Navarrese or not reporting their presence being subject to a 1,000 [[maravedi]] fine and two years imprisonment. The surviving 7 Navarrese Agramont lords were eventually released on acceptance of their submission, but they all joined the 1521 French-Navarrese expedition commanded by General Asparros.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|62}}

The reconquest attempt failed, and on 14{{nbs}}August 1516 the [[Treaty of Noyon]] was signed between Francis I of France and Charles V, in which Charles agreed in the context of a wider agreement to reconsider his rights over the Kingdom of Navarre and listen to Queen Catherine's envoys.&lt;ref&gt;The king of France and the emperor are referred in the treaty as "The Catholic", i.e. Charles V, and "The Most Christian", namely Francis I; see Monreal, G./Jimeno, R. page 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franco-Spanish tensions mounted again, Catherine died in early 1517 and the provisions on Navarre set out in the treaty were never enforced.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Talks continued between Navarrese diplomats and Charles V to reach an agreement over a marriage between Charles' sister Eleonor and the new king of Navarre, Henry II. The Parliament of Navarre in Pamplona, attended only by Beaumont party members, demanded the reattachment to Higher Navarre of [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|"Coastal Navarre"]],&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|26}} the Basque districts better known as Biscay until the early 19th century.

The Spanish cardinal [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cisneros]] was acting as regent for the newly proclaimed emperor Charles. As such, in 1517 he decreed that all Navarrese castles be pulled down to prevent future resistance.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Prominent Navarre figures who had stood up for the Navarrese monarchs were imprisoned in Atienza or forced into exile. The repression was aimed, in Cardinal Cisneros' words, at further "subjugating and constraining [Navarre], so that no one in that kingdom dares or ventures to rebel".&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|66}}

Mimicking the 1502 royal decision in Castile—the details of the decision are not well known—the Spanish imperial authorities decreed the forced conversion or the expulsion of the Navarrese [[Muslim]]s living in and around Tudela, probably on 1{{nbs}}May 1516. However, by 1516 many of them had emigrated following exactions imposed for decades. Muslims emigrated from Navarre until 1520, with many of them settling in Aragon, where they found temporary shelter until their 1526 expulsion.&lt;ref name="MuslimNav"&gt;Usunariz, J.M.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

The institutional framework of Navarre was preserved following the 1512 invasion. Once Ferdinand II of Aragon died in January, the Parliament of Navarre gathered in Pamplona, urging Charles V, aged 16, to attend a coronation ceremony in the town following tradition. The Parliament's envoys were met with the Emperor's utter indifference, if not contempt. He refused to attend any ceremony and stated "let us say that I am happy and [the proclamation proposal] pleases me". Eventually the Parliament met in 1517 without Charles V, who was represented by the Duke of Najera. He pronounced an array of promises, while Parliament kept submitting grievances and demands for damages to the Emperor, a total of sixty-seven. The second [[List of viceroys of Navarre|viceroy]] of Navarre, Fadrique de Acuña, was deposed in 1515; probably for passing on the grievances.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Contradictions in the documents relating to the Emperor's purported oath pledge in 1516 point to a contemporary manipulation of the records.

In 1520 and 1521, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] was distracted by the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]].  The [[Crown of Aragon]] was also suffering economic difficulties as a consequence of the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]]. As a result, Spain was seen as a target of opportunity by the King [[Francis I of France]]. Meanwhile, the young King [[Henry II of Navarre]], based in Béarn, saw a way to reconquer Navarre.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"&gt;Bustillo Kastrexana, J.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} Taking advantage of the synergies with France, Henry began raising a 12,000-strong army, mainly [[Gascony|Gascons]] and Navarrese exiles. This Franco-Navarrese army was commanded by [[André de Foix|General Asparros]] (or Esparre). It consisted of 12,000 infantry, 800 mounted knights, and 29 pieces of artillery.

The Castilian [[Viceroy of Navarre]], [[Antonio Manrique de Lara, 2nd Duke of Nájera]], was caught off-guard. The Duke was responsible for guarding the Navarrese lands conquered in 1512, but he had moved the bulk of his troops away from Navarre to suppress the Revolt of the Comuneros in his home territory of Castile. Rumors of a "French" invasion had been widespread, with former comunero noble [[Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Count of Ureña|Pedro Girón]] warning of the impending invasion in April 1521.&lt;ref name="per350"&gt;Pérez, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angry at the Castilian takeover of the ecclesiastic, administrative and judicial institutions in Navarre, the Navarrese rose up in support of Henry II on hearing the news of Henry II's expedition. Volunteer bands were created in many places to expel the Castilians.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|81–82}} As the Franco-Navarrese army approached Pamplona, the citizens revolted and besieged the Castilian military governor, [[Ignatius Loyola|Ignatius of Loyola]], in his newly built castle. The garrison surrendered after a few days of resistance in late May 1521 in the [[Battle of Pampeluna|Battle of Pampeluna (Pamplona)]]. In less than three weeks, all of Navarre was reconquered.&lt;ref name="per350"/&gt;{{rp|352}}

Still, not all was settled. The absence of Henry II was disquieting to the population. Additionally, the troops led by General Asparros indulged in looting on arrival at Viana, leaving many angry and disappointed with an expedition that was meant to liberate them. The Franco-Navarrese army then moved out of friendly territory and into Castile, crossing the [[Ebro River|Ebro]] and besieging the town of [[Logroño]], where the count of Lerin was stationed with a 4,000-strong force.&lt;ref name="per350"/&gt;{{rp|353}}

Unfortunately for the King of Navarre and the French, the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] had been crushed at the [[Battle of Villalar]] in April. Not only was the Castilian government able to send its soldiers back to Navarre, but a large number of Castilian nobles who had supported the comuneros or vacillated between sides were now presented with an opportunity to prove their loyalty to Castile. Many formerly rebel-held towns sent soldiers to Navarre as well. Backed by a suddenly reunified Castile, an army of 30,000 men approached Navarre.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|68}} On June 11, Asparros abandoned his siege of Logroño and retreated back to Tiebas, in Navarre.  Asparros desperately requested reinforcements from [[Béarn]], but Henry II refused the request, presumably not wanting to risk them in a battle that was likely already lost.&lt;ref name="per350"/&gt;{{rp|353}}

The Franco-Navarrese were completely defeated at the [[Battle of Esquiroz|Battle of Esquiroz (Noáin)]] near Pamplona, on 30{{nbs}}June 1521. The French-Navarrese force did not have sufficient artillery to defend themselves, and were outnumbered by more than two-to-one. French and Navarrese losses numbered more than 6,000 dead, and General Asparros was captured,&lt;ref name="per350"/&gt;{{rp|353}} and released in return for a ransom of 10,500 [[ducat]]s, and the surrender of Pamplona. The Castilian fatalities numbered between 50 and 300. The victory was followed by an occupation in which the Navarrese were subject to abuse, pillaging, marginalization and exile.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|85}} This situation bred despair among many Navarrese, with many lords opting to switch sides to the victorious Castilians.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|85}} The Castilians did not relent, and continued to send reinforcements to the area as [[Italian War of 1521–1526|Charles V and France went to war]] across Europe.

With the defeat at Noain still fresh in their memories, Kings Henry II of Navarre and Francis I of France allied again to strike back. This time on the northern fringes of Navarre—probably expecting the Spanish to be worn out militarily and financially by their relentless war activity. In late September 1521, the Franco-Navarrese divided in two columns and advanced towards the [[Bidasoa]]. The first column, made up of Agramont-party Navarrese, Normans and Gascons, was based in [[Labourd]] (in [[Crown lands of France|French royal territory]]), while the second, formed by German, Gascon and Norman infantry, set off from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port—then in the hands of troops loyal to Henry II. A total of 27,000 combatants under the command of [[Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet]].&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|95}} Most of the troops were raised in the Norman and Pyrénées-based possessions of the Foix-Albret. After taking over Roncal, the second column headed west along the Pyrénées range, and captured Roncevaux.

The Franco-Navarrese force approached the fortress of [[Amaiur]] ([[Baztan (valley)|Baztan]], Navarre), laying siege to the fortress the Castilians had just reinforced. On 3{{nbs}}October 1521 the Castilians capitulated in exchange for free passage to Castile.The troops of Guillaume Gouffier then headed to Labourd and on to [[Irun|Behobia]], capturing the fortress of Urantzu and moving on to invest the coastal stronghold of [[Hondarribia]] (Fuenterrabía, Fontarabie) at the tip of [[Gipuzkoa]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. This stronghold was captured on 12{{nbs}}October 1521 (other sources state 6{{nbs}}October).&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|96}}&lt;ref name="per350"/&gt;{{rp|354}} The Franco-Navarrese held sway over an area extending from Belate to the mouth of the Bidasoa river.

In May 1522, with Charles V in Pamplona, the Spanish forces started to gather the funds and troops necessary to respond. In July 1522, with Navarrese Amaiur about to fall, the Emperor disembarked in [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] with 4,000 [[landsknecht]]s. Many Basques from [[Biscay]] proper, [[Gipuzkoa]], Álava, and even Navarre joined Charles V's forces, as did a number of Aragonese. Ahead of the Castilian expedition to the Bidasoa, a combination of Gipuzkoan militias supported by 1,000 landsknecht engaged the Franco-Navarrese at the fortress of Urantzu in the celebrated [[Battle of San Marcial]]. The pro-Imperial forces took the position on 30{{nbs}}June 1522.

While Charles V made military arrangements, he also issued a decree pardoning many of the banished and exiled [[Agramont]] party members loyal to Henry II. Charles V seems to have followed Ferdinand II's tactics, the partial pardon was intertwined with repression, such as a new order to pull down remaining Agramont and other Navarrese fortresses, besides putting Agramont leaders loyal to King Henry II to trial on [[lèse-majesté]] charges.

On 4{{nbs}}July 1522, a 7,000-strong Castilian expedition left from Pamplona, and by 15{{nbs}}July Amaiur was invested. The fortress was defended by 200 Navarrese knights loyal commanded by Jaime Velaz de Medrano, the 1512 rebel of Estella-Lizarra. However, no relief force arrived and it ultimately fell to the Count of Miranda on 19{{nbs}}July 1522.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|97}} A commemorative monolith now stands on the site of the fortress. After the capitulation of Amaiur, orders were issued by the Venetian-born Castilian bishop of Pamplona, John de Rena, to level the fortress and pull down a number houses owned by Agramont sympathisers, as well as setting fire to the Abbey of Urdazubi.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|97}}

The 39 surviving Navarrese lords of Amaiur were taken to Pamplona and held captive in the Saint Nicolas fortress. Besides Jaime Velez de Medrano, they included Miguel de Jaso, lord of Xavier, and Francis Xavier's oldest brother. They were imprisoned in Pamplona, and Jaime and his son were poisoned. Miguel managed to escape dressed in woman garments; he joined his brother John de Jaso and the 3,000 strong garrison of Hondarribia—1,000 Navarrese and 2,000 French. The garrison included [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Claude of Lorraine]] as one of its commanders.

At the peak of Francis' and Henry II's campaign, the Navarrese king made a symbolic gesture: he called the Parliament of Navarre in [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]] (Donapaleu), took an oath to respect the Navarrese laws (''fueros''), and reorganized the Navarrese administration according to actual territorial control. Charles V felt his authority in Navarre was being defied, and designed a plan to subdue Henry II and Francis, and finally suppress Navarrese resistance. His ambitious plan aimed at invading Lower Navarre, [[Toulouse]], [[Bayonne]], and Hondarribia after Amaiur was captured.&lt;ref name="Guiadelarec"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

The Viceroy of Aragon advanced to [[Oloron]] in Béarn and laid siege to the town, while the army of the Prince of Orange [[Philibert of Chalon]] failed to take [[Bayonne]]. Frustrated at his failure, on his withdrawal south Philibert devastated [[Ustaritz]], and sacked Biarritz and [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] (Donibane Lohizune). Other towns and villages inland straddling the Navarre-Béarn border were also devastated. Eventually, the Imperial forces focused all their strength on capturing Hondarribia. On 15{{nbs}}December 1523, Charles V issued a new pardon, this time including most of the Navarrese Agramont leaders, except for 152 prominent figures, some of them still fighting in Hondarribia.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

The Battle of Fuenterrabía (Hondarribia) would last until April 1524. On 29{{nbs}}February 1524, the Navarrese forces commanded by Pedro de Navarra, son of the assassinated Navarrese marshall, capitulated to Iñigo Fernandez de Velasco, his own uncle. They were promised a restitution of their properties, but only after vowing loyalty to Charles V. Ultimately, some of the defenders of the position were given positions in Charles V court—but far from Navarre—and their properties were partially or fully restored, but not without problems. With this surrender, Navarrese resistance to the Spanish-Castilian occupation was dealt its final blow.

Localized military clashes were now confined to the southern fringes of [[Lower Navarre]] (Nafarroa Beherea in Basque, see map). In 1525, a Spanish attack captured St-Jean-Pied-de-Port again, it was held by the Spanish for almost two years, but in 1527 the lord of [[Luxe-Sumberraute|Luxe (Lukuze)]] and Esteban de Albret, lord of Miossens, recaptured the position. Except for a Spanish outpost in [[Luzaide/Valcarlos]] the region was abandoned in 1528 due to [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]]'s loss of interest and the difficulties of defending it. France's loss of the wider war, with King Francis' and Henry II's capture at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in February 1525, sealed the division of Navarre. While Henry II managed to escape from prison, the Treaty of Madrid on 1{{nbs}}January 1526 and the Treaty of Cambray in 1529 confirmed Spanish control over the Iberian part of Navarre—Francis I committed to denying assistance to Henry II.

==Aftermath and consequences==
[[File:Bernard van Orley (1487-1541) Karel V - Koninklijk klooster van Brou 25-10-2016 10-06-36.jpg|thumb|Young Charles V inherited the hot issue of Navarre]] 
[[File:La porte Notre Dame.jpg|thumb|Main entrance and bridge to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port]]
The successive pardons decreed by Charles V were intended to help integrate Navarre into [[Habsburg Spain]]. A series of pardons to clergy who had sided with the legitimate monarchs were also decreed, with the first just after the 1512 invasion. However, distrust to the loyalty of the Navarrese was maintained throughout the 16th century while [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|independent Navarre]] existed to the north of the Pyrénées, prior to its absorption into France in 1620. Holdings confiscated from subjects loyal to Henry II began to be returned, but the procedures were fraught with problems, were accompanied by judicial persecution, and were accompanied by exemplary sentences for Agramont party leaders.

While no burning of books is attested, as happened during the follow-up to the conquest of Granada in [[Oran]] (on Cardinal Cisneros' orders), large numbers of books, records and archives are missing; these relate to jurisprudence, accountancy, appointments, Parliament and Royal Council sessions, as well as property titles of the period prior to the 1512 invasion from the mid 15th century to early 16th century, with records resuming in 1512.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|34–35}} Files relating to the previous period appear to have been seized by the Spanish monarchy or their newly appointed authorities. The vast majority of the population was Basque-speaking and was mostly illiterate, relying on a bilingual notary who could write in Romance (a Navarrese variant [[Navarro-Aragonese#Eventual development|merging with Castilian]]) or Latin, but a requirement was imposed to re-register property titles before Castilian officials. Failing registration, ownership of the holding was invalidated and was subject to confiscation in favour the occupier.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}

Navarre remained on a state of military occupation at until at least 1530.&lt;ref name="ConqNavarre"/&gt;{{rp|71}} All positions in the kingdom's government were taken over by Castilian appointees, namely bishops, viceroys, and administrative personnel of the Royal Tribunals, the Royal Council, Accounts Chamber (''Comptos''), and the curia. Pamplona,&lt;ref name="Garona-Ebro"&gt;Jimeno Aranguren, R./Lopez-Mugartza Iriarte, J.C. (Eds.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} and other Navarrese towns were garrisoned by Castilian or Castilian-controlled troops. Navarrese ecclesiastics were  prevented from rising to the position of abbot or above.&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Navarrese showing a submissive demeanour were occasionally kept or appointed as officials.

Since the Spanish conquest, each time a bishop vacancy occurred, either the cathedral chapter of Pamplona, or later the ''Diputacion''. requested a Navarrese bishop, but no avail. For example, in 1539 an extensive report insisted on choosing a native ecclesiastic for the position on a number of accounts, one of them being that he could speak Basque and would be obeyed by his subjects, "for his native origin and because the Basque people, the main part of the kingdom, love like no other nation their own nature and language." The report was turned down without explanation, and a Castilian bishop appointed.&lt;ref&gt;In his influential ''Gramatica castellana'' (1492), Nebrija advocates for the need of the defeated to learn the language of the victors. He goes on to point that "it holds true that not only do the enemies of our faith need to know the Castilian language, but the [[Biscayne (ethnonym)|Biscayne]]s, the Navarrese, the French, the Italians, and any others who hold a business and a conversation in Spain, as well as a necessity for our language, may be able to know it better, had not they acquired it by use since childhood, by means of this work of mine. See Monreal, G; Jimeno, R. p 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of the church Goñi Gaztanbide (''Historia de los Obispos de Pamplona'', 1985) is adamant in his criticism, denouncing the "Castilian assimilation of Navarrese Church at all levels," to the point of considering that it was subjected to a colonial regime.&lt;ref name="HistoriaEuNav"&gt;Jimeno Jurío, J.M&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

The Navarrese continued turning their eyes to their Protestant brethren to the north, in Henry II's independent Navarre with Béarn. Navarre, like [[Gipuzkoa]], became a hotspot of penetration for Protestant ideas as early as 1521, when the [[Inquisition]] seized and set fire to a number of books. A ban was imposed on reading them, or even writing or preaching against Protestant doctrines, in order to avoid bringing attention to their claims.&lt;ref name="HistoriaEuNav"&gt;Jimeno Jurío, J.M&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

In 1525, on the heat of Henry II's two failed reconquest campaigns, the first [[witch trials in the early modern period|witchcraft]] allegations were instigated by the graduate Balanza, a member of the Royal Council and a commissioner of inquiries on witchcraft for Navarre. He sent letters to the Castilian bishop of Pamplona, John de Rena, (an able military administrator, but not ordained for religious functions). Balanza asserted that there existed "so much evil" in a number of southern Pyrenean valleys—starting from [[Salazar Valley|Salazar]] and Roncal, to [[Burguete]] (Auritz), Baztan, Bortziriak, [[Ituren|Malerreka]] (to Pamplona)—located in the rear of the [[St-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] front in Lower Navarre, and an active theatre of war just a few years or months before, "it should not be only me who is aware of it" . After his inquiry and the resultant trials, held between January and August 1525, 30–40 people, mostly women, were condemned and burnt alive by the occupation authorities; other sources point to 200. A further 43 were stripped of their property.

On 15{{nbs}}August 1532, Ana of [[Albret]], the sister of Henry II, died. She expressed in her will the wish to be buried with her parents Catherine I and John III in Pamplona, but her wish was not honoured. She also bequeathed her dominion as Princess of Viana to her brother King Henry II. Doubts over the occupation of Navarre perturbed Charles V until death. He attempted to find a compromise suiting both his ambitions and the monarchs of Navarre. To that end, he tried to marry his son and successor [[Philip II of Spain]] to the heir-apparent of Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]], in 1539, highlighting her high educational background and intelligence. These attempts ultimately failed, but Charles V left Philip II instructions on his will to give Navarre back, "following his conscience".&lt;ref name="ConqNavRef"/&gt;{{rp|27}} That never happened.

[[Stolpersteine]] is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They memorialize the fate of the victims of [[Nazi Germany]] being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. The Stolpersteine in [[Neratovice]], a town in the [[Central Bohemian Region]] ({{lang-cs|Středočeský kraj}}) of the present-day [[Czech Republic]] (formerly [[Czechoslovakia]]), were collocated in 2010.

The Czech Stolperstein project was initiated in 2008 by the ''Česká unie židovské mládeže'' (Czech Union of Jewish Youth) and was realized with the patronage of the Mayor of Prague.&lt;ref&gt;Zdeňka Kuchyňová: ''[http://www.radio.cz/cz/rubrika/udalosti/praha-ma-na-chodnicich-sve-prvni-pametni-kameny-holocaustu Praha má na chodnících své první pamětní kameny holocaustu]'', [[Radio Praha]], 19 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;stolpersteine.cz: ''[https://archive.is/6bh0z#selection-293.1-293.45 archive.is/6bh0z Stolpersteine in der Tschechischen Republik]'', retrieved on 20 March 2017 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeareds.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Tel Erani''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) or '''Tell esh-Sheikh Ahmed el-ʿAreini''' ([[Arabic]]) is a multi-period [[archaeological site]] on the outskirts of [[Kiryat Gat]] in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]] of [[Israel]]. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] was first occupied in the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic period]], but its most notable remains are from the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]], when it was the site of a substantial [[Philistines|Philistine]] city with links to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. It has been identified with the [[Bible|biblical]] cities of [[Libnah]], [[Gath (city)|Gath]], ''Mmst'', [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]] and [[Makkedah]], but none of these identifications are certain. The city was destroyed in the 6th century BCE, possibly by the [[Babylonia]]ns. In the [[Persian period]], it was the site of a temple. There are also signs of settlement in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Byzantine period|Byzantine]], and [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] periods. The [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] village of [[Iraq al-Manshiyya]] was located at the foot of the tell until it was depopulated in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA166|title=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land|last=Negev|first=Avraham|last2=Gibson|first2=Shimon|date=2001|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=9780826485717|edition=Revised|location=New York, NY|pages=166–167|language=en|chapter=Erani (Tel)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and history of investigations ==
[[File:Conder and Kitchener 1880, Tel Erani.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Excerpt from mao sheet 20 of Conder and Kitchener's ''Survey of Western Palestine'' showing Tel Erani (Sh. Ahmed el-'''ʿ'''Areini)]]
Tel Erani was first documented by [[Claude Reignier Conder]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]] in their 1872–1877 survey for the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. They described the contemporary village of [[Iraq al-Manshiyya]] and remarked that the site was "evidently ancient and important, and seems possibly to represent the ancient Libnah." The identification of Tel Erani with the biblical city of [[Libnah]] was based on the [[chalk]] in the hills nearby – the name of the city meaning 'the white' in [[Biblical Hebrew|ancient Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/surveyofwesternp03conduoft|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: memoirs of the topography, orography, hydrography, and archaeology|last=Conder|first=Claude Reignier|last2=Kitchener|first2=Horatio Herbert|last3=Palmer|first3=Edward Henry|last4=Besant|first4=Walter|date=1881|publisher=Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund|others=|year=|isbn=|volume=III|location=London|pages=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[William F. Albright]] argued that the site was a poor fit with Libnah, and instead proposed it was the major [[Philistines|Philistine]] city of [[Gath (city)|Gath]]. He placed Libnah at [[Tell es-Safi]], which most scholars of the time identified with Gath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albright|first=William F.|date=1921|title=Contributions to the Historical Geography of Palestine|jstor=3768450|journal=The Annual of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem|volume=2/3|pages=1–46|doi=10.2307/3768450}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Palestinian population was forced out of the area in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Albright's theory was the basis for naming the new Israeli settlements of [[Kiryat Gat]] and [[Gat, Israel|Kibbutz Gat]].

In the late 1950s, [[Shmuel Yeivin]] opened excavations at the site (then known as Tel Gat) to confirm Albright's identification. Although he did find [[Iron Age]] material, the pottery was not consistent with a Philistine city. Albright's theory was therefore rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kempinski|first=Aharon|last2=Gilead|first2=Isaac|date=1991|title=New Excavations at Tel Erani: A Preliminary Report of the 1985–1988 Seasons|url=|journal=Tel Aviv|volume=18|issue=2|pages=164–191|doi=10.1179/tav.1991.1991.2.164|issn=0334-4355|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aegyptus est Imago Caeli: studies presented to Krzysztof Ciałowicz on his 60th birthday|last=Czarnowicz|first=Marcin|last2=Pasternak|first2=Martin|last3=Ochał-Czarnowicz|first3=Agnieszka|last4=Skłucki|first4=Jakub|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Jagiellonian University of Kraków|year=2014|isbn=978-83-934218-8-6|editor-last=Jucha|editor-first=Mariusz A.|location=Kraków|pages=235–244|chapter=The Egyptian Presence at Tel Erani|editor-last2=Dębowska-Ludwin|editor-first2=Joanna|editor-last3=Kołodziejczyk|editor-first3=Piotr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Yeivin discovered that the main phase of occupation of the site was earlier, in the [[Early Bronze Age]].

The '''Waterfront Historic Area LeaguE''', also known as '''WHALE''', is a non-profit [[historic preservation]] organization located in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].  Its mission is: "to promote the value and reuse of greater New Bedford's historic structures through preservation, education and advocacy".&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"&gt;WHALE - Waterfront Historic Area League. 26 May 2009 &lt;http://www.waterfrontleague.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization often promotes its cause with the words of one of its founders, Sarah Delano (President of WHALE, 1966-1982).  Delano said, "if you bulldoze your heritage, you become just anywhere".&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995"&gt;McCabe, Marsha, and Joseph D. Thomas. Not Just Anywhere. New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

                                                                  
== History ==

The organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens in 1962, at a time when urban renewal threatened much of the city's history and architectural heritage.  The original focus was on the city's waterfront district, a dense area of [[whaling]] era buildings suffering from severe neglect and disrepair.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995" /&gt;  WHALE took on the preservation/restoration of as many as 20 buildings within the district's boundaries over the years.  This became the organization's first neighborhood revitalization project and lead to the establishment of Bedford Landing Waterfront National Register [[Historic District]].  With WHALE's leadership, the district would later be designated, [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]].&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;  Over time, WHALE expanded to properties beyond this district, taking on preservation projects throughout the city.  WHALE has now completed over 45 preservation and restoration projects in the greater New Bedford area between 1962 and 2009.&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">'''William Archer Butler''' (c. 1814–1848) was an Irish historian of philosophy.

==Life==

He was born at Annerville, near [[Clonmel]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. His father was a [[Protestant]], his mother a [[Roman Catholic]], and he was brought up as a Catholic. As a boy he was imaginative and poetical, and some of his early verses were remarkable. While yet at Clonmel school he became a Protestant. Later he entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he had a brilliant career. He specially devoted himself to literature and [[metaphysics]], and was noted for the beauty of his style. In 1834 he gained the ethical moderatorship, newly instituted by Provost Lloyd, and continued in residence at college. In 1837 he decided to enter the Church, and in the same year he was elected to the professorship of moral philosophy, specially founded for him through Lloyd's exertions.

About the same time he was presented to the prebend of Clondahorky, [[Donegal]], and resided there when not called by his professorial duties to Dublin. In 1842 he was promoted to the rectory of Raymochy. He died on 5 July 1848.

==Works==

His ''Sermons'' (2 vols., 1849) were brilliant and forceful. The Lectures on the ''History of Ancient Philosophy'', edited by W. Hepworth Thompson (2 vols., 5856; 2nd ed., 1 vol. 1875) were among the few British works on the history of philosophy. These works include introductory lectures, the early Greek thinkers, and lectures on Plato.

Among his other writings were papers in the ''[[Dublin University Magazine]]'' (1834-1837); and "Letters on Development" (in the ''Irish Ecclesiastical Journal'', 1845), a reply to [[John Henry Newman|Newman]]'s famous ''Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine''.

'''William Whiston''' (9 December 1667 – 22 August 1752) was an English theologian, historian, and mathematician, a leading figure in the popularisation of the ideas of [[Isaac Newton]]. He is now probably best known for helping to instigate the [[Longitude Act]] in 1714 (and his attempts to win [[longitude prize|the rewards]] that it promised) and his important translations of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' and other works by [[Josephus]] (which are still in print).  He was a prominent exponent of [[Arianism]] and wrote ''[[A New Theory of the Earth]]''.

Whiston succeeded his mentor Newton as [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1710 he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views. Because Whiston recognized the Bible as a book of spiritual truth, he rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire. He viewed it as absurd and cruel, as well as an insult to God. What especially pitted him against church authorities, was he viewed the [[Trinity]] as a lie after extensive research convinced him the origin of the Trinity teaching to be pagan.

==Early life and career==
Whiston was born to Josiah Whiston and Katherine Rosse at [[Twycross|Norton-juxta-Twycross]], in [[Leicestershire]], where his father was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]. He was educated privately, for his health, and so that he could act as [[amanuensis]] to his blind father.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Whiston, William |volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Queen Elizabeth's Mercian School|Queen Elizabeth Grammar School]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. After his father's death, he entered [[Clare College, Cambridge]] as a [[sizar]] on 30 June 1686. He applied himself to mathematical study, was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA) (1690), and AM (1693), and was elected Fellow in 1691 and probationary senior Fellow in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WHSN686W|name=Whiston, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]] ordained Whiston at [[Lichfield]] in 1693. In 1694, claiming ill health, he resigned his tutorship at Clare to [[Richard Laughton]], chaplain to [[John Moore (Bishop of Norwich)|John Moore]], the [[bishop of Norwich]], and swapped positions with him. He now divided his time between Norwich, Cambridge and London. In 1698 Moore gave him the living of [[Lowestoft]] where he became rector. In 1699 he resigned his Fellowship of Clare College and left to marry.

In 1701 Whiston resigned his living to become Isaac Newton's substitute, giving the Lucasian lectures at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor in 1702. There followed a period of joint research with [[Roger Cotes]], appointed with Whiston's patronage to the [[Plumian professorship]] in 1706. Students at the Cotes–Whiston experimental philosophy course included [[Stephen Hales]], [[William Stukeley]], and [[Joseph Wasse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knox |first=Kevin C. |title=From Newton to Hawking: A History of Cambridge University's Lucasian Professors of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGX_rAeia4kC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=6 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66310-6|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newtonian theologian==
[[File:WilliamWhistonComet.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of William Whiston with a diagram demonstrating his theories of cometary catastrophism, described in ''[[A New Theory of the Earth]]'']]

In 1707 Whiston was [[Boyle lecturer]]; this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for Newton's followers, including [[Richard Bentley]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], to express their views, especially in opposition to the rise of [[deism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shank |first=J. B. |title=The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBusxgu8-AAC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=15 September 2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74947-1|pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Newtonian" line came to include, with Bentley, Clarke and Whiston in particular, a defence of [[natural law]] by returning to the definition of [[Augustine of Hippo]] of a [[miracle]] (a cause of human wonderment), rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature, which went back to [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]. This move was intended to undermine arguments of deists and sceptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Jane |title=Miracles in Enlightenment England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_UXe_Cat7wC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11272-6|page=31 and 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boyle lectures dwelt on the connections between biblical prophecies, dramatic physical events such as floods and eclipses, and their explanations in terms of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{ThoemmesBritish17C|Whiston, William|875}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Whiston was alive to possible connections of prophecy with current affairs: the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and later the [[Jacobite rebellions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara Schechner|author2=Sara Schechner Genuth|title=Comets, popular culture, and the birth of modern cosmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_U3rRP-P684C&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=23 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00925-4|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiston supported a qualified [[biblical literalism]]: the literal meaning should be the default, unless there was a good reason to think otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kidd |first=Colin |title=British Identities before Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2EIlJISeUMC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-42572-8|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view again went back to Augustine. Newton's attitude to the [[cosmogony]] of [[Thomas Burnet]] reflected on the language of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]; as did Whiston's alternative cosmogony. Moses as author of ''Genesis'' was not necessarily writing as a natural philosopher, nor as a law-giver, but for a particular audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poole |first=William |title=The World Makers: Scientists of the Restoration and the Search for the Origins of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--Z4LNo40cwC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-906165-08-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new cosmogonies of Burnet, Whiston and [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] were all criticised for their disregard of the biblical account, by [[John Arbuthnot]], [[John Edwards (divine)|John Edwards]] and [[William Nicolson]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stephen Gaukroger]]|author2=John Schuster|author3=John Sutton|title=Descartes' Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lguESFLTOl0C&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=23 May 2013|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-46301-7|pages=176–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title for Whiston's Boyle lectures was ''The Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies''. Rejecting [[typology (theology)|typological]] interpretation of biblical prophecy, he argued that the meaning of a prophecy must be unique. His views were later challenged by [[Anthony Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Henk J. M. Nellen|author3=Edwin Rabbie|title=Hugo Grotius, Theologian: Essays in Honour of G. H. M. Posthumus Meyjes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nULvj0SoH6sC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=1994|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10000-8|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a more immediate attack by [[Nicholas Clagett the younger|Nicholas Clagett]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clagett, Nicholas (1654-1727)|display=Clagett, Nicholas (1654–1727)|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason prophecy was topical was the [[Camisard]] movement that saw French exiles ("French prophets") in England. Whiston had started writing on the [[millenarianism]] that was integral to the Newtonian theology, and wanted to distance his views from theirs, and in particular from those of [[John Lacy (merchant)|John Lacy]].&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jed Zachary Buchwald|author2=Mordechai Feingold|title=Newton and the origin of civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmFGvVvwon0C&amp;pg=PA336|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=22 October 2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15478-7|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting the French prophets in 1713, Whiston developed the view that the [[charismatic gift]] of revelation could be [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.E. Force|author2=S. Hutton|title=Newton and Newtonianism: New Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKT9HfHQ5tEC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=25 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-1969-2|page=179 note 102.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tensions with Newton==
It is no longer assumed that Whiston's ''Memoirs'' are completely trustworthy on the matter of his personal relations with Newton. One view is that the relationship was never very close, Bentley being more involved in Whiston's appointment to the Lucasian chair; and that it deteriorated as soon as Whiston began to write on prophecy, publishing ''Essay on the Revelation of St John'' (1706).&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt; This work proclaimed the millennium for the year 1716.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacob |first=Margaret C. |title=The Newtonians and the English Revolution 1689–1720 |year=1976 |publisher=Harvester Press |pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiston's 1707 edition of Newton's ''[[Arithmetica Universalis]]'' did nothing to improve matters. Newton himself was heavily if covertly involved in the 1722 edition, nominally due to [[John Machin]], making many changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. T. Whiteside|title=The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sf5z2h93_wcC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=3 January 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-04584-1|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1708–9 Whiston was engaging [[Thomas Tenison]] and [[John Sharp (bishop)|John Sharp]] as archbishops in debates on the Trinity. There is evidence from [[Hopton Haynes]] that Newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.E. Force|author2=S. Hutton|title=Newton and Newtonianism: New Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKT9HfHQ5tEC&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=25 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-1969-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; his [[antitrinitarian]] views, from the 1690s, were finally published in 1754 as ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]''.

Whiston was never a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. In conversation with [[Edmond Halley]] he blamed his reputation as a "heretick". Also, though, he claimed Newton had disliked having an independent-minded disciple; and was unnaturally cautious and suspicious by nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Richard H. Popkin]] |title=The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy |year=1999 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=0-7126-6534-X |page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expelled Arian==
Whiston's route to rejection of the [[Nicene Creed]], the historical orthodox position against [[Arianism]], began early in his tenure of the Lucasian chair as he followed hints from Samuel Clarke. He read also in [[Louis Ellies Dupin]], and the ''Explication of Gospel Theism'' (1706) of [[Richard Brocklesby (clergyman)|Richard Brocklesby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiles |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Wiles|title=Archetypal Heresy: Arianism Through the Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKWjIQtq5gQC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=26 September 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826927-4|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study of the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'' then convinced him that Arianism was the creed of the early church.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The [[British general election, 1710|general election of 1710]] brought the [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] solid political power for a number of years, up to the [[Hanoverian succession]] of 1714. Their distrust of theological innovation had a direct impact on Whiston, as well as others of similar views. His [[heterodoxy]] was notorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |title=The Enlightenment Prelate: Benjamin Hoadly, 1767-1761|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DepggDo4awIC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-227-67978-4|pages=121–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled from the university.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The matter was not allowed to rest there: Whiston tried to get a hearing before [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]]. He did have defenders even in the [[high church]] ranks, such as [[George Smalridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Gibson|author2=Robert G.. Ingram|title=Religious Identities in Britain: 1660 – 1832|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX5Mc_5snlcC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3209-2|pages=47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For political reasons, this development would have been divisive at the time.

=="Primitive Christianity"==
[[File:WilliamWhiston.jpg|thumb|right]]
Whiston founded a society for promoting primitive Christianity, lecturing in support of his theories in halls and [[coffee house|coffee-houses]] at London, [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and [[Tunbridge Wells]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Those he involved included [[Thomas Chubb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5378|title=Chubb, Thomas|first=Clive|last=Probyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Emlyn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=8793|title=Emlyn, Thomas|first=H.

[[Franz Wokenius]] wrote a 1728 Latin work on Whiston's view of primitive Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wokenius |first=Franz |title=Christianismus primaevus quem Guil. Whistonus modo non-probando restituendum dictitat sed Apostolus Paulus breviter quasi in tabula depinxit ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVfitgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 May 2013|year=1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; His challenge to the teachings of [[Athanasius]] meant that Whiston was commonly considered [[heresy|heretical]] on many points. On the other hand, he was a firm believer in supernatural aspects of Christianity. He defended prophecy and miracle. He supported [[anoint]]ing the sick and touching for the [[king's evil]]. His dislike of [[rationalism]] in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of Hoadley's ''Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament''. He was fervent in his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline, derived from the ''Apostolical Constitutions''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

About 1747 Whiston finally left the [[Anglican communion]] for the [[Baptists]]. He quitted the church literally as well as figuratively, as the clergyman began to read the [[Athanasian Creed]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Lecturer and popular author==
Whiston began lecturing on natural philosophy in London. He gave regular courses at [[coffee house#coffee in Europe|coffee house]]s, particularly Button's, and also at the Censorium, a set of riverside meeting rooms in London run by [[Richard Steele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret C. Jacob|author2=Larry Stewart|title=Practical Matter: Newton's Science in the Service of Industry and Empire 1687–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU8zZrK2JPgC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03903-2|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Button's, he gave courses of demonstration lectures on astronomical and physical phenomena, and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]] worked with him on experimental demonstrations. His passing remarks on religious topics were sometimes objected to, for example by [[Henry Newman (SPCK)|Henry Newman]] writing to Steele.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|title=London Coffee houses and mathematics|id=Coffee_houses|class=HistTopics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=12619|title=Hauksbee, Francis|first=Larry|last=Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Whiston Senex solar system chart.jpg|thumb|left|Solar system chart by William Whiston and John Senex]]
His lectures were often accompanied by publications. In 1712, he published, with [[John Senex]], a chart of the [[solar system]] showing numerous paths of comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Thomas Hockey|editor2=Katherine Bracher|editor3=Marvin Bolt|editor4=Virginia Trimble|editor5= Richard Jarrell|editor6=  JoAnn Palmeri|editor7=  Jordan D.

By 1715 Whiston had also become adept at newspaper advertising.&lt;ref name="Wigelsworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wigelsworth |first=Jeffrey R. |title=Selling Science in the Age of Newton: Advertising and the Commoditization of Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yi2S_ZiFxaQC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=25 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2310-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently lectured to the Royal Society.

==Longitude==
In 1714, he was instrumental in the passing of the [[Longitude Act]], which established the [[Board of Longitude]]. In collaboration with [[Humphrey Ditton]] he published ''A New Method for Discovering the Longitude, both at Sea and Land'',&lt;ref name="WhistonDitton1714"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ditton |first=William Whiston |last2=Ditton |first2=Humphrey |title=A New Method for Discovering the Longitude, both at Sea and Land|url=http://writersinspire.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/content/new-method-discovering-longitude-both-sea-land-humbly-proposed-consideration-publick-william|accessdate=15 Apr 2015|year=1714|publisher=John Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely referenced and discussed. For the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the [[Longitude prize|longitude reward]], which earned him widespread ridicule, particularly from the group of writers known as the [[Scriblerians]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1714 "Ode, to Musick. On the Longitude," including numerous references to bepissing and beshitting upon both Whiston and Ditton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Snobelen, ‘William Whiston: Natural Philosopher, Prophet, Primitive Christian’ (Cambridge Univ. Ph.D. Thesis, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In one proposal for using magnetic dip to find longitude he produced one of the first [[Isoclinic line|isoclinic]] maps of southern England in 1719 and 1721. In 1734, he proposed using the [[eclipse]]s of [[Moons of Jupiter|Jupiter's satellites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-MSS-00079-00130-00002/1 Mr Whiston's Project for finding the Longitude (MSS/79/130.2)], Board of Longitude project, [[University of Cambridge]] Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broader natural philosophy==
Whiston's ''[[A New Theory of the Earth|A New Theory of the Earth from its Original to the Consummation of All Things]]'' (1696) was an articulation of [[creationism]] and [[flood geology]]. It held that the [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]] of [[Noah]] had been caused by a [[comet]]. The work obtained the praise of [[John Locke]], who classed the author among those who, if not adding much to our knowledge, "At least bring some new things to our thoughts."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was an early advocate, along with [[Edmond Halley]], of the periodicity of comets; he also held that comets were responsible for past [[catastrophism|catastrophes]] in Earth's history. In 1736, he caused widespread anxiety among London's citizens when he predicted the world would end on [[October 16|16 October]] that year because a comet would hit the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201511/physicshistory.cfm|title=This Month in Physics History|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wake]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] officially denied this prediction to calm the public.

There was no consensus within the Newtonians as to how far mechanical causes could be held responsible for key events of sacred history: [[John Keill]] was at the opposite to extreme to Whiston in minimising such causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poole |first=William |title=The World Makers: Scientists of the Restoration and the Search for the Origins of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--Z4LNo40cwC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=25 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-906165-08-6|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural philosopher, Whiston's speculations respected no boundary with his theological views. He saw the creation of man as an intervention in the [[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]]. He picked up on [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]]'s advice to Samuel Clarke to omit an eclipse and earthquake mentioned by [[Phlegon of Tralles]] from future editions of Clarke's Boyle lectures, these events being possibly synchronous with [[Christ's crucifixion]]. Whiston published ''The Testimony of Phlegon Vindicated'' in 1732.&lt;ref name="Force1985"&gt;{{cite book |last=Force |first=James E. |title=William Whiston: Honest Newtonian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=np9s8TGaSnYC&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=29 March 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26590-4|page=181 note 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
The series of [[Moyer Lectures]] often made Whiston's unorthodox views a particular target.&lt;ref name="ForceHutton2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.E. Force|author2=S.

Whiston held that ''[[Song of Solomon]]'' was [[apocrypha]]l and that the ''[[Book of Baruch]]'' was not.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He modified the biblical [[Ussher chronology]], setting the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] at 4010&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Davis A. Young|author2=Ralph Stearley|title=The Bible, Rocks and Time: Geological Evidence for the Age of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRKtFWlSrRsC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=23 May 2013|date=18 August 2008|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-2876-0|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged Newton's system of ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' (1728). Westfall absolves Whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the ''Chronology'' just to attack it, commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of Newton, who died in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westfall |first=Richard S. |authorlink=Richard S.

Whiston's advocacy of clerical [[monogamy]] is referenced in ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. His last "famous discovery, or rather revival of Dr [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]]'s," which he mentions in his autobiography, was the identification of the [[Tatars]] with the [[lost tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Whiston married Ruth, daughter of George Antrobus, his headmaster at Tamworth school. He had a happy family life and died in [[Lyndon, Rutland|Lyndon]] Hall, [[Rutland]], at the home of his son-in-law, [[Samuel Barker (Hebraist)|Samuel Barker]], on 22 August 1752. He was survived by his children Sarah, William, George, and John.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Works==
Whiston's later life was spent in continual controversy: [[theology|theological]], mathematical, [[chronology|chronological]], and miscellaneous. He vindicated his estimate of the ''Apostolical Constitutions'' and the Arian views he had derived from them in his ''Primitive Christianity Revived'' (5 vols., 1711–1712). In 1713 he produced a reformed [[liturgy]]. His ''Life of Samuel Clarke'' appeared in 1730.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His translation of the works of [[Josephus]] (1737), with notes and dissertations, was often reprinted. In 1745 he published his ''Primitive New Testament'' (on the basis of [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Claromontanus]]).

Whiston left memoirs (3 vols., 1749–1750). These do not contain the account of the proceedings taken against him at Cambridge for his [[antitrinitarianism]], which was published separately at the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12537">The '''Zeriuani''' or '''Zeruiani''' was a Slavic tribe mentioned by the 9th-century [[Bavarian Geographer]] ({{abbreviation|BG|Bavarian Geographer}}). It states that the Zeruiani "which is so great a realm that from it, as their tradition relates, all the tribes of the Slavs are sprung and trace their origin". Scholarship connect it to [[Procopius]]' ''[[Sporoi]]'', the [[Serbs]], and [[Severians]].

{{cquote|Zeruiani tantum est reguum, ut ex eo cunctae gentes Sclavorum exortae sint, et originem, sicut affirmant, ducant{{sfn|Šafařík|1865|p=29}}&lt;br&gt;''Zeruiani which is so great a realm that from it, as their tradition relates, all the tribes of the Slavs are sprung and trace their origin''{{sfn|Cross|1963|p=6}}}}

==Studies==
While earlier assumed by scholars to have been connected to early [[Serbs]] (or [[White Serbs]]), modern Polish scholars{{who|date=December 2017}} believe it is a corrupted form of the name of the [[Severians]]. It is claimed that the Serb ethnonym was never written with the Slavic suffix ''-jane'' (''-eani''), while the tribal name of the Severians was written in both collective ''Sever'' and plural ''Severjane'' form, etymologically implying Severian tribes. [[Gerard Labuda]] considered those tribes arrived from the [[Lesser Poland]] and western Ukraine, while Ryszard Kiersnowski assumed the Zeriuani were a relic of a large group which lived along the river [[Oder]], but as there was no recorded tribe with such a name in those parts it also indicates the Ruthenian and Balkan Severians.{{sfn|Witczak|2013|p=?}}

*According to German historian [[Johann Caspar Zeuss]] (1806–1856) they inhabited the Enns-Rhein line and were the earliest Serb tribe.{{sfn|Zeuss|1837|p=615}}

*According to Polish historian [[Joachim Lelewel]] (1786–1861), the Zeriuani referred to the "Serbs on the Dniester", while Zuireani (another tribe mentioned by BG) referred to the "[[Serbs]] in the Balkans".{{sfn|Persowski|1962|p=73}}{{sfn|Lelewel|1852|p=43}}{{quote needed|date=December 2017}}

*According to Slovak historian and ethnographer [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861), the Zeruiani were the [[White Serbs]] mentioned in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''.{{sfn|Šafařík|1865|p=29}}{{sfn|Persowski|1962|p=?}}

*According to Czech historian [[František Palacký]] (1798–1876), the Zeruiani were the Serbs.{{sfn|Palacký|1876|p=89}}

*According to Czech anthropologist [[Lubor Niederle]] (1865–1944), the name Zeruiani is a corruption of either Sarmatians, Serbs or Severians.&lt;ref name="Niederle1923"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lubor Niederle|title=Manuel de l'antiquité slave ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjANAAAAIAAJ|year=1923|publisher=É.

*According to American Slavicist Samuel Hazzard Cross, the ethnonym Zeruiani was obviously related to the modern terms ''Serb'' and ''Sorb''.{{sfn|Cross|1963|p=6}}

*Some Serbian historians view the tribe as the [[Sporoi]] (a Greek rendering of ''*Sorpoi/Sorboi'') mentioned by Procopius, being the earliest Slavic tribe, that of Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbian Studies|volume=2|issue=1–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOcVAQAAMAAJ|year=1982|publisher=North American Society for Serbian Studies|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Александар М Петровић|title=Праисторија Срба: разматрање грађе за стару повесницу|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cV4MAQAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Пешић и синови|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
