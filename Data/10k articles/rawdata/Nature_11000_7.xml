'''{{mp|(276033) 2002 AJ|129}}''', provisional designation {{mp|2002 AJ|129}}, is a [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-crossing asteroid]]. It has the ninth-smallest perihelion of all numbered asteroids, after asteroids such as {{mpl-|137924|2000 BD|19}}, {{mpl-|374158|2004 UL}}, and {{mpl-|386454|2008 XM}}.&lt;ref name="JPLcrosserlist" /&gt; It makes close approaches to all of the [[inner planets]]&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; and asteroid [[4 Vesta]].&lt;ref name="NEODyS-CA" /&gt; The asteroid is estimated to be between {{convert|0.5|-|1.2|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} across.&lt;ref name="NeoDys" /&gt; In January 2018 there was much media hype about this asteroid being classified as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], although there is no known threat of an impact for hundreds if not thousands of years. The media has compared the size of the asteroid to the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai.&lt;ref name="Business-Insider" /&gt;

== Description ==

{{mp|2002 AJ|129}} was discovered on 15 January 2002, by astronomers of the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking|NEAT]] team at [[Haleakala Observatory]], Hawaii, United States.&lt;ref name="MPEC2002-B14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; It was removed from the [[Sentry Risk Table]] on 3 February 2002.&lt;ref name="Removed" /&gt;

It is a [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-]], [[List of Venus-crossing minor planets|Venus-]], [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-]] and [[List of Mars-crossing minor planets|Mars-crossing asteroid]]. With an [[observation arc]] of 14 years, it has a well determined orbit and was last observed in 2016.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is classified as an [[Apollo asteroid]]&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; because it is a [[near-Earth asteroid]] with a [[semi-major axis]] larger than Earth's. It is also categorized as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]],&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; but that does not mean there is a near-term threat of an impact. It is a potentially hazardous asteroid merely as a result of its size ([[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] {{nowrap|''H'' ≤ 22}}) and Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] {{nowrap|(''Earth MOID'' ≤ 0.05 AU}}).

=== 2018 approach ===

On 4 February 2018 at 21:31&amp;nbsp;[[Universal Time|UT]], the asteroid passed about {{convert|0.028126|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JPL-news" /&gt; The 2018 Earth approach distance was known with a [[3-sigma]] accuracy of ±200&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] is scheduled to observe the asteroid from 3–6 February.&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt; By 4 February 2018 11:00 UT, the asteroid brightened to [[apparent magnitude]] 14 and had a [[solar elongation]] of more than 100[[Degree (angle)|°]].&lt;ref name="NEODyS2018"/&gt;

=== 2172 approach ===

On 8 February 2172, the asteroid will pass about {{convert|0.00458|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The 2172 Earth approach distance is known with a [[3-sigma]] accuracy of ±4000&amp;nbsp;km.

As we look even further into the future the known trajectory becomes more [[wikt:divergent|divergent]]. By the Earth approach of {{convert|0.24|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} on 19 February 2196 the uncertainty increases to ±2.4 million&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

[[File:Irkutsk oblast with Vitim bolide impact site.png|thumb|right|alt=Impact site|Vitim bolide impact site]]

The '''2002 Vitim event''' or '''Bodaybo event''' is believed to be an [[impact event|impact]] by a [[bolide]] (fireball) in the [[Vitim River]] basin. It occurred near the town of [[Bodaybo]] in the Mamsko-Chuisky district of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]] on September 25, 2002 at approximately 22:00 (local time, UTC/GMT +9 hours: [[ISO 8601]] format 2002-09-25T13:00Z). The event was detected by a US military missile-defense satellite.&lt;ref name=cc071003/&gt;

==Analysis==

Attempts were made to define the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the explosion. [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] analysts calculated it was around {{convert|0.86|TJ|ktTNT|abbr=off|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=cc071003/&gt; Peter Brown estimates the total yield of both Bodiabo and [[Tagish Lake (meteorite)|Tagish Lake]] at about 2 kilotons—a factor of roughly 10,000 less than the [[Tunguska event]].&lt;ref name=cc071003/&gt; Russian physicist Andrey Olkhovatov estimates it at 4–5 kilotons.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Information about the event appeared in the mass media and among scientists after only a week. A small expedition, sent by the Institute of Sun–Earth Physics ([[Irkutsk]]), tried to find a meteorite within about 10&amp;nbsp;km from Bodaybo town (people told them– "it has fallen beyond the nearest mountain").

== Expeditions ==
* 1st - Russian MChS (Emergency Rescue) team tried to find an object near Bodaybo.
* 2nd - October, 2002 expedition of [[Irkutsk State University]] (leader S. Yazev).

Official expeditions in 2002–2003 never reached the impact site, situated in remote [[Siberia]]n [[taiga]].

== Kosmopoisk expedition ==
As reported by the [[ufology]] organization [[Kosmopoisk]], in May 2003 an expedition, performed by Kosmopoisk (leader &amp;mdash; [[Vadim Chernobrov]]) reached a presumed impact point (about 50&amp;nbsp;km from Vitimsky settle point). The situation there looked similar to that of the [[Podkamennaya Tunguska River]] after the [[Tunguska event]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}{{dubious|date=May 2014}} Snow and water samples were analyzed and found to contain an abnormal amount of [[tritium]], as well as [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[isotope]]s of [[cobalt]] and [[caesium]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Chernobrov suggested that the Vitim event could be caused by a low density [[comet]] nucleus with a diameter of about 30–100 meters.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

'''2004 FH''' is a micro-[[asteroid]] and [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], approximately 30 meters in diameter, that passed just {{convert|43,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the [[Earth]]'s surface on 18 March 2004, at 22:08 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. It was the [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth|11th closest approach to Earth]] recorded {{As of|2008|11|21|lc=on}}.{{efn|name=record-definitions}} The asteroid was first observed on 16 March 2004, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] at the [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==
[[File:2004fs56992main 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Trajectory of {{mp|2004 FH}} in the Earth–Moon system]]

{{mp|2004 FH}} is an [[Aten asteroid]]. It passed 43,000 km from the Earth on 18 March 2004. For comparison, [[geostationary satellite]]s orbit Earth at 35,790 kilometers. Despite its small size, it is still the fourth largest asteroid detected coming closer to the Earth than the Moon. 

Had this object hit Earth, it would probably have detonated high in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It might have produced a blast measured in hundreds of kilotons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], but may not have produced any effect on the ground. It could also have been an [[Earth-grazing fireball]] if it had been much closer but not close enough to impact.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--infobox: MASS= 2.8{{e|7}} kg source?--&gt;

On 17 March 2044 the asteroid will pass no closer than {{convert|0.0116|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; {{mp|2004 FH}} also has the distinction of having the lowest [[inclination]] of any known near-Earth asteroids.

Two weeks later another asteroid approached even closer, {{mpl|2004 FU|162}}, which was smaller, and a few years later {{mpl|2009 DD|45}}, which was closer in size passed by at similar distance.

== Physical characteristics ==

{{mp|2004 FH}} is an assumed stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

In March 2004, two rotational [[lightcurve]]s of {{mp|2004 FH}} were obtained from photometric observations by astronomers [[Petr Pravec]], [[Stefano Sposetti]] and [[Raoul Behrend]]. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of 0.0504 hours (3.02 minutes) with a brightness amplitude of 1.16 and 0.75 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]], respectively ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3/2+]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt;

This makes this object a [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], currently among the [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)#Periods 0.05–0.1 hour|Top 100]] known to exist. The photometric observations also revealed, that {{mp|2004 FH}} is a [[List of tumblers (small Solar System bodies)|tumbler]] with a non-principal axis rotation.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

has been estimated to measure approximately 30 meters (100 feet) in diameter.&lt;ref name="news142"/&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 24 meters based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 25.7.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Notes ==
{{notelist|refs=

{{efn|name=image-description-extended|1=Flyby of asteroid 2004 FH (center dot being followed by the sequence). The other object that flashes by is an artificial [[satellite]]. Images were taken by [[Stefano Sposetti]] and composited by [[Raoul Behrend]] of [[Geneva Observatory]].}}

{{efn|name=record-definitions|1=Rankings depend on definitions of meteoroid and approach. The 2-10 m 1972 grazer was at 57 km, the 44 kg 1990 grazer was about 100 km, possible 2006 grazer size and altitude not available. ''See [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth]]''.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">[[Image:6N3P.jpg|thumb|right|150px|6N3P vacuum tubes USSR]]The '''6N3P''' (Russian: '''6Н3П''') is a [[Russia]]n-made direct equivalent of the '''2C51''' medium gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]].  It may be used as an amplifier, mixer, oscillator or multivibrator over a frequency range [[Audio frequency|AF]] through [[VHF]].  The Russian tube is slightly larger in size than the American tube.

== Basic data ==

(per each triode)

Uf = 6.3 V, If = 350 mA, µ = 36, Ia = 7.7 mA, S = 4.9 mA/V, Pa = 1.5 W

== History of use ==

6N3P was widely used for FM band radio input unit stages (nearly all 1960s Soviet radios with FM band employed the same input unit on a separate [[sub-chassis]]). Currently it has found use in [[DIY]] preamps. A ruggedized/industrial version of the tube is designated '''6N3P-EV''' (Russian: '''6Н3П-ЕВ''').

== Chinese 6N3 ==
eBay has proliferated with pre-amps apparently from Hong Kong that are largely populated with the 6N3, which is said to be the Chinese version of the 6N3P.  The 6N3Ps are newly made (unlike the Soviet "new old stock," and the pre-amps appear to be the product of a cottage hifi industry).

The '''Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert''' on the southern coasts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is an [[ecoregion]] which experiences thick fogs where visibility may be reduced to {{convert|33|feet|metres}}. It is classed as an [[Afrotropic]] [[fog desert]] &lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at1302|name=Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
This ecosystem exists on a strip along the western and eastern coasts of Arabia. It follows the coast of [[Oman]] southward from [[Masirah Island]] and reaches inland to 120&amp;nbsp;km in the [[Jiddat al Harasisi]] plateau and the [[Dhofar]] mountains. From here it continues as a very narrow strip (only 5&amp;nbsp;km wide) along the coast of [[Yemen]] and up the 50&amp;nbsp;km wide the [[Tihamah]] plain along the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. In Oman and Yemen moisture is provided by thick fogs coming off the ocean during the summer [[khareef]] monsoon, while the hot Tihamah plain is moisturised by some rainfall and the generally high humidity of the Red Sea.

==Flora==
In this region, although it rarely rains the fog provides moisture sufficient to nurture a great deal of [[grassland]], [[shrub]]s and thick [[woodland]]. There are over sixty local species of plant. This coastal strip is of particular importance as further inland where the fog does not have an influence most of the Arabian Peninsula is desert. Vegetation varies progressively away from the coast which features dense woodland of ''[[Anogeissus dhofarica]]'', ''[[Acacia senegal]]'' and various thorny ''[[Commiphora]]'' trees and shrubs. The richest flora can be found in the Dhofar mountains which have 900 plants including 60 endemic species and two endemic genera, ''[[Cibirhiza]]'' and ''[[Dhofaria]]''. One of these plants, the [[frankincense]]  tree ''(Boswellia sacra)'' was a source of great wealth for Dhofar in antiquity. In Yemen the side of [[Jabal Urays]] facing the sea is covered with ''[[Euphorbia balsamifera]]'' shrubs.

==Fauna==
The many mammals found here include the [[Arabian oryx]] ''(Oryx leucoryx)'' which was reintroduced to the wild after disappearing, [[gazelle]]s and the [[Nubian ibex]], a [[goat antelope]]. Predators found on the coast include [[caracal]]s,  [[Arabian wolf]], [[striped hyena]] and the critically endangered [[Arabian leopard]] ''(Panthera pardus nimr)'', which survives on [[Jebel Samhan]] in the Dhofar mountains. The [[Arabian gazelle]] which once lived on the peninsula is now extinct.

==Threats and preservation==
The main threat to this ecosystem is overgrazing by increasing numbers of cattle and other livestock as well as off-road driving and human encroachment. Urban areas in this ecoregion include: in Oman the port of [[Duqm]] and the Dhofar capital of [[Salalah]]; in Yemen, the [[Hadhramaut]] port capital [[Mukalla]], the former capital and ancient port of [[Aden]], the Red Sea coffee ports of [[Al Hudaydah]] (still the largest town on this coast of Yemen) and [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], and the [[World Heritage Site]] of [[Zabid]]; and the city of [[Jizan]], the ''fruit basket of Saudi Arabia''. Protected areas in Oman include the controversial [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] where the reintroduction took place, and [[Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve]] established for the protection of the leopards. There are a number of [[Important Bird Area]]s on the coast of Yemen but none are officially protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert|id=at1302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14548">{{Cretaceous}}
The '''Barremian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[geologic timescale]] (or a [[chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]]) between 129.4 ± 1.5 [[annum|Ma]] ([[million years ago]]) and 125.0 ± 1.0 Ma). It is a subdivision of the [[Early Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] (or [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]). It is preceded by the [[Hauterivian]] and followed by the [[Aptian]] stage.&lt;ref name=geowhen&gt;See Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004) or the online geowhen database (link below)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definitions==
[[File:StratotypeBarremienA.JPG|thumb|Barremian [[sedimentary rock]] layers, France]]
The original [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] for the Barremian stage is in the vicinity of the village of [[Barrême]], [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], [[France]]. [[Henri Coquand]] defined the stage and named it in 1873. 

The base of the Barremian is determined by the first appearance of the [[ammonite]]s ''[[Spitidiscus|Spitidiscus hugii]]'' and ''Spitidiscus vandeckii''.  The end of the Barremian is determined by the [[geomagnetic reversal]] at the start of the M0r [[chronozone]], which is biologically near the first appearance of the ammonite ''[[Paradeshayesites|Paradeshayesites oglanlensis]]''.

===Regional equivalents===
The Barremian falls in the [[Gallic epoch|Gallic]] epoch, a subdivision of the [[Cretaceous]] that is no longer used by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]. It overlaps the lower part of the [[Urgonian]] stage, which is sometimes used in western European stratigraphy. In [[North America]], the late [[Coahulian]] and the early [[Comanchean]] correspond to the Barremian. In [[New Zealand]], it falls within the [[Mokoiwian]], and in [[Japan]] it corresponds to the late [[Aritan]].&lt;ref name = geowhen /&gt;

===Subdivision===
The Barremian is often subdivided into two substages or subages, Lower/Early and Upper/Late Barremian.

In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Barremian stage contains eleven ammonite [[biozone]]s:
* zone of ''[[Pseudocrioceras|Pseudocrioceras waagenoides]]''
* zone of ''[[Colchidites|Colchidites sarasini]]''
* zone of ''[[Imerites|Imerites giraudi]]''
* zone of ''[[Hemihoplites|Hemihoplites feraudianus]]''
* zone of ''[[Gerhardtia|Gerhardtia sertousi]]''
* zone of ''[[Ancyloceras|Ancyloceras vandenheckii]]''
* zone of ''[[Coronites|Coronites darsi]]''
* zone of ''[[Kotetishvilia|Kotetishvilia compressissima]]''
* zone of ''[[Nicklesia|Nicklesia pulchella]]''
* zone of ''Nicklesia nicklesi''
* zone of ''Spitidiscus hugii''

==Palaeontology==
Much knowledge about the Barremian [[fauna]]—especially regarding [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[pterosaur]]s—derived from the famous [[Yixian Formation]] of [[China]], part of which dates from this stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">The '''Blytt-Sernander''' classification, or sequence, is a series of north [[Europe]]an climatic periods or phases based on the study of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[peat bog]]s by [[Axel Blytt]] (1876) and [[Rutger Sernander]] (1908). The classification was incorporated into a sequence of [[pollen zone]]s later defined by [[Lennart von Post]], one of the founders of [[palynology]].

==Description==
Layers in [[peat]] were first noticed by [[Heinrich Dau]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, ''Allerunterthänigster Bericht an die Königliche Dänische Rentekammer über die Torfmoore Seelands nach einer im Herbste 1828 deshalb unternommenen Reise.'' (usually simply ''Über die Torfmoore Seelands'') Copenhagen and Leipzig, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; A prize was offered by the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] to anyone who could explain them. Blytt hypothesized that the darker layers were deposited in drier times; the lighter, in moister times, applying his terms ''Atlantic'' (warm, moist) and ''Boreal'' (cool, dry). In 1926 [[C.A. Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;Weber, "Grenzhorizont und Klimaschwankungen" ''Abhandl. Naturwiss. Vereins, Bremen''  '''26''' (1926:98-106).&lt;/ref&gt; noticed the sharp boundary horizons, or ''Grenzhorizonte'', in [[Germany|German]] peat, which matched Blytt’s classification. Sernander defined subboreal and subatlantic periods, as well as the late glacial periods. Other scientists have since added other information.

The classification was devised before the development of more accurate dating methods, such as [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14 dating]] and [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s. Currently geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs and [[ice core]] samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt-Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].

The fluctuations of climatic change are more complex than Blytt-Sernander periodizations can identify. For example, recent peat [[core sample]]s at [[Roskilde Fjord]] and also [[Lake Kornerup]] in [[Denmark]] identified 40 to 62 distinguishable layers of [[pollen]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, no universally accepted replacement model has been proposed.

==Problems==

===Dating and calibration===
Today the Blytt-Sernander sequence has been substantiated by a wide variety of scientific dating methods, mainly [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates obtained from peat. Earlier radiocarbon dates were often left uncalibrated; that is, they were derived by assuming a constant concentration of atmospheric radiocarbon. In fact the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration has varied over time and thus radiocarbon dates need to be [[Radiocarbon dating|calibrated]].

===Cross-discipline correlation===
The Blytt-Sernander classification has been used as a temporal framework for the [[archaeology|archaeological cultures]] of [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. Some have gone so far as to identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There is no reason, for example, why the north [[Europe]]ans should stop using [[bronze]] and start using [[iron]] abruptly at the lower boundary of the [[Subatlantic]] at 600 BC. In the warm [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] period, [[Denmark]] was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] cultures, rather than [[Neolithic]], notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.

==Sequence==
The [[Pleistocene]] phases and approximate calibrated dates (see above) are:
* [[Older Dryas]] stadial, 14,000–13,600 BP ([[Before Present]])
* [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] interstadial, 13,600–12,900 BP
* [[Younger Dryas]] stadial, 12,900–11,640 BP

The [[Holocene]] phases are:
* [[Preboreal]]
* [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]], cool, dry, rising temperature, 11,500–8,900 BP
* [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]], warm, moist, maximum temperature, 8900–5700 BP
* [[Subboreal]], 5700–2600 BP
* [[Subatlantic]], 2600–0 BP

==Marker species==
Some marker plant [[genus|genera]]/[[species]] studied in [[peat]] are
*''[[Sphagnum]]''
*''[[Carex limosa]]''
*''[[Scheuchzeria palustris]]'', Rannock rush
*''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]'', cotton grass
*''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'', bog cranberry
*''[[Andromeda polifolia]]'', bog rosemary
*''[[Erica tetralix]]'', cross-leaved heather
*''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'', heather
*''[[Pine|Pinus]]'', pine
*''[[Birch|Betula]]'', birch

More [[sphagnum]] appears in wet periods. Dry periods feature more tree stumps, of birch and pine.

'''Burned area emergency response''' (BAER) is an emergency [[risk management]] reaction to post [[wildfire]] conditions that pose [[risks]] to human life and property or could further destabilize or degrade the burned lands. Even though [[wildfires]] are natural events, the presence of people and man-made structures in and adjacent to the burned area frequently requires continued emergency risk management actions.  High severity wildfires pose a continuing [[flood]], [[debris flow]] and [[mudflow]] risk to people living within and downstream from a burned watershed as well as a potential loss of desirable watershed values.{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;DeBano, L.F., D.G. Neary and P.F. Ffolliott. 1998. ''Fire’s Effects on Ecosystems''. John Willey &amp; Sons, Inc. New York. 331p {{ISBN|0-471-16356-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The burned area emergency response [[risk management]] process begins during or shortly after wildfire containment with risk assessments evaluating the effects of the wildfire against values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} needing protection.  These risk assessments can range from simple to complex. An organized interdisciplinary team of subject matter experts (e.g.,  hydrologists, soil scientists, botanists, cultural resource specialists, engineers, etc.) used among other assessment tools [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924041322/http://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/agwa/docs/pubs/Goodrich-ASCE-05-AGWA.pdf hydrological modeling] and [http://fire.r9.fws.gov/ifcc/esr/Remote%20Sensing/soil_burnsev_summary_guide042203.pdf soil burn severity mapping] to assess potential flooding and vegetation recovery after the [[Cerro Grande Fire]] in 2000.

A BAER plan is developed based on the risk assessments and burned area land management objectives.  The BAER Plan identifies the most effective treatments to address the identified risks.  Plan implementation timeframes are dictated primarily by anticipated future events (e.g., next significant rainstorm) which also influence treatment options.

== Strategies and treatments ==

Burned area emergency response has mostly concentrated on risk reduction treatments with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Beyers, J.L.; Neary D.G. 2000. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Postfire Rehabilitation Treatments. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-63. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, [[Rocky Mountain Research Station]]. 85 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk avoidance, transfer and retention treatments are integral in the burned area emergency response risk management process.

=== Risk reduction ===

[[Disaster Risk Reduction|Risk reduction]] treatments are designed to protect human life and safety and reduce flood severity, soil erosion and prevent the establishment of non-native plants.  On 10 wildfires studied in Colorado, rainfall amount and intensity followed by bare mineral soil explained 63% of soil erosion variation.&lt;ref&gt;Pietraszek, J.H. 2006. Controls on post-fire erosion at the hillslope scale, Colorado, M.S. Thesis. Colorado State Univ. Ft. Collins Co. 124p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the risk of flooding, debris flows and mudflows are significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensities and burn severity and that some risk reduction treatments help for low but not high intensity rainfall events.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006"&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Elliot, W.J. 2006. Protection from erosion following wildfire. Written for presentation at the 2006 ASABE Annual International Meeting. Sponsored by ASABE, Portland Convention Center, Portland, OR. 9–12 July 2006. ASABE Paper No. 068009. American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001a. Hydrologic and Sedimentologic Response of Two Burned Watersheds in Colorado. U. S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 01-4122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mulch]]es, erosion cloth and seeding retard overland flow and protect soil from rain drop impact and increase soil moisture holding capacity. [[Landscape]] structures (e.g., log erosion barriers, contour trenches, straw [[wikt:wattle|wattles]]) trap sediment and prevent slope rilling. Strip tillage and chemicals break up or reduce [[hydrophobic soils]] and improve infiltration.  Wood and straw mulch reduced erosion rates by 60 to 80%, contour-felled log erosion barriers 50 to 70%, [[hydromulch]] 19% and [[post fire seeding]] had little effect the first year when rainfall events were small and intensities low.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006" /&gt;

In stream flood control treatments slow, delay, redistribute, or redirect water, mud and debris. Straw bale check [[dams]], silt screens and debris [[retention basin]]s slow water flow and trap sediment. Riparian vegetation stabilizes streambanks. Roads and culverts are armored and debris removed as needed. Water diversion implements protect facilities and property.

The chance of introducing new invasive plants to the burned area is reduced by restricting access or thoroughly cleaning all equipment, people and animals of seeds before entering a burned area. Research has shown that non-native plant cover is positively associated with post-wildfire seeded grass cover. Even though post-wildfire seeding operations require seed mix purity standards and the number of contaminated seeds may be small on a percentage based, that the application of very large amounts of seed (thousands of pounds) ensures that a significant number of non-native plant seeds will be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter M.E., P.N. Omi, E.J. Martinson and G.W. Chong. 2006. Establishment of non-native plant species after wildfires: effects of fuel treatment, abiotic and biotic factors, and post-fire grass seeding treatments. International journal of Wildland Fire 15:771-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk avoidance ===

Avoidance treatments remove values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk from risk prone areas. Frequently homes and other values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} are located on [[alluvial fan]]s at the base of watersheds. The presence of the alluvial fans indicates a history of significant flooding, debris flows and mudflows with potential personal and property damage potential. Mobile property is temporally or permanently relocated. [[emergency evacuation|Evacuation]] planning and [[early warning system]]s are frequently used to protect people at risk.  Flood peaks increase more rapidly with increases in rainfall intensity above a threshold value for the maximum 30 min intensity of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mm per hour.  That this rainfall intensity could be used to set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early warning flood system after wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001b. Post-fire, rainfall intensity-peak discharge relations for three mountainous watersheds in the western USA. Hydrological Processes, 15(15):2981-2993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk transfer ===

Often it is not feasible to avoid or reduce risks. [[Flood insurance]] is a means of transferring risk to another party for values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} with insurable value.

=== Risk retention ===

Accepting the risk is an option when values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk are small and inevitable or when the risks cannot be reduced, avoided or transferred (i.e., infrequent catastrophic events).

A '''chatter mark''' is  one  or, more commonly, a series of wedge shaped marks left by chipping of a [[bedrock]] surface by rock fragments carried in the base of a [[glacier]] ([[glacial plucking]]).  Marks tend to be crescent-shaped and oriented at right angles to the direction of ice movement.&lt;ref name = EG&gt;Marshak, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Dictionary of Geological Terms, Third Edition (1984). [http://www.agiweb.org/pubs/pubdetail.html?item=300260 [[American Geological Institute]] Publications]. Robert L. Bates and Julia A. Jackson, Editors&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three different types of chatter marks. The crescentic gouge is an upstream concave that is made by the removal of a piece of rock. The crescentic fracture which is a downstream concave that is also made by the removal of rock. The lunate fracture is also a downstream concave made without the removal of rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107979/chatter-mark Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cuban dry forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] [[ecoregion]] that occupies {{convert|65800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} on [[Cuba]] and [[Isla de la Juventud]].  The ecoregion receives {{convert|1000|-|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually.  Cuban dry forests can be differentiated into [[evergreen]] forests, semi-[[deciduous]] forests, [[mogote]]s, and [[sclerophyll]]ous low forests.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0213 |name=Cuban dry forests|accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evergreen forests==
Less than 30% of all trees lose their leaves in [[evergreen]] forests, and there are few [[epiphyte]]s or [[liana]]s. It is classified according to [[leaf]] length as being either mesophyllous (leaves {{convert|13|-|26|cm|in|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or microphyllous (leaves {{convert|1|-|6|cm|in|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Mesophyllous forest occurs at elevations from sea level to {{convert|400|m|ft}} or {{convert|400|-|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] reaches a height of {{convert|15|-|25|m|ft}}, while certain trees such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] emerge at {{convert|25|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The upper layer of trees in [[Sierra del Rosario]] includes aguacatillo (''[[Alchornea]] [[Alchornea latifolia|latifolia]]''), ocuje (''[[Calophyllum antillanum]]''), jocuma (''[[Sideroxylon foetidissimum]]'') and macurije (''[[Matayba]] [[Matayba oppositifolia|oppositifolia]]''). Yaya (''[[Oxandra]] [[Oxandra lanceolata|lanceolata]]''), ''[[Wallenia]] [[Wallenia laurifolia|laurifolia]]'', ramón de caballo (''[[Trophis]] [[Trophis racemosa|racemosa]]'') and ''[[Ficus]]'' species grow in the lower layer. Microphyllous evergreen forest establishes itself over coastal [[limestone]]. It has evergreen and deciduous trees that reach a height of {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft}} or {{convert|12|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, some thorny shrubs, arborescent [[Cactus|cacti]], other succulents, epiphytes and dry lianas. Trees include júcaro espinoso (''[[Bucida]] [[Bucida molinetii|molinetii]]''), cúrbana (''[[Canella|Canella winterana]]''), guayacán negro (''[[Guaiacum sanctum]]''), yaití (''[[Gymnanthes lucida]]''), cerillo (''[[Hypelate]] trifoliata''), soplillo (''[[Lysiloma latisiliquum]]''), guao de costa (''[[Metopium toxiferum]]''), almácigo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), caguairán amarillo (''[[Hymenaea torrei]]''), uvillón (''[[Coccoloba diversifolia]]''), and miraguanos (''[[Coccothrinax]]'' spp.).  Tuna (''[[Opuntia stricta]]'') is an important [[understory]] species.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Semi-deciduous forests==
About half of the trees in semi-[[deciduous]] forests are [[evergreen]], along with [[shrub]]s, [[epiphyte]]s, a few [[herbaceous plant]]s, and many [[vine]]s. Trees in this type of forest are often mesophyllous, with leaves {{convert|13|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The canopy in forests with consistent moisture reaches a height of {{convert|15|-|20|m|abbr=on}} and may have emergent species up to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high as well as {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Arecaceae|palms]]. The lower arboreal story includes deciduous and [[sclerophyll]]ous evergreen trees. [[Soil]]s are either red [[rendzina]]s, black rendzinas, or [[Brown earth|brown soils]]. Trees grow rapidly due to heavy rainfall during the summer. The upper layer of trees includes almácigo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), cedro-cheiroso (''[[Cedrela odorata]]''), dagame (''[[Calophyllum]] [[Calophyllum candidissimum|candidissimum]]''), ceiba (''[[Ceiba pentandra]]''), baría (''[[Cordia]] [[Cordia gerascanthus|gerascanthus]]''), ateje (''[[Cordia collococca|C. collococca]]''), cuyá (''[[Dipholis salicifolia]]''), caoba (''[[Swietenia mahagoni]]''), ayúa (''[[Zanthoxylum]] [[Zanthoxylum martinicense|martinicense]]''), guasiriano (''[[Celtis]] [[Celtis trinervia|trinervia]]'') and palma real (''[[Roystonea regia]]''). The lower layer includes jía (''[[Casearia]] [[Casearia hirsuta|hirsuta]]''), guara (''[[Cupania]] [[Cupania americana|americana]]''), yamagua (''[[Guarea]] [[Guarea trichiloides|trichiloides]]''), yaya (''[[Oxandra]] lanceolata'') and siguaraya (''[[Trichilia]] [[Trichilia havanensis|havanensis]]''). Forests with fluctuating moisture have an {{convert|8|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} canopy, an [[understory]] of microphyllous and thorny deciduous species, and a forest floor covered in herbaceous [[Storage organ|geophyte]]s.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Mogotes==

[[Mogote]]s are conical mountains composed of [[karst]]ic [[limestone]] and are found in western Cuba.  Forests found on mogotes are characterized by a discontinuous story of trees {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, as well as [[Arecaceae|palms]], plentiful [[succulent]]s, [[epiphyte]]s, and [[lianas]]. Plant life includes palma barrigona de sierra (''[[Gaussia princeps (plant)|Gaussia princeps]]''), guanito de sierra (''[[Thrinax morrisii]]''), roble (''[[Tabebuia]] [[Tabebuia calcicola|calcicola]]''), piñón (''[[Erythrina]] [[Erythrina cubensis|cubensis]]''), ''[[Malpighia]] [[Malpighia roigiana|roigiana]]'', palma corcho (''[[Microcycas|Microcycas calocoma]]''), ''[[Lantana]] [[Lantana strigosa|strigosa]]'', ''[[Agave]]'' spp., and ''[[Leptocereus]]'' spp. The vegetation on rock faces is bushy and very open and includes shrubs and trees with specially adapted roots, such as the endemic ceibón (''[[Pachira]] [[Pachira emarginata|emarginata]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Sclerophyllous low forests==

[[Sclerophyll]]ous low forests are found growing on [[serpentine soil]]s and represent the transition between the dry forests and [[Cuban cactus scrub|xeric scrublands]]. This is subdivided into charrascales (wet sclerophyllous low forests) and cuabales (dry sclerophyllous low forests). Cuabales can reach heights of {{convert|8|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and palms and species with small, hard and very thorny leaves are abundant. Emergent trees can be found. Plant life includes cuabal (''[[Leucocroton]] [[Leucocroton flavicans|flavicans]]''), anón del cuabal (''[[Annona]] [[Annona bullata|bullata]]''), júcaro espinoso (''[[Bucida]] [[Bucida molinetii|molinetii]]''), uverillo (''[[Coccoloba]] [[Coccoloba praecox|praecox]]''), chicharrón (''[[Pseudocarpidium]] wrightii''), palmas jatas (''[[Copernicia]]'' spp.), miraguanos (''[[Coccothrinax]]'' spp.), ''[[Buxus]]'' spp. ''[[Bourreria]]'' spp., robles (''[[Tabebuia]]'' spp.), ''[[Guettarda]]'' spp., ''[[Rhodogeron]] [[Rhodogeron coronopifolius|coronopifolius]]'' and ''[[Agave]] [[Agave cajalbanensis|cajalbanensis]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Fauna==
[[Bird]]s of the dry forests include the [[West Indian woodpecker]] (''Melanerpes superciliaris''), [[Fernandina's flicker]] (''Colaptes fernandinae''), [[Cuban green woodpecker]] (''Xiphidiopicus percussus''), and [[blue-headed quail-dove]] (''Starnoenas cyanocephala''). [[Reptile]]s include [[anole]]s, [[gecko]]s, and the Cuban boa (''[[Epicrates angulifer]]'').  [[Desmarest's hutia]] (''Capromys pilorides'') is a common species of [[mammal]].&lt;ref name="WildWord"&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=nt0213|name=Cuban dry forests|accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diffusion.svg|thumb|right|A diffusion is a process in physics. Some particles are [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] in a glass of water. At first, the particles are all near one top corner of the glass. If the particles randomly move around ("diffuse") in the water, they eventually become distributed randomly and uniformly from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, and organized (diffusion continues, but with no net [[flux]]).]]
[[File:Diffusion v2 20101120.ogv|thumb|Time lapse video of diffusion of a dye dissolved in water into a gel!]]

[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|250px|Diffusion from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. Initially, there are [[solution|solute]] molecules on the left side of a barrier (purple line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container. &lt;u&gt;Top:&lt;/u&gt; A single molecule moves around randomly. &lt;u&gt;Middle:&lt;/u&gt; With more molecules, there is a statistical trend that the solute fills the container more and more uniformly. &lt;u&gt;Bottom:&lt;/u&gt; With an enormous number of solute molecules, all randomness is gone: The solute appears to move smoothly and deterministically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. There is no microscopic [[force]] pushing molecules rightward, but there ''appears'' to be one in the bottom panel. This apparent force is called an ''[[entropic force]]''.]]

[[File: Blausen 0315 Diffusion.png|thumb| Three-dimensional rendering of diffusion of purple dye in water.]]

'''Diffusion''' is the net movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is driven by a gradient in chemical potential of the diffusing species.

A [[gradient]] is the change in the value of a quantity e.g. concentration, [[pressure]], or [[temperature]] with the change in another variable, usually [[distance]]. A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a [[pressure gradient]], and a change in temperature over a distance is called a [[temperature gradient]].

The word '''diffusion''' derives from the [[Latin]] word, ''diffundere'', which means "to spread way out".

A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle [[random walk]], and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of [[advection]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gamble Kirkwood|J.G. Kirkwood]], R.L. Baldwin, P.J. Dunlop, L.J. Gosting, G. Kegeles (1960)[http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1731433 Flow equations and frames of reference for isothermal diffusion in liquids]. The Journal of Chemical Physics 33(5):1505–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term [[convection]] is used to describe the combination of both [[transport phenomena]].

==Diffusion vs. bulk flow==
An example of a situation in which [[Mass flow |bulk motion]] and diffusion can be differentiated is the mechanism by which [[oxygen]] enters the body during [[external respiration]] known as breathing. The [[lungs]] are located in the [[thoracic cavity]], which expands as the first step in external respiration. This expansion leads to an increase in volume of the [[alveoli]] in the lungs, which causes a decrease in pressure in the alveoli. This creates a pressure gradient between the [[air]] outside the body at relatively high pressure and the alveoli at relatively low pressure. The air moves down the pressure gradient through the airways of the lungs and into the alveoli until the pressure of the air and that in the alveoli are equal i.e. the movement of air by bulk flow stops once there is no longer a pressure gradient.

The air arriving in the alveoli has a higher concentration of oxygen than the “stale” air in the alveoli. The increase in oxygen concentration creates a concentration gradient for oxygen between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the [[capillaries]] that surround the alveoli. Oxygen then moves by diffusion, down the concentration gradient, into the blood. The other consequence of the air arriving in alveoli is that the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the alveoli decreases. This creates a concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli, as fresh air has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide compared to the [[blood]] in the body.

The pumping action of the [[heart]] then transports the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure in the ventricle. This creates a pressure gradient between the heart and the capillaries, and blood moves through [[blood vessel]]s by bulk flow down the pressure gradient. As the thoracic cavity contracts during expiration, the volume of the alveoli decreases and creates a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the air outside the body, and air moves by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.

==Diffusion in the context of different disciplines==
[[File:Centrotherm diffusion furnaces at LAAS 0481.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diffusion furnaces used for [[thermal oxidation]]]]
The concept of diffusion is widely used in: [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas and of price values). However, in each case, the object (e.g., atom, idea, etc.) that is undergoing diffusion is “spreading out” from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.

There are two ways to introduce the notion of ''diffusion'': either a [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomenological approach]] starting with [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the ''[[random walk]] of the diffusing particles''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Philibert (2005). [http://ul.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/19504/diff_fund_2%282005%291.pdf One and a half century of diffusion: Fick, Einstein, before and beyond.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213113203/http://www.rz.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |date=2013-12-13 }} Diffusion Fundamentals, 2, 1.1–1.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the phenomenological approach, ''diffusion is the movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration without bulk motion''. According to Fick's laws, the diffusion [[Flux#Flux as flow rate per unit area|flux]] is proportional to the negative [[gradient]] of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Sometime later, various generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of [[thermodynamics]] and [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;S.R. De Groot, P. Mazur (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the ''atomistic point of view'', diffusion is considered as a result of the random walk of the diffusing particles. In [[molecular diffusion]], the moving molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]. The theory of the [[Brownian motion]] and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Einstein |year=1905|url=http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein2.pdf |title=Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|journal=Ann. Phys.|volume= 17|pages= 549–60|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220806|issue=8|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..549E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of diffusion is typically applied to any subject matter involving random walks in [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensembles]] of individuals.

[[biology|Biologists]] often use the terms "net movement"  or "net diffusion" to describe the movement of ions or molecules by diffusion. For example, oxygen can diffuse through cell membranes so long as there is a higher concentration of oxygen outside the cell. However, because the movement of molecules is random, occasionally oxygen molecules move out of the cell (against the concentration gradient). Because there are more oxygen molecules outside the cell, the [[probability]] that oxygen molecules will enter the cell is higher than the probability that oxygen molecules will leave the cell. Therefore, the "net" movement of oxygen molecules (the difference between the number of molecules either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is a ''net movement'' of oxygen molecules down the concentration gradient.

==History of diffusion in physics==
In the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of diffusion was created. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] had previously described the [[cementation process]], which produces steel from the element iron (Fe) through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the diffusion of colors of [[stained glass]] or [[earthenware]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].

In modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was performed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]]. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main phenomenon was described by him in 1831–1833:&lt;ref&gt;''Diffusion Processes'', Thomas Graham Symposium, ed. J.N. Sherwood, A.V. Chadwick, W.M.Muir, F.L. Swinton, Gordon and Breach, London, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse, mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the intimate state of mixture for any length of time.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The measurements of Graham contributed to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] deriving, in 1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air. The error rate is less than 5%.

In 1855, [[Adolf Fick]], the 26-year-old anatomy demonstrator from Zürich, proposed [[Fick's laws of diffusion|his law of diffusion]]. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as "the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element of space". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism that is similar to [[Thermal conduction|Fourier's law for heat conduction]] (1822) and [[Ohm's law]] for electric current (1827).

[[Robert Boyle]] demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Barr (1997), In: ''Diffusion in Materials, DIMAT 96'', ed. H.Mehrer, Chr. Herzig, N.A. Stolwijk, H. Bracht, Scitec Publications, Vol.1, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; by penetration of zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was not systematically studied until the second part of the 19th century. [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen]], the well-known British metallurgist and former assistant of Thomas Graham studied systematically solid state diffusion on the example of gold in lead in 1896. :&lt;ref name="Mehrer2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. Mehrer |author2=N.A. Stolwijk |year=2009|url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/pdf/volume11/diff_fund_11(2009)1.pdf |title=Heroes and Highlights in the History of Diffusion|journal= Diffusion Fundamentals|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages= 1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... My long connection with Graham's researches made it almost a duty to attempt to extend his work on liquid diffusion to metals."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1858, [[Rudolf Clausius]] introduced the concept of the [[mean free path]]. In the same year, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed the first atomistic theory of transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and [[Brownian motion]] was developed by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Perrin]]. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the development of the atomistic backgrounds of the macroscopic [[transport phenomena|transport processes]], introduced the [[Boltzmann equation]], which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCowling"&gt;S. Chapman, T. G. Cowling (1970) ''The Mathematical Theory of Non-uniform Gases: An Account of the Kinetic Theory of Viscosity, Thermal Conduction and Diffusion in Gases'', Cambridge University Press (3rd edition), {{ISBN|052140844X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920–1921, [[George de Hevesy]] measured [[self-diffusion]] using [[radioisotope]]s. He studied self-diffusion of radioactive isotopes of lead in the liquid and solid lead.

[[Yakov Frenkel]] (sometimes, Jakov/Jacob Frenkel) proposed, and elaborated in 1926, the idea of diffusion in crystals through local defects (vacancies and [[interstitial defect|interstitial]] atoms). He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants from experimental data.

Sometime later, [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Walter H. Schottky]] developed Frenkel's ideas about mechanisms of diffusion further. Presently, it is universally recognized that atomic defects are necessary to mediate diffusion in crystals.&lt;ref name="Mehrer2009"/&gt;

[[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]], with co-authors, applied his theory of [[Transition state theory|absolute reaction rates]] to Frenkel's quasichemical model of diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.F.

&lt;!--==Qualitative description==
{{under construction}}
Diffusion is the consequence of the random movement of particles. A [[molecule]] or [[ion]] with [[kinetic energy]] (explain) collides with other molecules and ions, and each collision alters the kinetic energy and [[momentum]] of both particles. Unless the particles are bound in position in a solid, they are free to move away from each other until the next collision. Therefore, in a fluid all the particles move from collision to collision, changing direction with each collision. The path of any given particle is random, so the probability of it returning to a previous position is lower than of going somewhere else since there are so many more other places to go. If the fluid is in a container, any collision with the solid container sends it back into the volume of the fluid. The rate at which a given particle moves away from its original position depends on how fast it moves on average, which depends on the temperature, and how often it collides with other particles, which in turn depends on how far apart they are on average. The particles of a gas are much further apart than the particles of a liquid, so a gas molecule or ion generally goes further before colliding and changing direction each time, so it moves away from any given point more quickly, assuming equal velocities.

When all particles start out evenly mixed, there is no noticeable difference over time, and they stay evenly mixed. However, if there is a region where most of the particles are of one type at a given time, they tend to disperse until evenly distributed.

== Basic models of diffusion ==

=== Diffusion flux ===
Each model of diffusion expresses the '''diffusion flux''' through concentrations, densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;. The transfer of a [[physical quantity]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; through a small [[area]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; with normal &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; per time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta N = (\mathbf{J},\nu) \,\Delta S \,\Delta t +o(\Delta S \,\Delta t)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{J},\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inner product]] and &lt;math&gt;o(\cdots)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[little-o notation]].
If we use the notation of [[vector area]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{S}=\nu \, \Delta S&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta N = (\mathbf{J}, \Delta \mathbf{S}) \, \Delta t +o(\Delta \mathbf{S} \,\Delta t)\, . &lt;/math&gt;
The [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] of the diffusion flux is [flux]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[quantity]/([time]·[area]).
The diffusing physical quantity &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; may be the number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar [[extensive quantity]]. For its density, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the diffusion equation has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}= - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} +W \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is intensity of any local source of this quantity (the rate of a chemical reaction, for example).
For the diffusion equation, the '''no-flux boundary conditions''' can be formulated as &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{J}(x),\nu(x))=0&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the normal to the boundary at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Fick's law and equations ===
{{Main article|Fick's laws of diffusion}}

Fick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}=-D \,\nabla n \ , \;\; J_i=-D \frac{\partial n}{\partial x_i} \ .&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n(x,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot( D \,\nabla n(x,t))=D \, \Delta n(x,t)\ , &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta n(x,t) = \sum_i \frac{\partial^2 n(x,t)}{\partial x_i^2} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion ===
Fick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small. The driving force of diffusion in Fick's law is the antigradient of concentration, &lt;math&gt;-\nabla n&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1931, [[Lars Onsager]]&lt;ref name = "Onsager1931"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Onsager, L. |year=1931|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.405|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes. I|journal=Physical Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=405–26|bibcode = 1931PhRv...37..405O }}&lt;/ref&gt; included the multicomponent transport processes in the general context of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For
multi-component transport,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_i=\sum_j L_{ij} X_j \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the flux of the ''i''th physical quantity (component) and &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic force]].

The thermodynamic forces for the transport processes were introduced by Onsager as the space gradients of the derivatives of the [[entropy]] density ''s'' (he used the term "force" in quotation marks or "driving force"):
:&lt;math&gt;X_i= \operatorname{grad} \frac {\partial s(n)}{\partial n_i}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; are the "thermodynamic coordinates".
For the heat and mass transfer one can take &lt;math&gt;n_0=u&lt;/math&gt; (the density of internal energy) and &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the ''i''th component. The corresponding driving forces are the space vectors
: &lt;math&gt;X_0= \operatorname{grad} \frac{1}{T}\ , \;\;\; X_i= - \operatorname{grad} \frac{\mu_i}{T} \; (i &gt;0) ,&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}s = \frac{1}{T} \,\mathrm{d}u-\sum_{i \geq 1} \frac{\mu_i}{T} \, {\rm d} n_i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the absolute temperature and &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the chemical potential of the ''i''th component. It should be stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and for small gradients.

For the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the linear approximation near equilibrium:
:&lt;math&gt;X_i= \sum_{k \geq 0} \left.\frac{\partial^2 s(n)}{\partial n_i \, \partial n_k}\right|_{n=n^*} \operatorname{grad} n_k \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the derivatives of ''s'' are calculated at equilibrium ''n''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.
The matrix of the ''kinetic coefficients'' &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; should be symmetric ([[Onsager reciprocal relations]]) and [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] ([[Second law of thermodynamics|for the entropy growth]]).

The transport equations are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial t}= - \operatorname{div} \mathbf{J}_i =- \sum_{j\geq 0} L_{ij}\operatorname{div} X_j = \sum_{k\geq 0} \left[-\sum_{j\geq 0} L_{ij} \left.\frac{\partial^2 s(n)}{\partial n_j \, \partial n_k}\right|_{n=n^*}\right] \, \Delta n_k\ .&lt;/math&gt;
Here, all the indexes ''i, j, k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;... are related to the internal energy (0) and various components. The expression in the square brackets is the matrix &lt;math&gt;D_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;of the diffusion (''i,k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), thermodiffusion (''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and [[thermal conductivity]] (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) coefficients.

Under [[Isothermal process|isothermal conditions]] ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;constant. The relevant thermodynamic potential is the free energy (or the [[free entropy]]). The thermodynamic driving forces for the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials, &lt;math&gt;-(1/T)\,\nabla\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;, and the matrix of diffusion coefficients is
:&lt;math&gt;D_{ik}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j\geq 1} L_{ij} \left.\frac{\partial \mu_j(n,T)} { \partial n_k}\right|_{n=n^*}&lt;/math&gt;
(''i,k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0).

There is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only their combinations &lt;math&gt;\sum_j L_{ij}X_j&lt;/math&gt; can be measured. For example, in the original work of Onsager&lt;ref name = "Onsager1931"/&gt; the thermodynamic forces include additional multiplier ''T'', whereas in the [[Course of Theoretical Physics]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D. Landau]], [[Evgeny Lifshitz|E.M. Lifshitz]]
 |year=1980

 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]
 |isbn=978-0-7506-3372-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; this multiplier is omitted but the sign of the thermodynamic forces is opposite. All these changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and do not affect the measurable quantities.

=== Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear ===
The formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the systems of linear diffusion equations in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t} = \sum_j D_{ij} \, \Delta c_j.&lt;/math&gt;
If the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal, then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal, for example, &lt;math&gt;D_{12} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the state with &lt;math&gt;c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;. At this state, &lt;math&gt;\partial c_2 / \partial t = D_{12} \, \Delta c_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;D_{12} \, \Delta c_1(x) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; at some points, then &lt;math&gt;c_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes negative at these points in a short time. Therefore, linear non-diagonal diffusion does not preserve positivity of concentrations. Non-diagonal equations of multicomponent diffusion must be non-linear.&lt;ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/&gt;

=== Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula ===
The [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)]] connects the diffusion coefficient and the mobility (the ratio of the particle's terminal [[drift velocity]] to an applied [[force]])&lt;ref&gt;S. Bromberg, K.A. Dill (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hdeODhjp1bUC&amp;pg=PA327 Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Chemistry and Biology], Garland Science, {{ISBN|0815320515}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D = \mu \, k_\text{B} T, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''D'' is the [[Fick's law of diffusion|diffusion constant]], ''μ'' is the "mobility", ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]].

Below, to combine in the same formula the chemical potential ''μ'' and the mobility, we use for mobility the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

The mobility—based approach was further applied by T. Teorell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Teorell|pmc=1076553|pmid=16587950|year=1935|title=Studies on the "Diffusion Effect" upon Ionic Distribution. Some Theoretical Considerations|volume=21|issue=3|pages=152–61|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 1935PNAS...21..152T |doi = 10.1073/pnas.21.3.152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he studied the diffusion of ions through a membrane. He formulated the essence of his approach in the formula:
:'''the flux is equal to mobility × concentration × force per gram-ion'''.
This is the so-called ''Teorell formula''. The term "gram-ion" ("gram-particle")  is used for a quantity of a substance that contains [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]] of ions (particles). The common modern term is [[Mole (unit)|mole]].

The force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:
# Diffusion force caused by concentration gradient: &lt;math&gt;-RT \frac{1}{n} \, \nabla n = -RT \, \nabla (\ln(n/n^\text{eq}))&lt;/math&gt;.
# Electrostatic force caused by electric potential gradient: &lt;math&gt;q \, \nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''R'' is the gas constant, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, ''n'' is the concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript "eq", ''q'' is the charge and ''φ'' is the electric potential.

The simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the Einstein–Teorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate this simple and physically obvious rule.

The general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under isothermal conditions is&lt;ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathfrak{m} \exp\left(\frac{\mu - \mu_0}{RT}\right)(-\nabla \mu + (\text{external force per mole})),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard value of the chemical potential.
The expression &lt;math&gt;a = \exp\left(\frac{\mu - \mu_0}{RT}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. It measures the "effective concentration" of a species in a non-ideal mixture. In this notation, the Teorell formula for the flux has a very simple form&lt;ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathfrak{m} a (-\nabla \mu + (\text{external force per mole})).&lt;/math&gt;
The standard derivation of the activity includes a normalization factor and for small concentrations &lt;math&gt;a = n/n^\ominus + o(n/n^\ominus)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n^\ominus&lt;/math&gt; is the standard concentration. Therefore, this formula for the flux describes the flux of the normalized dimensionless quantity &lt;math&gt;n/n^\ominus&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial (n/n^\ominus)}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot [\mathfrak{m} a (\nabla \mu - (\text{external force per mole}))].&lt;/math&gt;

==== Teorell formula for multicomponent diffusion ====
The Teorell formula with combination of Onsager's definition of the diffusion force gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_i = \mathfrak{m_i} a_i \sum_j L_{ij} X_j,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility of the ''i''th component, &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is its activity, &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the coefficients, &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; is the thermodynamic diffusion force, &lt;math&gt;X_j= -\nabla \frac{\mu_j}{T}&lt;/math&gt;. For the isothermal perfect systems, &lt;math&gt;X_j = - R \frac{\nabla n_j}{n_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the Einstein–Teorell approach gives the following multicomponent generalization of the Fick's law for multicomponent diffusion:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial t} = \sum_j \nabla \cdot \left(D_{ij}\frac{n_i}{n_j} \nabla n_j\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of coefficients. The [[Diffusion#The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation|Chapman–Enskog formulas for diffusion in gases]] include exactly the same terms. Earlier, such terms were introduced in the [[Maxwell–Stefan diffusion]] equation.

=== Jumps on the surface and in solids ===
[[File:Chemical surface diffusion slow.gif|thumb|300px|Diffusion in the monolayer: oscillations near temporary equilibrium positions and jumps to the nearest free places.]]

[[Surface diffusion|Diffusion of reagents on the surface]] of a [[catalyst]] may play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis. The model of diffusion in the ideal monolayer is based on the jumps of the reagents on the nearest free places. This model was used for CO on Pt oxidation under low gas pressure.

The system includes several reagents &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_m&lt;/math&gt; on the surface. Their surface concentrations are &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\ldots, c_m.&lt;/math&gt; The surface is a lattice of the adsorption places. Each
reagent molecule fills a place on the surface. Some of the places are free. The concentration of the free places is &lt;math&gt;z=c_0&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of all &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; (including free places) is constant, the density of adsorption places ''b''.

The jump model gives for the diffusion flux of &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_i=-D_i[z \, \nabla c_i - c_i \nabla z]\, . &lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding diffusion equation is:&lt;ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t}=- \operatorname{div}\mathbf{J}_i=D_i[z \, \Delta c_i - c_i \, \Delta z] \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the conservation law, &lt;math&gt;z=b-\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \, ,&lt;/math&gt; and we
have the system of ''m'' diffusion equations. For one component we get Fick's law and linear equations because &lt;math&gt;(b-c) \,\nabla c- c\,\nabla(b-c) = b\,\nabla c&lt;/math&gt;. For two and more components the equations are nonlinear.

If all particles can exchange their positions with their closest neighbours then a simple generalization gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_i=-\sum_j D_{ij}[c_j \,\nabla c_i - c_i \,\nabla c_j]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t}=\sum_j D_{ij}[c_j \, \Delta c_i - c_i \,\Delta c_j]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D_{ij} = D_{ji} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix of coefficients that characterize the intensities of jumps. The free places (vacancies) should be considered as special "particles" with concentration &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Various versions of these jump models are also suitable for simple diffusion mechanisms in solids.

=== Diffusion in porous media ===
For diffusion in porous media the basic equations are:&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Vázquez (2006), The Porous Medium Equation. Mathematical Theory, Oxford Univ. Press, {{ISBN|0198569033}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}=- D \,\nabla n^m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = D \, \Delta n^m \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D'' is the diffusion coefficient, ''n'' is the concentration, ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 (usually ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the case ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 corresponds to Fick's law).

For diffusion of gases in porous media this equation is the formalisation of [[Darcy's law]]: the velocity of a gas in the porous media is
:&lt;math&gt;v=-\frac{k}{\mu}\,\nabla p&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[Permeation|permeability]] of the medium, ''μ'' is the [[viscosity]] and ''p'' is the pressure. The flux ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''nv'' and for &lt;math&gt;p \sim n^\gamma&lt;/math&gt; Darcy's law gives the equation of diffusion in porous media with ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''γ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

For underground water infiltration, the [[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]] gives the same equation with&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

For plasma with the high level of radiation, the [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Zeldovich]]–Raizer equation gives ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;4 for the heat transfer.
&lt;!--
As we know that in porous media there are pores as well as solid material existing to gather all the way along the spacial dimensions of the porous media. So, there exist a combination of diffusion mechanisms in poroous media. To understand this, lets consider the example of ceramic membranes. when a gas enters into a ceramic membrane it undergoes the molecular diffusion when moving through the material of the porous media and knudsen diffusion ( if the diameter of pore is less than the length of the pore) and molecular difussion ( can be self diffusion or mutual diffusion depending on the number of species being diffused) in series when moving in the pores. while moving in the pore the poiseuille diffusion also happens in parrllel with knudsen and molecular diffusion. Depending on the nature of material and operating conditions one or more types of diffusion may not be aplicable be small and can be neglected but basic phenomenon is the same. for more information see &lt;M. Coroneo, G.Montante, M.GiacintiBaschetti, A.Paglianti, CFD modelling of inorganic membrane modules for gas mixture separation, Chemical EngineeringScience64(2009)1085–94--&gt;

The diffusion coefficient &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient in the [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's first law]] &lt;math&gt;J=- D \, \partial n/\partial x &lt;/math&gt;, where ''J'' is the diffusion flux ([[amount of substance]]) per unit area per unit time, ''n'' (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration, ''x'' is the position [length].

Let us consider two gases with molecules of the same diameter ''d'' and mass ''m'' ([[self-diffusion]]). In this case, the elementary mean free path theory of diffusion gives for the diffusion coefficient

:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{1}{3} \ell v_T = \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{k_{\rm B}^3}{\pi^3 m}} \frac{T^{3/2}}{Pd^2}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''P'' is the [[pressure]], &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean free path]], and ''v&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mean thermal speed:
:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{\sqrt 2 \pi d^2 P}\, , \;\;\; v_T=\sqrt{\frac{8k_{\rm B}T}{\pi m}}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
We can see that the diffusion coefficient in the mean free path approximation grows with ''T'' as ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; and decreases with ''P'' as 1/''P''. If we use for ''P'' the [[ideal gas law]] ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''RnT'' with the total concentration ''n'', then we can see that for given concentration ''n'' the diffusion coefficient grows with ''T'' as ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; and for given temperature it decreases with the total concentration as&amp;nbsp;1/''n''.

For two different gases, A and B, with molecular masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and molecular diameters ''d''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, the mean free path estimate of the diffusion coefficient of A in B and B in A is:
: &lt;math&gt;D_{\rm AB}=\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{k_{\rm B}^3}{\pi^3}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2m_{\rm A}}+\frac{1}{2m_{\rm B}}}\frac{4T^{3/2}}{P(d_{\rm A}+d_{\rm B})^2}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

=== The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation ===
In Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own distribution function, &lt;math&gt;f_i(x,c,t)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is the time moment, ''x'' is position and ''c'' is velocity of molecule of the ''i''th component of the mixture. Each component has its mean velocity &lt;math&gt;C_i(x,t)=\frac{1}{n_i}\int_c c f(x,c,t) \, dc&lt;/math&gt;. If the velocities &lt;math&gt;C_i(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; do not coincide then there exists ''diffusion''.

In the [[Chapman–Enskog theory|Chapman–Enskog]] approximation, all the distribution functions are expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:&lt;ref name="ChapmanCowling"/&gt;
* individual concentrations of particles, &lt;math&gt;n_i(x,t)=\int_c f_i(x,c,t)\, dc&lt;/math&gt; (particles per volume),
* density of momentum &lt;math&gt;\sum_i m_i n_i C_i(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; (''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''i''th particle mass),
* density of kinetic energy
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_i \left( n_i\frac{m_i C^2_i(x,t)}{2} + \int_c \frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\, dc \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The kinetic temperature ''T'' and pressure ''P'' are defined in 3D space as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B} T=\frac{1}{n} \int_c \frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\, dc; \quad P=k_{\rm B}nT,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n=\sum_i n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total density.

For two gases, the difference between velocities, &lt;math&gt;C_1-C_2&lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:&lt;ref name="ChapmanCowling"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;C_1-C_2=-\frac{n^2}{n_1n_2}D_{12}\left\{ \nabla \left(\frac{n_1}{n} \right)+ \frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}{P n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\nabla P- \frac{m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)+k_T \frac{1}{T}\nabla T\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the force applied to the molecules of the ''i''th component and &lt;math&gt;k_T&lt;/math&gt; is the thermodiffusion ratio.

The coefficient ''D''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is positive. This is the diffusion coefficient. Four terms in the formula for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; describe four main effects in the diffusion of gases:
# &lt;math&gt;\nabla \,\left(\frac{n_1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; describes the flux of the first component from the areas with the high ratio ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' to the areas with lower values of this ratio (and, analogously the flux of the second component from high ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' to low ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' because ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'');
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}{n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\nabla P&lt;/math&gt; describes the flux of the heavier molecules to the areas with higher pressure and the lighter molecules to the areas with lower pressure, this is [[barodiffusion]];
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)&lt;/math&gt; describes diffusion caused by the difference of the forces applied to molecules of different types. For example, in the Earth's gravitational field, the heavier molecules should go down, or in electric field the charged molecules should move, until this effect is not equilibrated by the sum of other terms. This effect should not be confused with barodiffusion caused by the pressure gradient.
# &lt;math&gt;k_T \frac{1}{T}\nabla T&lt;/math&gt; describes [[thermodiffusion]], the diffusion flux caused by the temperature gradient.

All these effects are called ''diffusion'' because they describe the differences between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these effects cannot be described as a ''bulk'' transport and differ from advection or convection.

In the first approximation,&lt;ref name="ChapmanCowling"/&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;D_{12}=\frac{3}{2n(d_1+d_2)^2}\left[\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\pi m_1m_2} \right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; for rigid spheres;
* &lt;math&gt;D_{12}=\frac{3}{8nA_1({\nu})\Gamma(3-\frac{2}{\nu-1})} \left[\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\pi m_1m_2}\right]^{1/2} \left(\frac{2kT}{\kappa_{12}} \right)^{\frac{2}{\nu-1}}&lt;/math&gt; for repulsing force &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{12}r^{-\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;
The number &lt;math&gt;A_1({\nu})&lt;/math&gt; is defined by quadratures (formulas (3.7), (3.9), Ch. 10 of the classical Chapman and Cowling book&lt;ref name="ChapmanCowling"/&gt;)

We can see that the dependence on ''T'' for the rigid spheres is the same as for the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent is different. Dependence on a total concentration ''n'' for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/''n''.

In applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity ''V'' is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{\sum_i \rho_i C_i} \rho \, .&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho_i =m_i n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass concentration of the ''i''th species, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sum_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density.

By definition, the diffusion velocity of the ''i''th component is &lt;math&gt;v_i=C_i-V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_i \rho_i v_i=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The mass transfer of the ''i''th component is described by the [[continuity equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho_i}{\partial t}+\nabla(\rho_i V) + \nabla (\rho_i v_i) = W_i \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions, &lt;math&gt;\sum_i W_i= 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In these equations, the term &lt;math&gt;\nabla(\rho_i V)&lt;/math&gt; describes advection of the ''i''th component and the term &lt;math&gt;\nabla (\rho_i v_i)&lt;/math&gt; represents diffusion of this component.

In 1948, [[Wendell H. Furry]] proposed to use the ''form'' of the diffusion rates found in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to diffusion in gases. This approach was developed further by F.A. Williams and S.H. Lam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. H. Lam |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~lam/MultiComp.pdf|title=Multicomponent diffusion revisited|doi=10.1063/1.2221312|year=2006|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=18|issue=7|page=073101|bibcode = 2006PhFl...18g3101L }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the diffusion velocities in multicomponent gases (''N'' components) they used
:&lt;math&gt;v_i=-\left(\sum_{j=1}^N D_{ij}\mathbf{d}_j + D_i^{(T)} \, \nabla (\ln T) \right)\, ;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_j=\nabla X_j + (X_j-Y_j)\,\nabla (\ln P) + \mathbf{g}_j\, ;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_j=\frac{\rho}{P} \left( Y_j \sum_{k=1}^N Y_k (f_k-f_j) \right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;D_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient matrix, &lt;math&gt;D_i^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal diffusion coefficient, &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the body force per unite mass acting on the ''i''th species, &lt;math&gt;X_i=P_i/P&lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure fraction of the ''i''th species (and &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure), &lt;math&gt;Y_i=\rho_i/\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass fraction of the ''i''th species, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_i X_i=\sum_i Y_i=1.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:diffusion center.gif|thumb|350px|right|As carriers are generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) due to light shining at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor, they diffuse towards two ends. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.]]

=== Diffusion of electrons in solids ===

{{main article|Diffusion current}}
When the density of electrons in solids is not in equilibrium, diffusion of electrons occurs. For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of semiconductor, or a light shines on one end (see right figure), electron diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends), forming a gradient of electron density. This process generates current, referred to as [[diffusion current]].

Diffusion current can also be described by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's first law]]
:&lt;math&gt;J=- D \, \partial n/\partial x\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''J'' is the diffusion current density ([[amount of substance]]) per unit area per unit time, ''n'' (for ideal mixtures) is the electron density, ''x'' is the position [length].

=== Diffusion in geophysics ===
Analytical and numerical models that solve the diffusion equation for different initial and boundary conditions have been popular for studying a wide variety of changes to the Earth's surface. Diffusion has been used extensively in erosion studies of hillslope retreat, bluff erosion, fault scarp degradation, wave-cut terrace/shoreline retreat, alluvial channel incision, coastal shelf retreat, and delta progradation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S.|last3=Hilgartner|first3=William B.|date=2001-04-01|title=Impact of historic land-use change on sediment delivery to a Chesapeake Bay subestuarine delta|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.189/abstract|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=409–27|doi=10.1002/esp.189|issn=1096-9837|bibcode=2001ESPL...26..409P}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the Earth's surface is not literally diffusing in many of these cases, the process of diffusion effectively mimics the holistic changes that occur over decades to millennia. Diffusion models may also be used to solve inverse boundary value problems in which some information about the depositional environment is known from paleoenvironmental reconstruction and the diffusion equation is used to figure out the sediment influx and time series of landform changes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-modeling/|author= Gregory B.

==Random walk (random motion)==
[[File:Random motion.webm|thumb|The apparent random motion of atoms, ions or molecules explained. Substances appear to move randomly due to collisions with other substances. From the iBook "Cell Membrane Transport", free license granted by IS3D, LLC, 2014.]] One common misconception is that individual atoms, ions or molecules move randomly, which they do not. In the animation on the right, the ion on in the left panel has a “random” motion, but this motion is not random as it is the result of “collisions” with other ions. As such, the movement of a single atom, ion, or molecule within a mixture just appears random when viewed in isolation. The movement of a substance within a mixture by “random walk” is governed by the kinetic energy within the system that can be affected by changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.

=== Separation of diffusion from convection in gases ===
While Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions. Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.

Under normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another [[transport phenomena|transport phenomenon]], [[convection]], and to study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.

Therefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are ''wrong'': If cologne is sprayed in one place, it can soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion persists in the room because of the temperature [inhomogeneity]. If ink is dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in particular, by this dropping).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In contrast, [[heat conduction]] through solid media is an everyday occurrence (e.g. a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid). This explains why the diffusion of heat was explained mathematically before the diffusion of mass.

It is the first Philippine microsatellite and the first satellite built and designed by Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Philippine microsatellite "DIWATA" set to launch|url=http://www.gov.ph/2016/01/18/philippines-diwata-microsatellite-launch/|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=18 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120203649/http://www.gov.ph/2016/01/18/philippines-diwata-microsatellite-launch/|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pdisettogo/&gt;

==Background==
[[Hokkaido University]] and [[Tohoku University]] of [[Japan]] initiated a project to send 50 microsatellites into space by 2050. The project will photograph aftermaths of natural disasters, partnering with governments, universities and other organizations based in [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mongolia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. Two satellites are commissioned for the Philippine government.&lt;ref name=satnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Asian Universities +  Asian Nations Go Small...

Diwata-1 is the first satellite of the venture made possible through the [[Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite program|Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite (PHL-Microsat) Program]],&lt;ref name="rappler1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ranada|first1=Pia|title=Introducing Diwata, the first Philippine-made satellite|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/86327-philippine-microsatellite-diwata|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a three-year program funded by the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST). The program is a collaboration between the [[University of the Philippines]], the [[Advanced Science and Technology Institute (Philippines)|DOST-Advanced Science and Technology Institute]] (DOST-ASTI), and Japan's [[Tohoku University]] and [[Hokkaido University]]. It was initiated on December 2014 by DOST.&lt;ref name=chibameeting&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakamoto|first1=Yuji|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ariston|last3=Espiritu|first3=Juan Paolo|last4=Labrador|first4=John Leur|last5=Oliveros|first5=Julian|last6=Kuwahara|first6=Toshinori|last7=Yoshida|first7=Kazuya|title=Development of the Satellite Bus System for PHL-MICROSAT|journal=Japan Geoscience Union|date=25 May 2015|url=https://confit.atlas.jp/guide/event-img/jpgu2015/02983/public/pdf?type=in|accessdate=19 January 2016|location=Chiba}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite is an updated version of the [[Raijin-2]], which was developed by the two Japanese universities.&lt;ref name=asahi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morimoto|first1=Miki|title=Japanese, Filipino researchers to jointly develop satellites to check typhoon damage|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sci_tech/technology/AJ201503060062|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=6 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310012636/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sci_tech/technology/AJ201503060062|archivedate=10 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uploading of commands to Diwata-1 and downloading of the images are done in the Philippines' very own [[Philippine Earth Data Resources Observation Center]] (PEDRO) ground receiving station. Image processing is also performed locally.

There were two Philippine satellites before Diwata-1, [[Agila-1]] and [[Agila-2]] (later renamed ABS-3) but the former was owned and operated by a non-Philippine firm, PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara, at the time of its launch and the latter was owned by [[Mabuhay Satellite Corporation]], a private local firm, but later acquired by [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]], a foreign firm.&lt;ref name=pdisettogo/&gt;

The government has been availing services from foreign countries for satellite imagery. Carlos Primo David, former Executive Director of the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) called the PHL-Microsat program a "small investment"&lt;ref name=pdisettogo/&gt; taking note that in 2013, following the aftermath of [[Typhoon Haiyan]] (locally known as Typhoon Yolanda), the government had to pay about {{Philippine peso|56 million}} for satellite imagery of an area affected by the typhoon dubbed as the "Yolanda Corridor".&lt;ref name=pdisettogo/&gt;&lt;ref name=alliance/&gt; This led to the creation of the PHL-Microsat program.

==Etymology==
The satellite was named after a type of divine being from [[Philippine mythology]], the [[diwata]].&lt;ref name=edgedavao&gt;{{cite news|title=DOST: First Filipino-made satellite to help agriculture|url=http://www.edgedavao.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24449:dost-first-filipino-made-satellite-to-help-agriculture&amp;catid=38:competitive-edge&amp;Itemid=57|accessdate=19 January 2016|agency=Philippine News Agency|publisher=EdgeDavao|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
[[File:Diwata-1 development.png|thumbnail|Diwata-1 in Japan]]
Diwata-1 has three scientific instruments: the High Precision Telescope (HPT); Space-borne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF); and the Wide Field Camera (WFC). Diwata-1 also has one engineering control instrument, the Middle Field Camera (MFC).&lt;ref name=sciencemissions&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vergel|first1=Kaye Kristine|last2=Magallon|first2=Benjamin Jonah|last3=Takahashi|first3=Yukihiro|last4=Ishida|first4=Tetsuro|last5=Perez|first5=Gay Jane|last6=Tupas|first6=Mark Edwin|last7=Marciano|first7=Joel|title=Science Missions and Payloads Specifications of Philippines' First Earth-Observation Microsatellite: Diwata|journal=Japan Geoscience Union|date=2 November 2015|url=https://secure.jproduce.co.jp/sgepss/sessionFinal/html/program/pdf/S001/S001-P01.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HPT &amp;ndash; with a [[ground sample distance]] (GSD) of {{convert|3|m|ft}} at {{convert|400|km|mi}} &amp;ndash; is currently being studied on how it can be used to monitor the extent of damages from natural disasters such as [[typhoons]]. It is also equipped with four CCDs for the red, blue, green, and near infrared regions of light.&lt;ref name=sciencemissions/&gt;

The SMI with LCTF &amp;ndash; with a GSD of {{convert|80|m|ft}} at {{convert|400|km|mi}} &amp;ndash; is currently being studied on how it can be used in measuring vegetation changes and [[phytoplankton]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in Philippine waters. The instrument is equipped with two CCDs for both visible (420–700&amp;nbsp;nm) and near infrared (650–1050&amp;nbsp;nm) regions with a 13&amp;nbsp;nm interval.&lt;ref name=sciencemissions/&gt;

The WFC &amp;ndash; which has a GSD of {{convert|7|km|mi}} and a panchromatic CCD with a field view of 1800 × 1340 &amp;ndash; is used to give visualizations of large-scale cloud patterns and distributions. Diwata-1 can be used to take daily images using the WFC in case of any upcoming large-scale weather disturbances, such as storms or typhoons.

The calibration of the attitude determination algorithm will be handled by the MFC. The instrument is equipped with a colored CCD and expected GSD of {{convert|185|m|ft}}, and will also aid in locating images captured by the HPT and SMI.&lt;ref name=sciencemissions/&gt;

In the occasion of the deployment, the Philippine flag was raised along with the Japanese flag at the [[Tsukuba Space Center]] of the [[JAXA]].&lt;ref name="GMAlaunchorbit"/&gt;

===Operation===
The mission duration of the satellite is expected to take place for around 20 months,&lt;ref name=deployedintospace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suarez|first1=KD|title=Diwata-1, the first Philippine microsatellite, deployed to space|url=http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/earth-space/130956-diwata-microsatellite-deployment-space|accessdate=27 April 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 months longer than earlier reported. The engineering team behind Diwata-1 at the [[Tohoku University]] was able to receive the satellite's first communication hours later after its deployment from the ISS, at 7:45 p.m. PST.&lt;ref name=maayos/&gt;

A ground station based in the Philippines, the [[Philippine Earth Data Resources Observation Center|Philippine Earth Data Resources Observation]] (PEDRO) Center, has primary control over the satellite with a command line on the UHF band. PEDRO receives telemetry data sent by Diwata-1 via UHF band and receives images via X-band.&lt;ref name=pdisettogo/&gt; The Tohoku University Ground station (CRESST)&lt;ref name=chibameeting/&gt; also has access to the satellite.

Weeks into the satellite's deployment since the Cygnus launch, the setting up of a temporary ground receiving station at the DOST ASTI building was being hastened by DOST units, PCIEERD and Advanced Science and Technology Institute. Diwata-1 was operational at least a week after its deployment into orbit.&lt;ref name=reachesspacestation/&gt;

The satellite's first images were released in public by the Tohoku University on June 2, 2016, via a Japanese press release.

The University of the Philippines Diliman campus has allocated an area for a space research laboratory for the continued development of microsatellite technology, where the Filipino scientists who were involved in the Diwata-1 project can teach and train local engineers. The facility will be funded by the PCIEERD of DOST.

The '''Drakoo wave energy converter'''  is a technological device that uses the motion of [[ocean surface waves]] to generate electricity.

== Principle ==
The Drakoo WEC does not fall under any of the usual [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] classifications: its working principle, based on a twin-chamber oscillating water column system, is to transform waves into a continuous water flow which drives a hydro turbine generator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
after being patented in 2008, the Drakoo technology has successfully been tested in NTU lab and, subsequently, in the deep wave flume of NAREC in 2012(UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report2014.ocean-energy-systems.org/country-reports/singapore/technology-demonstration/|title=Ocean Energy System Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocean Energy Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2016, Hann Ocean Energy, the Singapore wave developer company which invented and patented the technology, announced the first successful power production during a trial in its testing facility in [[Nantong]], with a peak power output of 3.8&amp;nbsp;kW at a wave height of 0.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology continuously increased its performances along the years, reaching firstly a peak output power of 9.3&amp;nbsp;kW  in November 2017 and of 11.2&amp;nbsp;kW in March 2018. Moreover, during the [[World Future Energy Summit]] 2018, in Abu Dhabi, Hann Ocean Energy reported about sales inquiries from the Persian Gulf for the application of the Drakoo WEC for wellhead platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ecological debt''' refers to the accumulated [[debt]] of wealthier countries{{Vague|date=March 2018}}{{Clarify|date=March 2018}} (from a defined date in the past until present) for having plundered poorer countries by the exploitation of their [[resource]]s, the degradation of their natural habitat, the beggaring of local people and/or the free occupation of environmental space for waste discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donoso|first=A.|date=2015|title=We are not debtors, we are creditors. In: Bravo, E., &amp; Yánez, I. (Eds.), No more looting and destruction! We the peoples of the south are ecological creditors|url=|journal=Southern Peoples Ecological Debt Creditors Alliance (SPEDCA)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition in itself has varied over the years and several scholars have attempted a greater specification of the concept.

Within the ecological debt definition, two types of aspects are understood: the ecological damage caused over time by a country in one or other countries or to ecosystems beyond national jurisdiction through its production and consumption patterns; and the exploitation or use of ecosystems over time by a country at the expense of the equitable rights to these ecosystems by other countries.

==  History ==
The term 'ecological debt' first appeared on paper in 1985, in a yellow booklet with the title “Women in movement" made by the German ecofeminist [[c:Category:Eva Quistorp|Eva Quistorp]] and edited by the [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]] in Germany in 1985. The work was intended to be used for a workshop she gave on 'women, peace and ecology' in [[Nairobi]] during the [[UN Women|United Nation Women’s Conference]] (the first workshop of this kind).

In 1992, the term appeared again in two reports published in different places around the world: “''Deuda ecológica''” by Robleto and Marcelo in [[Chile]] and “''Miljöskulden''” by Jernelöv in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warlenius, R., Pierce, G., Ramasar, V., Quistorp, E., Martínez-Alier, J., Rijnhout, L., Yanez, I.|first=|date=2015|title=Ecological debt. History, meaning and relevance for environmental justice|url=|journal=EJOLT Report|volume=18|pages=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robleto and Marcelo's report, published by the critical NGO ''Instituto de Ecologia Politica'' (IEP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La deuda ecológica. Una perspectiva sociopolítica|last=Robleto M.L., Marcelo W.|first=|publisher=Instituto Ecología Política (IEP)|year=1992|isbn=|location=Santiago de Chile|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a political and activist response to the global environmental negotiations happening during the Rio Summit. It shed light on the debate occurring in Latin America since the 1980s about the crucial nature's heritage that had been consumed and not returned (i.e. ecological debt). On the other hand, Jernelöv's report goal was to calculate the Swedish debt for future generation and was intended to serve nationally for the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)|Swedish Environmental Advisory]]. Although the last one had less world-wide influence in the concept's debate, it is important to note that both reports have opposite approach in considering the ecological debt: Robleto and Marcelo's report expresses it in symbolic terms, focusing on the moral and political aspects, whereas Jernelöv's report tries to quantify and monetize it in economic terms.

In 1994, the Colombian lawyer Borrero, wrote a book on ecological debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La deuda ecológica. Testimonio de una reflexión|last=Borrero Navia|first=J.|publisher=Fipma y Cela|year=1994|isbn=|location=Cali|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to the environmental liabilities of Northern countries for the excessive per capita production of greenhouse gases, historically and at present. The concept has then been reused by some [[environmental organization]]s from the [[Global south|Global South]]. Campaigns on the ecological debt were launched since 1997 by [[Accion Ecologica]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Friends of the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deudaecologica.org/|title=Deuda Ecologica|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Deuda Ecologica|language=Spanish|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ecological debt 'movement' was born of the convergence of three main factors during the 80s-90s: 1) the consequences of the debt crisis in the 70s due to the [[Volcker shock]]s or the drastic increase of interest rates (followed by [[structural adjustment]]s made by the US to solve the [[stagflation]] in 1981, and thus putting heavily indebted third world countries in an impossible situation in regards to debt repayment); 2) the rising of environmental awareness as seen previously (activists and NGOs attending the [[Rio Summit]] in 1992); 3) an increase in recognition of the violence caused by [[colonialism]] over the years &lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt; (the demand of recognition is over 500 years, since [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] arrived in [[North America]]).

In 2009, [[Ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] scholar [[Ariel Salleh]] explained how the [[capitalist]] processes at work in the global North [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploit nature]] and [[Exploitation of labour|people]] simultaneously, ultimately sustaining a large ecological debt in her article, "Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt".&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt; At the 1992 [[Rio Earth Summit]], politicians and corporate leaders from the global North introduced the supposed solution for the [[foreign debt]] crisis in the global South.&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt; They proposed 'debt for nature swaps', which essentially means that those countries that possess abundant [[biodiversity]] and [[natural resource|environmental resource]]s would give them up to the global North in return for the [[World Bank]] reducing their debt.&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt;

Feminist [[environmentalist]]s, Indigenous activists, and peasants from the Global South, exposed how the Global North is much more indebted to the Global South.&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt; Salleh justified this by explaining how the 500-year-long colonialisation process involving the extraction of resources has caused immense damage and destruction to the ecosystem of the [[Global South]].&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt; In fact, scientists at the US National [[Academy for Science and Design|Academy for Sciences]] state that in the time period of 1961–2000, by analyzing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions created by the rich (the Global North) alone, it has become apparent that the rich have imposed climate changes on the poor that greatly outweigh the poor's foreign debt.&lt;ref name="srinivasan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=U. Thara Srinivasan|display-authors=etal|year=2008|title=The debt of nations and the distribution of ecological impacts from human activities|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=105|issue=5|pages=1768–1773|doi=10.1073/pnas.0709562104|pmc=2234219|pmid=18212119}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this [[environmental degradation]] amounts to ecological debt, seizing the people's livelihood resources in the Global South.

In 2009 as well, [[Andrew Simms]] used the ecological debt in a more bio-physical way and defined it as the consumption of resources from within an ecosystem that exceeds the system's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Simms. ''Ecological Debt: The Health of the Planet &amp; the Wealth of Nations.'' (London: [[Pluto Press]], 2009) p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in particular in [[non-renewable resource]]s wherein consumption outstrips production. In a general sense in his work, it refers to the depletion of global resources beyond the Earth's ability to regenerate them. The concept in this sense is based on the bio-physical [[carrying capacity]] of an ecosystem; through measuring [[ecological footprints]] human society can determine the rate at which it is depleting natural resources. Ultimately, the imperative of [[sustainability]] requires human society to live within the means of the ecological system to support life over the long term. Ecological debt is a feature of unsustainable economic systems.

== Political dimension ==

=== Historical context ===
There have been several debates around the notion of ecological debt, and this is mostly because the concept arises from various social movements in response to distributional injustice of climate change's consequences on the environment and people's livelihood.

Salleh in particular showed how the ecological debt manifested in the destruction of the environment and associated climate change the North has created is made possible through the process of [[Modernization theory|modernization]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="salleh"&gt;Salleh, A. (2009). Ecological debt: embodied debt. Eco-Sufficiency and Global Justice. London: Pluto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the nature-culture divide that emerged due to rapid [[industrialisation]] is a perfect illustration of a human-nature dualism in which [[human being]] has the central role above everything else. The notion of humans being embedded in the ecosystem that they live in is crucial to the discipline of [[political ecology]].&lt;ref name="salleh" /&gt;

In political ecology, which reconnects nature and the economy, ecological debt is crucial because it recognizes that colonization has not only resulted in a loss of culture, way of life, and language for [[Indigenous peoples]], but it has shaped the [[world economy]] into one that [[monetization|monetizes]] and [[commodification|commodifies]] the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chapter 3: Habitation versus Improvement. In The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time|last=Polanyi|first=Karl|publisher=Boston: Beacon Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=|pages=35–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the [[Colonization of south america|colonization of South America]] occurred over 500 years ago, European settlers brought with them their [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] values, seeing themselves as better than and therefore entitled to the [[Indigenous Knowledge|Indigenous people's knowledge]] and the land they lived on. In a perceived [[Postcolonialism|post colonial world]], large corporations and Western governments tend to present solutions to global warming by commodifying nature and hoping to make a profit out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makki|first=Fouad|date=2014|title=Development by Dispossession: Terra Nullius and the Social-Ecology of New Enclosures in Ethiopia|url=|journal=Rural Sociology|volume=79| issue = 1|pages=79–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This better-than-thou attitude has created the conditions for [[global warming]] to occur, making the North’s [[ecological footprint]] soar,&lt;ref&gt;Seager, J. (2009). The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World (4th ed.). New York, NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; while also constructing an ecological debt so large as to completely rid the entire Global South of their [[Debt|financial debt]].

During the [[Rio Earth Summit]] in 1992, attending [[NGOs]] created the Debt Treaty, a document gathering all information to better define the ecological debt concept. They demanded compensation for damages over 500 years (1992 is exactly 500 years after the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in North America). It was a first push back, reversing the stream, but it stayed as a draft paper not recognized by international institutions or lead countries at that time.
[[File:ActionAid1.jpg|thumb|Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 - Action Aid demonstration]]

=== Today ===
In the 2000s, two networks were created and still exist today: the [http://www.socioeco.org/bdf_organisme-56_en.html Southern Peoples Ecological Debt Creditors Alliance (SPEDCA)] which is a network of [[creditor]]s that launched a campaign for the recognition of ecological debt, and the European Network for the Recognition of Ecological Debt (ENRED) which is a network of [[debtor]]s.

During the [[Conference of the parties|COP]] in Copenhagen in December 2009, some governments from developing countries or countries most vulnerable to [[climate change]] consequences (such as Bolivia, Mauritania, Chad, or island countries as Maldives or Haiti) have argued that the principle of shared responsibility demands that rich nations or [[developed economies]] (such as the United States, some European countries, China) go beyond donations or adaptation [[Debits and credits|credits]] and make reparations that recognize an ecological debt for excessive emissions over several decades. The top United States ambassador, [[Todd Stern]], flatly rejected arguments by diplomats from these countries that the United States owed such a debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/weekinreview/06zeller.html|title=Negotiators at Climate Talks Face Deep Set of Fault Lines|last=Zeller Jr.|first=Tom|date=December 5, 2009|website=New York Times|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[COP 21]] in Paris brought minor progress with an increase in financial aid for developing countries. Although the goal was to prepare future action to be undertaken for adapting to climate change and consider loss and damages (especially [[displaced people]]) of some countries, no real action was adopted. There were no recognition of responsibilities but recommendations only.

==  Calculations ==

=== Climate debt ===
When discussing ecological debt, [[climate debt]] appears to be the only example of a scientific attempt to quantify the debt. It incorporates two different elements: the [[Climate debt|adaptation debt]] which is the cost to communities of adapting to [[climate damage]]s they are not responsible for, and the consumption debt or emission's debt which is compensation due for emitting carbon in the present time.

=== Calculations ===
Academic work on calculations of the ecological debt came later. An article published in 2008 looked at the distribution of [[Environmental issue|ecological impacts]] for various human activities.&lt;ref name="srinivasan" /&gt; Studies were also produced at regional level within countries, for instance for Orissa in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Khatua and W. Stanley, "Ecological Debt: a case study from Orissa, India" (2006) [http://www.deudaecologica.org/publicaciones/Chapter5(125-168).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen previously, calculation of the ecological debt implies various aspects related to [[political ecology]]. While calculation the amount of emissions, some scholars have disregard inequalities of emissions from the past whereas others have considered historical accountability.

In 2000, Neumayer calculated what he named the 'historical emissions debt', consisting on the difference in emissions of actual historical emissions (from a specific date in the past) and equal per-capita emissions (current emissions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumayer|first=E.|date=2000|title=In defence of historical accountability for greenhouse gas emissions|url=|journal=Ecol. Econ.|volume=33|pages=185–192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, it may be possible to put a money value on ecological debt by calculating the value of the environmental and social [[Externality|externalities]] associated with historic resource extraction and adding an estimated value for the share of global [[Pollution|pollution problems]] borne by poor countries as the result of higher consumption levels in rich ones.&lt;ref name="srinivasan" /&gt; This includes efforts to value the [[external costs]] associated with climate change.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goeminne, G. &amp; Paredis, E.|first=|date=2010|title=The concept of ecological debt: Some steps towards an enriched sustainability paradigm|url=|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|volume=12|issue=5|pages=691–712|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Matthews proposed a method to calculate the ecological debt, by looking at the accumulated `carbon debts' for each country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Damon|date=September 2015|title=Quantifying Historical Carbon and Climate Debts among Nations|url=|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=6|pages=60+|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model uses historical estimates of [[Fossil fuel emissions|national fossil fuel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le Quéré, C. et al.|first=|date=2015|title=Global Carbon Budget 2014|url=|journal=Earth System Science Data|volume=7| issue = 1|pages=47–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[population]] and this since 1960. Furthermore, it runs a comparison between [[temperature]] changes each year by each country's emissions compared to a proportional temperature change of each country's share of the world population (this same year). This gives the accumulated credits and debts related to a larger range of emissions and the 'climate debts' obtained would be the difference between the actual temperature change (caused by each country) and their [[Per capita|per-capita]] share of global temperature change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other scholars have proposed a different approach, a `modified equal shares' approach, that would consider each country's [[basic needs]] and would weight each ones' share of emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanderheiden|first=S.|date=2008|title=Atmospheric Justice: A Political Theory of Climate Change|url=|journal=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach brings potential [[Ethics|ethical]] and political difficulties to quantitatively defining what would thus be the equal shares.

== Key debates ==
Although some recent emerging countries have participated in the increase of [[carbon emissions]], the situation tend to stay uneven in-between developing and developed countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews, H., Graham, T., Keverian, S., Lamontagne, C., Seto, D., &amp; Smith, T.|first=|date=2014|title=National contributions to observed global warming|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=9| issue = 1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/1/014010}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding who is affected the most versus who pollutes the most.

Recent studies on ecological debt focus more on sub-topics as the notion of historical responsibility&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (whether or not a country is considered ethically responsible or accountable for carbon emissions prior 1990, i.e. when global warming was universally recognized), the components of [[climate debt]] (see above sections), the difficulties in deciding when to start counting past emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fridahl, M., Friman, M., &amp; Strandberg, G.|first=|date=2014|title=Historical responsibility for climate change: science and the science-policy interface|url=|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|volume=5|issue=3|pages=297–316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if this debate is slowing the implementation of programs or the legal and political consecration of the debt through treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez-Alier|first=J.|date=2002|title=Ecological debt and property rights on carbon sinks and reservoirs|url=|journal=Capitalism Nature Socialism|volume=13|issue=1|pages=115–119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present key debates focus on how is the debt going to be paid back. First, some academia have pushed for financial [[debt cancellation]] rather than being paid for ecological damages and then paying back the country's national financial debt. However, financial debts were not even agree by people (in developing countries especially) in the first place, calling it the unfair "[[Volcker Rule|Volcker]] debt". Accepting this option could hold the risk of giving legitimize credits to these financial debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecritique.com/ojaRg/articles/ecological-debt-versus-financial-debt-in-the-african-context/|title=Ecological Debt Versus Financial Debt In The African Context|last=Ngosso|first=Thierry|date=2016|website=The Critique|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second solution proposed is the [[Basic income guarantee|Basic Income Guarantee]] (BIG) or the universal basic income. It consists on regular cash payments to everyone in a community (or country) and has proven a certain efficacy in some places around the world (like Namibia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-new-approach-to-aid-how-a-basic-income-program-saved-a-namibian-village-a-642310.html|title=A New Approach to Aid: How a Basic Income Program Saved a Namibian Village|last=Krahe|first=Dialika|date=2009-08-10|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another debate addresses the fact that the ecological debt risks “commodifying nature”, exhausting ecosystem services. Researchers have tackled this risk by showing how it will expand the inclination of objectifying, monetizing and ultimately commodifying nature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, the language of debt, repayments, credits and so forth is understood in Northern countries mostly, and is mostly focused on recognition of wrongdoing but not payment for loss of services for instance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

}}

The '''electricity sector of Uruguay''' has traditionally been based on domestic [[hydropower]] along with [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] plants, and reliant on imports from [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] at times of peak demand. 
Over the last 10 years, investments in renewable energy sources such as [[wind power]] and [[solar power]] allowed the country to cover in early 2016 94.5% of its electricity needs with [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy|title=Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2015-12-03|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydropower]] provides a large percentage of installed production capacity in Uruguay, almost all of it produced by four hydroelectric facilities, three on the [[Rio Negro (Uruguay)|Rio Negro]] and one, the Salto Grande dam shared with Argentina, on the [[Uruguay River]]. The production from these hydropower sources is dependent on seasonal rainfall patterns, but under normal hydrological conditions, can supply off-peak domestic demand.

[[Thermal power station|Thermal power]] from petroleum fired power plants, activated during peak demand, used to provide the remaining installed production capacity. 
Generation from fossil fuel decreased substantially in recent years, with renewables accounting for 94.5% of electricity generation in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy|accessdate=20 January 2018|work=the Guardian|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thermal power from biomass also provides additional power generation capacity.

The shift to renewable energy sources in recent years has been achieved thanks to modernization efforts, based on legal and regulatory reforms in 1997, 2002, and 2006, which have led to large new investments in electrical production capacity including from the private sector. [[Wind power]] capacity has gone from negligible in 2012 to 10% of installed capacity by 2014.
A new, highly efficient thermal power plant which can run on either gas or oil has been installed.{{cn|date=January 2018}}
A number of photovoltaic [[solar power]] plants have been built. 
Additionally, a new [[electrical grid]] interconnection has improved the ability to import or export electricity with Brazil.{{citation needed|reason=Has the interconnection been built/completed?|date=April 2016}}

== Electricity supply and demand ==

=== Installed capacity ===
Installed electricity capacity in Uruguay was around 2,500 MW ([[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]]) in 2009 and around 2,900 MW in 2013. Of the installed capacity, about 63% is [[hydroelectricity|hydro]], accounting for 1,538 MW which includes half of the capacity of the Argentina-Uruguay bi-national [[Salto Grande Dam|Salto Grande]]. The rest of the production capacity is mostly [[thermal power station|thermal]] and a small share of wind and biomass.&lt;ref name="DNETN Statistics"&gt;[http://www.miem.gub.uy/portal/hgxpp001?5,6,231,O,S,0,SRC;51;0;256;N;SRC;MNU;E;13;2;MNU;, MIEM-DNETN Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The power system exhibits characteristics and issues of hydro-based generation. The apparently wide reserve margin conceals the vulnerability to hydrology. In dry years it is necessary to import over 25% of the demand from [[Argentina|Argentinian]] and [[Brazil]]ian markets.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

About 56% of generation capacity is owned and operated by UTE, the national utility. The remaining capacity corresponds to the Salto Grande hydroelectric plant (945 MW), to co-generation or to small private investments in renewable sources. The table below shows the plants that are operated and owned by UTE as of 2008:&lt;ref name="UTE cifras"&gt;UTE en cifras 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Installed capacity had barely changed between 1995 and 2008. The most recent addition was the 300 MW Punta del Tigre Plant, whose last units started operations in 2008. A 530 MW dual fuel (gas/light oil) CCGT power plant, "[[Punta del Tigre B]]", is being built in the Punta del Tigre site; construction started in late 2013 and final completion is expected by late 2018. The existing large hydroelectric potential has already been developed and the existing thermal units are low performing.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Total generation in the year 2008 was 8,019 GWh, 56.1% of which were from hydroelectric sources, with 42.2% being thermal.&lt;ref name="DNETN Statistics"/&gt;

=== Imports and exports ===
In the years leading up to 2009, the Uruguayan electricity system has faced difficulties to supply the increasing demand from its domestic market. In years of low rainfall, there is a high dependency on imports from Brazil and Argentina. Exports have historically been negligible. In particular, no electricity has been exported in 2009.The table below shows the evolution of imported electricity since 1999:&lt;ref name="DNETN Statistics"/&gt;

These energy exchanges happen through two existing interconnections, a 500kv line with Argentina, through [[Salto Grande Dam|Salto Grande]], and a 70kv line with Brazil, through [[Garabi]].&lt;ref name="CIER Statistics"&gt;[http://www.cier.org.uy/d06-sie/2008/index.htm CIER Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand ===
Total electricity consumption in 2008 was 7,114 GWh, which corresponds to a per capita consumption of 2,729 kWh.&lt;ref name="UTE cifras"/&gt; Share of consumption by sector was as follows:&lt;ref name="CIER Statistics"/&gt; 
* Residential: 41%
* Industrial: 24%
* Commercial: 20%
* Public lighting and others: 15%

=== Demand and supply projections ===
In the period 2002-2007, after the 2002-2003 economic and financial crisis, electricity demand increased 4.9% per year on average. Electricity demand increased by 7.5% between 2006 and 2007, from 6,613 GWh to 7,112 GWh, reaching a per capita value of 2,143 kWh. Yearly demand increase is expected to be about 3.5% during the next ten years.&lt;ref name="DNETN Statistics"/&gt;

=== Reserve margin ===
Maximum demand on the order of 1,500 MW (historic peak demand, 1,668 MW happened in July 2009&lt;ref name="ADME"&gt;[http://www.adme.com.uy/ ADME]&lt;/ref&gt;) is met with a generation system of about 2,200 MW capacity. This apparently wide reserve margin conceals a high vulnerability to hydrology.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==
Access to electricity in Uruguay is very high, above 98.7%. This coverage is above average for countries with public electricity services.&lt;ref name="CIER Statistics"/&gt; Quality of service is perceived to be good both by companies and residential users.  Companies suffer losses of just about 1.1% of their sales due to electricity service interruptions &lt;ref name="World Bank Survey"&gt;'World Bank Survey on Investment Climate, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Interruption frequency and duration are considerably below the averages for the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] region. In 2004, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 7.23, while duration of interruptions per subscriber was 9.8 hours. The [[Weighted mean|weighted averages]] for LAC were 13 interruptions and 14 hours respectively.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

UTE has implemented a series of measures to reduce electricity losses, which were particularly high during the 2002-2003 crisis.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt; In December 2007, losses were still high, about 18%, of which 7% to 8% were of technical nature.&lt;ref name="UTE"&gt;UTE&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities in the electricity sector ==
The National Directorate of Energy and Nuclear Technology (DNTEN) formulates energy-sector policies. The regulatory functions are assigned to URSEA, the regulatory body. Both transmission and distribution activities are fully under the control of UTE, as established by the 1997 law.

=== Private companies ===
Currently, there are four private companies that generate electricity for their own consumption and sell their surplus to the grid: Botnia (biomass, 161 MW), Agroland (wind, 0.3 MW), Nuevo Manantial (wind, 10 MW) and Zenda (natural gas, 3.2 MW). The Azucarlito plant (5 MW) operates in the spot market.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; The current 6% private contribution to the generation park is expected to increase as investments in new wind power plants materialize.

== Renewable energy resources ==
Renewables could play a role in future energy supply, in particular [[Wind power in Uruguay|wind power]], allowing Uruguay to reduce its dependence on imports.

[[File:Salto Grande dam.JPG|thumb|The Salto Grande Dam]]

All the potential for large [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects in Uruguay has already been developed. Existing plants are Terra (152 MW), Baygorria (108 MW), Constitucion (333 MW) and the bi-national Salto Grande, with a total capacity of 1,890 MW.

[[File:Sierra de los Caracoles wind farm.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Sierra de los Caracoles wind farm]]
Uruguay has a favorable climate for generating electricity through [[wind power]], but its cost – estimated at US$45–50/MWh for large projects (50-100 MW) - is still uncertain. Consequently, the estimated wind potential of 600 MW cannot yet be taken as a feasible value, from an economic standpoint.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite those difficulties, according to the Government’s strategic plan, Uruguay will have 300 MW of installed wind capacity in 2011 and should reach 500 MW in 2015. The National Environmental Directorate (DINAMA) has already received several requests for new wind projects and UTE had a very positive response to the bidding process launched in mid-2009&lt;ref name="AEE"&gt;[http://www.aeeolica.es/prensa_actualidad.php?ID_ACTUALIDAD=3860 ''Asociación Empresarial Eólica'']&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, the government of Uruguay approved a Decree that allows UTE to bid 150 MW of wind power. USD 300 million of private investment are expected as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evwind.es/noticias.php?id_not=941]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wind farm in Uruguay, the 10 MW Nuevo Manantial project in [[Rocha, Uruguay|Rocha]], which will sell the electricity generated to UTE, started operations in October 2008. A few months later, in January 2009, UTE’s 10 MW wind farm in [[Sierra de los Caracoles]] also started operations.&lt;ref name="AEE"/&gt;

[[Biomass]] based on renewable sources such as rice husk could generate up to 20 MW at competitive prices. Firewood has already been used as a substitute for fuel oil in the 1980s, and cellulose projects expect to generate up to 65 MW for sales to the network.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Power sector reform ===

In 1997, the national electricity law was updated following the principles of the so-called “standard
model,” which contemplated the separation of regulatory/governance functions from corporate functions, and put in place the regulatory agency URSEA and a market administrator, ADME. The reform contemplated the remuneration of generators in order of merit, the creation of a wholesale market with regulated prices in transmission and distribution, where competition is not possible.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform has not been effectively implemented. After passing the modifications to the electricity law, secondary legislation was not forthcoming and the system continued to operate without any significant change. The new model was regulated in 2002 and it was expected that new operators would enter into a competitive market. The market did not develop as planned and demand actually decreased due to the economic crisis in the region. For instance, natural gas provision, which could have supplied new power generating units, did not materialize. Although URSEA and ADME were established, they cannot yet fulfil most of the functions established in their mandate.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dependence on imports ===

For a full decade no power capacity was added to the power system. Prior to the completion of the 100 MW Punta del Tigre diesel power plant in August 2005, UTE had not added a power station to the system since 1995, when the last unit of Salto Grande came online. The absence of commissioning of new production facilities during this extended period was the product of a conscious, strategic decision to take advantage of market developments in Argentina and in the region, which would allow imports to fill any Uruguayan shortfalls, while exporting hydropower surplus production to Argentina and Brazil during wet years.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependence on imports from Argentina started to become problematic in 2004. Before 2004, UTE was able to supply its demand through a combination of contracts and purchases on the Argentinean spot market. As a result of the Argentine energy difficulties, UTE’s contracts with Argentina for firm supply of 365 MW were reduced to 150 MW and were not extended beyond 2007. Notwithstanding this forced reduction in supply from Argentina over the low hydrology period of 2004-06, UTE was able to maintain energy imports through a noticeable increase of imports from Brazil and purchase of energy from the Argentine spot market.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, supply costs increased substantially as the drought, high fuel costs and low availability of power in neighboring countries.

=== Policy options ===

The Energy Strategy Guidelines for Uruguay were defined in 2006 by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (MIEM). This strategy includes: (i) diversifying energy sources to reduce costs and emissions, as well as increase energy security; (ii) increasing private participation in new renewable power generation; (iii) increasing regional energy trade; and (iv) facilitating availability and acquisition of energy efficient goods and services, including efforts to raise public awareness regarding demand-side management interventions. According to the National Directorate for Energy and Nuclear Technology (DNETN), grid-connected wind power generation is one of the domestic resources with both medium and long term potential in Uruguay.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has taken action to promote RE development. In March 2006, the executive power issued Decree No.77/2006  to foster private generation through wind, biomass and small hydropower plants. A target of 60 MW was established for the first tender, which was conducted by UTE in August 2006. Although bids received for wind and biomass projects were all higher than US$70/MWh, this can be attributed to the small size of the proposed projects and the uncertainty of contractual arrangements.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Interconnecting with Brazil is also particularly attractive. The expansion of the interconnection capacity with Brazil may be carried out either along the Coast or from Salto Grande. This expansion would contribute to diversifying the supply sources and could be done in order to take advantage of the installation of large thermal (coal) plants in the South of Brazil.&lt;ref name="ESMAP 2007"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tariffs ==

For 2008, the overall [[weighted mean|weighted]] average tariff was US$0.139/kWh. Average tariffs for some sectors are presented below:
* Residential:  US$0.177/kWh
* Large consumers: US$0.047/kWh
* Medium consumers: US$0.131/kWh
* Public lighting: US$0.164/kWh

== Environmental impact ==
[http://www.olade.org OLADE] (Organización Latinoamericana de Energía) estimated that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from electricity production in 2006 were 1.55 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olade.org/informe.html OLADE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074348/http://www.olade.org/informe.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2009, there were only three registered [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] projects in Uruguay, all of them related to energy: the [http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/DNV-CUK1190184595.5/view Montevideo Landfill Gas Capture and Flare Project], the [http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/DNV-CUK1199485759.25/view Fray Bentos Biomass Power Generation Project] and a project on [http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/DNV-CUK1167995084.77/view partial substitution of fossil fuels with biomass in cement manufacture]. Total expected emissions reductions are 251,213 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC]&lt;/ref&gt;

== External assistance ==
The only active energy project financed by the [[World Bank]] in Uruguay is the [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P068124 Energy Efficiency Project] (PERMER), with a USD 6.88 million grant from the [[Global Environmental Facility]]. The objective this project is to increase the demand for and competitive supply of energy efficiency goods and services, contributing to improved efficiency of energy use, reduced reliance of the Uruguayan economy on imported electricity and fuels, and reduced emissions from the energy sector.

In [[geophysical]] [[fluid dynamics]], the '''''f''-plane approximation''' is an approximation where the [[Coriolis parameter]], denoted ''f'', is set to a constant value. 

This approximation is frequently used for the analysis of highly idealized tropical cyclones. Using a constant Coriolis parameter prevents the formation of [[beta gyre]]s which are largely responsible for the North-westward direction of most tropical cyclones. [[Rossby waves]] also depend on variations in ''f'', and do not occur in the ''f''-plane approximation. 

In reality, the Coriolis parameter varies with [[latitude]], and so the ''f''-plane approximation is not appropriate when considering flows over large lengthscales. The ''f''-plane approximation is also poor near the equator, where variations in ''f'' are on the same [[order of magnitude]] as ''f''. The [[beta plane]] approximation is an improvement on the ''f''-plane approximation which takes leading-order variations in ''f'' into account.

[[Image:Feb131979StormPeakGustMap.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the storm. Most of these peak gusts are from official stations]]

The '''February 13, 1979 windstorm''' is a natural phenomenon that took place on February 13, 1979 in Pacific Canada and the United States. During the early morning of February 13, 1979, an intense wave [[cyclone]] moved across southern [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]]. South of the low center, a strong atmospheric pressure gradient was carried across [[Washington (state)|Washington]], with associated high winds. With a cold airflow moving toward the northeast interacting with the high terrain of the [[Olympic Mountains]], a lee low developed east of the Olympics. The [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] low caused a particularly intense pressure gradient to develop across the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] region.

==Wind velocity==
At 6 mbar over 8 miles, the [[geostrophic]] wind potential easily exceeded 200 knots (which roughly translates to about 100 knots in ageostrophic flow over the Earth's rough surface, or 115&amp;nbsp;mph). As reported by the crew of the [[Hood Canal Bridge]], average winds reached at least 80&amp;nbsp;mph out of the south, with gusts into the triple digits. These wind velocities were cross-checked on two different [[anemometers]] at the bridge control tower.

==Damage==
Extensive damage to trees on surrounding private timberland also corroborate the extreme intensity of this tempest. The pressure of wind and wave on the [[Hood Canal Bridge]] stressed the structure enough to cause catastrophic failure. It is suspected that a severe list in the bridge exposed pontoon access hatches to the waves, which subsequently tore the covers loose and allowed water to enter the flotation devices, causing sections to sink. It took nearly three years and over $140 million U.S. to rebuild the lost bridge.

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Hecate''' or '''Hekate''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ə|t|iː}}; {{lang-grc|Ἑκάτη}}, ''Hekátē'') is a goddess in [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], most often shown holding a pair of torches or a key&lt;ref name="Charles M 1986 pp. 307-318"&gt;The Running Maiden from Eleusis and the Early Classical Image of Hekate by Charles M. Edwards in the American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 90, No. 3 (Jul., 1986), pp. 307–318&lt;/ref&gt; and in later periods depicted in triple form. She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, light, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, [[necromancy]], and sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html |title=HECATE : Greek goddess of witchcraft, ghosts &amp; magic ; mythology ; pictures : HEKATE |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;d'Este, Sorita &amp; Rankine, David, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She appears in the [[Homeric Hymn|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]] and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', where she is promoted strongly as a great goddess. The place of origin of her following is uncertain, but it is thought that she had popular followings in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="Burkert"/&gt;

Hecate was one of the main deities worshiped in Athenian households as a protective goddess and one who bestowed prosperity and daily blessings on the family.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/259138/Hecate|title=Hecate&amp;nbsp;– Greek goddess|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-Christian writings of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] (2nd–3rd century CE) she was regarded with (some) rulership over earth, sea, and sky, as well as a more universal role as Saviour (Soteira), Mother of Angels and the Cosmic [[Anima mundi|World Soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1991/02.06.11.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 02.06.11 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, Hekate Soteira, Scholars Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the nature of her cult, it has been remarked, "she is more at home on the fringes than in the center of Greek polytheism. Intrinsically ambivalent and polymorphous, she straddles conventional boundaries and eludes definition."&lt;ref name="OCD671"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=671 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and origin==
The etymology of the name ''Hecate'' (Ἑκάτη, ''Hekátē'') is not known. Some suggestions derive the name from a Greek root: from  ἑκών "willing" (thus, "she who works her will" or similar),&lt;ref&gt;At least in the case of [[Hesiod]]'s use, see {{cite book |first=Jenny Strauss |last=Clay |title=Hesiod's Cosmos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=135 |isbn=0-521-82392-7 }} Clay lists a number of researchers who have advanced some variant of the association between Hecate's name and will (e.g. Walcot (1958), Neitzel (1975), Derossi (1975)). The researcher is led to identify "the name and function of Hecate as the one 'by whose will' prayers are accomplished and fulfilled." This interpretation also appears in Liddell-Scott, ''A Greek English Lexicon'', in the entry for Hecate, which is glossed as "lit. 'she who works her will'"&lt;/ref&gt; or from  Ἑκατός ''Hekatos'', an obscure epithet of [[Apollo]]&lt;ref name="OCD671" /&gt; interpreted as  "the far reaching one" or "the far-darter",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. E. |last=Wheelwright |title=Metaphor and Reality |year=1975 |location=Bloomington |publisher= |page=144 |isbn=0-253-20122-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whence for the feminine form "she that operates from afar" or "she that removes or drives off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Anthon |title=A Classical Dictionary |location= |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |year=1869 |page=579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected a Greek etymology and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'' (2009), Brill, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; A possibility for foreign origin of the name may be ''[[Heqet]]'', name of an Egyptian goddess of fertility and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKechnie |first=Paul |first2=Philippe |last2=Guillaume |title=Ptolemy II Philadelphus and His World |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |year=2008 |page=133 |isbn=978-90-04-17089-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Early Modern English]], the name was also pronounced disyllabically (as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ɪ|t}}) and sometimes spelled ''Hecat''. It remained common practice in English to pronounce her name in two syllables, even when spelled with final ''e'', well into the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The spelling ''Hecat'' is due to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Arthur Golding |last=Golding |first=Arthur |year=1567 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asGFKAUTQC8C&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;pg=PA243&amp;f=false |title=Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book Seven }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this spelling without the final E later appears in plays of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]]-[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe, Christopher]] (first published 1604; performed earlier). ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vaNlzzIqXe0C&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Hecat#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Act III, Scene 2, line 21:] "Pluto's blue fire and Hecat's tree".&lt;br /&gt;[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]] (c. 1594-96). ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey2gnY51jmoC&amp;;pg=PT195&amp;pg=PT195&amp;dq=%22By+the+triple+Hecat%27s+team%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22By%20the%20triple%20Hecat's%20team%22&amp;f=false Act V, Scene 1, line 384:] "By the triple Hecat's team".&lt;br /&gt;Shakespeare, William (c. 1603-07). ''[[Macbeth]]'', [http://www.playshakespeare.com/macbeth/scenes/257-act-iii-scene-5 Act III, Scene 5, line 1:] "Why, how now, Hecat!"&lt;br /&gt;[[Ben Jonson|Jonson, Ben]] (c. 1637, printed 1641).

[[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1866 particularly credits the influence of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for the then-predominant disyllabic pronunciation of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Noah |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmwIAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;pg=PT9#v=onepage&amp;dq=Hecate&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |edition=10th |quote=Rules for pronouncing the vowels of Greek and Latin proper names", p.9: "''Hecate''..., pronounced in three syllables when in Latin, and in the same number in the Greek word ''Ἑκάτη'', in English is universally contracted into two, by sinking the final ''e''. Shakespeare seems to have begun, as he has now confirmed, this pronunciation, by so adapting the word in Macbeth.... And the play-going world, who form no small portion of what is called the better sort of people, have followed the actors in this world, and the rest of the world have followed them. }}&lt;br /&gt;Cf. ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1894): [https://books.google.com/books?id=6aElzaWwzkQC&amp;dq=Hecate&amp;lpg=RA1-PA593&amp;pg=RA1-PA593#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "'''Hec'ate''' (3 syl. in Greek, 2 in Eng.)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate possibly originated among the [[Carians]] of [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref name="Burkert"&gt;Walter Burkert, (1987) ''Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical'', p. 171. Oxford, Blackwell. {{ISBN|0-631-15624-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the region where most [[theophoric name]]s invoking Hecate, such as [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] or Hecatomnus, the father of [[Mausolus]], are attested,&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Kraus, ''Hekate: Studien zu Wesen u. Bilde der Göttin in Kleinasien u. Griechenland'' (Heidelberg) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; and where Hecate remained a [[Magna Dea|Great Goddess]] into historical times, at her unrivalled&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 128: Berg comments on Hecate's endorsement of Roman hegemony in her representation on the pediment at Lagina solemnising a pact between a warrior (Rome) and an [[Amazons|amazon]] (Asia)&lt;/ref&gt; cult site in [[Lagina]]. While many researchers favor the idea that she has Anatolian origins, it has been argued that "Hecate must have been a Greek goddess."&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 134. Berg's argument for a Greek origin rests on three main points: 1. Almost all archaeological and literary evidence for her cult comes from the Greek mainland, and especially from Attica—all of which dates earlier than the 2nd century BCE. 2. In Asia Minor only one monument can be associated with Hecate prior to the 2nd century BCE. 3. The supposed connection between Hecate and attested "Carian theophoric names" is not convincing, and instead suggests an aspect of the process of her Hellenization. He concludes, "Arguments for Hecate's "Anatolian" origin are not in accord with evidence."&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments to Hecate in [[Phrygia]] and Caria are numerous but of late date.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus 1960, p. 52; list pp.166ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Berg observes, "Since children are not called after spooks, it is safe to assume that Carian theophoric names involving ''hekat-'' refer to a major deity free from the dark and unsavoury ties to the underworld and to witchcraft associated with the Hecate of classical Athens."&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is some evidence that she might be derived from the local [[solar deity|sun goddesses]] (see also [[Arinna]]), based on similar attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Bachvarova, Hecate: An Anatolian Sun-Goddess of the Underworld, SSRN Electronic Journal · May 2010
DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.1608145&lt;/ref&gt;

If Hecate's cult spread from Anatolia into Greece, it is possible it presented a conflict, as her role was already filled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by [[Artemis]] and [[Selene]]. This line of reasoning lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis that she was a foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the ''Theogony'', the Greek sources do not offer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans.

==Cult==
Shrines to Hecate were placed at doorways to both homes and cities with the belief that it would protect from restless dead and other spirits. Likewise, shrines to Hecate at three way crossroads were created where food offerings were left at the new moon to protect those who did so from spirits and other evils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/HekateCult.html |title=CULT OF HEKATE : Ancient Greek religion |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs were sacred to Hecate and associated with roads, domestic spaces, purification, and spirits of the dead. Dogs were also sacrificed to the road.&lt;ref&gt;As Sterckx (2002) observes, "The use of dog sacrifices at the gates and doors of the living and the dead as well as its use in travel sacrifices suggest that dogs were perceived as daemonic animals operating in the liminal or transitory realm between the domestic and the unknown, danger-stricken outside world". Roel Sterckx, ''The Animal and The Daemon in Early China'', State University of New York Press, 2002, pp 232-233. Sterckx explicitly recognizes the similarities between these ancient Chinese views of dogs and those current in Greek and Roman antiquity, and goes on to note "Dog sacrifice was also a common practice among the Greeks where the dog figured prominently as a guardian of the underworld." (Footnote 113, p318)&lt;/ref&gt;
This can be compared to Pausanias' report that in the Ionian city of Colophon in Asia Minor a sacrifice of a black female puppy was made to Hecate as "the wayside goddess", and Plutarch's observation that in Boeotia dogs were killed in purificatory rites. Dogs, with puppies often mentioned, were offered to Hecate at crossroads, which were sacred to the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp 233-234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctuaries===

Hecate was a popular divinity, and her cult was practiced with many local variations all over Greece and Western Anatolia.  However, she did not have many known sanctuaries or temples dedicated to her aside from her most famous temple in Lagina.  There was a Temple of Hecate in [[Argolis]]: "Over against the sanctuary of Eilethyia is a temple of Hekate [the goddess probably here identified with the apotheosed [[Iphigeneia]]], and the image is a work of Skopas. This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hekate, were made respectively by Polykleitos and his brother Naukydes."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 22. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  
There were also a shrine to Hecate in [[Aigina]], where she was very popular:
: "Of the gods, the Aiginetans worship most Hekate, in whose honour every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thrakian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron, and it has one face and one body. It was Alkamenes, in my opinion, who first made three images of Hekate attached to one another [in Athens]."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 30. 2 (trans. Jones)&lt;/ref&gt;
Aside from her own temples, Hecate was also worshipped in the sanctuaries of other gods, where she was apparently sometimes given her own space. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], where the priests, ''megabyzi'', officiated.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'', 14.1.23&lt;/ref&gt;  This sanctuary was called ''Hekatesion'' (Shrine of Hekate).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography 14. 1. 23 (trans. Jones)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hecate was also worshipped in the Temple of Athena in Titane: "In Titane there is also a sanctuary of Athena, into which they bring up the image of Koronis [mother of Asklepios] . . . The sanctuary is built upon a hill, at the bottom of which is an Altar of the Winds, and on it the priest sacrifices to the winds one night in every year. He also performs other secret rites [of Hekate] at four pits, taming the fierceness of the blasts [of the winds], and he is said to chant as well the charms of Medea."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 12. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
She was most commonly worshipped in nature, where she had many natural sanctuaries. An important sanctuary of Hecate was a holy cave on the island of [[Samothrake]] called Zerynthos: 
:"In Samothrake there were certain initiation-rites, which they supposed efficacious as a charm against certain dangers. In that place were also the mysteries of the Korybantes [Kabeiroi] and those of Hekate and the Zerinthian cave, where they sacrificed dogs. The initiates supposed that these things save [them] from terrors and from storms."&lt;ref&gt;Suidas s.v. All' ei tis humôn en Samothraikei memuemenos esti&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Cult at Lagina====
Hecate's most important sanctuary was [[Lagina]], a theocratic city-state in which the goddess was served by [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]].&lt;ref name="Burkert"/&gt;    

The temple is mentioned by [[Strabo]]:
:"Stratonikeia [in Karia, Asia Minor] is a settlement of Makedonians . . . There are two temples in the country of the Stratonikeians, of which the most famous, that of Hekate, is at Lagina; and it draws great festal assemblies every year."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography 14. 2. 15 (trans. Jones)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally [[Macedon]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] of [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratonikeia]], where she was the city's patron.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 14.2.25; Kraus 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thrace she played a role similar to that of lesser-[[Hermes]], namely a ruler of [[Liminality|liminal]] regions,particularly gates, and the wilderness. 

====Cult at Byzantium====

Hecate was greatly worshipped in [[Byzantium]]. She was said to have saved the city from Philip II, warning the citizens of a night time attack by a light in the sky, for which she was known as ''Hecate Lampadephoros''. The tale is preserved in the [[Suda]].&lt;ref&gt;"In 340 B.C., however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon.    In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to Hecate, they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]" William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003, pp. 5-6; "If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was Hecate. 

Hecate had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of "liminal places", in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions.    Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history.     A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate Hecate's defensive aid." Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, pp. 126-127; this story apparently survived in the works Hesychius of Miletus, who in all probability lived in the time of Justinian. His works survive only in fragments preserved in Photius and the ''[[Suda]]'', a Byzantine lexicon of the 10th century CE. The tale is also related by Stephanus of Byzantium and Eustathius.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hecate Phosphorus (Venus) she is said to have lit the sky during the Siege of Philip II in 340, revealing the attack to its inhabitants. The Byzantines dedicated a statue to her as the "lamp carrier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell |first=Thomas James |year=2017 |page=184 |title= Byzantium and the Bosporus |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZD1uDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198790525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deipnon====

The Athenian Greeks honored Hekate during the [[Deipnon]].  In Greek, deipnon means the evening meal, usually the largest meal of the day. Hekate's Deipnon is, at its most basic, a meal served to Hekate and the restless dead once a lunar month&lt;ref&gt;The play Plutus by Aristophanes (388 BCE), line 594 any translation will do or [[Benjamin Bickley Rogers]] is fine&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[new moon]].  The Deipnon is always followed the next day by the [[Noumenia]],&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 65, No.2, 1972 pages 291-297&lt;/ref&gt; when the first sliver of moon is visible, and then the Agathos Daimon the day after that.

The main purpose of the Deipnon was to honor Hekate and to placate the souls in her wake who "longed for vengeance."&lt;ref&gt;These are the biaiothanatoi, aoroi and ataphoi (cf. Rohde, i. 264 f., and notes, 275-277, ii. 362, and note, 411-413, 424-425), whose enthumion, the quasi-technical word designating their longing for vengeance, was much dreaded. See Heckenbach, p. 2776 and references.&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary purpose was to purify the household and to atone for bad deeds a household member may have committed that offended Hekate, causing her to withhold her favor from them.  The Deipnon consists of three main parts: 1) the meal that was set out at a crossroads, usually in a shrine outside the entryway to the home&lt;ref&gt;Antiphanes, in Athenaeus, 313 B (2. 39 K), and 358 F; Melanthius, in Athenaeus, 325 B. Plato, Com. (i. 647. 19 K), Apollodorus, Melanthius, Hegesander, Chariclides (iii. 394 K), Antiphanes, in Athenaeus, 358 F; Aristophanes, Plutus, 596.&lt;/ref&gt; 2) an expiation sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Hekate's Suppers, by K. F. Smith. Chapter in the book The Goddess Hekate: Studies in Ancient Pagan and Christian Philosophy edited by Stephen Ronan.  Pages 57 to 64&lt;/ref&gt; and 3) purification of the household.&lt;ref&gt;Roscher, 1889; Heckenbach, 2781; Rohde, ii. 79, n. 1. also Ammonius (p. 79, Valckenaer)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AN00866037 001 l.jpg|thumb|Triple Hecate]]
Hecate was generally represented as three-formed. This has been speculated as being connected with the appearance of the full moon, half moon, and new moon.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Seemann (1884), ''The Mythology of Greece and Rome'', p. 178.
Later authors speculated that Triple Hecate was the goddess of the moon with three forms: as Selene, the moon in heaven; Artemis, the huntress on earth; Persephone, the destroyer in the underworld and queen of hell.
Harry E. Wedeck, ''A Treasury of Witchcraft'' (Published by Gramercy, 1994. Hardcover. Condition: New. book), p. 203 {{ISBN|9994898906}}[https://www.amazon.com/Treasury-Witchcraft/dp/9994898906/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514253657&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=+A+Treasury+of+Witchcraft] [[Sarah Amelia Scull]] (1880), ''Greek Mythology Systematized'', p. 263.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm0ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=hecate+persephone&amp;dq=Greek_Mythology_Systematized+selene+arthmis+persephone]&lt;/ref&gt;
As a virgin goddess, she remained unmarried and had no regular consort, though some traditions named her as the mother of [[Scylla]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins'', Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers, 1974, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Greek depictions of Hecate were not three-formed. Farnell states: "The evidence of the monuments as to the character and significance of Hecate is almost as full as that of to express her manifold and mystic nature."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Lewis Richard Farnell, (1896). "Hecate in Art", ''The Cults of the Greek States.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known monument is a small terracotta found in Athens, with a dedication to Hecate, in writing of the style of the 6th century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at [[Athens]] to be earlier than the Persian invasion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

[[File:Hekate Kharites Glyptothek Munich 60.jpg|thumb|left|Triple Hecate and the [[Charites]], Attic, 3rd century BCE ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]
The 2nd-century travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] stated that Hecate was first depicted in triplicate by the sculptor [[Alkamenes]] in the Greek Classical period of the late 5th century BCE&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; which was placed before the temple of the Wingless Nike in Athens. Greek anthropomorphic conventions of art resisted representing her with three faces: a votive sculpture from Attica of the 3rd century BCE (''illustration, left''), shows three single images against a column; round the column of Hecate dance the [[Charites]]. Some classical portrayals show her as a triplicate goddess holding a torch, a key, serpents, daggers and numerous other items.&lt;ref&gt;Hekate Her Sacred Fires, ed. Sorita d'Este, Avalonia, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of both a single form Hekate and triple formed, as well as occasional four headed descriptions continued throughout her history.

In Egyptian-inspired Greek esoteric writings connected with [[Hermes Trismegistus]], and in magical papyri of [[Late Antiquity]] she is described as having three heads: one dog, one [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], and one horse. In other representations her animal heads include those of a cow and a boar.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, Wendy Doniger,'' Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Hecate's triplicity is elsewhere expressed in a more Hellenic fashion in the vast frieze of the great [[Pergamon Altar]], now in Berlin, wherein she is shown with three bodies, taking part in the battle with the Titans. In the [[Argos|Argolid]], near the shrine of the [[Dioscuri]], Pausanias saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of [[Eileithyia]]; He reported the image to be the work of [[Scopas]], stating further, "This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hecate, were made respectively by [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polycleitus]] and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon." (''Description of Greece'' 2.22.7)

In the ''[[Argonautica]]'', a 3rd-century BCE [[Alexandria]]n epic based on early material,&lt;ref&gt;"The legend of the Argonauts is among the earliest known to the Greeks," observes Peter Green, ''The Argonautika'', 2007, Introduction, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason placates Hecate in a ritual prescribed by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight in a stream of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]]. He is told to sweeten the offering with a [[libation]] of [[honey]], then to retreat from the site without looking back, even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonios Rhodios (tr. Peter Green), ''The Argonautika'', University of California Press, 2007, p140&lt;/ref&gt; All these elements betoken the rites owed to a [[chthonic]] deity.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A 4th-century BCE marble relief from Crannon in Thessaly was dedicated by a race-horse owner.&lt;ref&gt;This statue is in the [[British Museum]], inventory number 816.&lt;/ref&gt;
It shows Hecate, with a hound beside her, placing a wreath on the head of a mare.  She is commonly attended by a dog or dogs, and the most common form of offering was to leave meat at a crossroads. Images of her attended by a dog&lt;ref&gt;[http://timerift.net/?p=21 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024203741/http://timerift.net/?p=21 |date=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are also found at times when she is shown as in her role as mother goddess with child, and when she is depicted alongside the god [[Hermes]] and the goddess [[Kybele]] in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eidola.eu/images/907 |title=Images |publisher=Eidola.eu |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
[[File:William Blake 006.jpg|thumb|''[[The Triple Hecate]]'', 1795. [[William Blake]]]]
[[File:T16.5Hekate.jpg|thumb|right|A goddess, probably Hekate or else Artemis, is depicted with a bow, dog and twin torches.]]

Dogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. "In art and in literature Hecate is constantly represented as dog-shaped or as accompanied by a dog. Her approach was heralded by the howling of a dog. The dog was Hecate's regular sacrificial animal, and was often eaten in solemn sacrament."&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Mildred Franklin, ''The Lupercalia'', Columbia University, 1921, p67&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of dogs to Hecate is attested for Thrace, Samothrace, Colophon, and Athens.&lt;ref name="OCD671" /&gt;

It has been claimed that her association with dogs is "suggestive of her connection with birth, for the dog was sacred to [[Eileithyia]], Genetyllis, and other birth goddesses. Although in later times Hecate's dog came to be thought of as a manifestation of restless souls or demons who accompanied her, its docile appearance and its accompaniment of a Hecate who looks completely friendly in many pieces of ancient art suggests that its original signification was positive and thus likelier to have arisen from the dog's connection with birth than the dog's underworld associations."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead'', University of California Press, 1999, pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt; The association with dogs, particularly female dogs, could be explained by a metamorphosis myth in [[Lycophron]]: the friendly looking female dog accompanying Hecate was originally the Trojan Queen Hekabe, who leapt into the sea after the fall of Troy and was transformed by Hecate into her familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LycophronAlexandra.html|title=LYCOPHRON, ALEXANDRA&amp;nbsp;– Theoi Classical Texts Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metamorphosis myth explains why the polecat is also associated with Hecate.  From [[Antoninus Liberalis]]:
"At Thebes Proitos had a daughter Galinthias. This maiden was playmate and companion of Alkmene, daughter of Elektryon. As the birth throes for Herakles were pressing on Alkmene, the Moirai (Fates) and Eileithyia (Birth-Goddess), as a favour to Hera, kept Alkmene in continuous birth pangs. They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished.

At all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene’s pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel (or polecat), making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat. Hekate felt sorry for this transformation of her appearance and appointed her a sacred servant of herself."&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 29, translation by Francis Celoria, Psychology Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Aelian told a different story of a woman transformed into a polecat:  ""I have heard that the polecat was once a human being. It has also reached my hearing that Gale was her name then; that she was a dealer in spells and a sorceress (Pharmakis); that she was extremely incontinent, and that she was afflicted with abnormal sexual desires. Nor has it escaped my notice that the anger of the goddess Hekate transformed it into this evil creature. May the goddess be gracious to me: fables and their telling I leave to others."&lt;ref&gt;On the Characteristics of Animals by Aelian, translated by Alwyn Faber Scholfield, Harvard University Press, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], drawing on the etymological speculation of [[Apollodorus of Athens]], notes that the [[red mullet]] is sacred to Hecate, "on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is ''trimorphos'', of a triple form". The Greek word for mullet was ''trigle'' and later ''trigla''. He goes on to quote a fragment of verse "O mistress Hecate, Trioditis / With three forms and three faces / Propitiated with mullets".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duke Yonge, tr., ''The Learned Banqueters'', H.G. Bohn, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Greek concepts of pollution, Parker observes, "The fish that was most commonly banned was the red mullet (''trigle''), which fits neatly into the pattern. It 'delighted in polluted things,' and 'would eat the corpse of a fish or a man'. Blood-coloured itself, it was sacred to the blood-eating goddess Hecate. It seems a symbolic summation of all the negative characteristics of the creatures of the deep."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parker, ''Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion'', Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 362-363.&lt;/ref&gt; At Athens, it is said there stood a statue of Hecate ''Triglathena'', to whom the red mullet was offered in sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin Leake, ''The Topography of Athens'', London, 1841, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; After mentioning that this fish was sacred to Hecate, Alan Davidson writes, "Cicero, Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Pliny, Seneca and Suetonius have left abundant and interesting testimony to the red mullet fever which began to affect wealthy Romans during the last years of the Republic and really gripped them in the early Empire. The main symptoms were a preoccupation with size, the consequent rise to absurd heights of the prices of large specimens, a habit of keeping red mullet in captivity, and the enjoyment of the highly specialized aesthetic experience induced by watching the color of the dying fish change."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davidson, ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Ten Speed Press, 2002, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[frog]], which was also the symbol of the similarly-named Egyptian goddess [[Heqet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armour |first=Robert A. |year=2001 |title=Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |isbn= |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also become sacred to Hecate in modern Pagan literature, possibly due in part to its ability to cross between two elements.&lt;ref&gt;Varner, Gary R. (2007). ''Creatures in the Mist: Little People, Wild Men and Spirit Beings Around the World: A Study in Comparative Mythology'', p. 135. New York: Algora Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87586-546-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her three-headed representations, discussed above, Hecate often has one or more animal heads, including cow, dog, boar, serpent and horse.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, Wendy Doniger, ''Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 195; "Hecate" article, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
Hecate was closely associated with plant lore and the concoction of medicines and [[poison]]s. In particular she was thought to give instruction in these closely related arts. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' mentions that [[Medea]] was taught by Hecate, "I have mentioned to you before a certain young girl whom Hecate, daughter of Perses, has taught to work in drugs."&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Hunter, ''The Argonautica of Apollonius'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 142, citing Apollonius of Rhodes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess is described as wearing oak in fragments of [[Sophocles]]' lost play ''The Root Diggers'' (or ''The Root Cutters''), and an ancient commentary on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica (3.1214) describes her as having a head surrounded by serpents, twining through branches of oak.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taxus baccata|yew]] in particular was sacred to Hecate.

{{quote|Greeks held the yew to be sacred to Hecate... Her attendants draped wreathes of yew around the necks of black bulls which they slaughtered in her honor and yew boughs were burned on funeral pyres. The yew was associated with the alphabet and the scientific name for yew today, ''taxus'', was probably derived from the Greek word for yew, ''toxos'', which is hauntingly similar to ''toxon'', their word for bow and ''toxicon'', their word for poison. It is presumed that the latter were named after the tree because of its superiority for both bows and poison.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Suffness (Ed.), ''Taxol: Science and Applications'', CRC Press, 1995, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hecate was said to favor offerings of [[garlic]], which was closely associated with her cult.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Plants of Life, Plants of Death'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1998, p. 143; Fragkiska Megaloudi, ''Plants and Diet in Greece From Neolithic to Classic Periods'', Archaeopress, 2006, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also sometimes associated with [[Mediterranean Cypress|cypress]], a tree symbolic of death and the underworld, and hence sacred to a number of chthonic deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frieze | first = Henry | authorlink = |author2=Dennison, Walter | title = Virgil's Aeneid | publisher = American Book Company | year = 1902 | location = New York | pages = N111 | url = | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other plants (often poisonous, medicinal and/or psychoactive) are associated with Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;"Hecate had a "botanical garden" on the island of Colchis where the following alkaloid plants were kept: Akoniton (''Aconitum napellus''), Diktamnon (''Dictamnus albus''), Mandragores (Mandragora officinarum), Mekon (''Papaver somniferum''), Melaina (''Claviceps pupurea''), Thryon (''Atropa belladona''), and ''Cochicum'' [...]" Margaret F. Roberts, Michael Wink, ''Alkaloids: Biochemistry, Ecology, and Medicinal Applications'', Springer, 1998, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[aconitum|aconite]] (also called ''hecateis''),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', Penguin Books, 1977, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], [[Origanum dictamnus|dittany]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]]. It has been suggested that the use of dogs for digging up mandrake is further corroboration of the association of this plant with Hecate; indeed, since at least as early as the 1st century CE, there are a number of attestations to the apparently widespread practice of using dogs to dig up plants associated with magic.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Plants of Life, Plants of Death'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1998, pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries and crossroads===
[[File:Coin of the Bactrian king Agathokles.jpg|thumb|The coins of [[Agathocles of Bactria]] (ruled 190-180 BCE), show [[Zeus]] holding Hecate in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA103]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Hecate was associated with borders, city walls, doorways, crossroads and, by extension, with realms outside or beyond the world of the living. She appears to have been particularly associated with being 'between' and hence is frequently characterized as a "[[Liminal deity|liminal]]" goddess. "Hecate mediated between regimes—[[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]—but also between mortal and divine spheres."&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie MacLachlan, Judith Fletcher, ''Virginity Revisited: Configurations of The Unpossessed Body'', University of Toronto Press, 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This liminal role is reflected in a number of her cult titles: ''[[Apotrope|Apotropaia]]'' (that turns away/protects); ''Enodia'' (on the way); ''Propulaia''/''Propylaia'' (before the gate); ''Triodia''/''Trioditis'' (who frequents [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]]); ''Klêidouchos'' (holding the keys), etc.

{{quote|As a goddess expected to avert harmful or destructive spirits from the house or city over which she stood guard and to protect the individual as she or he passed through dangerous liminal places, Hecate would naturally become known as a goddess who could also ''refuse'' to avert the demons, or even drive them on against unfortunate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|It was probably her role as guardian of entrances that led to Hecate's identification by the mid fifth century with [[Enodia]], a [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] goddess. Enodia's very name ("In-the-Road") suggests that she watched over entrances, for it expresses both the possibility that she stood on the main road into a city, keeping an eye on all who entered, and in the road in front of private houses, protecting their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This function would appear to have some relationship with the [[Iconography|iconographic]] association of Hecate with keys, and might also relate to her appearance with two torches, which when positioned on either side of a gate or door illuminated the immediate area and allowed visitors to be identified. "In [[Byzantium]] small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as a deity of protection. When [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions."&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary And The Creation of Christian Constantinople'', Routledge, 1994, pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Hecate's close association with dogs derived in part from the use of watchdogs, who, particularly at night, raised an alarm when intruders approached. Watchdogs were used extensively by Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=490 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cult images and altars of Hecate in her triplicate or trimorphic form were placed at three-way [[Crossroads (road)|crossroads]] (though they also appeared before private homes and in front of city gates).&lt;ref name="OCD671" /&gt; In this form she came to be identified with the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Diana (mythology)|Diana Trivia]] ("of the three ways"). In what appears to be a 7th-century indication of the survival of cult practices of this general sort, [[Saint Eligius]], in his ''Sermo'' warns the sick among his recently converted flock in Flanders against putting "devilish charms at springs or trees or crossroads",&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Porterfield, ''Healing in the history of Christianity'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Saint Ouen]] would urge them "No Christian should make or render any devotion to the deities of the trivium, where three roads meet...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm Saint Ouen, ''Vita Eligii'' book II.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820234709/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm |date=20 August 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Hecate, "[t]he dog is a creature of the threshold, the guardian of doors and portals, and so it is appropriately associated with the frontier between life and death, and with demons and ghosts which move across the frontier. The yawning gates of [[Hades]] were guarded by the monstrous watchdog [[Cerberus]], whose function was to prevent the living from entering the underworld, and the dead from leaving it."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cavendish, ''The Powers of Evil in Western Religion, Magic and Folk Belief'', Routledge, 1975, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
===Classical period===
[[File:Hécate - Mallarmé.png|thumb|right|Hecate, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess of the crossroads; drawing by [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] in ''Les Dieux Antiques, nouvelle mythologie illustrée'' in Paris, 1880]]

Hecate has been characterized as a pre-Olympian [[chthonic]] goddess.
The first literature mentioning Hecate is the ''[[Theogony]]'' by [[Hesiod]]:
{{blockquote|text=And she conceived and bore Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos honored above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honor also in starry heaven, and is honored exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favor according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honor comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favorably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 411–425].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Hesiod, she held sway over many things:
{{blockquote|text=Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will. She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then, albeit her mother's only child, she is honored amongst all the deathless gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 429–452].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hesiod]] emphasizes that Hecate was an only child, the daughter of [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], the sister of [[Leto]] (the mother of [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]]). Grandmother of the three cousins was [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] the ancient Titaness who personified the moon.

Hesiod's inclusion and praise of Hecate in the ''[[Theogony]]'' has been troublesome for scholars, in that he seems to hold her in high regard, while the testimony of other writers, and surviving evidence, suggests that this may have been the exception. One theory is that [[Hesiod]]'s original village had a substantial Hecate following and that his inclusion of her in the ''Theogony'' was a way of adding to her prestige by spreading word of her among his readers.&lt;ref name="Restless_Dead"&gt;Johnston, Sarah Iles, (1991). ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece''. {{ISBN|0-520-21707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that Hekate was mainly a household god and humble household worship could have been more pervasive and yet not mentioned as much as temple worship.&lt;ref&gt;Household and Family Religion in Antiquity by John Bodel and Saul M. Olyan, page 221, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Athens Hecate, along with Zeus, Hermes, Hestia, and Apollo, were very important in daily life as they were the main gods of the household.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labrys.gr/index.php?l=householdworship#1|title=Λ Α Β Ρ Υ Σ :: Λατρευτική κοινότητα Λάβρυς|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that the special position given to Hecate by Zeus is upheld throughout her history by depictions found on coins depicting Hecate on the hand of Zeus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/baktria/kings/agathokles/t.html |title=Baktria, Kings, Agathokles, ancient coins index with thumbnails |publisher=WildWinds.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted in more recent research presented by d'Este and Rankine.&lt;ref&gt;d'Este &amp; Rankine, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AN01020070 001 l.jpg|thumb|Hecate by Richard Cosway]]

In the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], Hecate is called the "tender-hearted", a [[euphemism]] perhaps intended to emphasize her concern with the disappearance of [[Persephone]], when she assisted [[Demeter]] with her search for Persephone following her abduction by Hades, suggesting that Demeter should speak to the god of the sun, [[Helios]].  Subsequently, she became Persephone's companion on her yearly journey to and from the realms of Hades; serving as a [[psychopomp]]. Because of this association, Hecate was one of the chief goddesses of the Eleusinian Mysteries, alongside Demeter and Persephone.&lt;ref name="Charles M 1986 pp. 307-318"/&gt;

Variations in interpretations of Hecate's role or roles can be traced in classical Athens. In two fragments of [[Aeschylus]] she appears as a great goddess. In [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] she is characterized as the mistress of witchcraft and the [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]].

One surviving group of stories{{clarify|date=November 2017}} suggests how Hecate might have come to be incorporated into the Greek pantheon without affecting the privileged position of Artemis. Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with [[Iphigeneia]]. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal's suicide.&lt;ref name="Restless_Dead"/&gt;

===Hellenistic period to Late Antiquity===
Hecate is the primary feminine figure in the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' (2nd-3rd century CE),&lt;ref&gt;The ''Chaldean Oracles'' is a collection of literature that date from somewhere between the 2nd century and the late 3rd century, the recording of which is traditionally attributed to Julian the Chaldaean or his son, Julian the Theurgist. The material seems to have provided background and explanation related to the meaning of these pronouncements, and appear to have been related to the practice of theurgy, pagan magic that later became closely associated with Neoplatonism, see{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=316 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she is associated in fragment 194 with a ''strophalos'' (usually translated as a spinning top, or wheel, used in magic) "Labour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate."&lt;ref&gt;English translation used here from: William Wynn Wescott (tr.), ''The Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster'', 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to refer to a variant of the device mentioned by Psellus.&lt;ref&gt;"A top of Hekate is a golden sphere enclosing a lapis lazuli in its middle that is twisted through a cow-hide leather thong and having engraved letters all over it. [Diviners] spin this sphere and make invocations. Such things they call charms, whether it is the matter of a spherical object, or a triangular one, or some other shape. While spinning them, they call out unintelligible or beast-like sounds, laughing and flailing at the air. [Hekate] teaches the ''taketes'' to operate, that is the movement of the top, as if it had an ineffable power. It is called the top of Hekate because it is dedicated to her. In her right hand she held the source of the virtues. But it is all nonsense." As quoted in Frank R. Trombley, ''Hellenic Religion and Christianization, C. 370-529'', Brill, 1993, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hellenistic syncretism, Hecate also became closely associated with [[Isis]]. [[Lucius Apuleius]] in  ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (2nd century) equates Juno, Bellona, Hecate and Isis:
{{quote|Some call me Juno, others Bellona of the Battles, and still others Hecate. Principally the Ethiopians which dwell in the Orient, and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' 11.47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[syncretism]] during [[Late Antiquity]] of Hellenistic and late Babylonian ("[[Chaldean mythology|Chaldean]]") elements, Hecate was identified with [[Ereshkigal]], the underworld counterpart of [[Inanna]] in the Babylonian cosmography. In the Michigan magical papyrus (inv. 7), dated to the late 3rd or early 4th century CE, ''Hecate Ereschigal'' is invoked against fear of punishment in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Dieter Betz]], "Fragments from a Catabasis Ritual in a Greek Magical Papyrus", ''History of Religions'' '''19''',4 (May 1980):287-295). The goddess appears as ''Hecate Ereschigal'' only in the heading: in the spell itself only ''Erschigal'' is called upon with protective magical words and gestures.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Strmiska (2005) claimed that Hecate, conflated with the figure of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], appears in late antiquity and in the early medieval period as part of an "emerging legend complex" known as "[[Diana (mythology)#The "Society of Diana"|The Society of Diana]]"&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with gatherings of women, the moon, and witchcraft that eventually became established "in the area of Northern Italy, southern Germany, and the western Balkans."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Strmiska, ''Modern paganism in world cultures'', ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of the Roman origins of many European folk traditions related to Diana or Hecate was explicitly advanced at least as early as 1807&lt;ref&gt;Francis Douce, Illustrations of Shakspeare, and of Ancient Manners, 1807, p. 235-243.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected{{dubious|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--grasping at straws to push a pet theory here--&gt; in etymological claims by early modern lexicographers from the 17th to the 19th century, connecting ''hag, hexe'' "witch" to the name of Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Minsheu]] and [[William Somner]] (17th century), [[Edward Lye]] of Oxford (1694-1767), [[Johann Georg Wachter]], ''Glossarium Germanicum'' (1737), [[Walter Whiter]], ''Etymologicon Universale'' (1822)&lt;/ref&gt; Such derivations are today proposed only by a minority&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gerald Milnes, ''Signs, Cures, &amp; Witchery'', Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2007, p. 116; Samuel X. Radbill, "The Role of Animals in Infant Feeding", in ''American Folk Medicine: A Symposium'' Ed. Wayland D. Hand. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"Many have been caught by the obvious resemblance of the Gr. ''Hecate'', but the letters agree to closely, contrary to the laws of change, and the Mid. Ages would surely have had an unaspirated Ecate handed down to them; no Ecate or Hecate appears in the M. Lat. or Romance writings in the sense of witch, and how should the word have spread through all German lands?" Jacob Grimm, ''Teutonic Mythology'', 1835, (English translation 1900).
The actual etymology of ''hag'' is Germanic and unrelated to the name of Hecate. See e.g. Mallory, J.P, Adams, D.Q. ''The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World''. Oxford University Press, 2006. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;
A medieval commentator has suggested a link connecting the word "jinx" with Hecate: "The Byzantine polymath [[Michael Psellus]] [...] speaks of a bullroarer, consisting of a golden sphere, decorated throughout with symbols and whirled on an oxhide thong. He adds that such an instrument is called a ''iunx'' (hence "jinx"), but as for the significance says only that it is ineffable and that the ritual is sacred to Hecate."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic saints: the Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 100; Writing at some length about the ancient greek 'iunx' [[Marcel Detienne]] never mentions any connection to Hecate, see Detienne M, ''The Gardens of Adonis'', Princeton UP, 1994, pp.83-9..&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare mentions Hecate both before the end of the 16th century ([[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], 1594-96), and just after, in [[Macbeth (play)|Macbeth]] (1605): specifically, in the title character's "dagger" [[soliloquy]]: "Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfs.sparknotes.com/macbeth/page_50.html|title=No Fear Shakespeare: Macbeth: Act 2, Scene 1, Page 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern reception===
In 1929, Lewis Brown, an expert on religious cults, connected the 1920s [[Blackburn Cult]] (also known as, "The Cult of the Great Eleven,") with Hecate worship rituals.  He noted that the cult regularly practiced dog sacrifice and had secretly buried the body of one of its "queens" with seven dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Weird Rituals Laid to Primitive Minds, Los Angeles Examiner, October 14, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Samuel Fort noted additional parallels, to include the cult's focus on mystic and typically nocturnal rites, its female dominated membership, the sacrifice of other animals (to include horses and mules), a focus on the mystical properties of roads and portals, and an emphasis on death, healing, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;"Cult of the Great Eleven," Samuel Fort, 2014, 320 pages. ASIN B00OALI9O4&lt;/ref&gt;

As a "goddess of witchcraft", Hecate has been incorporated in various systems of [[modern witchcraft]], [[Wicca]] and [[Neopaganism]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g.[[Sabina Magliocco]], ''Witching Culture: Folklore and Neopaganism in America'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p79&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases associated with the [[Wild Hunt]] of Germanic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, ''Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions'', 1999, pp 303-304; For a 'moon magick' reference to Hecate as "Lady of the Wild Hunt and witchcraft" see: D. J. Conway, ''Moon Magick: Myth &amp; Magic, Crafts &amp; Recipes, Rituals &amp; Spells'', Llewellyn, 1995, p157&lt;/ref&gt; in others as part of a reconstruction of specifically Greek polytheism, in English also known as "[[Hellenismos]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hellenion (USA)]] {{cite web|url=http://hellenion.org/|title=Hellenion|publisher=}}. {{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hellenionstemenos/Home/festivals/hekatesdeipnon|title=Hekate's Deipnon&amp;nbsp;– Temenos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wicca]], Hecate has in some cases become identified with the "Crone" aspect of the "[[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite book |first=Donna |last=Wilshire |title=Virgin mother crone: myths and mysteries of the triple goddess |location=Rochester, VT |publisher=Inner Traditions International |year=1994 |page=213 |isbn=0-89281-494-2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate is also the namesake of the [[100 Hekate|hundredth numbered asteroid]], which was discovered by American astronomer [[James Craig Watson]] on July 11, 1868.  Its adopted name alludes to it as being the hundredth named asteroid ('hekaton' being the Greek for 'hundred').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">'''Holeums''' are hypothetical stable, quantized gravitational bound states of [[Primordial black hole|primordial]] or [[micro black holes]]. Holeums were proposed by L. K. Chavda and Abhijit Chavda in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/19/11/311 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; They have all the properties associated with [[cold dark matter]]. Holeums are not [[black holes]], even though they are made up of black holes.

==Properties==

The [[binding energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a holeum that consists of two identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308054 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{n}=-\frac{mc^{2}\alpha_{g}^{2}}{4n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the principal [[quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,...,\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational counterpart of the [[fine structure constant]]. The latter is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}G}{\hbar c}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]] divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;;
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum;
: &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

The ''n''th excited state of a holeum then has a mass that is given by

: &lt;math&gt;m_{H}=2m+\frac{E_{n}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The holeum's atomic transitions cause it to emit [[gravitational radiation]].

The radius of the ''n''th excited state of a holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{n}=\left(  \frac{n^{2}R}{\alpha_{g}^{2}}\right)  \left(  \frac{\pi^{2}}{{8}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;R=\left(  \frac{2mG}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.

The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the [[hydrogen atom]]. It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The holeum can therefore be considered to be a [[dark matter]] particle.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yu. Khlopov, [https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0801.0116 Primordial Black Holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macro holeums and their properties==

A macro holeum is a quantized gravitational bound state of a large number of micro black holes. The energy eigenvalues of a macro holeum consisting of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0703 Quantized Gravitational Radiation from Black Holes and other macro holeums in the Low Frequency Domain]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k}=-\frac{p^{2}mc^{2}}{2n_{k}^{2}}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\gg2&lt;/math&gt;. The system is simplified by assuming that all the micro black holes in the core are in the same quantum state described by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outermost, &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; micro black hole is in an arbitrary quantum state described by the principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''physical radius'' of the bound state is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{k}=\frac{\pi^{2}kRn_{k}^{2}}{16p^{2}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{k}=mk\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Schwarzschild radius of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;R_{k}=kR\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] of the system is given by

: &lt;math&gt;S_{k}=k^{2}S\left( 1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of the individual micro black holes that constitute the macro holeum.

== The ground state of macro holeums ==

The [[ground state]] of macro holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The holeum has maximum binding energy, minimum physical radius, maximum Schwarzschild radius, maximum mass, and maximum entropy in this state.

Such a system can be thought of as consisting of a gas of &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; free (&lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) micro black holes that is bounded and therefore isolated from the outside world by a solitary outermost micro black hole whose principal quantum number is &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stability ==

It can be seen from the above equations that the condition for the stability of holeums is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relations &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha _{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{g}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; into this inequality, the condition for the stability of holeums can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;m_{P}\left( 6\right) ^{\frac{1}{4}}\left( \frac{n}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The ground state of holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which gives us &lt;math&gt;m&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the condition for stability. Thus, the ground state of holeums is guaranteed to be always stable.

== Black holeums ==

A holeum is a black hole if its physical radius is less than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius, i.e. if

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k}\leqslant R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Such holeums are termed black holeums. Substituting the expressions for &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and simplifying, we obtain the condition for a holeum to be a black holeum to be

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi n_{k}}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state, which is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Black holeums are an example of black holes with internal structure. Black holeums are quantum black holes whose internal structure can be fully predicted by means of the quantities &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Holeums and cosmology ==

Holeums are speculated to be the progenitors of a class of short duration [[gamma ray bursts]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AdSpR..40.1236A Holeums as potential candidates for some short-lived gamma ray bursts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdSpR..46..468D Primordial black holes and holeums as progenitors of galactic diffuse gamma-ray background]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also speculated that holeums give rise to [[cosmic rays]] of all energies, including [[ultra-high-energy cosmic rays]].&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0454 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from decays of holeums in Galactic Halos]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BarbourCountyCourthouse.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The [[Barbour County Courthouse]] (1903–05) in Philippi, West Virginia, USA; its exterior is faced entirely in Hummelstown brownstone.]]

'''Hummelstown brownstone''' is a medium-grain, dense [[sandstone]] [[quarried]] near [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]] in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA. It is a dark [[brownstone]] with reddish to purplish hues, and was once widely used as a building stone in the United States.

The [[Hummelstown Brownstone Company]] quarried high quality brownstone near Hummelstown from 1863 to 1929 and sold it across the U.S. as a preferred masonry material of builders. Because of its durability, it was used for a wide range of building projects, especially as trim and ornamentation on large buildings, but also as bridge piers and in the foundations and walls of buildings or the sculptures that decorated them. Frequently, entire buildings were dressed in Hummelstown brownstone. An outstanding example of this is the [[Barbour County Courthouse]] (1903–05) in [[Philippi, West Virginia|Philippi]], [[West Virginia]].

Hummelstown brownstone and similar sandstones were known as “[[Freestone (masonry)|freestone]]” because of properties allowing them to be worked freely in every direction, rather than in one direction along a “grain”. This characteristic made them very popular with stone cutters and masons.

The '''Irrawaddy''' or, officially, '''Ayeyarwady&lt;ref&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/8th-uncsgn-docs/inf/8th_UNCSGN_econf.94_INF.75.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; River''' ({{MYname|MY=ဧရာဝတီမြစ်|MLCTS=erawa.ti mrac}}, {{IPA-my|ʔèjàwədì mjɪʔ|pron}}, also spelt '''Ayeyarwaddy'''{{cn|date=August 2018}}) is a river that flows from north to south through [[Myanmar]]. It is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. Originating from the confluence of the [[N'Mai River|N'mai]] and [[Mali River|Mali]] rivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Irrawaddy |volume=14 |page=839| first=James George |last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; it flows relatively straight North-South before emptying through the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] into the [[Andaman Sea]]. Its [[drainage basin]] of about {{convert|404200|km2}} covers a large part of Burma. After [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem, it is sometimes referred to as '[[Mandalay (poem)|The Road to Mandalay]]'.

As early as the sixth century, the river was used for trade and transport. Having developed an extensive network of [[irrigation|irrigation canals]], the river became important to the [[British Empire]] after it had colonized Burma. The river is still as vital today, as a considerable amount of (export) goods and traffic moves by river. Rice is produced in the Irrawaddy Delta, irrigated by water from the river.

In 2007, Myanmar's [[military dictatorship]] signed an agreement for the construction of seven [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]], yielding a total 13,360&amp;nbsp;MW, in the N'mai and Mali Rivers, including the 3,600&amp;nbsp;MW Myitsone Dam at the [[confluence]] of both rivers. Environmental organisations have raised concerns about the ecological impacts on the river's biodiverse [[ecosystem]]s. Animals potentially impacted include the threatened [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] and the [[Irrawaddy river shark]], an endangered species.

==Etymology==
The native Kachin people named the river Mali-Nmai-Hka.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Burmese name of Irrawaddy is derived from a [[Pali]] name for the [[Ravi River]] of [[India]], ''Irāvatī''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1999/2-99/aye.htm|title=Irrawaddy etymology|work=myanmar.gov.mm|accessdate=17 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217041606/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1999/2-99/aye.htm|archivedate=17 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Airavati'' (Pali ''Erāvatī'') was the Pali version of the name of the elephant mount of [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]], and [[Indra]] in Hinduism.

The Irrawaddy gives its name to the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] (''Orcaella brevirostris''), which is found in the lower reaches of the river and known to help fishermen who practice cast-net [[fishing]]. Though called Irrawaddy dolphin, it has been also found in the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Indian ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UEJcYiT5eoC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=ayeyarwady+river+bridges#PPA173,M1|title=Asian Marine Biology 1997:Investigation of Cetaceans in the Ayeyarwady River and Northern Coastal Waters of Myanmar|author=Brian D Smith|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=173|accessdate=6 October 2008|isbn=978-962-209-462-8|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111233731/https://books.google.com/books?id=7UEJcYiT5eoC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=ayeyarwady+river+bridges#PPA173,M1|archivedate=11 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinttun.mm.googlepages.com/irrawaddydolphin|title=Irrawaddy Dolphin|author=Tint Tun|accessdate=6 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725115205/http://tinttun.mm.googlepages.com/irrawaddydolphin|archivedate=25 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irrawaddy River bisects Myanmar from north to south and empties through the nine-armed [[Irrawaddy Delta]] into the Indian Ocean.

The Irrawaddy River arises by the [[confluence]] of the N'mai(Nam Gio) and Mali Rivers in [[Kachin State]]. Both the N'mai and Mali Rivers find their sources in the Himalayan [[glacier]]s of [[Upper Burma]] near 28° N.

Among the most well-known species in the river is the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] (''Orcaella brevirostris''), a [[euryhaline]] species of oceanic dolphin with a high and rounded forehead, lacking a beak. It is found in discontinuous sub-populations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the [[Bay of Bengal]] and South-East Asia.

Along the North-South course of the Irrawaddy River, a number of notably different ecoregions can be distinguished.

===Northern Mountains===
The streams of the Nmai and Mali that form the Irrawaddy originate in high and remote mountains near the border with [[Tibet]]. This part of Burma, which extends north from [[Myitkyina]] and the Irrawaddy confluence, lies entirely outside the tropics. Rain falls at all seasons of the year, but mostly in the summer. The valleys and lower hill ranges are covered with tropical and [[subtropical]] evergreen [[rainforest]] instead of monsoon (deciduous) forest. This region is characterised by subtropical and [[temperate]] forests of [[oak]] and [[pine]] are found at elevations above {{convert|900|m}}. This evergreen forest passes into sub-tropical pine forest at about {{convert|1500|m}} feet. Above {{convert|1800|m}}, are forests of [[rhododendron]]s, and that in turn into evergreen [[conifer]] forest above {{convert|2400|m}} feet.

===The Central Basin and Lowlands===
The Irrawaddy river basin covers an approximate area of 255 {{convert|81|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Irrawaddy River| author=L. Dudley Stamp| journal=The Geographical Journal| year=May 1940| volume=95 | issue = 5 | pages=329–352| jstor=1787471 | doi=10.2307/1787471}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Basin consists of the valley of the middle Irrawaddy and lower [[Chindwin]]. It lies within the 'dry zone' and consists almost entirely of plains covered with the [[teak]]-dominated Irrawaddy Moist Deciduous Forest [[ecoregion]] surrounding drier patches of dry forests. The central basin receives little rain (ave 650mm per year) although it does flood quickly during the July–October storms. The one meteorological factor which does not vary greatly, and which is the most important for plant life, is atmospheric [[humidity]]. This is always high, except in the winter in certain localities. Humidity usually does not fall below 75% and is 90% or more for long periods during summer. Another feature is the prevalent southerly summer winds which erode the soil of the basin.

The natural habitats of this central zone have been much altered for farming and there are few protected areas.

====Irrawaddy dry forests====
The predominant trees of the drier patches are the thorny ''[[Terminalia oliveri]]'' and the hardwood dahat [[teak]] (''Tectona hamiltoniana'') with stands of Indaing [[Dipterocarpus]] tuberculatus which is cut for timber. The wildlife includes many birds, small mammals and reptiles such as the huge [[Burmese python]]. However, most of the large animals including the tiger have been hunted out or seen their habitats disappear.

===Irrawaddy Delta Area===
[[File:Muthupet.jpg|thumb|A [[mangrove forest]] system along the coast]]

The Irrawaddy River and its [[tributary|tributaries]] flow into the [[Andaman Sea]] through the Irrawaddy Delta. This [[ecoregion]] consists of [[mangrove]]s and freshwater [[swamp]] forests. It is an extremely fertile area because of the river-borne [[silt]] deposited in the delta. The upper and central portions of the delta are almost entirely under [[Tillage|cultivation]], principally for rice. The southern portion of the ecoregion transitions into the [[Burmese Coast mangroves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im1404|name=Myanmar Coast mangroves|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is made up of fanlike [[marsh]]es with [[oxbow lake]]s, islands, and meandering [[stream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0117|name=Irrawaddy Swamp Forests|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcbc.org.ph/wetlands/myanmar/mmr_irrdel.htm Wetlands in Myanmar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515195853/http://www.arcbc.org.ph/wetlands/myanmar/mmr_irrdel.htm |date=15 May 2008 }}, Asian Regional Centre for Biodiversity Conservation.

Birds of the delta are both winter visitors and passage migrants including [[great cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax carbo''), a wide variety of [[Anatidae]], [[Eurasian coot]] (''Fulica atra''), about thirty species of [[bird migration|migratory shorebirds]], the [[whiskered tern]] (''Chlidonias hybrida''), the [[Caspian tern]] (''Hydroprogne caspia''), and the [[brown-headed gull]] (''Larus brunnicephalus''), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the [[lesser sand plover]] (''Charadrius mongolus''), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast of the delta. The [[wood sandpiper]] (''Tringa glareola'') and [[red junglefowl]] (''Gallus gallus'') are also abundant.

In the late 19th century, the [[spot-billed pelican]] (''Pelecanus philippensis'') nested in huge numbers in south Burma. One colony on the [[Sittaung River]] plain to the east of the delta was described in November 1877 as covering {{convert|300|km2|sqmi|sigfig=1}} and containing millions of birds. Immense colonies still bred in the area in 1910, but the birds had disappeared completely by 1939. Small numbers were regularly reported in the delta in the 1940s, but no breeding sites were located. {{As of|2010}}, no pelicans have been recorded, and it may well be that the species is now extinct in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=3812&amp;m=0 BirdLife Species Factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104234204/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=3812&amp;m=0 |date=4 January 2009 }} on the range of breeding spot-billed pelican populations, retrieved 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus'') can be found in the southern part of the delta. The species was formerly abundant in coastal regions, but population numbers have decreased because of a combination of commercial skin hunting, habitat loss, drowning in fishing nets and over-collection of living animals to supply [[crocodile farm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121446935/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A population survey of the estuarine crocodile in the Ayeyarwady Delta], Oryx Volume 34 Issue 4, Pages 317 – 324.

==Tributaries==

The Irrawaddy River has five major tributaries. As they flow through the northern tip of Burma – the [[Kachin State]] – they cut long north-south [[alluvial]] plains and relatively narrow upland [[valley]]s between the {{convert|2000|to(-)|3000|m|sigfig=1}} mountain ridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugtext.org/library/books/McCoy/book/20.htm Burma: Sahibs in the Shan States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828011909/http://www.drugtext.org/library/books/McCoy/book/20.htm |date=28 August 2009 }}, [[The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia]] (1972), Alfred W. McCoy with Cathleen B. Read and Leonard P. Adams II. Chapter 3 "The Colonial Legacy", paragraph "Burma: Sahibs in the Shan States.

As early as the sixth century, ancestors of the Burmese were using the Irrawaddy river, which runs through the center of Burma, to gain power in the region through trade and transport on the China – [[India]] route. By the twelfth century, a well-developed network of [[canal]]s made for flourishing rice cultivation. Later, the river became a key economic tool of [[British Empire|Imperial British]] interests, who set up trading ports along its shores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294719/Irrawaddy-River Irrawaddy River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130832/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294719/Irrawaddy-River |date=28 April 2015 }} (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 6 August 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Irrawaddy is still the country's most important commercial waterway. Despite Mandalay's position as the chief rail and highway focus in northern Burma, a considerable amount of passenger and goods traffic moves by river. As the Irrawaddy Delta is one of the world's major rice-growing areas, one of the most important goods transported is rice. [[Teak]] logs – Myanmar is one of the world's top exporters – are floated down the river as large rafts. Before it is transported, teak has to be seasoned, because otherwise it won't float.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Teak |volume=26 |page=485 |first1=Dietrich |last1=Brandis |first2=James Sykes |last2=Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens by [[girdling]], a practice where a deep circular cut through bark and sap is made into the heartwood. Other major goods that are transported from the nation's heartlands to [[Yangon]] for export are other foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton, and local commodities.

Commercial transportation on the Irrawaddy is maintained for about {{convert|1300|km}}: from [[Hinthada]] to Bhamo ({{convert|1080|km}}) throughout the year, but from Bhamo to Myitkyina (200&amp;nbsp;km) for only seven months. More than {{convert|3200|km}} of navigable waterways exist in the Irrawaddy delta, and there is a system of connecting canals. The Sittang is usable by smaller boats, but the [[Salween River]], because of its rapids, is navigable for less than {{convert|160|km}} from the sea. Small steamers and country boats also serve the coasts of the [[Rakhine State]] and [[Tanintharyi Region]]. On the [[Chindwin River]], transportation is carried on by steam or diesel vessels throughout the year up to [[Homalin]]—about 640&amp;nbsp;km from its confluence with the Irrawaddy. Seasonal navigation is carried on into [[Tamanthi]], which is {{convert|57|mi|km}} by river above Homalin.

The Chindwin valley has no railroad and relies heavily on river transport. [[Chauk]], downstream from the confluence in the oil-field district, is a petroleum port. It is linked to Yangon by road and rail. [[Hinthada]], near the apex of the delta, is the rail junction for lines leading to [[Kyangin]] and [[Pathein|Bassein]] (Pathein). A ferry operates between Hinthada on the west bank and the railway station at Tharrawaw on the east bank.

==Dams==

Burma's [[Military junta|junta]] signed an agreement with [[China Power Investment Corporation]] in May 2007 for the construction of seven [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] along the Irrawaddy, [[Mali River|Mali]], and [[N'Mai River]] in Kachin State. The total planned output of all seven plants will be 15,160 MWs of electricity, making it the largest hydropower project in Burma, surpassing the 7,100 MW [[Tasang Dam]] in Shan State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kachinnews.com/index.php/articleopinion/feature/742-saviours-sought-to-halt-irrawaddy-river-dam-project.html ''Saviours Sought To Halt Irrawaddy River Dam Project''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229144607/http://www.kachinnews.com/index.php/articleopinion/feature/742-saviours-sought-to-halt-irrawaddy-river-dam-project.html |date=29 December 2016 }} (14 March 2009) Nawdin Lahpai on [http://www.kachinnews.com/index.php Kachin News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224062812/http://www.kachinnews.com/index.php |date=24 February 2017 }}.

Due to its location and size, construction of the Myitsone Dam has raised significant ecological and [[sociology|sociological]] concerns. According to the Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam Multipurpose Water Utilizing Project study, the maximum water level of the reservoir will be 290 metres. This makes for a flood zone of 766&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, compromising 47 villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmariversnetwork.org/images/stories/publications/english/dammingtheirrawaddy.pdf  ''Damming the Irrawaddy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229144636/http://www.burmariversnetwork.org/images/stories/publications/english/dammingtheirrawaddy.pdf |date=29 December 2016 }} p. 39 (2008) Chiang Mai (Kachin Environment Organization, [http://aksyu.com/ Kachin Development Networking Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227033119/http://aksyu.com/ |date=27 February 2012 }}.

Other consequences of the inundation include loss of farmland, loss of spawning habitat as fishes can not swim upstream anymore.

They report locals are also worried about the flooding of cultural sites in the flood zone. As with other large dam projects, the Myitsone Dam construction will alter the [[hydrology|hydrological]] characteristics of the river, e.g. preventing [[sediment]] from enriching riverbanks downstream, where it usually enriches the riverside foodproducing plains.&lt;ref&gt;William L.

He was a contributing editor of ''Birder's World'' magazine, culminating with an article about American Crow behavior observations of his own, plus his own watercolors of crows performing the behaviors in the text. He died with the wish of revising his 1980 ''Audubon Encyclopedia of North American Birds'', about which Roger Tory Peterson said never left his desk side. Birder's World published, before the crow article, a story about him, with a photograph of him at the University of North Carolina-- Chapel Hill biological station, with much concentration examining a specimen.

The [[United Nations]] has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate{{clarify|date=March 2017}} themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in [[Mombasa]], furthering delivery contract delays.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

==Dependency problems==
Although [[Adam Smith]] and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, [[Rwanda]] and then finally [[Burundi]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"/&gt; Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three [[BRIC]] nations (China, [[Russia]] and [[India]]) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
[[File:Map displaying landlocked Burundi's strife with finding a suitable export route.png|thumb|400px| Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were:

* dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or

&lt;br&gt;* dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or 
* dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red).
When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown).]]
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of [[Tanzania]] is poorly connected to the port of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt; Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through [[Mozambique]] around the same time due to violent civil conflict.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"/&gt; Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500&amp;nbsp;km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Other African countries===

* [[Mali]] had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours ([[Algeria]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]) were engaged in civil war around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The exception being Ghana which was under a military rule but did not have an active civil war
* The [[Central African Republic]]'s export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s [[Oubangui River]] water levels are too low for river travel.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Central Asia===

The mineral resource-rich countries of [[Central Asia]] and [[Mongolia]] offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: [[Kazakhstan]]’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Railways]] now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.&lt;ref&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the [[Soviet Union]]'s social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], resulting in revenue generation through the port of [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"/&gt;

===Nepal===
[[Nepal]] is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt; treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almaty Ministerial Conference==
In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows:
*Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays
*Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia
*Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market
*To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvements&lt;ref&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latite''' is an [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[volcanic rock]], with [[aphanitic]]-[[Phenocryst#Classification by phenocryst|aphyric]] to aphyric-[[porphyritic]] texture. Its [[mineral]] assemblage is usually alkali [[feldspar]] and [[plagioclase]] in approximately equal amounts. [[Quartz]] is less than five percent and is absent in a [[feldspathoid]]-bearing latite, and [[olivine]] is absent in a [[quartz]]-bearing latite. When quartz content is greater than five percent the rock is classified as [[quartz latite]].&lt;ref name=IUGS&gt;[http://geology.csupomona.edu/alert/igneous/igclass.htm Classification of Igneous Rocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930102012/http://geology.csupomona.edu/alert/igneous/igclass.htm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biotite]], [[hornblende]], [[pyroxene]] and scarce [[olivine]] or [[quartz]] are common accessory minerals.

Several non-sovereign entities are also included for informational purposes, with their parent state noted. 
The per capita data for many countries may be slightly inaccurate as population data may not be for the same year that the consumption data are. 
Population data were obtained from the [[List of countries by population]] in 2016, except for years other than 2016, in which case they were obtained from the Wikipedia pages for the corresponding countries/territories. [[kilowatt-hour#Definition|Average power]] per capita was calculated according to the formula:&lt;ref&gt;It is interesting to compare the average electric power consumed per capita with the person's [[basal metabolic rate]] (about 65 watts), the average power obtained by a human body at rest from the food metabolism.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Electric energy per capita [ in [[watt-hour]] ] = Total population electricity consumption [ in [[Watt-hour#Explanation|kW·h]]/yr ] * 1,000 /population.
:Electric power per capita [ in [[watt]] ] = Total population electricity consumption [ in [[Watt-hour#Explanation|kW·h]]/yr ] * 0.114077116 /population.

: 1 [[Watt-hour#Explanation|kW·h]]/yr = 1,000 Wh/(365.25 x 24)h = 0.11408 Watt

Halle received his bachelor's degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1932.

{{blockquote|As a young man, he worked for a railway company in Central America and later with a publishing house in New York. For a year, he did graduate study in anthropology at Harvard, then explored boundary rivers between Guatemala and Mexico by mule and dugout canoe.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;}}

He served in the US Army before WW II and in the Coast Guard during WW II. He was a Latin American specialist employed by the US State Department Policy Planning Staff from the mid 1940s to 1954. From 1954 to 1956 at the University of Virginia, he was a researcher on American foreign policy. He became in 1956 a professor at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva. He retired there as professor emeritus in 1973 but remained in Geneva.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

He was the author of 22 books.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1941 he received the [[John Burroughs Medal]] for ''Birds Against Men''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Murphy, Patrick D.|editor2=Gifford,Terry|editor3=Yamazato, Katsunori|title=Literature of nature: an international sourcebook|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw9qkwbIKCkC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Louis J. Halle, Jr. married Barbara Mark in 1946 and was the father of five children.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; His father was born in 1873 and immigrated to the USA via Ellis Island on 15 September 1905. The famous inventor and philanthropist [[Hiram Halle]] was a brother of Louis J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">'''Microbial electrosynthesis''' is a form of microbial electrocatalysis in which electrons are supplied to living microorganisms via a [[cathode]] in an electrochemical cell by applying an [[electric current]]. The electrons are then used by the microorganisms to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] to yield industrially relevant products. The electric current would ideally be produced by a renewable source of power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbio.asm.org/content/1/2/e00103-10 Microbial Electrosynthesis: Feeding Microbes Electricity To Convert Carbon Dioxide and Water to Multicarbon Extracellular Organic Compounds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is the opposite to that employed in a [[microbial fuel cell]], in which microorganisms transfer electrons from the oxidation of compounds to an anode to generate an electric current.

==Comparison to microbial electrolysis cells==
Microbial electrosynthesis is related to [[microbial electrolysis cell]]s (MEC). Both use the interactions of microorganisms with a cathode to reduce chemical compounds, but differ in the source of power for this process. In microbial
electrosynthesis electrons are supplied solely by the external electrical power source. In MECs, an electrical power source is used to augment the [[electrical potential]] produced by the microorganisms consuming a source of chemical energy such as [[acetic acid]]. The combined potential provided by the power source and the microorganisms is then sufficient to for example reduce [[hydrogen ion]]s to molecular [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_account/microbial_electrolysis_cell_turning_bacteria_into_hydogen_machines Microbial Electrolysis Cell - Turning Bacteria Into Hydrogen Machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Microbial electrosynthesis may be used to produce fuel from carbon dioxide using electrical energy generated by either traditional power stations or renewable electricity generation. It may also be used to produce speciality chemicals such as drug precursors through microbially assisted [[electrocatalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v8/n10/abs/nrmicro2422.html Microbial electrosynthesis — revisiting the electrical route for microbial production : Abstract : Nature Reviews Microbiology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial electrosynthesis can also be used to "power" plants. Plants can then be grown without sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/Open-Mind-Award-for-a-revolutionary-idea-.htm Open Mind Award for a revolutionary idea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stw.nl/nl/content/stw-reikt-open-mind-beurzen-en-simon-stevin-prijzen-uit David Strik's "dark photosynthesis" idea receiving Open Mind Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://resource.wur.nl/en/show/Producing-food-without-sunlight.htm Producing food without sunlight]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mount Ilgaz National Park''' ({{lang-tr|Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı}}) is a [[protected area]] established on June 2, 1976 and located on the [[Ilgaz Mountains]] at the borderline between [[Kastamonu Province]] and [[Çankırı Province]] in the western [[Black Sea Region]] of [[Turkey]]. Natural resources and its potential for recreational activities are the main values of the national park, which stretches over an area of {{convert|742.38|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="kkt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kastamonukulturturizm.gov.tr/belge/1-66027/milli-parklar.html |publisher=Kastamonu Kültür Turizm |title=Milli Parklar-Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ku"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://earsiv.kastamonu.edu.tr/jspui/bitstream/1/296/1/B2.%20Analysis%20of%20Terrain%20Usage%20in%20Kastamonu%20%E2%80%93Ilgaz%20Mountain.pdf |publisher=International Symposium on Environmental Protection and Planning: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) Applications (ISEPP) 28–29 June 2011, Izmir-Turkey |title=Analysis of Terrain Usage in Kastamonu-Ilgaz Mountain Natural Park |author1=Aydınözü, Duran Aydinozu  |author2=Ünal İbret, Miraç Aydın  |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The terrain structure of the Mount Ilgaz region, which is on the transient zone from [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]] to [[Black Sea Region|North Anatolia]], is characterized in general by [[serpentinite]], [[schist]] and [[volcanic rock]]. There are also interesting examples in the region regarding [[mountain formation]]. Turkey's longest and most active [[fracture (geology)|geological fracture]], the [[North Anatolian Fault]], runs through the southern foot of Mount Ilgaz.&lt;ref name="mct"/&gt; The intire region features valleys, slopes and peaks of different characters. Additionally, it has [[geomorphology|geomorphological structure]] with a high-level landscape speciality.&lt;ref name="kkt"/&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Turkey-kizilirmak.svg|thumb|300px|Geographical position of Gökırmak River and Devrez Creek around Ilgaz Mountains]]
The national park is on the Ilgaz Mountains, a mountain range in the western Black Sea Region. The mountains are bordered in the north by Gökırmak River and in the south by Devrez Creek, forming the [[hydrography|hydrographic]] boundary between the two river basins. The Gökırmak River originates in the northern slopes of the Ilgaz Mountains, and flows in the west-east direction joining [[Kızılırmak River]] as one of its main [[tributary|tributaries]]. Devrez Creek follows the North Anatolian Fault joining also Kızılırmak in the east.&lt;ref name="ku"/&gt;

The highest peaks in the range are Büyükhacettepe at {{convert|2587|m|ft|abbr=on}}, Küçükhacettepe at {{convert|2546|m|ft|abbr=on}}, Çeþtepe at {{convert|2394|m|ft|abbr=on}} and Karataş Hill at {{convert|2380|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ridges of the Ilgaz Maountains stretch about {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the west-east direction.&lt;ref name="ku"/&gt;

==Climate==
Average annual temperature at the national park is 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C. January is the coldest month with an average temperature of −0.8&amp;nbsp;°C, while the warmest month is July with 20&amp;nbsp;°C followed by August with 19.7&amp;nbsp;°C. According to the meteorological station in Kastamonu, average annual rainfall is {{convert|486|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In the lower parts of the national park as in the valley floors, rainfall is about {{convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on}} and at the mountain peaks, it is about {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is highest in spring and early
summer. The north facing slopes of the higher regions receive relative more rainfall. Central Antolian climate causes snow over remains for about six months with snow thickness reaching about {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} on slopes.&lt;ref name="ku"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==
Thanks to the location of the national park in the transient region between Central Anatolia and Black Sea Region, the national park has a rich ecosystem of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="mct"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,36311/kastamonu---ilgaz-mountain-national-park.html |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Tourism |title=Kastamonu – Ilgaz Mountain National Park  |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

;Flora
Forests, covering 81.7% of the total area,&lt;ref name="ku"/&gt; are the main vegetation group found in the national park's flora formation consisting of [[forest]], [[underwood]] and [[alpine tundra|alpine flora]] in general. The low altitude parts of the northern slopes are generally covered with Turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]''), European black pine (''[[Pinus nigra]]'') and fir (''[[Abies]]'') forests. At the altitudes of {{convert|1000|-|1300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]'') and beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]''') become dominant accompanied with some other firewood and [[deciduous]] plants. At higher elevations, at {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and above, Turkish pine (''[[Pinus brutia]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') establish pure or mixed forests. This zone is rich of endemic flora found in northern Turkey. The alpine zone beginning up from  {{convert|2000|-|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} is utmost rich consisting of rare and endemic vegetation formed by [[subshrub|dwarf shrub]]s. On the summit of Küçükhacettepe and Büyükhacettepe, which is the highest peak,&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dunya.com/ilgaz-national-park-offers-winter-resort-facilities-184440h.htm |newspaper=Dünya |title=Ilgaz National Park offers winter resort facilities |author=Demirsar, Metin |date=2013-03-11|accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous rare and endemic [[taxon|taxa]] are found.&lt;ref name="kkt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;
	
;Fauna
It is believed that some 30 [[mammal]]s are found in and around the Ilgaz Mountains. Abundant and all-year-long running streams as well as rich vegetation enable well-matched conditions for the [[habitat]] of [[fauna]] such as [[deer]] (''Cervidae''), [[roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos''), [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris''), [[lynx]], [[European pine marten]] (''Martes martes''), [[beech marten]] (''Martes foina''), [[weasel]], [[rabbit]], [[squirrel]], [[hedgehog]], [[Mole (animal)|mole]], [[bat]], [[European badger]] (''Meles meles'') and [[European otter]] (''Lutra lutra'').&lt;ref name="kkt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mct"/&gt; Studies showed the existence of 617 taxa in and around the national park.&lt;ref name="mp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/mp/ilgazdagi/sayfa1.htm |publisher=Orman ve Su İşleri Bakanlığı-Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü |title=Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı-Kaynak Değerleri |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/mp/ilgazdagi/sayfa4.htm |publisher=Orman ve Su İşleri Bakanlığı-Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü |title=Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı-Fauna |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==
Mount Ilgaz National Park offers opportunities for diverse outdoor sports including [[hiking]], [[camping]] and [[RV park|caravaning]] as well as daily activities. [[Angling]] at [[fish pond|fishponds]] situated on Karasu stream in Baldıran Valley is possible between June 15 and September 15. Visitors can also buy [[trout]] throughout the year from [[fish hatchery|fish hatcheries]] in the same area.&lt;ref name="kkt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mct"/&gt;

Another important feature of the national park is its potential for winter sports, which is performed at the site since the 1990s. The ski resort attracts visitors from Istanbul and Ankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/mp/ilgazdagi/sayfa0.htm |publisher=Orman ve Su İşleri Bakanlığı-Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü |title=Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı-Alandaki rekreasyonel Kullanımlar |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest ski resort to Ankara is situated in the national park, called "Ankara Konağı" ("Ankara Lodge"). The Ilgaz Ski Resort, established officially in 1997 containing the entire national park, has a {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} long ski slope available, which is served by a [[chairlift]] and a [[surface lift]], each {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="kkt"/&gt;

==Access==
The national park is situated on the state road {{TUR-D|765}} between [[Çankırı]] and [[Kastamonu]], which runs from [[Ankara]] to [[Black Sea]] coast northwards. It is {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Istanbul]] and {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Ankara, and {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Kastamonu,&lt;ref name="mct"/&gt; where also an [[Kastamonu Airport|airport]] is available. The site is {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the town [[Ilgaz]] on the [[Istanbul]]-[[Samsun]] highway {{TUR-D|100}} ({{European route E|80}}).&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/mp/ilgazdagi/harita.htm |publisher=Orman ve Su İşleri Bakanlığı-Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü |title=Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı-Ulaşım Durumu |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main entrance to the national park is  near the mountain pass at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which is the highest point of the highway {{TUR-D|765}}.

==Catering and lodging==

{{distinguish|Abduction (disambiguation)}}
{{about|the geological process|the video game|Obduction (video game)|the medical procedure|autopsy}}

'''Obduction''' was originally defined by Coleman &lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;Coleman, R.G., 1971. Plate tectonic emplacement of upper mantle peridotites along continental edges. J. Geophys. Res., 76:1212-1222&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the overthrusting of oceanic lithosphere onto continental lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary where continental lithosphere is being subducted beneath oceanic lithosphere.

Subsequently, this definition has been broadened to mean the emplacement of [[continental lithosphere]] by [[oceanic lithosphere]] at a [[convergent plate boundary]], such as closing of an ocean or a [[mountain building]] episode. This process is uncommon because the denser oceanic lithosphere usually subducts underneath the less dense continental plate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Obduction occurs where a fragment of continental [[crust (geology)|crust]] is caught in a [[subduction zone]] with resulting overthrusting of oceanic [[mafic]] and ultramafic rocks from the mantle onto the continental crust. Obduction may occur where a small [[tectonic plate]] is caught between two larger plates, with the lithosphere (both [[island arc]] and oceanic) welding onto an adjacent [[continent]] as a new [[terrane]]. When two [[continental plates]] collide, obduction of the oceanic lithosphere between them is often a part of the resulting orogeny.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Most obductions appear to have initiated at back-arc basins above the subduction zones during the closing of an ocean or an orogeny.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Characteristic rocks==
The characteristic rocks of obducted oceanic lithosphere are the [[ophiolites]]. Ophiolites are an assemblage of oceanic lithosphere rocks that have been emplaced onto a continent. This assemblage consists of deep-marine sedimentary rock (chert, limestone, clastic sediments), volcanic rocks ([[pillow lava]]s, glass, ash, [[sheeted dyke complex|sheeted dykes]] and [[gabbro]]s) and [[peridotite]] (mantle rock).&lt;ref name="Robinson et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Paul T.|last2=Malpas|first2=John|last3=Dilek|first3=Yildirim|last4=Zhou|first4=Mei-fu|title=The significance of sheeted dike complexes in ophiolites|journal=GSA Today|date=2008|volume=18|issue=11|pages=4–10|doi=10.1130/GSATG22A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of obductions==

===Upwedging in subduction zones===
This process is operative beneath and behind the inner walls of oceanic trenches (subduction zone) where slices of oceanic crust and mantle are ripped from the upper part of the descending plate and wedged and packed in high pressure assemblages against the leading edge of the other plate.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;Dewey, J. F., 1976. Ophiolite Obduction. Tectonophysics, v. 31, p.93-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weakening and cracking of oceanic crust and upper mantle is likely to occur in the tensional regime. This results in the incorporation of ophiolite slabs into the overriding plate.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

Progressive packing of ophiolite slices and arc fragments against the leading edge of a continent may continue over a long period of time and lead to a form of continental accretion.

===Compressional telescoping onto Atlantic-type continental margins===
The simplest form of this type of obduction may follow from the development of a subduction zone near the continental margin. Above and behind the subduction zone, a welt of oceanic crust and mantle rides up over the descending plate. The ocean, intervening between the continental margin and the subduction zone is progressively swallowed until the continental margin arrives at the subduction zone and a giant wedge or slice (nappe) of oceanic crust and mantle is pushed across the continental margin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because the buoyancy of the relatively light continental crust is likely to prohibit its extensive subduction, a flip in subduction polarity will occur yielding an ophiolite sheet lying above a descending plate.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

If however, a large tract of ocean intervenes between the continental margin the subduction zone, a fully developed arc and back arc basin may eventually arrive and collide with the continental margin. Further convergence may lead to overthrusting of the volcanic arc assemblage and may be followed by flipping the subduction polarity.

According to the rock assemblage as well as the complexly deformed ophiolite basement and arc intrusions, the Coastal Complex of western Newfoundland may well have been formed by this mechanism.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

===Gravity sliding onto Atlantic-type continental margins===
This concept involves the progressive uplift of an actively spreading oceanic ridge, the detachment of slices from the upper part of the lithosphere and the subsequent gravity sliding of these slices onto the continental margin as [[ophiolites]]. This concept was advocated by Reinhardt &lt;ref name="Reinhardt"&gt;Reinhardt, B.M., 1969. On the genesis and emplacement of ophiolites in the Oman Mountains geosyncline. Schweiz. Mineral. Petrog. Mitt., 49:1-30&lt;/ref&gt; for the emplacement of the [[Semail Ophiolite]] complex in [[Oman]] and argued by Church &lt;ref&gt;Church, W. R., 1972. Ophiolite: its definition, origin as oceanic crust, and mode of emplacement in orogenic belts, with special reference to the Appalachians. Dep. Energy, Mines Resourc. Can., Publ., 42:71-85.&lt;/ref&gt; and Church and Stevens &lt;ref&gt;Church, W.R., and Stevens, R.K., 1971. Early Paleozoic ophiolite complexes of the Newfoundland Appalachians as mantle-oceanic crust sequences. J. Geophys. Res., 76:1460-1466.&lt;/ref&gt; for the emplacement of the [[Bay of Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay of Islands]] sheet in western Newfoundland. This concept has subsequently been replaced by hypotheses that advocate subduction of the continental margin beneath oceanic lithosphere.

===Transformation of a spreading ridge to a subduction zone===
Many ophiolite complexes were emplaced as thin hot obducted sheets of oceanic lithosphere shortly after their generation by plate accretion.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. F., 1975. The role of ophiolite obduction in the evolution of the Appalachian/Caledonian orogenic belt. In: N. Bogdanov (editor), Ophiolites in the Earth’s Crust. Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. (in press)&lt;/ref&gt; The change from a spreading plate boundary to a subduction plate boundary may result from rapid rearrangement of relative plate motion. 
A transform fault may also become a subduction zone, with the side with the higher, hotter, thinner lithosphere riding over the lower, colder lithosphere. This mechanism would lead to obduction of ophiolite complex if it occurred near a continental margin.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

===Interference of a spreading ridge and a subduction zone===
In the situation where a spreading ridge approaches a subduction zone, the ridge collides with the subduction zone, at which time there will develop a complex interaction of subduction-related tectonic sedimentary, and spreading-related tectonic igneous activity. The left-over ridge may either subduct or ride upward across the trench onto arc trench gap and arc terranes as a hot ophiolite slice. These two mechanisms are shown in figure 2 B and C.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;
Two examples of this interaction of a ridge colliding into a trench are well documented. The first one is the progressive diminution of the Farallon plate off California. Ophiolite obduction by the above proposed mechanism would not be expected as the two plates share a dextral transform boundary. However, the major collision of the Kula/Pacific plate with the Alaskan/Aleutian resulted in the initiation of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath Alaska, with no sign of either obduction or indeed any major manifestation of a ridge being “swallowed”.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

===Obduction from rear-arc basin===
Dewey and Bird &lt;ref name="Dewey_a"&gt;Dewey, J. F. and Bird, J.M., 1971. Origin and emplacement of the ophiolite suite: Appalachian ophiolites in Newfoundland. J. Geophys. Res., 76:3179-3206.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that a common form of ophiolite obduction is related to the closure of rear-arc marginal basins and that, during such closure by subduction, slices of oceanic crust and mantle may be expelled onto adjacent continental forelands and emplaced as ophiolite sheets. In the high heat-flow region of a volcanic arc and rear-arc basin the lithosphere is particularly thin. This thin lithosphere may preferentially fail along gently dipping thrust surface if a compressional stress is applied to the region. Under these circumstances a thin sheet of lithosphere may become detached and begin to ride over adjacent lithosphere to finally become emplaced as a thin ophiolite sheet on the adjacent continental foreland.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;
This mechanism is a form of plate convergence where a thin, hot layer of oceanic lithosphere is obducted over cooler and thicker lithosphere.

===Obduction during continental collision===
As an ocean is progressively trapped in between two colliding continental lithospheres, the rising wedges of oceanic crust and mantle rise are caught in the jaws of the continent/continent vise and detach and begin to move up the advancing continental rise. Continued convergence may lead to the overthrusting of the arc-trench gap and eventually overthrusting of the metamorphic plutonic and volcanic rocks of the volcanic arc.

Following total subduction of an oceanic tract, continuing convergence may lead to a further sequence of intra-continental mechanisms of crustal shortening. 
This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the various ocean basins of the Mediterranean region. The Alpine belt is believed to register a complex history of plate interactions during the general convergence of the Eurasian plate and African plates.&lt;ref name="Dewey" /&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of oceanic crustal rocks and deeper mantle rocks that have been obducted and exposed at the surface worldwide. [[New Caledonia]] is one example of recent obduction. The [[Klamath Mountains]] of northern California contain several obducted oceanic slabs. Obducted fragments also are found in [[Oman]],&lt;ref name="Reinhardt" /&gt; the [[Troodos Mountains]] of [[Cyprus]], [[Newfoundland]],&lt;ref name="Dewey_a" /&gt; [[New Zealand]], the [[Alps]] of Europe, the [[Shetland]] islands of [[Unst#Geography and geology|Unst]] and Fetlar, and the [[Appalachians]] of eastern North America.

'''''Paradise Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden''''' is a 2011 book by Brook Wilensky-Lanford that discusses efforts to locate the [[Garden of Eden]].

Wilensky-Lanford writes that more people began to search for the garden to reassert the truth of the [[Bible]] after the advent of [[Darwinism]]. The book focuses on 20th-century individuals who have sought to locate the garden.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite news|last=Bethune|first=Brian|title=Review: Paradise Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/08/26/review-paradise-lust-searching-for-the-garden-of-eden/|accessdate=February 22, 2012|newspaper=Macleans'|date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilensky-Lanford profiles several individuals who have discussed the location of the garden, including [[William Fairfield Warren]] and the author(s) of ''[[The Urantia Book]]''.&lt;ref name=NewYork&gt;{{cite news|last=Wulf|first=Andrea|authorlink = Andrea Wulf|title=Which Way to the Garden of Eden?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/paradise-lust-by-brook-wilensky-lanford-book-review.html|accessdate=February 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradise Lust'' also discusses the work of archaeologist [[Juris Zarins]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Carl|title=Review: Garden of Eden Imagined at 17 Locations|url=https://news.yahoo.com/review-garden-eden-imagined-17-locations-100753248.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|newspaper=ABCNews.com|date=August 2, 2011|agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Associated Press]] writer Carl Hartman applauded the book as "witty and exhaustively researched", though he notes that the title could confuse readers. (Wilensky-Lanford chose the book's title as a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]], not to indicate sexual content.)&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Andrea Wulf]] praised the book as an "enjoyable parade of oddities" that is an "appealing mix of serious research and tongue-in-cheek humor", but noted that it occasionally felt like a repetitive list of bizarre characters.&lt;ref name=NewYork/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Pinch analysis''' is a methodology for minimising energy consumption of [[process (engineering)|chemical processes]] by calculating thermodynamically feasible ''energy targets'' (or minimum energy consumption) and achieving them by optimising heat recovery systems, energy supply methods and process operating conditions. It is also known as ''[[process integration]]'', ''heat integration'', ''energy integration'' or ''pinch technology''.

The process data is represented as a set of energy flows, or streams, as a function of heat load (kW) against temperature (°C).  These data are combined for all the streams in the plant to give ''composite curves'', one for all ''hot streams'' (releasing heat) and one for all ''cold streams'' (requiring heat). The point of closest approach between the hot and cold composite curves is the ''[[pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] point'' (or just ''pinch'') with a hot stream pinch temperature and a cold stream pinch temperature.  This is where the design is most constrained.  Hence, by finding this point and starting the design there, the [[thermal energy|energy]] targets can be achieved using [[heat exchangers]] to recover [[heat]] between hot and cold streams in two separate systems, one for temperatures above pinch temperatures and one for temperatures below pinch temperatures. In practice, during the pinch analysis of an existing design, often cross-pinch exchanges of heat are found between a hot stream with its temperature above the pinch and a cold stream below the pinch. Removal of those exchangers by alternative matching makes the process reach its ''energy target''.

== History ==

In 1971, Ed Hohmann stated in his PhD that 'one can
compute the least amount of hot and cold utilities required for a process
without knowing the heat exchanger network that could accomplish it. One
also can estimate the heat exchange area required'.

In late 1977, Ph.D. student [[Bodo Linnhoff]] under the supervision of Dr John Flower at the [[University of Leeds]]&lt;ref name="ebrahim"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M. | last2 = Kawari | first2 = Al- | title = Pinch technology: an efficient tool for chemical-plant energy and capital-cost saving | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 65| last1 = Ebrahim | pages = 45–49| year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showed the existence in many processes of a heat integration bottleneck, ‘the pinch’, which laid the basis for the technique, known today as pinch-analysis. At that time he had joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) where he led practical applications and further method development.

Bodo Linnhoff developed the 'Problem Table', an algorithm for calculating the energy targets and worked out the basis for a calculation of the surface area required, known as ‘the spaghetti network’. These algorithms enabled practical application of the technique.

In 1982 he joined University of Manchester Institute of Technology  ([[UMIST]], present day [[University of Manchester]]) to continue the work. In 1983 he set up a consultation firm known as [[Linnhoff March International]] later acquired by [[KBC Energy Services]].

Many refinements have been developed since and used in a wide range of industries, including extension to heat and power systems and
non-process situations. Both detailed and simplified (spreadsheet) programs are now available to calculate the energy targets. See Pinch Analysis Software below.

In recent years, Pinch analysis has been extended beyond energy applications. It now includes:

* Mass Exchange Networks (El-Halwagi and Manousiouthakis, 1987)
* [[Water pinch]] (Yaping Wang and Robin Smith, 1994; Nick Hallale, 2002; Prakash and Shenoy, 2005)
* [[Hydrogen pinch]] (Nick Hallale et al., 2003; Agrawal and Shenoy, 2006)

== Weaknesses ==

Classical pinch-analysis primarily calculates the energy costs for the heating and cooling utility. At the pinch point, where the hot and cold streams are the most constrained, large heat exchangers are required to transfer heat between the hot and cold streams. Large heat exchangers entail high investment costs. In order to reduce capital cost, in practice a minimum temperature difference (Δ T) at the pinch point is demanded, e.g., 10&amp;nbsp;°F.  It is possible to estimate the heat exchanger area and capital cost, and hence the optimal Δ T minimum value. However, the cost curve is quite flat and the optimum may be affected by "topology traps". The pinch method is not always appropriate for simple networks or where severe operating constraints exist.  Kemp (2006) discusses these aspects in detail.

== Recent Developments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Critical Review and Annotated Bibliography for Heat Exchanger Network Synthesis in the 20th Century|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie010389e|journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date = 2002-03-09|pages = 2335–2370|volume = 41|issue = 10|doi = 10.1021/ie010389e|language = en|first = Kevin C.|last = Furman|first2 = Nikolaos V.|last2 = Sahinidis}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

The problem of integrating heat between hot and cold streams, and finding the optimal network, in particular in terms of costs, may today be solved with numerical [[algorithm]]s. The network can be formulated as a so-called [[Mixed integer programming|mixed integer]] non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and solved with an appropriate numerical [[solver]]. Nevertheless, large-scale MINLP problems can still be hard to solve for today’s numerical algorithms. Alternatively, some attempts were made to formulate the MINLP problems to mixed integer linear problems, where then possible networks are screened and optimized.  For simple networks of a few streams and heat exchangers, hand design methods with simple targeting software are often adequate, and aid the engineer in understanding the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4070">'''Quantum chromodynamics binding energy''' ('''QCD binding energy'''), '''gluon binding energy''' or '''chromodynamic binding energy''' is the [[energy]] binding [[quark]]s together into [[hadron]]s. It is the energy of the [[field (physics)|field]] of the [[strong force]], which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. QCD binding energy contributes most of the hadron's mass.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

==Source of mass==
Most of the [[mass]] of hadrons is actually QCD binding energy, through [[mass-energy equivalence]]. This phenomenon is related to [[chiral symmetry breaking]]. In the case of [[nucleon]]s – [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – QCD binding energy forms about 99% of the nucleon's mass. That is if assuming that the [[kinetic energy]] of the hadron's constituents, moving at near the [[speed of light]], which contributes greatly to the hadron mass,&lt;ref name=MS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons |title=Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium in Matter |last1=Strassler |first1=Matt |last2= |first2= |date=15 April 2013 |website=Of Particular Significance |publisher= |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is part of QCD binding energy. For protons, the sum of the [[rest mass]]es of the three [[valence quark]]s (two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]]) is approximately 9.4 [[MeV]]/[[Speed of light|c]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the proton's total mass is about 938.3 [[MeV]]/[[Speed of light|c]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For neutrons, the sum of the rest masses of the three valence quarks (two down quarks and one up quark) is approximately 11.9  [[MeV]]/[[Speed of light|c]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the neutron's total mass is about 939.6  [[MeV]]/[[Speed of light|c]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Considering that nearly all of the [[atom]]'s mass is concentrated in the nucleons, this means that about 99% of the mass of everyday matter ([[baryonic matter]]) is, in fact, chromodynamic binding energy.

==Gluon energy==
While gluons are [[massless particle|massless]], they still possess energy – chromodynamic binding energy. In this way, they are similar to [[photon]]s, which are also massless particles carrying energy – [[photon energy]]. The amount of energy per single gluon, or "gluon energy", cannot be calculated. Unlike photon energy, which is quantifiable, described by the [[Planck-Einstein relation]] and depends on a single variable (the photon's [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequency]]), no [[formula]] exists for the quantity of energy carried by each gluon. While the effects of a single photon can be observed, single gluons have not been observed outside of a hadron. Due to the mathematical complexity of quantum chromodynamics and the somewhat chaotic structure of hadrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/04/mass-common-quark-finally-nailed-down |title=Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |last2= |first2= |date=2 April 2010 |website=Science Magazine |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are composed of gluons, valence quarks, [[sea quark]]s and other [[virtual particle]]s, it is not even measurable how many gluons exist at a given moment inside a hadron. Additionally, not all of the QCD binding energy is gluon energy, but rather, some of it comes from the kinetic energy of the hadron's constituents. Therefore, only the total QCD binding energy per hadron can be stated. However, in the future, studies into [[quark-gluon plasma]] might be able to overcome this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5280">[[File:Rana Niejta B.JPG|thumb|Rana Niejta in a park in [[Mo i Rana]] in the municipality of [[Rana, Norway|Rana]] in [[Northern Norway]]]]
'''Rana Niejta''' and '''Rana Niejte''' are [[Ume Sami]] names on a goddess in [[Sami religion|Sami mythology]]. In [[Northern Sami]] she is called '''Rana Neida''' and '''Rana Neide''' (names in other Sami languages are '''Rana Nieda''', '''Ruona Neida''', '''Radien-neide''' and '''Blende''').

Rana Niejta is the goddess for spring and fertility. The literal translation of the name Rana is «the green» or «the green, fertile fields». The name Rana Niejta can freely be translated as «the daughter of earth». According to Sami mythology, she made the mountains turned southwards green, so that hungry reindeer had enough food.

==Sala Niejta and Rana Niejta==
The Finnish [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Otto Donner]] described in his translation of Sámi poems into [[german language|German]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in 1876 how Sala Niejta "daughter of the Sun", '''Rana Niejta''' and '''Saivo Niejta''' "daughter of the underworld" often were mentioned together in sami poetry, and sometimes were confused with each other by outsiders without personal knowledge of Sámi mythology:
{{quote|"Die Sonnentochter wird auch zuweilen ''saivo neida'' die tochter der underwelt, oder '''rāna''', '''ruona neida''' die grünliche, d.i. die frühlingstochter, welche die berge grün bekleidet, gennant."

"The daughter of the Sun is also mention together with '''saivo neida''', the daughter of the underworld, or '''rāna''', '''ruona neida''', the green, that is, the daughter of spring."&lt;ref name=Donner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donner|first=Otto|title=Lieder der Lappen - Lappalaisia lauluja|year=1876|series=Suomi-sarjan Toinen Jakso, 2 Oso|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
However, older sources from 1700 clearly shows that they are three different goddesses. Sala Niejta had the power to end the snow and the cold, while Rana Niejta made it possible for trees and herbs to grow and flourish anew every year.&lt;ref name="Sckanke NS-2, p. 210"&gt;[Sckanke NS-2], p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Rana Niejta thus represents the recreation of the spring.

The Samis considered the Sun as {{quote|a divine being; but the effects and the heat, which they are sensing from the Sun, they say is the daughter of the Sun, which they call '''Salaneide''', and they consider her to at have the power to make an end to snow and coldness".&lt;ref name="Sckanke NS-2, p. 210"/&gt;|}} Sala Niejta and Rana Niejta were two different goddesses, which, together with {{quote|'''Servge-edni''' ... are worshipped and adored ... as Goddesses, and when the Sami need them, they are sacrificing to them, so that they shall be mild and give grass to the reindeer of the Sami people, and so that the Sami people should not suffer from hunger, but enjoy milk and cheese from the animals.&lt;ref name="Sckanke NS-2, p. 210"/&gt;|}}
{{quote|To the Summer belongs: that the snow must go away, and thereafter that grass and leaves  grows. Both are necessary for the sami people for the sake of their animals, especially in such a polar climate, and in the mountains, where snow and cold rules so much longer, and in some years even more and longer than in others... And as such they could see and sense, how the Sun works so that the snow disappear; but they could not understand how leaves and grass blossoms. They realized that they then had to deal with the power of '''Radiens''' &amp;minus; that is the good God, who rules above everything, and that from there leaves and grass came. But the elimination of the snow they credit the warmth from the Sun.&lt;ref name="Sckanke NS-2, p. 210"/&gt;|}}

==The municipality of Rana, Norway==
[[File:Rana Niejta 3.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Bronze statue showing Rana Niejta in [[Mo i Rana]]]]

Some also consider her name as the origin of the name of the municipality of [[Rana, Norway|Rana]] in [[Norway]].

In 1971, a bronze statue depicting Rana-Niejta was raised in the park beneath the shopping centre LA Meyer in [[Mo i Rana]]. The statue was made by the artist [[Arne Durban]], and financed by ''Den Norske Bank'' (DNB, «The Norwegian Bank») in 1970 in connection with its 25-years anniversary. It was delivered to Rana municipality on November 19, 1970. In 2003, a similar statue was moved from DNB to ''Nordlandsbanken'' («Bank of Nordland») in Rana after the process of amalgamating the two banks.

[[File:RapidEye`s S-Band Antenna.jpg|thumb|RapidEye`s S-Band Antenna]]

'''RapidEye''' AG was a German geospatial information provider focused on assisting in management decision-making through services based on their own Earth observation imagery.  The company operated a five-[[satellite constellation]] producing 5&amp;nbsp;meter resolution imagery that was designed and implemented by  [[MacDonald Dettwiler|MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA)]] of Richmond, Canada.

Today, RapidEye refers to the constellation of 5 earth observation [[satellites]] owned and operated by [[Planet Labs]].

== History ==
'''1996''': The RapidEye business concept was designed by [[Kayser-Threde|Kayser-Threde GmbH]], based on a call for ideas from the [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] (German Aerospace Agency), on how to commercialize  [[remote sensing]] in Germany.

'''1998:''' RapidEye was established as an independent company in Munich with seed financing from a few private investors and [[Vereinigte Hagelversicherung]], a German agricultural insurance provider.

In 2004, funding was secured for the RapidEye satellite constellation and [[ground segment]] with the help of the European Union, the State of Brandenburg (Germany), a banking consortium consisting of Commerzbank, EDC (Export Development Canada) and KfW Banking Group.
Through a contract with the CCC (Canadian Commercial Corporation),  [[MacDonald Dettwiler|MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA)]] was awarded the contract as the prime contractor to build RapidEye's satellite system.
Originally located in [[Munich]], the company relocated 60&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Berlin]] to [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] in 2004.

'''2008''': RapidEye earned [[ISO 9001:2000#2000 version|ISO 9001:2000]] certification in April from TÜV Nord. On August 29, 2008, a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]] (a refurbished [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM missile]]), was successfully launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] in Kazakhstan carrying RapidEye's constellation of five Earth observation [[satellites]] designed and implemented by  [[MacDonald Dettwiler|MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA)]] of Richmond, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvroscosmos.ru/picture_library/video/start30.wmv Video of the launch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014710/http://tvroscosmos.ru/picture_library/video/start30.wmv |date=2011-10-05 }} provided by Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2009''': After the satellites completed their MPAR phase (consisting of testing and calibration) they became commercially operational in February 2009.

'''2011''':  RapidEye files for bankruptcy protection on 30 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insolvenz-ratgeber.de/satelliten-betreiber-rapid-eye-ist-insolvent/2011/06/03/ Insolvenz Ratgeber], 15. Juni 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/earth-imagery-firm-rapideye-seeking-bankruptcy-protection Space News], 3 Jun 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011''': RapidEye Blackbridge Ltd. of [[Lethbridge|Lethbridge, Alberta]], Canada acquired RapidEye AG on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapideye.de/news/pr/2011-iunctuscorp.htm|title=BlackBridge :: Delivering the World|work=rapideye.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2012 the company announced that it has successfully relocated the company headquarters to Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapideye.com/news/pr/2012-berlin.htm|title=BlackBridge :: Delivering the World|work=rapideye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2013 RapidEye officially changed its name to BlackBridge.&lt;ref name="blackbridge.com"/&gt;

'''2014''': Blackbridge Ltd. announced a new constellation called RapidEye+ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geospatialworld.net/News/View.aspx?id=29047_Article|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002144117/http://geospatialworld.net/News/View.aspx?ID=29047_Article|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-02|title=BlackBridge secures $20.25 million funding for RapidEye+|work=geospatialworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015''' : [[Planet Labs]] acquired RapidEye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/15/satellite-maker-planet-labs-acquires-blackbridges-geospatial-business/|title=Satellite Maker Planet Labs Acquires BlackBridge’s Geospatial Business+|work=techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Satellites ==

'''Five Identical Satellites''': Built by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd|Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.sstl.co.uk/archives/174-RapidEye-constellation-launch-successful.html/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091105120605/http://blog.sstl.co.uk/archives/174-RapidEye-constellation-launch-successful.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-11-05 | title = SSTL's RapidEye blog, 22 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Guildford, subcontracted by  [[MacDonald Dettwiler|MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA)]], each satellite is based on an evolution of the flight-proven [[Comparison of satellite buses|SSTL-100]] bus. Each satellite measures less than one cubic meter and weighs 150&amp;nbsp;kg (bus + payload).

Each of RapidEye's five satellites contain identical sensors, are equally calibrated and travel on the same orbital plane (at an altitude of 630&amp;nbsp;km). Together, the 5 satellites are capable of collecting over 4 million km² of 5&amp;nbsp;m resolution, 5-band color imagery every day.

'''Sensors:''' The Jena-Optronik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jena-optronik.de/index.php/en/company/profile.html | title = Jena-Optronik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multi-spectral image|multi-spectral]] imager, the Jena Spaceborne Scanner JSS 56, is a [[Push broom scanner|pushbroom sensor]] carried on each satellite. Each sensor is capable of collecting image data in five distinct bands of the electromagnetic spectrum: Blue (440-510&amp;nbsp;nm), Green (520-590&amp;nbsp;nm), Red (630-690&amp;nbsp;nm), Red-Edge (690-730&amp;nbsp;nm) and Near-Infrared (760-880&amp;nbsp;nm). The nominal resolution on the ground is 6.5&amp;nbsp;meters, corresponding to [[NIIRS]] 2.

RapidEye's satellites are the first commercial satellites to include the [[Red edge|Red-Edge]] band, which is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content. Studies show that this band can assist in monitoring vegetation health, improve species separation and help in measuring protein and nitrogen content in biomass.

== Applications ==

Imagery from the RapidEye constellation can provide geospatial information to the following industries:

'''Agriculture''' – The RapidEye constellation is capable of field based, regional or global scale agricultural monitoring on a frequent revisit cycle. The information derived from the imagery can assist farmers in [[Precision agriculture|precision farming]] operations, agricultural insurers in damage assessment and risk management, or governments in [[food security]] and [[environmental compliance]] monitoring.

'''Forestry''' – Satellite-based information is increasingly being used by governments and commercial operators to assess forest status, evaluate management strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Son|first=Nguyen-Thanh|last2=Chen|first2=Chi-Farn|last3=Chen|first3=Cheng-Ru|date=2017-06-09|title=Mapping Mangrove Density from Rapideye Data in Central America|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0018/geo-2017-0018.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=211–220|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0018|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; measure the environmental and economical sustainability of forest operations and monitor [[illegal logging]] and [[deforestation]].

'''Security &amp; Emergency''' - Fast turnaround of imagery showing current ground conditions following a natural or man-made disaster is essential for crisis management authorities in assessing the situation and helping to better coordinate rescue teams.

'''Environment''' – Satellite imagery can provide valuable information to governmental agencies or industries, that monitor the environmental impact of human activities.

'''Spatial Solutions''' – RapidEye satellite imagery is used as background imagery for a variety of purposes including mapping, navigation, flight simulation, gaming and as an integral component in geospecific 3D modeling.

'''Energy &amp; Infrastructure''' - The RapidEye constellation can monitor pipeline and transmission corridors and identify problems on the ground such as vegetation encroachment, nearby buildings, development of roads or leaks. It can provide land cover and land use classification data to telecommunication firms to assist in planning their antenna network.

The '''Serravallian''' is in the [[geologic timescale]] an [[List of time periods|age]] or a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the middle [[Miocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]/[[series (stratigraphy)|series]], that spans the time between 13.65 ± 0.05 [[annum|Ma]] and 11.608 ± 0.005 Ma (million years ago). The Serravallian follows the [[Langhian]] and is followed by the [[Tortonian]].&lt;ref&gt;Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

It overlaps with the middle of the [[Astaracian]] [[European Land Mammal Mega Zone]], the upper [[Barstovian]] and lower [[Clarendonian]] [[North American Land Mammal Ages]] and the [[Laventan]] and lower [[Mayoan]] [[South American Land Mammal Ages]]. It is also coeval with the [[Sarmatian (stage)|Sarmatian]] and upper [[Badenian]] stages of the [[Paratethys]] time scale of Central and eastern Europe.

==Definition==
The Serravallian stage was introduced in stratigraphy by the [[Italy|Italian]] geologist [[Lorenzo Pareto]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jubilotheque.upmc.fr/fonds-bulsgf/GB_000037_001/document.pdf?name=GB_000037_001_pdf.pdf Lorenzo Pareto, Note sur les subdivisions que l'on pourrait établir dans les terrains tertaires de l'Apennin septentrional In ''Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France'', volume 22, série 2, pp. 210-277]&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the town of [[Serravalle Scrivia]] in northern Italy.

The base of the Serravallian is at the first occurrence of fossils of the [[Plankton#Size groups|nanoplankton]] species ''[[Sphenolithus|Sphenolithus heteromorphus]]'' and is located in the [[magnetic chronozone]] C5ABr. The official [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP) for the Serravallian is in the 'Ras il-Pellegrin' section, located at the 'Ras il-Pellegrin' headland in the vicinity of 'Fomm ir-Rih' Bay , SW Malta.The base of the Serravallian is represented in the field as the formation boundary between the Globigerina Limestone formation and the Blue Clay formation &lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.stratigraphy.org/gssp/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; . The base of the Serravallian is related to the Mi3b oxygen isotope excursion marking the onset of the Middle Miocene Cooling step. 

The top of the Serravallian (the base of the Tortonian stage) is at the last common appearance of calcareous nannoplanktons ''[[Discoaster|Discoaster kugleri]]'' and planktonic [[foram]] ''[[Globigerinoides|Globigerinoides subquadratus]]''. It is also associated with the short normal-polarized [[magnetic chronozone]] C5r.2n.

[[File:Poverty-of-Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Title page of the 1910 [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company|Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co.]] edition of Marx's ''The Poverty of Philosophy.'' The book was translated by British socialist [[Harry Quelch]].]]
'''''The Poverty of Philosophy''''' (&lt;small&gt;French:&lt;/small&gt; ''Misère de la philosophie'') is a book by [[Karl Marx]] published in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]] in 1847, where he lived in exile from 1843 until 1849. It was originally written in [[French language|French]] as an answer to the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of French [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] set forth in his 1846 book ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]].''

==History==
===The ideas of Proudhon===
[[File:Proudhon à l'assemblée en 1848.png|thumb|right|220 px|Proudhon addressing the French Assembly in July 1848.]]

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809-1865) was a French anarchist [[theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] who wrote extensively on the relationship between the individual and the state. Proudhon believed in an orderly society but argued that the state represented an illegitimate concentration of official violence which effectively undercut any effort to build a just society.&lt;ref name=Thomas176&gt;Paul Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980; pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon rejected all [[political action]] as a form of [[class collaboration]] but argued instead that the [[working class]] could achieve its salvation through economic action alone; abstention from politics was advocated with a view to the ultimate eradication of the existing state and its political apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon believed that the stateless future was not preordained by iron laws of history, but was rather to be the conscious creation of a population which had been morally awakened.&lt;ref name=Thomas179&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists,'' pg. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; This necessary [[morality]], based upon honesty, decency, [[self-respect]], and individual responsibility, was believed to be an inherent part of the working class—something to be developed and emphasized.&lt;ref name=Thomas179 /&gt;

By way of contrast, industrialists, businessmen, and their servitors were held to be incapable of developing this morality due to the nature of their day-to-day economic and political activity.&lt;ref name=Thomas179 /&gt; The act of labor itself was believed to be socially ennobling, whereas the act of [[exploitation of labour|economic exploitation]] backed by political force was held to be inherently corrupting.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Proudhon emphatically declared for a strict separatism between the working class and all others.&lt;ref name=Thomas179 /&gt;

===Karl Marx in exile===
[[Karl Marx]] left Germany following the repression of the newspaper he edited, the [[Rheinische Zeitung]], by the government of [[Prussia]] early in 1843. He landed in [[Paris]], where he lived from October 1843 until December 1845.&lt;ref name=Thomas191&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he first met Proudhon, who was already a well known radical writer, with four books to his credit.&lt;ref name=Thomas191 /&gt; Despite an appeal being made as a prospective French collaborator, Proudhon declined to participate in the ill-fated ''Deutsch-französische Jahrbücher'' (German-French Yearbook) project with which Marx was intimately associated.&lt;ref name=Thomas192&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the personal contact between the two was limited, Marx read Proudhon's writings at this time, discussions of which may be found in his work of the period, including the book written against Bruno Bauer, ''The Holy Family'' (1845), and the unpublished ''Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.''&lt;ref name=Thomas192 /&gt; In the published book Marx lent critical support to some of the ideas of Proudhon against competing ideas of Bauer.&lt;ref name=Thomas192 /&gt;

Marx was particularly attracted to the comprehensive nature of Proudhon's writings up to 1845 and the latter's willingness to make larger connections from smaller observations.&lt;ref name=Thomas197198&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' Proudhon emphasized the social relationships emerging from [[private property]], and the tendency of economic development to produce a propertyless [[proletariat]] in ever increasing numbers—ideas which Marx found compelling.&lt;ref name=Thomas197198 /&gt; Marx's praise of Proudhon was not limitless, however, as he felt Proudhon did not fully grasp the way in which wages and money, for example, were themselves forms of private property.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was forced to exit Paris by the French government in 1845, with Brussels, Belgium his next destination.&lt;ref name=Thomas205&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pg. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his departure from France, he continued to see Proudhon as a potential political collaborator, asking him in 1846 to participate in a new international correspondence committee patterned after the London-based [[Workers' Educational Association]], designed to propagate socialist ideas among the working class of continental Europe.&lt;ref name=Thomas205 /&gt; Proudhon responded cautiously to Marx's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Marx and the Anarchists'', pg. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps partially in consequence, Marx and his friend and political associate turned their organizing efforts to an established political body, the [[League of the Just]].&lt;ref name=Thomas205 /&gt;

===Proudhon's ''The Philosophy of Poverty''===
{{Empty section|date=January 2017}}

===Marx's ''The Poverty of Philosophy''===
Marx read Proudhon's book late in 1846 and responded strongly and negatively, authoring a lengthy letter to his Russian correspondent P.V. Annenkov on December 28, 1846 with a detailed exposition of his views that became the core of his 1847 book.&lt;ref name=Morozova672&gt;Vera Morozova, "Introductory Note to The Poverty of Philosophy," ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 6, Marx and Engels, 1845–1848''. New York: International Publishers, 1976; pg. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; He began working on a book-length formal reply the following January, completing the work in the spring and going to press in April 1847.&lt;ref name=Morozova672 /&gt;

The book, formally titled ''The Poverty of Philosophy: Answer to the'' Philosophy of Poverty '' by M. Proudhon,'' saw print in [[Brussels]] and Belgium early in July 1847.&lt;ref name=Morozova672 /&gt; The book was written in the [[French language]] to strike its target most closely and for the cutting [[pun]] of a title to be rendered most unmistakably. The book was regarded by the political circle around Marx organized as the [[Communist League]] as a key part of their contemporary program, delineating the views of the League from those espoused by Proudhon and his followers.&lt;ref name=Morozova672 /&gt;

Somewhat surprisingly, following its initial release in 1847, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' was never republished in full prior to Marx's death in 1883.&lt;ref name=Morozova673&gt;Morozova, "Introductory Note," pg. 673.&lt;/ref&gt; The first German edition of the book was first published in 1885; a Russian language translation by the [[Emancipation of Labor]] group (&lt;small&gt;Russian:&lt;/small&gt; Освобождение труда) was released in 1886.&lt;ref name=Morozova673 /&gt; A corrected Second French Edition materialized in 1896, initiated by [[Friedrich Engels]] and completed after his death by Marx's daughter, [[Laura Lafargue]].&lt;ref name=Morozova673 /&gt;

The first English language edition of ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' was unveiled in London in 1900 by the pioneer [[Marxism|Marxist]] publisher [[Twentieth Century Press]].&lt;ref name=Morozova674&gt;Morozova, "Introductory Note," pg. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation for this edition was made by British socialist [[Harry Quelch]].&lt;ref name=Morozova674 /&gt; Quelch's version was reprised in the United States for the first time in 1910 by [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company|Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co.]], a socialist publishing house based in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Morozova674 /&gt;

==Content==
The tone of Marx's polemic against Proudhon is set from the outset, with a witty cut in lieu of a foreword:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"M. Proudhon has the misfortune of being particularly misunderstood in Europe. In France, he has the right to be a bad economist, because he is reputed to be a good German philosopher. In Germany, he has the right to be a bad philosopher, because he is reputed to be one of the ablest of French economists. Being both a German and an economist at the same time, we desire to protest against this double error.... —''Karl Marx,'' Brussels, June 15, 1847."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' in ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 6: Marx and Engels, 1845–1848''. New York: International Publishers, 1976; pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although prominently featuring the word "[[philosophy]]" in its title, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' is essentially a book dealing with the subject of [[economics]]—first English-language translator Harry Quelch noted that the work contained "the groundwork of the theories so fully elaborated in ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', apart from its exhaustive analysis of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist system of production]] and distribution"&lt;ref&gt;Harry Quelch, "Introduction" to Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy''. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., n.d. [1910]; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[law of value]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Chapter 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; To argue the method to apply the dialectics to political economy, he cites the [[Science of Logic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Chapter 2, 1&lt;/ref&gt; And Marx rejects idea of Proudhon on [[consumption tax]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Chapter 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; and denial of [[strike action]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Chapter 2, 5&lt;/ref&gt; And the end of the book, he cites the words of [[George Sand]] that "Combat or Death: bloody struggle or extinction. It is thus that the question is inexorably put.".&lt;ref&gt;From the novel ''Jean Siska'' by Sand (In French) ''Le combat ou la mort, la lutte sanguinaire ou le néant. C'est ainsi que la question est invinciblement posée.''&lt;/ref&gt; Further he cites the theory of [[John Gray (socialist)|John Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Annex, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the book has been called by one Soviet scholar, "one of the first works of mature Marxism."&lt;ref&gt;Vera Morozova, "Preface" to Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 6: Marx and Engels, 1845–1848''. New York: International Publishers, 1976; pg. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1956 economist [[Joan Robinson]] proclaimed in a review of a new British edition of ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' that from the standpoint of modern economics Marx's polemic with Proudhon was "a dead horse" of only "highly specialised interest."&lt;ref name=JR&gt;Joan Robinson, ''"The Poverty of Philosophy'', by Karl Marx," [review] ''Economic Journal,'' vol. 66, no. 262 (June 1956), pp. 334–335. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2227981 IN JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The entertainment value...is not great. There is no wit in ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' apart from its title; Proudhon's ideas were confused enough to begin with, and Marx's presentation of them makes them totally unseizable, so that there is little sport to be got out of following the argument. All the same for anyone interested in 'What Marx Really Meant' some passages in this book are very valuable. In some ways they bear the same relation to ''Capital'' that Marshall's ''Pure Theory'' does to his ''Principles''. Ideas that are clear in the early and short version were later elaborated into obscurity."&lt;ref name=JR /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a widely recognized and periodically reissued title, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' is not regarded as one of the fundamental works of Marxist doctrine, exemplified by its omission from the two volume ''Karl Marx: Selected Works'' published simultaneously in several countries in the 1930s under the auspices of the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute]] of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;For the American edition: V. Adoratsky (ed.), ''Karl Marx: Selected Works: In Two Volumes.'' New York: International Publishers, 1933–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new translation of the work appeared in conjunction with the publication of Volume 6 of the joint Soviet-British-American publication of ''[[Marx-Engels Collected Works]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' in ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 6: Marx and Engels, 1845–1848''. New York: International Publishers, 1976; pp. 105–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the [[Indian Ocean]].

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]] suggested in his 5th century BC ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' that tsunamis were related to [[submarine earthquake]]s,&lt;ref name="Thucydides 3.89.1-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smid, T. C. 103f."/&gt; but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown. Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do; accurately forecasting the passage of tsunamis across the oceans; and forecasting how tsunami waves interact with shorelines.

==Terminology==
===Tsunami===
{{infobox Chinese
|pic=Tsunami (Chinese characters).svg
|piccap="Tsunami" in ''[[kanji]]''
|picupright=0.35
|kanji=津波
|romaji=tsunami
}}
The term "tsunami" is a borrowing from the Japanese ''tsunami'' {{lang|ja|津波}}, meaning "harbour wave". For the plural, one can either follow ordinary English practice and add an ''s'', or use an invariable plural as in the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[a. Jap. tsunami, tunami, f. tsu harbour + nami waves.—''Oxford English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some English speakers alter the word's initial {{IPA|/ts/}} to an {{IPA|/s/}} by dropping the "t", since English does not natively permit /ts/ at the beginning of words, though the original Japanese pronunciation is {{IPA|/ts/}}.

===Tidal wave===
[[File:Tsunami 2004 aftermath. Aceh, Indonesia, 2005. Photo- AusAID (10730863873).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Tsunami aftermath in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]], December 2004.]]Tsunamis are sometimes referred to as '''''tidal waves'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tidal%20wave|title=Definition of TIDAL WAVE|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This once-popular term derives from the most common appearance of a tsunami, which is that of an extraordinarily high [[tidal bore]]. Tsunamis and tides both produce waves of water that move inland, but in the case of a tsunami, the inland movement of water may be much greater, giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide. In recent years, the term "tidal wave" has fallen out of favour, especially in the scientific community, because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with those of [[tide]]s, which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water. Although the meanings of "tidal" include "resembling"&lt;ref&gt;"Tidal", The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]]. 11 November 2008.[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tidal Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or "having the form or character of"&lt;ref&gt;-al. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved November 11, 2008, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/-al Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the tides, use of the term ''tidal wave'' is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers.

===Seismic sea wave===
The term '''''seismic sea wave''''' also is used to refer to the phenomenon, because the waves most often are generated by [[seismic]] activity such as earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weready.org/tsunami/index.php?option=com_glossary&amp;letter=S&amp;id=56|title=Seismic Sea Wave – Tsunami Glossary|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the rise of the use of the term ''tsunami'' in English, scientists generally encouraged the use of the term ''seismic sea wave'' rather than ''tidal wave''. However, like ''tsunami'', ''seismic sea wave'' is not a completely accurate term, as forces other than earthquakes – including underwater [[landslide]]s, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, land or ice [[Slump (geology)|slumping]] into the ocean, [[meteorite]] impacts, and the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly – can generate such waves by displacing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthsci.org/education/teacher/basicgeol/tsumami/tsunami.html|title=tsunamis|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/tsunami/info/faq.shtml|title=Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre|first=corporateName=Bureau of Meteorology; address=GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;|last=postcode=3001|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis, the sheer destruction caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times, killing around 230,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30602159 Indian Ocean tsunami anniversary: Memorial events held] 26 December 2014, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumatran region is also accustomed to tsunamis, with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/the-10-biggest-tsunamis-in-history.htm/ The 10 most destructive tsunamis in history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204022559/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/the-10-biggest-tsunamis-in-history.htm |date=2013-12-04 }}, Australian Geographic, March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and parts of Europe. Of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami]] (which was caused by the [[Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault]]), the [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes]], each causing several tens of thousands of deaths and the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] and tsunami. The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern Europe. The [[Storegga Slide]] in the Norwegian Sea and some examples of [[tsunamis affecting the British Isles]] refer to landslide and meteotsunamis predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves.

[[426 BC Maliakos Gulf tsunami|As early as 426 BC]] the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]] inquired in his book ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' about the causes of tsunami, and was the first to argue that ocean earthquakes must be the cause.&lt;ref name="Thucydides 3.89.1-4"&gt;[[Thucydides]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.89.1 “A History of the Peloponnesian War”, 3.89.1–4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smid, T.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen.&lt;ref name="Thucydides 3.89.5"&gt;[[Thucydides]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.89.1 “A History of the Peloponnesian War”, 3.89.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (''Res Gestae'' 26.10.15–19) described the typical sequence of a tsunami, including an incipient earthquake, the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave, after the [[365 Crete earthquake|365 AD tsunami]] devastated [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Kelly, Gavin (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4135013|last=Kelly|first=Gavin|date=2004|title=Ammianus and the Great Tsunami|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|volume=94|pages=141–167|issue=141|jstor=4135013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley, Jean-Daniel &amp; Jorstad, Thomas F.

==Causes==&lt;!-- [[Ocean surface wave]] links here. --&gt;
The principal generation mechanism (or cause) of a tsunami is the displacement of a substantial volume of water or perturbation of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2004.10.016|last1=Haugen|first1=K|last2=Lovholt|first2=F|last3=Harbitz|first3=C|title=Fundamental mechanisms for tsunami generation by submarine mass flows in idealised geometries|journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]]|date=2005|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=209–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This displacement of water is usually attributed to either earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, glacier calvings or more rarely by meteorites and nuclear tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Margaritondo|first=G|title=Explaining the physics of tsunamis to undergraduate and non-physics students|journal=European Journal of Physics|date=2005|volume=26|issue=3|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/26/3/007|pages=401|bibcode = 2005EJPh...26..401M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.19.010187.001245|last=Voit|first=S.S|title=Tsunamis|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|date=1987|volume=19|issue=1|pages=217–236|bibcode = 1987AnRFM..19..217V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The waves formed in this way are then sustained by gravity.{{how|date=November 2017}}

===Seismicity===
Tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Tectonic earthquakes are a particular kind of earthquake that are associated with the Earth's crustal deformation; when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea, the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do earthquakes generate tsunamis?|url=http://www.geophys.washington.edu/tsunami/general/physics/earthquake.html|publisher=University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a tsunami can be generated when [[thrust fault]]s associated with [[convergent boundary|convergent]] or destructive [[plate boundaries]] move abruptly, resulting in water displacement, owing to the vertical component of movement involved. Movement on [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal (extensional) faults]] can also cause displacement of the seabed, but only the largest of such events (typically related to flexure in the [[outer trench swell]]) cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami, such as the [[1977 Sumba earthquake|1977 Sumba]] and [[1933 Sanriku earthquake|1933 Sanriku]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Source Process of the Great 1977 Sumba Earthquake|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~thorne/TL.pdfs/LL_Sumba_JGR1988.pdf|first=C.

Tsunamis have a small [[amplitude]] (wave height) offshore, and a very long [[wavelength]] (often hundreds of kilometres long, whereas normal ocean waves have a wavelength of only 30 or 40 metres),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/facts-and-figures-how-tsunamis-form.htm/ Facts and figures: how tsunamis form] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105033906/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/facts-and-figures-how-tsunamis-form.htm/ |date=2013-11-05 }}, Australian Geographic, March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually about {{convert|300|mm|in}} above the normal sea surface. They grow in height when they reach shallower water, in a [[wave shoaling]] process described below. A tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas.

On April 1, 1946, the 8.6 {{M|w}} [[1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake|Aleutian Islands earthquake]] occurred with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VI (''Strong''). It generated a tsunami which inundated [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on the island of Hawaii with a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=mid|high}} surge. Between 165 and 173 were killed. The area where the earthquake occurred is where the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor is [[subducting]] (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska.

Examples of tsunami originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include [[Storegga]] about 8,000 years ago, [[Grand Banks]] 1929, [[Papua New Guinea]] 1998 (Tappin, 2001). The Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments, causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami. They dissipated before travelling transoceanic distances.

The cause of the Storegga sediment failure is unknown. Possibilities include an overloading of the sediments, an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.).

The [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] ([[Moment magnitude scale|''M''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] 9.5), [[1964 Alaska earthquake]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 9.2), [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 9.2), and [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;9.0) are recent examples of powerful [[megathrust earthquake]]s that generated tsunamis (known as [[teletsunamis]]) that can cross entire oceans. Smaller (''M''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 4.2) earthquakes in Japan can trigger tsunamis (called '''local''' and '''regional tsunamis''') that can devastate stretches of coastline, but can do so in only a few minutes at a time.

===Landslides===
{{Anchor|Tsunami generated by landslides}}In the 1950s, it was discovered that larger tsunamis than had previously been believed possible could be caused by giant [[submarine landslides]].  These rapidly displace large water volumes, as energy transfers to the water at a rate faster than the water can absorb. Their existence was confirmed in 1958, when a giant landslide in [[1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami|Lituya Bay]], Alaska, caused the highest wave ever recorded, which had a height of 524 metres (over 1700 feet).&lt;ref name="drgeorgepc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Tsunami1958LituyaB.html|title=The Mega-Tsunami of July 9, 1958 in Lituya Bay, Alaska|author=George Pararas-Carayannis|date=1999|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wave did not travel far, as it struck land almost immediately. Two people fishing in the bay were killed, but another boat managed to ride the wave.

Another landslide-tsunami event occurred in 1963 when a massive landslide from [[Monte Toc]] entered the [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy. The resulting wave surged over the 262&amp;nbsp;m (860&amp;nbsp;ft) high dam by 250 metres (820&amp;nbsp;ft) and destroyed several towns. Around 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=petley-blog-vajont&gt;{{cite web |author=Petley, Dave (Professor) |url=http://www.landslideblog.org/2008/12/vaiont-vajont-landslide-of-1963.html |title=The Vaiont (Vajont) landslide of 1963 |publisher=The Landslide Blog |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206033431/http://www.landslideblog.org/2008/12/vaiont-vajont-landslide-of-1963.html |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-50th-anniv&gt;{{cite web|last=Duff |first=Mark |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24464867 |title=Italy Vajont anniversary: Night of the 'tsunami' |work=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists named these waves [[megatsunami]]s.

Some geologists claim that large landslides from volcanic islands, e.g. [[Cumbre Vieja]] on [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]], may be able to generate megatsunamis that can cross oceans, but this is disputed by many others.
&lt;!-- comment out pending translation
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Tsunami4.JPG|Most tsunamis are caused by [[submarine earthquake]]s that dislocate the oceanic crust, pushing water upwards.
File:Tsunami3.JPG|Tsunami can be generated by erupting submarine volcanos ejecting magma into the ocean.

&lt;/gallery&gt; --&gt;

In general, landslides generate displacements mainly in the shallower parts of the coastline, and there is conjecture about the nature of large landslides that enter the water.  This has been shown to subsequently affect water in enclosed bays and lakes, but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history. Susceptible locations are believed to be the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]], [[Réunion|La Reunion]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Cumbre Vieja]] on the island of [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]]; along with other volcanic ocean islands. This is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing. However, there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science of Tsunami Hazards| volume=20| number=5| pages=251–277| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3963563.stm| accessdate=7 September 2014| title=Evaluation of the threat of mega tsunami generation from postulated massive slope failures of the island volcanoes on La Palma, Canary Islands, and on the island of Hawaii| first=George| last=Pararas-Carayannis| date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Meteotsunamis]]===
Some [[meteorological]] conditions, especially rapid changes in barometric pressure, as seen with the passing of a front, can displace bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths comparable to seismic tsunamis, but usually with lower energies. These are essentially dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunamis, the only differences being that meteotsunamis lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunamis and that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunamis can't be modelled as having been caused instantaneously. In spite of their lower energies, on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance, they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life. They have been documented in many places, including the Great Lakes, the Aegean Sea, the English Channel, and the Balearic Islands, where they are common enough to have a local name, ''rissaga''. In Sicily they are called ''marubbio'' and in Nagasaki Bay, they are called ''abiki''. Some examples of destructive meteotsunamis include 31 March 1979 at Nagasaki and 15 June 2006 at Menorca, the latter causing damage in the tens of millions of euros.&lt;ref name="Monserrat"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monserrat|first=S.|last2=Vilibíc|first2=I.|last3=Rabinovich|first3=A. B.|date=2006|title=Meteotsunamis: atmospherically induced destructive ocean waves in the tsunami frequency band|journal=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences|volume=6|pages=1035–1051|url=http://hal-sde.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/93/94/PDF/nhess-6-1035-2006.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2011|doi=10.5194/nhess-6-1035-2006|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteotsunamis should not be confused with [[storm surges]], which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones, nor should they be confused with setup, the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong on-shore winds. Storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves.&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt; They are unable to propagate beyond their sources, as waves do.

=== Man-made or triggered tsunamis ===
{{see also|Tsunami bomb}}

There have been studies of the potential of the induction of and at least one actual attempt to create tsunami waves as a [[tectonic weapon]].

In World War II, the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Military Forces]] initiated [[Project Seal]], which attempted to create small tsunamis with explosives in the area of today's [[Shakespear Regional Park]]; the attempt failed.&lt;ref name="PART2-P9"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, Part 2|date=3 March 2010|work=Inset to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been considerable speculation on the possibility of using [[nuclear weapons]] to cause tsunamis near an enemy coastline.  Even during [[World War II]] consideration of the idea using conventional explosives was explored. Nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Proving Ground]] by the United States seemed to generate poor results.  ''Operation Crossroads'' fired two {{convert|20|ktTNT|abbr=on}} bombs, one in the air and one underwater, above and below the shallow ({{convert|50|m|abbr=on}}) waters of the [[Bikini Atoll]] lagoon.  Fired about {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} from the nearest island, the waves there were no higher than {{convert|3|–|4|m|abbr=on}} upon reaching the shoreline.  Other underwater tests, mainly ''[[Operation Hardtack I|Hardtack I]]/Wahoo'' (deep water) and ''Hardtack I/Umbrella'' (shallow water) confirmed the results.  Analysis of the effects of [[underwater explosions#shallow underwater explosions|shallow]] and [[underwater explosions#deep underwater explosions|deep underwater explosions]] indicate that the energy of the explosions doesn't easily generate the kind of deep, all-ocean waveforms which are tsunamis; most of the energy creates steam, causes vertical fountains above the water, and creates compressional waveforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Glasstone| first1=Samuel| last2=Dolan| first2=Philip| date=1977| title=Shock effects of surface and subsurface bursts – The effects of nuclear weapons| edition=third| place=Washington, DC| publisher=U.S. Department of Defense; Energy Research and Development Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which do not occur in explosions.

==Characteristics==
[[File: Propagation du tsunami en profondeur variable.gif|thumb|When the wave enters shallow water, it slows down and its amplitude (height) increases.]]
[[File:Tsunami2.JPG|thumb|The wave further slows and amplifies as it hits land. Only the largest waves crest.]]

Tsunamis cause damage by two mechanisms: the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed, and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it, even with waves that do not appear to be large.

While everyday [[wind wave]]s have a [[wavelength]] (from crest to crest) of about {{convert|100|m|ft}} and a height of roughly {{convert|2|m|ft}}, a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to {{convert|200|km|mi}}. Such a wave travels at well over {{convert|800|km/h|mph}}, but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about {{convert|1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsci.org/education/teacher/basicgeol/tsumami/tsunami.html Earthsci.org], Tsunamis&lt;/ref&gt; This makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water, where ships are unable to feel their passage.

The velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the velocity of a tsunami would be the square root of √(5000 × 10) = √50000 = ~224 metres per second (735 feet per second), which equates to a speed of ~806 kilometres per hour or about 500 miles per hour. This is the formula used for calculating the velocity of [[Shallow water equations#Wave modelling by shallow water equations|shallow-water]] waves. Even the deep ocean is shallow in this sense because a tsunami wave is so long (horizontally from crest to crest) by comparison.

The reason for the Japanese name "harbour wave" is that sometimes a village's [[fishermen]] would sail out, and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing, and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave.

As the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, [[wave shoaling]] compresses the wave and its speed decreases below {{convert|80|km/h|mph}}. Its wavelength diminishes to less than {{convert|20|km|mi}} and its amplitude grows enormously – in accord with [[Green's law]]. Since the wave still has the same very long [[frequency|period]], the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height. Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not [[Breaking wave|break]], but rather appears like a fast-moving [[tidal bore]].&lt;ref name="Walrus"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step-like wave with a steep-breaking front.

When the tsunami's wave peak reaches the shore, the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed ''run up''. Run up is measured in metres above a reference sea level.&lt;ref name="Walrus" /&gt; A large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving over a period of hours, with significant time between the wave crests. The first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest run-up.&lt;ref name="Tulane"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 80% of tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water, including lakes. They are caused by earthquakes, landslides, volcanic explosions, glacier calvings, and [[bolide]]s.

==Drawback==
[[File: Shallow water wave.gif|upright=2|thumb|right|An illustration of the rhythmic "drawback" of surface water associated with a wave.  It follows that a very large drawback may herald the arrival of a very large wave.]]

All [[wave]]s have a positive and negative peak; that is, a ridge and a trough.  In the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami, either may be the first to arrive.  If the first part to arrive at the shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land.  However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a '''drawback''' will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas.  The drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.

A typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes. Thus, the sea recedes in the drawback phase, with areas well below sea level exposed after three minutes.  For the next six minutes, the wave trough builds into a ridge which may flood the coast, and destruction ensues.  During the next six minutes, the wave changes from a ridge to a trough, and the flood waters recede in a second drawback.  Victims and debris may be swept into the ocean.  The process repeats with succeeding waves.

==Scales of intensity and magnitude==
As with earthquakes, several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events.&lt;ref name=Gusiakov&gt;{{cite web|author=Gusiakov V.|title=Tsunami Quantification: how we measure the overall size of tsunami (Review of tsunami intensity and magnitude scales)|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/presentations/jtc/gusiakov.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensity scales===
The first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunami were the ''Sieberg-Ambraseys scale'', used in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the ''Imamura-Iida intensity scale'', used in the Pacific Ocean. The latter scale was modified by Soloviev, who calculated the Tsunami intensity ''I'' according to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\,\mathit{I} = \frac{1}{2} + \log_{2} \mathit{H}_{av}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{H}_{av}&lt;/math&gt; is the average wave height along the nearest coast. This scale, known as the ''Soloviev-Imamura tsunami intensity scale'', is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the NGDC/NOAA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/tsu_db.shtml|title=NGDC/WDS Global Historical Tsunami Database – NCEI|first=National Geophysical Data|last=Center|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami.

In 2013, following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011, a new 12 point scale was proposed, the Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS-2012), intended to match as closely as possible to the modified [[Environmental Seismic Intensity scale|ESI2007]] and [[European Macroseismic Scale|EMS]] earthquake intensity scales.&lt;ref name="Lekkas et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bssaonline.org/content/103/2B/1493.abstract | title=A Proposal for a New Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS‐2012) | author=Lekkas E. | author2=Andreadakis E. | author3=Kostaki I. | author4=Kapourani E. | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America | date=2013 | volume=103 | issue=2B | pages=1493–1502 | doi=10.1785/0120120099|bibcode = 2013BuSSA.103.1493L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katsetsiadou, K.N., Andreadakis, E. and Lekkas, E., 2016.

''Research in Geophysics'', ''5''(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude scales===
The first scale that genuinely calculated a magnitude for a tsunami, rather than an intensity at a particular location was the ML scale proposed by Murty &amp; Loomis based on the potential energy.&lt;ref name=Gusiakov/&gt; Difficulties in calculating the potential energy of the tsunami mean that this scale is rarely used. Abe introduced the ''tsunami magnitude scale &lt;math&gt;\mathit{M}_{t}&lt;/math&gt;'', calculated from,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\mathit{M}_{t} = {a} \log h + {b} \log R = \mathit{D}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the maximum tsunami-wave amplitude (in m) measured by a tide gauge at a distance ''R'' from the epicentre, ''a'', ''b'' and ''D'' are constants used to make the M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; scale match as closely as possible with the moment magnitude scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Abe K.|date =1995|title=Estimate of Tsunami Run-up Heights from Earthquake Magnitudes|work=Tsunami: progress in prediction, disaster prevention, and warning|accessdate=2009-10-18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5YjaGdQOJIwC&amp;pg=PA21 |isbn=978-0-7923-3483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tsunami heights==
There are different term being used to describe different characteristic of tsunami in term of their height, and each of them are used to refer to different characteristic of a tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itic.ioc-unesco.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=1142&amp;Itemid=1142 Tsunami Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/news/tsu-terms.html Tsunami Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/faq/faq26.html 津波について]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120219202854/http://www.coastal.jp/ttjt/index.php?津波の高さの定義 津波の高さの定義]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Amplitude, Wave Height, or Tsunami Height: Amplitude of Tsunami refer to its height relative to the normal sea level. It is usually measured at sea level, and it is different from the crest-to-trough height which is commonly used to measure other type of wave height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weready.org/tsunami/index.php?option=com_glossary&amp;letter=T&amp;id=73 Tsunami Amplitude]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Run-up Height, or Inundation Height: The height reached by a tsunami on the ground above sea level, Maximum run-up height refers to the maximum height reached by water above sea level, which is sometime reported as the maximum height reached by a tsunami.
*Flow Depth: Refer to the height of tsunami above ground, regardless of the height of the location or sea level.
*(Maximum) Water Level: Maximum height above sea level as seen from trace or water mark. Different from maximum run-up height in the sense that they are not necessarily water marks at inundation line/limit.

==Warnings and predictions==
{{See also|Tsunami warning system}}
[[File:TsunamiHazardSign.svg|thumb|Tsunami warning sign]]

Drawbacks can serve as a brief warning. People who observe drawback (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound), can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings. In 2004, ten-year-old [[Tilly Smith]] of [[Surrey]], England, was on [[Maikhao beach]] in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand with her parents and sister, and having learned about tsunamis recently in school, told her family that a tsunami might be imminent. Her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived, saving dozens of lives. She credited her geography teacher, Andrew Kearney.

In the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] drawback was not reported on the African coast or any other east-facing coasts that it reached. This was because the wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the fault line and upwards on the western side. The western pulse hit coastal Africa and other western areas.

A tsunami cannot be precisely predicted, even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. [[Geologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, and [[seismologist]]s analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives. One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.

Regions with a high tsunami risk typically use [[tsunami warning system]]s to warn the population before the wave reaches land. On the west coast of the United States, which is prone to Pacific Ocean tsunami, warning signs indicate evacuation routes. In Japan, the community is well-educated about earthquakes and tsunamis, and along the Japanese shorelines the tsunami warning signs are reminders of the natural hazards together with a network of warning sirens, typically at the top of the cliff of surroundings hills.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chanson, H.|author-link=Hubert Chanson |title= Tsunami Warning Signs on the Enshu Coast of Japan  |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203103 |publisher=Shore &amp; Beach|pages=52–54|number=1|volume=78 |date=2010 |issn= 0037-4237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center|Pacific Tsunami Warning System]] is based in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. It monitors Pacific Ocean seismic activity. A sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning. While the subduction zones around the Pacific are seismically active, not all earthquakes generate a tsunami. Computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and the adjoining land masses.

As a direct result of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat for all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the United Nations Disaster Mitigation Committee. A tsunami warning system is being installed in the Indian Ocean.

[[Computer model]]s can predict tsunami arrival, usually within minutes of the arrival time. Bottom pressure sensors can relay information in [[present|real time]]. Based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor's shape ([[bathymetry]]) and coastal [[topography]], the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami. All [[Pacific Rim]] countries collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practise evacuation and other procedures. In Japan, such preparation is mandatory for government, local authorities, emergency services and the population.

Some zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic [[Rayleigh waves]] from an earthquake or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes, tsunami etc. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in [[Sri Lanka]] in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that certain animals (e.g., [[elephant]]s) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' reaction was to move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.

Along the United States west coast, in addition to sirens, warnings are sent on television and radio via the [[National Weather Service]], using the [[Emergency Alert System]].

=== Forecast of tsunami attack probability ===
Kunihiko Shimazaki ([[University of Tokyo]]), a leading member of the Earthquake Research Committee at The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion in Japan, has mentioned an idea for instituting a system of public education regarding the probability of tsunami risk; such a system was announced by Shimazaki at the [[Japan National Press Club]] in May 2011. The forecast would include a detection for environmental risk, including proposed tsunami height, danger areas prone to tsunamis, and overall occurrence probability. The forecast would integrate the scientific knowledge of recent [[interdisciplinarity]] with information gathered from the [[aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. Per the announcement, a plan was due to be put in place by 2014; however, reliable forecasting of earthquake and tsunami probability is still unavailable. Shimazaki acknowledged that, given the current literature on the topic, tsunami probability warnings are just as, if not more, difficult to predict than earthquake risk probability.

==Mitigation==
{{see also|Seawall}}

[[File:Tsunami wall.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[seawall]] at [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]], Japan|alt=Photo of seawall, with building in background]]

In some tsunami-prone countries, [[earthquake engineering]] measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore.

[[Japan]], where tsunami science and response measures first began following a [[1896 Sanriku earthquake|disaster in 1896]], has produced ever-more elaborate countermeasures and response plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/tsunami-japan/ |title=Journalist's Resource: Research for Reporting, from Harvard Shorenstein Center |publisher=Content.hks.harvard.edu |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has built many tsunami walls of up to {{convert|12|m|ft}} high to protect populated coastal areas. Other localities have built [[floodgate]]s of up to {{convert|15.5|m|ft}} high and channels to redirect the water from an incoming tsunami.  However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunami often overtop the barriers.

The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] was directly triggered by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], when waves exceeded the height of the plant's sea wall.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Phillip Lipscy, Kenji Kushida, and Trevor Incerti. 2013. "[http://www.stanford.edu/~plipscy/LipscyKushidaIncertiEST2013.pdf The Fukushima Disaster and Japan’s Nuclear Plant Vulnerability in Comparative Perspective]". ''Environmental Science and Technology'' 47 (May), 6082–6088.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwate Prefecture]], which is an area at high risk from tsunami, had tsunami barriers walls  ([[Taro sea wall]]) totalling {{convert|25|km|mi}} long at coastal towns.  The 2011 tsunami toppled more than 50% of the walls and caused catastrophic damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Fukada, Takahiro |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110921f1.html |title=Iwate fisheries continue struggle to recover |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=21 September 2011 |page=3 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Historic tsunami#1993: Okushiri, Hokkaido, Japan (北海道南西沖地震)|Okushiri, Hokkaidō tsunami]] which struck [[Okushiri, Hokkaidō|Okushiri Island]] of [[Hokkaidō]] within two to five minutes of the [[1993 Hokkaido earthquake|earthquake on July 12, 1993]], created waves as much as {{convert|30|m|ft|-1}} tall—as high as a 10-storey building. The port town of Aonae was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Tsunami1993JAPANOkushiri.html |title=The Earthquake and Tsunami of July 12, 1993 in the Sea of Japan/East Sea |author=George Pararas-Carayannis |website=www.drgeorgepc.com |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WiTricity''' is an American engineering company that manufactures devices for [[wireless energy transfer]] using [[resonant inductive coupling|resonant energy transfer]] based on oscillating magnetic fields.

== History ==

The term WiTricity was used for a project that took place at [[MIT]], led by [[Marin Soljačić]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="MIT theory news"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/wireless.html | title = Wireless electricity could power consumer, industrial electronics | publisher = [[MIT]] News | date = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT experiment news"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/wireless-0607.html | title = Goodbye wires… | publisher = [[MIT]] News | date = 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MIT researchers successfully demonstrated the ability to power a 60 [[watt]] light bulb wirelessly, using two 5-turn copper coils of 60&amp;nbsp;cm (24&amp;nbsp;in) [[diameter]], that were 2&amp;nbsp;m (7&amp;nbsp;ft) away, at roughly 45% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/pod/250/wireless-power-demonstrated.html|title=Wireless Power Demonstrated|accessdate=2008-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231103130/http://thefutureofthings.com/pod/250/wireless-power-demonstrated.html|archivedate=2008-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coils were designed to resonate together at 9.9 [[megahertz|MHz]] (wavelength ≈ 30 m) and were oriented along the same axis. One was connected inductively to a power source, and the other one to a bulb. The setup powered the bulb on, even when the direct line of sight was blocked using a wooden panel.  Researchers were able to power a 60 [[watt]] light bulb at roughly 90% efficiency at a distance of 3 feet{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  The research project was spun off into a private company, also called WiTricity.

The [[emerging technology]] was demonstrated in July 2009 by CEO Eric Giler at the [[TED Global Conference]] held in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes |authorlink= | title= Wireless power system shown off | date=2009-07-23 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8165928.stm | work =[[BBC News Online]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_giler_demos_wireless_electricity.html |title=Eric Giler demos wireless electricity |accessdate=2009-09-13 |date=July 2009 |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he refers to the original idea, first applied by the physicist [[Nikola Tesla]] between his coils,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_giler_demos_wireless_electricity#t-15992&lt;/ref&gt; and shows a WiTricity power unit powering a television as well as three different cell phones, the initial problem that inspired Soljacic to get involved with the project.

In September 2012, the company announced it would make a $1000 demonstration kit available to interested parties, to promote development of commercial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Boston Globe|date=2012-09-17|title=Flying electricity and neighborhood news|url=http://bostonglobe.com/business/2012/09/16/flying-electricity-and-neighborhood-news/HYIsNwxORd5VDewu4RvgvO/story.html|author=Scott Kirsner}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|3|20}}&lt;!-- so they announced they would make the kit available.  Did they ever do it?  How did sales go?  Etc.  It's been 18 mos. since the "announcement". --&gt;&lt;!-- What else has happened with this company in 2013? --&gt;

CEO Alex Gruzen was hired in 2014, and decided to take WiTricity out of the competition for powering consumer electronics, and focus on wireless power for vehicles.  The company nonetheless demonstrated wireless power for a Dell laptop at the January, 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, which became commercially available in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/07/11/witricity-brings-wireless-power-new-dell-laptop/NPr7yPXIxUwNj2I6LuZS8N/story.html WiTricity brings wireless power to new Dell laptop]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has reportedly collaborated with car makers [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Chrysler]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Nissan]], and [[Toyota]]. In 2017, having raised $68 million to date and facing competition from the wireless vehicle standard Halo (developed by [[Qualcomm]]), the company reduced its workforce from 80 to 55, and closed an office in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/12/15/witricity-takes-turn-toward-electric-car-charging/jbuwKKlY4qr18j0B7PCUII/story.html#comments WiTricity takes a turn toward electric-car charging]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Population day''' is an annual event, observed on July 11 every year, which seeks to raise awareness of [[world population|global population]] issues. The event was established by the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in 1989. It was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987, the approximate date on which the world's population reached five billion people. World Population Day aims to increase people's awareness on various population issues such as the importance of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights.

The day was suggested by Dr KC Zachariah in which population reaches Five Billion when he worked as Sr Demographer at World Bank.

While press interest and general awareness in the global population surges only at the increments of whole billions of people, the world population increases annually by 100 million approximately every 14 months. The world population reached 7,400,000,000 on February 6, 2016; the world population had reached 7,500,000,000 at around 16:21 on April 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info|title=Worldometers real time world statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
