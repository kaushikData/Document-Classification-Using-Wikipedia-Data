At Avco Everett he met [[Arthur Kantrowitz|Arthur R. Kantrowitz]] (later of the [[Foresight Institute]]).

In 1972, Bova became editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction]]'', after [[John W. Campbell]]'s death in 1971. At ''Analog'', Bova won six [[Hugo Award]]s for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]].&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt;

Bova served as the science advisor for the television series ''[[The Starlost]]''&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt; and left in disgust after the airing of the first episode (1973). His novel ''The Starcrossed'', loosely based on his experiences, featured a thinly veiled characterization of his friend and colleague [[Harlan Ellison]]. Bova dedicated the novel to "Cordwainer Bird", the pen name Ellison uses when he does not want to be associated with a television or film project.

In 1974, he wrote the screenplay for an episode of the children's [[science fiction|science-fiction]] television series ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'', titled "The Search".

After leaving ''Analog'' in 1978, Bova went on to edit ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', from 1978 to 1982.&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt;

Bova holds the position of President Emeritus of the [[National Space Society]] and served as President of [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) from 1990 to 1992.

He appeared as the Guest of Honor at the Florida convention Necronomicon in 1995 and 2011. In 2000, he attended the [[58th World Science Fiction Convention]] (Chicon 2000) as the Author Guest of Honor.

In 2007, [[Mary Parent|Stuber/Parent Productions]] hired him as a consultant to provide insight into what the world may look like in the near future, for their film ''[[Repo Men]]'' (2010) starring [[Jude Law]] and [[Forest Whitaker]]. Also in 2007 he provided consulting services to [[Silver Pictures]] on the [[Altered Carbon#Film adaptation|film adaptation]] of [[Richard K. Morgan]]'s [[hardboiled]] [[cyberpunk]] science-fiction novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' (2002). He was awarded the [[Robert A. Heinlein Award]] in 2008 for his work in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Heinlein2008.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423023607/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Heinlein2008.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-23|title=The Locus Index to SF Awards: 2008 Robert A.

The '''Camus Cross''', otherwise known as the '''Camuston''' or '''Camustane Cross''', is an [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval Scottish]] [[Pictish stones|standing stone]] located on the [[Panmure House|Panmure Estate]] near [[Carnoustie]] in [[Angus, Scotland]]. First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between [[Camuston]] and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule, it is a [[High cross|freestanding cross]], rare in Eastern Scotland.

The cross is thought to date from the tenth century, and exhibits distinctive [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and [[folk etymology]] suggest that the cross marked the burial site of [[Camus (folklore)|Camus]], leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King [[Malcolm II]] at the apocryphal [[Battle of Barry]]. The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct [[Camuston|village of Camuston]], which has a [[Celtic language|Celtic]] toponymy.

==Location==

The Camus Cross is in the [[Downie Hills]], approximately {{convert|4|km|mi}} [[Boxing the compass|northwest]] of [[Carnoustie]] in [[Angus, Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The avenue is part of Panmure Estate and leads, beyond the road, to the former site of [[Panmure House]].

==Description==
[[File:Camuscrosssidedetail.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Shaft detail, showing foliar scrolls on southern edge]]
The freestanding cross is carved from [[Old Red Sandstone]] and stands {{convert|2|m|ft}} high, approximately {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} wide at the base, {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} wide at the arms, and approximately {{convert|0.2|m|ft}} thick. It stands on a low earth mound, {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} wide (east to west), {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} wide (north to south) and {{convert|1|m|ft}} high, in the centre of the Camuston Wood avenue, facing east to west. All faces and sides are sculpted. The cross has suffered significant [[weathering]], most notably on the west face, which has obscured some of the designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = 29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone bears no idiomatic [[Picts|Pictish]] [[symbol]]s and, under [[J Romilly Allen]] and Joseph Anderson's classification system, it is a class III stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at [[Forteviot]], [[St Vigeans]] and [[Strathmartine]] and shaft fragments found at [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones|Monifieth]], [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]], [[Carpow]] and [[Invermay]], as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The western face is divided into three sections. The uppermost section is almost completely [[weathering|weathered]]. The antiquarian [[Alexander Gordon (antiquary)|Alexander Gordon]], who described the stone in 1726 in his ''Itinerarium Septentrionale'', records this panel as holding a [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] scene, with the figure of a man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a [[centaur]] holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a [[symmetrical]] floral scroll design.&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;

The [[stone carving|carving]] on the Camus Cross shows distinct similarities with those on the [[Brechin]] [[Hogback (sculpture)|Hogback]] stone and point to an Irish Ecclesiastical influence. The foliar designs on the north and south edges, originally seen as [[Ringerike style|Ringerike]]-like (and hence, [[Viking Age|Scandinavian]] in origin), consist of [[tendril]]s and [[volute]]s with "wave-crest" thickening. These features bear closest similarity with Irish [[insular art]] of the late tenth century, and the treatment of the [[symmetrical]] foliar scroll design on the lower portion of the west face is diagnostically Irish. The full-face figures on the east face are of an identical type to those on the Brechin Hogback. In the case of the Brechin Hogback, the figures are carrying objects that are characteristic of [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|early medieval Irish]] [[monasticism]].&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;{{citation

[[Camus (folklore)|Camus]] was the supposed leader of a [[Viking|Norse]] expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised in the sixteenth century by historian [[Hector Boece]], states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain at the point where the cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The name of the cross is likely to derive from the village of Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist by the time of the first [[Ordnance Survey]] map, published in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A burial disinterred in 1598, near the Camus cross, was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not far thearfra in the bank of Camstone, the zeir of God I&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; fywe hundrethe nyntie and aught zeiris, thear wos ane greawe fownd withe ane bread stone on eury quarter thearof efter the forme of ane malt cobile, quharin did ly the heale bons of ane man of gryt statwre, the thee bone quharof ves neir als longue as bothe the schank and thee bone of any reasonable man of this age, the harne pan gryte, and vanted the palme bread of ane hand thearof, quhilk had beine the straik as appeirithe of ane sword, it wes thought to heawe beine Cames the chief mans bwriel.&lt;ref name="rp"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Little information of the burial exists, but goods found in the cist were kept at [[Brechin Castle]]. These were sketched by Jervise and are typical of [[Bronze Age]] artifacts, found fairly commonly in the area.&lt;ref name="Jervise journal"&gt;

The '''Church of St. Denis''' ({{lang-fr|Collégiale Saint-Denis}}) in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]], is a former [[fortified church|fortified]] [[collegiate church]], founded by [[Notker of Liège]] in 987 and first consecrated on 12 March 990.&lt;ref&gt;Theodose Bouille, ''Histoire de la ville et pays de Liege'', [https://books.google.es/books?id=4xtUAAAAcAAJ vol. 1] (Liège, 1725), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was added around 1100. The church has since 1936 been registered as a listed building, and is currently listed as "exceptional heritage" of [[Wallonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spw.wallonie.be/dgo4/site_ipic/index.php/fiche/fiche?codeInt=62063-INV-0341-02 Heritage listing] accessed 22 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Church of St Denis was one of the [[seven collegiate churches of Liège]], which until the [[Liège Revolution]] of 1789 collectively comprised the "secondary clergy" in the [[First Estate]] of the [[Prince-bishopric of Liège]]. The church was suppressed in 1797, but the building was taken into use as a parish church in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spw.wallonie.be/dgo4/site_ipic/index.php/fiche/fiche?codeInt=62063-INV-0341-02 Heritage listing] accessed 22 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a [[tempera]] on panel [[polyptych]] by the Italian late Gothic artist [[Lorenzo Monaco]], centred on the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]]. Once in the Camaldolese monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli (Florence)|Santa Maria degli Angeli]], it is now housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. It is dated February 1413 which, in the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine calendar]] (which began in March), corresponded to 1414.

==History==
The painting is mentioned in the early 15th century by Antonio Billi. 

In the late 16th century, it was replaced in the altar it occupied by a large canvas by [[Alessandro Allori]]. The ''Coronation'' was rediscovered in the 19th century, when it was housed in the Camaldolese abbey of San Pietro a Cerreto, in poor condition. In 1872 it was restored to its frame. In 1990 the painted part was found to contain the precious and (for the time) expensive use of [[lapis lazuli blue]].

==Description==
The work is in a huge gilded and carved frame, with three cusps covered placed on jutting  [[corbel]]s. The three arches are decorated with vegetable motifs; over them are three panels (whose upper frame is lost), containing the paintings, from the left, of the ''Angel of the Annunciation'', the ''Blessing Christ between Cherubims'' and the ''Annunciation''. At the side are two piers with twisting columns on the edges, with paintings of prophets. In the lower part is the [[predella]], with six small paintings of the ''Episodes of the Lives of St. Benedict and St. Bernard of Clairvaux''.

The central painting within the three arcades shows the Coronation of the Virgin set in Paradise (alluded by the blue starred belts), with two rows of saints at the sides and a large number of angels behind the throne of Jesus and the Madonna.

The composition is crowded but, like other Giottoesque paintings, lacks perspective. The gilded background is typical of Lorenzo's style.

'''''Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile''''' is an 1890–1891 painting by [[John Singer Sargent]]. It is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/50.130.16/ |title=Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile &amp;#124; John Singer Sargent &amp;#124; 50.130.16 &amp;#124; Work of Art &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent made several trips to Egypt, Greece and Turkey as part of a project commissioned by the Boston Public Library to explore the origin of Western religion through art. Whilst in Egypt he created this canvas in 1890–91, depicting a group of locals drinking or collecting water from the Nile which had been raised to the bank by a [[shaduf]].

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed the [[church cantata]] '''{{lang|de|Es ist das Heil uns kommen her}}''' (It is our salvation come here to us),&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; '''{{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}}{{nbsp}}9''' in [[Leipzig]] for the sixth Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] between 1732 and 1735. It is a [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]], based on the [[hymn]] "{{lang|de|[[Es ist das Heil uns kommen her]]|italic=no}}" by [[Paul Speratus]]. Bach composed the cantata to fill a gap in his [[chorale cantata cycle]] written for performances in Leipzig from 1724.

The cantata is structured in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a [[chorale fantasia]] and a chorale four-part setting, of the first and the twelfth [[stanza]] in the original words by the [[Protestant Reformers|reformer]] Speratus, published in the [[First Lutheran hymnal]]. The theme is salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, [[flauto traverso]], [[oboe d'amore]], [[String instrument|strings]] and [[Basso continuo|continuo]]. He gave all three recitatives to the [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a [[tenor]] aria with solo [[violin]] and a duet of [[soprano]] and [[alto]] with the [[wind instrument]]s.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== History and words ==
Bach composed the cantata for the [[Church cantata#Sixth Sunday after Trinity (Trinity VI)|Sixth Sunday after Trinity]] between 1732 and 1735. It filled a gap in his [[Bach's second cantata cycle|second annual cycle]] of chorale cantatas written for performance in Leipzig. In 1724, when he composed the cycle, he had an engagement in Köthen that Sunday, and therefore left the text for later completion.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt; The cantata is based on a [[hymn]] "{{lang|de|[[Es ist das Heil uns kommen her]]|italic=no}}" by [[Paul Speratus]], which was published in 1524 in the {{lang|de|Achtliederbuch}}, the [[first Lutheran hymnal]]. The theme of the chorale is the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] creed of salvation from sin by God's grace alone ([[justification by faith]]),&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt; summarized in the first stanza: "Deeds can never help, ... faith beholds Jesus Christ, ... He has become the Intercessor".&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt;

The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], "By Christ's death we are dead for sin" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=6|verse=3|range=–11}}), and from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] a passage from the [[Sermon on the Mount]] about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=5|verse=20|range=–26}}). The  hymn in 14 [[stanza]]s matches the topic of the gospel.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt; An unknown poet transformed the first 12 stanzas of the chorale to seven cantata movements. Dropping the last two stanzas, the librettist retaines the first stanza as the first [[Movement (music)|movement]], and the 12th as the last movement. He rephrased stanzas 2–4 to a [[recitative]] (2), stanzas 5–7 to a recitative (4), stanzas 9–11 to a third recitative (6).&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt; Ideas from stanza 8 were made an [[aria]] (5), and movement 3 is not derived directly from the chorale, but intensifies the conclusion of the first recitative.&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt; The three recitatives can be considered a sermon, according to Julian Mincham, who comments: "All three speak of God's Laws; their bestowal, their fulfillment (or lack of it) and our attitudes towards them", and who summarizes: "The three recitatives were clearly planned as a cognate group and encapsulate the fundamental Lutheran creed. The two intervening arias, and finally the chorale, reflect upon and extend their statements."&lt;ref name="Mincham" /&gt; The Bach scholar [[Christoph Wolff]] assumes that the text was already written for Bach's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt;

Bach had used selected stanzas of the hymn before, in 1716 stanza 12 to conclude {{lang|de|[[Mein Gott, wie lang, ach lange? BWV 155|''Mein Gott, wie lang, ach lange?'' BWV 155]] |italic=unset}}, in 1723 both stanza 12 and 11 to conclude the two parts of {{lang|de|[[Ärgre dich, o Seele, nicht, BWV 186|''Ärgre dich, o Seele, nicht'', BWV 186]] |italic=unset}}, and in 1724 stanza 11 to conclude {{lang|de|[[Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch, BWV 86|''Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch'', BWV 86]] |italic=unset}}.&lt;ref name="chorale melody" /&gt;

== Music ==
=== Structure and scoring ===
Bach structured the cantata in seven movements, framing by a [[chorale fantasia]] and a closing chorale a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for a chamber music ensemble of four vocal soloists ([[soprano]] (S), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B)), a [[SATB|four-part choir]] [[SATB]], [[flauto traverso]] (Ft), [[oboe d'amore]] (Oa), two [[violin]]s (Vl), one of them solo (Vs), [[viola]] (Va), and [[basso continuo]] (Bc).&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mincham" /&gt; The [[autograph]] title page reads: "Dominica 6. post Trinitatis / Es ist das Heil uns kommen her / a / 4 Voci / 1 Traversa / 1 Hautb: d'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / di / Joh:Sebast:Bach".&lt;ref name="Grob" /&gt;

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]].&lt;ref name="Bischof" /&gt; The [[Key (music)|keys]] and [[time signature]]s are taken from [[Alfred Dürr]], using the symbol for common time (4/4).&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt; The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

=== Movements ===

==== 1 ====
The opening chorus, "{{lang|de|Es ist das Heil uns kommen her|italic=no}}" (It is our salvation come here to us),&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; is a [[chorale fantasia]], the vocal part embedded in a [[concerto]] of the instruments. The [[cantus firmus]] of the [[Es ist das Heil uns kommen her|chorale melody]] is in the soprano in unadorned long notes, while the lower voices engage in imitation. The scoring with the [[obbligato]] instruments flute and oboe d'amore in contrast to the strings is unusual, sometimes the first violin takes also part in the concerto.&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;

==== 2 ====
"{{lang|de|Gott gab uns ein Gesetz|italic=no}}" (God gave us the Law),&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; is the first of three recitatives which are sung by the bass as the {{lang|la|[[vox Christi]]}} (voice of Christ), almost like one sermon, which is only deepened by the two arias in between. The recitatives are [[Recitative#Secco|secco]] with the only exception of the final line of movement 4, "{{lang|de|... und fest um Jesu Arme schlingt|italic=no}}" (... embrace the arms of Jesus),&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; which is rendered [[arioso]],&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt; in "an enlightening major key, a tender vocal phrase and the late semi-quaver continuo line".&lt;ref name="Mincham" /&gt;

==== 3 ====
The tenor aria depicts the "sinking" of "{{lang|de|Wir waren schon zu tief gesunken|italic=no}}" (We were already too deeply sunk)&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; in downward [[Motif (music)|motifs]] and an irregular rhythm of [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncopes]], observed by Dürr as an image of "a giddy descent into the abyss of sin".&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;

==== 4 ====
The bass continues the "sermon", "{{lang|de|Doch mußte das Gesetz erfüllet werden|italic=no}}" (Yet the Law must be fulfilled).&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt;

==== 5 ====
The [[duet]] "{{lang|de|Herr, du siehst statt guter Werke|italic=no}}" (Lord, you see, instead of good works)&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; is set for five parts of equal weight, the soprano and alto voices, flute, oboe d'amore and continuo, in intricate [[Canon (music)|canonic]] [[counterpoint]] in [[da capo]] form.&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;

==== 6 ====
The bass continues the "sermon" a third time, "{{lang|de|Wenn wir die Sünd aus dem Gesetz erkennen|italic=no}}" (When we recognize our sin against the Law).&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt;

==== 7 ====
The closing chorale, "{{lang|de|Ob sichs anließ, als wollt er nicht|italic=no}}" (Although it appears that He does not will it),&lt;ref name="Dellal" /&gt; is set for four parts. While Bach's closing chorales are often in simple [[homophony]], the lower voices are set here in unusual [[polyphony]].&lt;ref name="Dürr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;

== Recordings ==

The listing is taken from the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website.&lt;ref name="Oron" /&gt; Recordings have traditionally been made by large symphonic groups, but increasingly in [[historically informed performance]]s (HIP) by [[boys' choir]]s, [[chorale]]s ({{lang|de|Kantorei}}, choir dedicated to mostly church music), [[chamber choir]]s or groups with [[OVPP|on voice per part]] (OVPP), and matching instrumental ensembles playing on [[Baroque instruments|Baroque period instruments]] in [[historically informed performance]]. HIP and OVPPensembles are marked by green background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9207">'''Fairy painting''' is a genre of painting and [[illustration]] featuring [[fairies]] and [[fairy tale]] settings, often with extreme attention to detail. The genre is most closely associated with [[Victorian painting]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], but has experienced a contemporary revival. Moreover, fairy painting was also seen as [[escapism]] for Victorians.

==Origins and influences==
[[File:Henry Fuseli - Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Titania and Bottom''. Oil on canvas by Henry Fuseli, ''c''. 1790]]
Despite its whimsical appearance, fairy painting is strongly rooted in the literary and theatrical influences of [[Romanticism]], as well as in the cultural issues facing the Victorian era. Among the most significant of these influences were the fantasy themes of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]''. Other literary works, such as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and [[Alexander Pope]]'s [[mock-heroic]] ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' have been cited as contributing influences as well.&lt;ref name="Frick"&gt;{{cite web |title=Victorian Fairy Painting from the Frick Collection |publisher=Antiques and the Arts Online |url=http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/archive/fairy.htm |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204103315/http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/archive/fairy.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovations in stage production helped bring these works to the public eye, as the development of [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and improvements in wire-work led to increasingly elaborate special effects. Although once described by [[Douglas Jerrold]] as "a fairy creation that could only be acted by fairies",&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Phelps, W. May  |author2=John Forbes-Robertson |title=The Life and Life-Work of Samuel Phelps |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington |year=1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; productions of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' became more common, eventually leading to an 1863 spectacle featuring [[Ellen Terry]] as Titania astride a mechanical mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Stanley |title=Shakespeare in the Theatre: An Anthology of Criticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-871176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural changes were also an important factor during this period. Continuing [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] was uprooting longstanding traditions, and rapid advances in science and technology, especially the invention of [[photography]], left some people discomforted and confused. According to [[Jeremy Maas]], the turn to mythological and fantasy elements, and in particular to the fairy's world, allowed an escape from these demands.  "No other type of painting concentrates so many of the opposing elements of the Victorian psyche: the desire to escape the drear hardships of daily existence; the stirrings of new attitudes toward sex, stifled by religious dogma; a passion for the unseen; the birth of psychoanalysis; the latent revulsion against the exactitude of the new invention of photography."&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maas |first=Jeremy |title=Victorian Fairy Painting |publisher=Merrell Holberton |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-900946-58-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of fairy paintings as a reaction to cultural change is not universally accepted, however.  "Ultimately," Andrew Stuttaford wrote, "these paintings were just about fun."&lt;ref name="Stuttaford"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stuttaford |first=Andrew |title=Feywatch |journal=National Review |date=1998-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian fairy painting==
[[Image:Image-Dadd - Fairy Feller's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke]]''. Oil on cavas by [[Richard Dadd]] 1855-64.]]
[[Image:The captive robin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Captive Robin]]'' by [[John Anster Fitzgerald]], ''c''. 1864]]
The earliest artists considered to have contributed to the genre predate much of Romanticism and the Victorian era.  [[Henry Fuseli]] and [[William Blake]] produced works that would be indicative of the later genre even before 1800.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fairy Painting |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=Tate Collection |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/f/fairy-painting |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the artist most closely associated with fairy painting was [[outsider artist]] [[Richard Dadd]], a suspected [[schizophrenic]] who produced most of his work while incarcerated in the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem]] [[psychiatric hospital]] for the murder of his father.&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Allderidge |first=Patricia |title=The Late Richard Dadd, 1817-1886 |publisher=Tate Gallery |year=1974 |isbn=978-0-900874-79-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his status and condition, his fantastic subjects and extraordinarily detailed style were generally well-received, with one period reviewer describing his work as "exquisitely ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Etched Thoughts by the Etching Club |journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine |issue=346 |date=August 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He accompanied his masterpiece, ''[[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke]]'', with an elaborate poem providing historical, literary, or mythological context to each of the characters depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacGregor |first=John |title=The Discovery of the Art of the Insane |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-691-04071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy painting was not exclusively the domain of outside art, however. The work of [[John Anster Fitzgerald]] debuted at London's [[Royal Academy]]. His work, in the form a series of Christmas-themed fairy illustrations, received wider public visibility in the [[Illustrated London News]]. The Scottish artist [[Joseph Noel Paton]] exhibited two immensely detailed paintings, ''[[The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania]]'' and ''The Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon'', based on the popular fairy scenes of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. Even [[Edwin Landseer]], sometimes named "[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]'s favourite artist", produced a painting of [[Titania]] and [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in the genre's style, his ''[[Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.&lt;ref name="Stuttaford" /&gt;

The genre also influenced the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the movement it began. Co-founder [[John Everett Millais]] produced a series of fairy paintings based on ''The Tempest'', ending with his 1849 work ''[[Ferdinand Lured by Ariel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Mary |title=An Early Drawing for 'The Tempest' by Everett Millais |journal=Burlington Magazine |issue=126 |date=August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], another of the Brotherhood's initial members, took a more sensual approach to the subject, in both painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Treuherz, Jan, [[Liz Prettejohn]] and Edwin Becker |title=Dante Gabriel Rossetti |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |date=2003-11-24 |isbn=978-0-500-09316-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others involved with the movement, such as [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[William Bell Scott]], also contributed to the genre.

Although the [[Cottingley Fairies]] briefly revived interest in fae subjects, the waning of Romanticism and the advent of [[World War I]] reduced interest in the styles and topics popular during the Victorian era. The illustrated fairy-tale books of [[Arthur Rackham]] are considered its "final flowering".&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==Modern revival==
The interest in [[fantasy]] art and [[fantasy literature|literature]] since the 1970s has seen a revival in the topics and styles of Victorian fairy painting, often in novel contexts. While artists such as [[Stephanie Pui-Mun Law]] have produced genre illustrations for book covers and [[role-playing games]], the works of [[Brian Froud]], also known for a series of illustrated fairy books, have been adapted into several successful motion pictures including ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''. A 2003 book, ''The Art of Faery'', written by [[David Riche]] and mentored by Froud, contributed to the careers of twenty fairy artists of this revival movement, including [[Amy Brown]], Myrea Pettit, [[Jasmine Becket-Griffith]], Philippe Fernandez, [[James Browne (artist)|James Browne]], and [[Jessica Galbreth]], many of whom went on to author individual art books. Depictions of fae have made their way into the popular culture in other ways as well, including clothing designs, ceramics, figurines, needlecraft, figurative art, quilting, many marketed through [[Hot Topic]] to an international market online. Part of the growth in popularity over the past three decades is due to the [[New Age#Philosophy and cosmology|New Age Movement]]. [[Renaissance fair]]s and [[science fiction conventions]] have also developed modern fairy art as a genre of [[collectibles]].

Roberta Bonetti, African Arts, Autum 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  are functional coffins made by specialized carpenters in the [[Greater Accra Region]] in [[Ghana]]. These colourful objects which have developed out of the [[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|figurative palanquins]] are not only coffins, but considered real works of art, were shown for the first time to a wider Western public in the exhibition ''Les Magiciens de la terre'' at the ''Musée National d’Art Moderne'' in Paris in 1989. The seven coffins which were exposed in Paris were done by [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|Kane Kwei]] (1922–1992) and by his former assistant [[Paa Joe]] (b.1947).&lt;ref&gt;A Deathbed of a Living Man.

==Origin and Meaning==
The reason that mainly the southern Ghana-based [[Ga people]] use such elaborate coffins for their funerals is explained by their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.

Fantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people’s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins (''abebuu adekai'') or in the Ga language "okadi adekai".

==History==

[[Image:Drawing by Ataa Oko, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|Figurative palanquin]]; drawing by [[Ataa Oko]] from Ghana]] 
Among the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the [[Greater Accra Region]] around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 52-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance'', in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of these figurative coffins is usually attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: „[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its „invented“ inventor, Kane Kwei“.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Regula Tschumi]] question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ataa Oko]] (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.

== Making the coffins ==
Figurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. 
A coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters’ level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. 
The painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish.Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 63-81. Regula Tschumi 2011. Death-bed of a living man.

In 2007, he opened a new workshop in Pobiman near Accra.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 242-43.&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2013 he was in an Artist residence in UK with his son Jacob making a lion coffin, and 2016 the Artdocs film "Paa Joe and the Lion" made by Benjamin Wigley and Anna Griffin (producer) came out.

===Eric Kpakpo===
Eric Kpakpo was born in 1979 in Nungua, Ghana. He learned carpentry from 1994 until 2000 at Paa Joe's workshop in Nungua. He remained there as a master carpenter until 2006 when he opened his own coffin studio in La.

[[Daniel Mensah]], also called "Hello", was born in 1968 in Teshie, Ghana. He did his six-year apprenticeship with Paa Joe in Nungua. He then spent eight more years with [[Paa Joe]]. Only in 1998 did he open his own studio, "Hello Design Coffin Works", in Teshie. He participated in various art exhibitions and in some European film projects. In 2011, he had an exhibition in the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]].

===Ataa Oko===
[[Image:Ataa Oko, his third wife with a battleship coffin about 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Ataa Oko]] and his third wife with a battleship coffin, c.1960]]
[[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. [[Ataa Oko]] was, until 2002, not in contact with foreigners, he only made coffins for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles.  In 2006, his work was for the first time exhibited at the art museum in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;Six Feet Under, 2006. Art Museum Bern, and "Six Feet Under" 2007/2008 in the Deutsches Hygienemuseum, Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from those artists which come out of Kane Kwei's tradition. Therefore, it differs not only in terms of design, materials, but overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Ataa Oko, Ex. Cat., [[Collection de l'art brut]] (Hg), Infolio, 2010, p. 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2005 to his death in 2012, he became a painter under the supervision of anthropologist [[Regula Tschumi]]. 2010/11 he had his first one-man show in a western Art museum, in the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] in Lausanne.

One of the first streams of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Europe from the 10th century and the beginning of 11th century is called '''First Romanesque''' or '''Lombard Romanesque'''. It took place in the region of [[Lombardy]] and spread into [[Catalonia]] and into the south of [[France]]. Its principal decoration for the exterior, bands of ornamental blind arches are called [[lombard band]]s. It was characterized by thick walls and lack of sculpture in facades, and with interiors profusely painted with frescoes.

During the first quarter of the 11th century, much architectural activity by groups composed of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] teachers and stonemasons (''[[Comacine masters|Comacine Guild]]''), who worked throughout much of [[Europe]] and Catalan territories and erected fairly uniform temples, some of which still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Santa Maria de Roses|Monastery of Santa Maria de Roses]] of 1022 is the oldest of the Lombard features in Catalonia.&lt;/ref&gt; For a considerable area this process of craft diffusion started in [[Lombardy]] and ''Lombardus'' became the word for ''mason'' at an early period.&lt;ref name=KJC&gt;{{cite book|title=Carolingian and Romanesque |first=Kenneth John |last=Conant |date=1959 |place=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might call the First Romanesque style the style of this Italian architectural reconquest.&lt;ref name=KJC/&gt; The large promoter and sponsor of this art in Catalonia was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]], monk and abbot of the [[Santa Maria de Ripoll|monastery of Ripoll]] who, in 1032, ordered the extension of the body of this building with a façade with two towers, plus a transept which included seven apses, all decorated on the outside with the Lombardic ornamentation of blind arches and vertical strips.

Catalan architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] suggested that what was formerly considered the late form of [[pre-Romanesque]] architecture in [[Catalonia]] bore features of Romanesque and thus classified it as First Romanesque (''primer romànic''). The First Romanesque churches of the [[Vall de Boí]] were declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in November 2000.

The geographical proximity of this [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] region to the rest of [[Europe]], resulted in depictions of the emerging [[Romanesque art]] being brought to Catalonia. While the art failed to take root in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula until the second third of the 11th century, there are numerous examples of its presence in [[Catalan counties]] before this time. Though this style may not be considered fully Romanesque, the area contained many of the defining characteristics of this artistic style.

To avoid the term Pre-Romanesque, which is often used with a much broader meaning than is generally suited to refer to early Medieval and [[Early Christian art and architecture|early Christian art]], and in Spain may also refer to the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]], [[Asturian architecture|Asturias]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] and [[Repoblación art and architecture|Repoblación]] art forms, Puig i Cadafalch preferred to use the term "First Romanesque" or "first Romanesque art" to designate those Catalan anticipations of the Romanesque itself.

'''Fran Kelly''' is an Australian radio presenter, current affairs journalist and political correspondent who has hosted the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Radio National]] program ''[[Radio National Breakfast|Breakfast]]'' since March 2005.

==Early life==
Fran Kelly is the fourth of six children, named for her father Frank Kelly, a chiropodist and physiotherapist. Kelly grew up in [[Adelaide]], attending [[St Dominic's Priory College, Adelaide|St Dominic's Priory College]] and completing an arts degree at the [[University of Adelaide]], majoring in literature and classics.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;ABC Radio National, "[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/fran-kelly/2913202 ''Fran Kelly'']."&lt;/ref&gt; While at university she became involved in the women's movement and feminist theatre as well as singing with bands.

After completing her degree Kelly worked at [[Flinders University]] as an activities director, booking bands and organising entertainment for students. In 1980 she moved to Melbourne to fill a similar role at [[La Trobe University]]. She sang in all-girl [[New wave music|new wave]] band Toxic Shoc, which released their single "Intoxicated" in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Wallaby Beat, [http://wallabybeat.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/toxic-shock-intoxicated-7-emi-custom.html "Toxic Shock – Intoxicated 7"], EMI Custom 13236, 1981, 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She volunteered at Melbourne's [[3RRR]] as a host of ''Backchat'', a radio program discussing women's current affairs. In 1984 she co-ordinated the statewide Women's Arts Festival for Victoria's sesquicentenary.

==Career in journalism==
Kelly began work in journalism at the age of 29. In 1988, she moved to Sydney to work on [[Triple J]]'s ''The Drum'', a youth radio program offering opinion and analysis on politics and current affairs. In 1990 she became a reporter for ABC [[Radio National]]'s current affairs programs ''AM'' and ''PM''. She describes covering the Labor Party leadership battle between [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] in 1991: "I remember standing in the pack in the corridor outside the PM's office, and being right up at the front of the crush, asking questions of Kim Beazley", she says. "I also remember not being intimidated, which is when I realised that this was probably the job for me."&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Tim Elliot, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/making-radio-waves-20120313-1uxoe.html#ixzz26aexfCiJ "Making radio waves"]. ''SMH'', 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, Kelly would become Canberra [[News bureau|bureau]] chief, chief political correspondent with ''AM'' and ''PM'', political editor for ABC's [[Radio National Breakfast]] and ABC television's ''[[The 7:30 Report]]'' and the ABC's Europe correspondent. In 2005 she returned to Australia to host ''[[Radio National Breakfast]]''. The program airs nationally in Australia from 6:00&amp;nbsp;am to 9:00&amp;nbsp;am (live in the eastern states and on delay in other states), Monday to Friday, combining news, analysis, commentary, interviews and special features. In describing her work, Kelly says, "I don't have an agenda. What I do is question people as to what I think are the irrationalities in their position..."&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt; She has a great love for the work that she does, "I love the program, I always have... It's just one of the best jobs in Australian media."&lt;ref name="samesame"&gt;Same Same 25, [http://www.samesame.com.au/25/2008/FranKelly/ Fran Kelly: Presenter, Radio National] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429020816/http://www.samesame.com.au/25/2008/FranKelly# |date=29 April 2012 }}." 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly was involved with the documentary series ''[[The Howard Years]]'' in 2008, for which she interviewed former US president [[George W. Bush]]. She appears regularly as a panelist and commentator on ABC TV's ''[[Insiders (TV program)|Insiders]]'', engaging in debate and discussion with other experienced political journalists.

In 2008 Kelly received a Same Same 25 award, recognising her as one of the country's most influential gay and lesbian Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Georgiou, "[http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/gay-lesbian/features/3783/same-same-25-honoured. "Same Same 25 Honoured"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130105172916/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/gay-lesbian/features/3783/same-same-25-honoured.# |date=5 January 2013 }}, ''Time Out Sydney''. 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named by [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'s "the(Sydney)magazine" as one of Sydney's 100 most influential people of 2011. She is described by the Australian electronic magazine ''[[Crikey]]'' as "one of the most influential media players in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Jason Whittaker, [http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/10/26/fran-kelly-quality-journalism-project/ "The quality journalism project: early bird Fran Kelly"], ''Crikey'', 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==

In describing herself, Kelly states that, "What I am, really am, is an activist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/making-radio-waves-20120313-1uxoe.html ''Sydney Morning Herald'']&lt;/ref&gt; She reports that "I've identified as a proud feminist ever since I was at school and was a feminist activist for a long time."&lt;ref name="samesame" /&gt;

In 2007 Kelly launched the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]]'s "Same-Sex: Same Entitlements" inquiry.&lt;ref name="samesame" /&gt; She has been involved with One Just World's speaker forums, moderating a "Women of the World" forum for [[WOMADelaide]] and speaking on the "Stand Up Against Poverty" forum in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;One Just World, [http://www.onejustworld.com.au/Speakers/Fran-"Kelly Forum Speakers and Moderators: Get to Know Fran Kelly"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She partly attributed [[Tony Abbott]]'s downfall as Liberal leader to his handling of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2015/s4324805.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Kelly described it as "fortunate" that [[Malcolm Turnbull]] has replaced Abbott as Prime Minister of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2015/s4352244.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Kelly has been with her partner, journalist Marion Frith, since 1993, together raising Frith's three children from primary school age to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

'''Gene Gauntier''' (May 17, 1885 – December 18, 1966) was an American [[screenwriter]] and [[actress]] who was one of the pioneers of the [[motion picture]] industry. A writer, director and actress in films from mid 1906 to 1920, she wrote screenplays for 42 films. She performed in 87 films and is credited as the director of ''The Grandmother'' (1909).

==Biography==
Born as '''Genevieve Gauntier Liggett''' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to James Wesley and Ada J. (Gauntier) Liggett, she was the middle child of three children. Her older brother was Richard Green Liggett (1880–1941) and her sister was Marguerite Gauntier Liggett (1891–1973), who married Swedish billionare [[Axel Wenner-Gren]]. Gauntier attended the Kansas City School of Oratory while in Kansas City. In 1904, she began her stage career.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tracy|date=2016|title=Outside the System: Gene Gauntier and the Consolidation of Early American Cinema|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.03|journal=Film History|volume=28|issue=1|pages=71|doi=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.03|issn=0892-2160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauntier made her way to [[New York City]] where she began her career in live theater using the [[stage name]] "Gene Gauntier," and first appeared in films between acting jobs with stock company tours. She remembered in her 1928 autobiography ''Blazing the Trail'': &lt;blockquote&gt;“My funds were running low, and in a vague way I thought of the new opening for actors – moving pictures, but, like the rest of the legitimate profession, I looked on them with contempt and felt sure that my prestige would be lowered if I worked in them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 1906, Gauntier was literally thrown into her first screen assignment when she was hired for a daredevil stunt, being filmed as a damsel thrown into a river for [[Biograph Company|Biograph]]'s ''The Paymaster''. It was a one-reeler, where she first met her long-time friend [[Sidney Olcott]] and [[Frank J. Marion|Frank Marion]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Gauntier then returned to stage acting as the lead female role in George Ade's [[The County Chairman (play)|The County Chairman]] at Kansas City's Grand Opera House.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===The Kalem Company===
In 1907, Gauntier became more involved in the fledgling [[silent film]] industry, working for [[Kalem Company|Kalem Studios]]. She became Kalem's star actress, dubbed by the studio as the "Kalem Girl," and also became their most productive screenwriter in collaboration with director [[Sidney Olcott]] on numerous film projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Gauntier goes abroad for features|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13822627/gene_gauntier/|accessdate=September 17, 2017|work=Pittsburgh Daily Post|page=21|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1924, after her departure from the film industry, Gauntier reminisced about her time at Kalem as an intensely fruitful period of creative freedom, when her authorial control and influence extended well beyond acting: "In addition to playing the principal parts, I also wrote, with the exception of a bare half-dozen, every one of the five hundred or so pictures in which I appeared. I picked locations, supervised sets, passed on tests, co-directed with Sidney Olcott, cut and edited and wrote captions (when in the United States), got up a large part of the advertising matter, and, with it all, averaged a reel a week. It was work in those days—but ''creative'' work, blazing the trail. We were always discovering new possibilities and each little success or surprise fed our enthusiasm. Mr. Olcott and I had no one over us. I scarcely ever submitted a scenario and never while abroad. The Kalem never knew what our picture was to be until they saw the first run in the projection room. We would have risked our lives (and did many times) out of sheer love for, and loyalty to the Kalem. For four years the same friends were together and we were known as the O'Kalems, and later, during the oriental tour, as the El Kalems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=July 1924|pages=67 &amp; 101|via=Lantern}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gauntier's astonishing range of creative decision-making at Kalem reflects the "creative chaos in the early years [of the industry that] favored women’s relatively full participation while a new order in the industry mandated against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-gene-gauntier/|title=Gene Gauntier – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, Gauntier had become disillusioned with the new conditions at Kalem, and left to start her own company, Gene Gauntier Feature Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=July 1924|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=July 1924|pages=102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing and copyright===
''[[Tom Sawyer (1907 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' was the first of over three hundred screenplays Gene Gauntier either wrote and produced or sold. In 1907, she wrote the script for ''The Days of '61'', the first film ever made about the [[American Civil War]]. That same year she wrote the screenplay and acted in the first ''[[Ben Hur (1907 film)|Ben Hur]]'' film. The film was adapted in two days&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was not familiar with ''Ben Hur'' and the mere reading of the book would take two days. But this time my self-confidence [in writing] was unlimited and I promised. What is more by dint of working nearly two nights I turned in the script on schedule...and we turned out the greatest spectacle and money-maker up to that time." 
&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the time, there was no [[copyright]] law to protect authors, and she wrote in her autobiography about how the film industry infringed upon everything. As a result of the production of ''Ben Hur'', [[HarperCollins|Harper and Brothers]] and the author's estate ([[Lew Wallace|General Lew Wallace]]) brought suit against the Kalem Company, the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], and Gauntier for [[copyright infringement]]. The suit, which eventually settled the question of American copyright law for all time, took years to make its way through the court system but the [[United States Supreme Court]] finally ruled in favor of Harpers and Wallace, and against the film company.&lt;ref name="Decherney2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Decherney|first=Peter|title=Hollywood's Copyright Wars: From Edison to the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2KsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|date=1 September 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15947-0|pages=47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, Gauntier wrote and acted in 1912's ''[[From the Manger to the Cross]]''; a film that [[Turner Classic Movies]] considers the most important silent film to deal with the life of [[Jesus Christ]], and which has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

===Independent company ===
In December of 1912, Gene Gauntier left the Kalem Company and started the independent Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company, along with her long time collaborator Sidney Olcott and her actor husband Jack Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=July 1924|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=July 1924|pages=102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was among a number of women silent film stars to start their own independent companies during this period. Others included Florence Lawrence with the Victor Company, Helen Holmes with the Signal Film Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=July 1924|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=July 1924|pages=103-104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flora Finch with the Flora Finch Company (1916-1917) and Film Frolic Picture Corporation (1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Pink-Slipped: What Happened to the Women in the Silent Film industry?" in The Wiley-Blackwell History of American Film|last=Gaines|first=Jane M.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marion Leonard with the Gem Motion Picture Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-marion-leonard/|title=Marion Leonard – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1914, Sidney Olcott resigned as producer at Gauntier's company to start his own Sid Olcott International Features. The cause of his falling out with Gauntier remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-gene-gauntier/|title=Gene Gauntier – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company continued until 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=July 1924|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=July 1924|pages=102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable works include, ''The Civil War-era'' (1912), ''A Daughter of the Confederacy'' (1913) (adapted from Wallace Reid's stage play), ''Mystery of Pine Camp'' (1913), ''When Men Hate'' (1913), ''For Ireland's Sake'' (1914), ''A Daughter of Old Ireland'' (1914), and ''The Eye of the Government'' (1914).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Gauntier wrote and stared in many of the films her company produced, while Olcott is credited as the main director during this time. Gaunter Feature Players became competitors of Kalem and eventually faded into oblivion once Gauntier signed on with Universal Pictures and moved to Hollywood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Exit from the film industry===
In 1920 at age thirty-five, and after writing forty-two screenplays and performing in eighty-seven films, Gauntier walked away from the business. In a 1924 interview with Photoplay, Gauntier explained her reasons for leaving: "I was worn out and had lost enthusiasm, without which we cannot, of course, progress. My work in pictures had been too difficult, my strength was sapped and it had become drudgery, especially the new way in which they were produced [...] After being mastered of all I surveyed, I could not work under the new conditions. Domestic tragedy was the finishing touch and I was glad to get out while I could still retain some pleasant memories of the good old days."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick James|date=July 1924|title=Unwept, Unhonored and Unfilmed|url=http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/pho27chic_0001|journal=Photoplay|volume=1924 July|pages=67 &amp;101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Personal life and later years===
In 1912, Gene Gauntier married actor [[Jack J. Clark]]. They were divorced in 1918.

She had a brother, Richard Gauntier Liggett and a sister, Marguerite Gauntier Liggett. Marguerite married wealthy Swedish industrialist [[Axel Wenner-Gren]] in 1909.[[Image:Haringe Slot.jpg|thumb|300px|The tomb of Gene Gauntier at Häringe Slot, Sweden]]
Gauntier had sailed to Europe frequently where her sister Marguerite was an [[opera]] singer who had trained and worked in Germany, and found herself stranded there when [[World War I]] broke out. After leaving filmmaking, she worked as the film and drama critic for the ''Kansas City Post'' in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-gene-gauntier/|title=Gene Gauntier – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to live in Europe where she remained for a number of years while writing her autobiography, ''Blazing the Trail''. The work was serialized in 1928–29 in the American magazine, ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', and the manuscript is on display in the Film Library of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Gauntier also penned two novels, ''Cabbages and Harlequins'' in 1929 and ''Sporting Lady'' in 1933.

Gene Gauntier died in 1966 in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], aged 81. She is buried in Sweden at Häringe Slott close to Marguerite, her sister and Axel Wenner-Gren, her brother-in-Law.

In 1914, June 11 was declared as "Gauntier Day" at the International Exposition of Motion Pictures.

In the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], '''grips''' are technicians in the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a [[key grip]]. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a [[camera dolly|dolly]], [[crane operators|crane]], or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating [[camera dolly|camera doll]]ies or [[crane operators|camera crane]]s. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a [[shot (film)|shot]] under the direction of the [[director of photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howtofilmschool.com/working-as-a-key-grip/|title=Working as a Key Grip: How to be a Key Grip|author=|date=22 November 2012|website=howtofilmschool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Grips' responsibility is to build and maintain all the equipment that supports cameras. This equipment, which includes tripods, dollies, tracks, jibs, cranes, and static rigs, is constructed of delicate yet heavy duty parts requiring a high level of experience to operate and move. Every scene in a feature film is shot using one or more cameras, each mounted on highly complex, extremely expensive, heavy duty equipment. Grips assemble this equipment according to meticulous specifications and push, pull, mount or hang it from a variety of settings. The equipment can be as basic as a tripod standing on a studio floor, to hazardous operations such as mounting a camera on a 100 ft crane, or hanging it from a helicopter swooping above a mountain range.|Media Match Inc.&lt;ref name="mmatch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grip – What do Grips do?|url=http://www.media-match.com/usa/jobtypes/grip-jobs-402724.php|publisher=Media Match Inc|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Good Grips perform a crucial role in ensuring that the artifice of film is maintained, and that camera moves are as seamless as possible. Grips are usually requested by the [[Director of photography|DoP]] (Director of Photography) or the camera operator. Although the work is physically demanding and the hours are long, the work can be very rewarding. Many Grips work on both commercials and features.|Media Match Inc.&lt;ref name="mmatch"/&gt;}}

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]] and most parts of [[Europe]], grips are not involved in lighting.  In the "British System", adopted throughout Europe and the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (excluding Canada), a grip is solely responsible for camera mounting and support.

The term "grip" is from the early era of the [[Circus (performing art)|circus]]. From there it was used in [[vaudeville]] and then in today's film [[sound stage]]s and sets. Some have suggested the name comes from the 1930s–40s slang term for a tool bag or "grip" that these technicians use to carry their tools. Another theory is that in the days of hand-cranked cameras, it was necessary for a few burly men to hang onto the tripod legs to stop excessive movement of the camera. These men became known as the "good grips"—as they were constantly being instructed to "keep a good grip on the tripod".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

US grips typically belong to the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE).  Canadian grips may also belong to IATSE or to Canada's other professional trade unions including Toronto's Nabet 700, or Vancouver's ACFC. British grips usually belong to [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|BECTU]] (Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph &amp; Theatre Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iatse767.org/index.cfm?Section=10&amp;PageNum=78|title=- Las Vegas Craigslist Apartments That Are Affordable For You|author=|date=|website=Las Vegas Craigslist Apartments That Are Affordable For You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lighting==
On all [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes|union]] jobs, grips do not touch the lights themselves. The placement of lighting instruments and electric power distribution is handled by the [[electrician]]s who work under a [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]]. Grips handle all the non-electrical equipment that modifies the light. This work is done by setting stands that hold flags, nets, diffusing materials or other [[gobo (lighting)|gobos]] that control the quality, intensity, or shape of the light.

Grips also set "passive fill" which is a term for the reflected light that is "bounced" back onto a subject on the [[Fill light|fill]] or non-[[key light]] side.  The first choice for most film-makers' fill is a product known in the US as beadboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.achfoam.com/?p=1430|title=It’s Not Beadboard Anymore -|author=|date=|website=blog.achfoam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp_cAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=beadboard|title=Scenic Design and Lighting Techniques: A Basic Guide for Theatre|first1=Rob|last1=Napoli|first2=Chuck|last2=Gloman|date=11 February 2013|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtools.com/1beadboard.html|title=1" Bead Board 4' x 8' (box of 12) 0 - Filmtools|author=|date=|website=www.filmtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919035920/http://www.depronfoam.co.uk/html/what_is_depron.html|title=what is DEPRON|author=|date=19 September 2017|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5zcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=beadboard|title=Motion Picture and Video Lighting|first=Blain|last=Brown|date=12 November 2012|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called "poly", short for polystyrene, in Europe.  It is rigid insulation made for the construction trade, but was adopted by the film trade because of its "true-white" color and "soft" bounce.

Grips may also be called on to set "negative fill", which is the reduction of ambient or non-directional light, such as ambient  sunlight, to raise contrast on the subject. This is achieved by setting "solids", made of black fabric, either flags (up to 4' × 4') or rags (6' × 6' or larger) on the non-key light side or wherever the negative fill is desired.

When shooting day exteriors, grips perform similar functions, but with the sun as the primary light source. Grips use overhead frames up to 20' × 20' or larger for the shaping or filtering of sunlight. The lighting set-ups for these exterior shots can become quite extensive, and the use of [[Cherry picker|boom lift]]s (called "condors") is common. Condors are especially useful at night when they are rigged to raise lights or diffusing material (up to 120 feet in the air) to create moon-effect lighting.

==Rigging==
Grips also satisfy rigging needs on set. Examples of simple rigs include the ''menace arm'', which allows a light to be boomed over set using one stand, or ''goalposts'' that span over top of set using two stands. More advanced rigs can include working with [[pulley]]s, [[steel cable]] or [[truss]]es. Grips also rig picture cars on [[process trailer]]s, placing camera and lights around the vehicle for [[driving shots]]. This often includes the use of hood mounts, side mounts, suction cup mounts and proprietary clamps to attach film equipment to vehicles without causing damage.

Grips also do "blackouts" and "tenting-out" windows and doors. When shooting interiors day-for-night on location, grips need to eliminate all daylight entering the set.  If windows or other openings are not visible in a shot, the light may be blacked out with a cloth known as [[duvetyne]] or rags, and in rare cases, plastic sheeting.  When windows or doors are seen from camera, black out tents must be created outside of windows to allow lights to be placed outside, or green screens to be seen through the window, lit only by lights placed by electricians.

==Safety==
Grips are also responsible for safety on the set as it relates to the force of [[gravity]]. Insofar as [[C-Stand|stands]], [[ladder]]s, [[scaffold]]s, and overhead rigs are properly installed, grips are charged with making them safe because the other crew members must climb on, walk around, or otherwise negotiate the different grip set-ups.  The key grip may even be held responsible for injuries that happen on set, especially if the injury is caused by a falling lighting instrument.

==Tools==
A grip uses some tools typically used by mechanics and construction workers. As in those vocations, grips need hand tools at the ready.(Tools such as ratchet straps,wedges and a normal tool box)

==Types of grips==
* '''[[Key grip]]''' or '''first company grip''': the boss or head of the grip department.
* '''[[Best boy|Best boy grip]]''' or '''second company grip''': this is the key grip's right hand person. He or she will act on behalf of the key grip in areas such as booking crew and equipment rental.
* '''3rd grip''', '''company grip''' or '''gang grip''': the majority of grips fit into this category. They work on set under the direction of the key.
* '''[[Construction grip]]''': Constructs and dismantles the set. On the [[sound stage]], [[construction grip]]s are responsible for laying out, building, moving, and adjusting major set pieces (e.g. walls, ceiling flats) when something needs to be moved to get a camera or lights into position. Construction grips also build decks and platforms. This job is exclusively practiced in the New York area.{{cn|date=January 2015}}
* '''[[Dolly grip]]''': operates the [[Camera dolly|dollies]] and sometimes [[camera crane]]s. He or she is a first hire, like the key grip.

'''House-Museum of Uzeyir Hajibeyov''' – is a house-museum of famous Azerbaijani composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]], opened in 1959.

==History==
In the museum, along with household items belonging to the Hajibeyov family, Uzeyir bey's personal belongings, pictures, books, books dedicated to him and the museum are exhibited in the exposition. In 1985, the 100th anniversary of Uzeyir Hajibeyov was celebrated by UNESCO, guests from many countries of the world. They visited Hajibeyov's house-museum in Shusha where jubilee events were held.

On May 8, 1992, the museum stopped its activity after occupation of Shusha by Armenian forces. From the exhibits of the museum, personal belongings of Hajibeyov were brought to Baku. Currently they are stored in the funds of U.Hajibeyov's house-museum in Baku. The exhibits brought from Shusha are composed of: Uzeyir Bey's personal belongings, childhood hat, costume, sunglasses, coat, his violin played at the Gori Seminary , writing accessories, ink-pot, pencil, personal album, photos, her mother Shirinbayim khanim's bride dressing, books dedicated to Hajibeyov's life and creativity. One of the most valuable exhibits brought to Baku is the handful of Shusha land of a pear tree, Uzeyir bey's favorite in the yard of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Şuşada Ü.Hacıbəyovun ev-muzeyi|url=http://uzeyir.musigi-dunya.az/az/dom_muzey_shusha.html|website= uzeyir.musigi-dunya.az|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing mentions are omitted from this article. Many of these stories explore the social pain and exclusion felt by illegitimate "natural children".

Illegitimacy was a common theme in [[Victorian literature]]. "Illegitimacy was a popular subject for Victorian writers, not only because of its value as a plot device, but also because of the changing laws affecting illegitimate children and their parents which kept the topic in the public eye."&lt;ref&gt;"Representations of illegitimacy in Wilkie Collins's early novels", ''[[Philological Quarterly]]'', 22 March 2004.

===Pre-Victorian===
* [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|The History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c. 1136 prose history):  Much attention is focused on the disputable bastardy of [[King Arthur]], as well as the illegitimate origins of the wizard [[Merlin]].
* [[Sir Thomas Malory]], ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1485 prose romance):  [[King Arthur]] is conceived illegitimately when his father Uther Pendragon utilizes [[Merlin]]'s magic to seduce [[Igraine]], a noblewoman married to Duke [[Gorlois]].  Later, Arthur unwittingly begets a bastard son, [[Mordred]], on his own half-sister [[Morgause]].  At Arthur's court, Mordred and his half-brother Agravain incite growing discontent about the Queen’s adulterous relations with Sir [[Lancelot]], and a civil war ensues.  While Arthur is preoccupied fighting Lancelot, Mordred spreads word that Arthur has been killed, seizes the crown for himself, and attempts to seduce the queen.  She resists, and Arthur quickly returns, attacking and defeating his son’s armies.  Mordred dies in combat, and Arthur is fatally wounded and dies shortly thereafter with his kingdom in ruins.

'''Jessica Thom''' (born 14 July 1980) is a British theatre-maker and comedian best known for Touretteshero, an alter-ego and project aimed at increasing awareness of [[Tourette syndrome|Tourette's Syndrome,]] the neurological condition which she was diagnosed with in her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/09/jess-thom-tourettes-hero-comedy|title=Jess Thom AKA Touretteshero: comedy at its most unpredictable|last=Caird|first=Jo|date=2014-07-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Touretteshero production, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' debuted at [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in 2014. The show won critical acclaim and has since toured across the UK and internationally, including various performances across North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.us/tourettesheros-backstage-biscuit-land|title=Touretteshero's Backstage in Biscuit Land {{!}} British Council|website=www.britishcouncil.us|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.festival.melbourne/2016/events/backstage-in-biscuit-land/|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land {{!}} Melbourne Festival, 06—23 October 2016.|newspaper=Melbourne Festival|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom has also made numerous appearances on British television, notably an interview on ''[[Russell Howard's Good News|Russel Howard's Good News]]'' which has garnered more than 400,000 YouTube views&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell Howard's Good News|title=Russell speaks to real life hero Jess Thom|date=2015-10-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8gOcbneQRQ|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|February|lc=y}}, and was reported on by ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/31/biscuits-this-woman-explains-living-with-tourettes-in-hilarious-and-heart-warming-interview-on-russell-howards-good-news-5473598/|title=This woman explains living with Tourette's in funny and heart-warming interview|last=Metro.co.uk|first=Katie Baillie for|date=2015-10-31|website=Metro|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indy100.com/article/this-russell-howard-interview-destigmatising-tourettes-is-very-very-funny--WJm3Q1NF_e|title=This Russell Howard interview destigmatising Tourettes is wickedly|date=2015-10-31|newspaper=indy100|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early/personal life ==
Thom was born in London. She experienced involuntary vocal and physical tics throughout her childhood as a result of Tourette's Syndrome, but was not diagnosed with the condition until her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thom has recurring vocal tics, the most common of which is the word 'biscuit' which she can utter up to 16,000 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/18/backstage-in-biscuit-land-review-tourettes-makes-for-unpredictable-joyous-must-watch-theatre|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review – Tourette's makes for unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=2016-10-18|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a younger sister, who Jess previously referred to as 'Fat Sister' in a vocal tic whilst she was dieting. Thom acknowledges that her condition presents challenges but seeks to avoid 'self-pity or mockery' and to 'celebrate the creativity and humour of Tourette's'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/faq/|title=FAQ|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to guidance notes for journalists written by the team at Touretteshero, and published by the Guardian:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although some aspects of [Tourette's Syndrome] are challenging, Jess does not describe herself as a 'Tourette's sufferer' under any circumstances. Instead she likes to be referred to as a 'person with Tourette's' or as simply as 'having Tourette's'. She is 'brave' for all sorts of reasons, but not because she is disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/challenging-stereotypes-about-tourette-syndrome|title=Challenging stereotypes about Tourette syndrome|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thom has stated that she finds herself talking about and explaining Tourette's everyday in her day-to-day interactions: "It doesn't always feel like a choice, more a tool for living...Often this is very functional, like explaining at the start of a phone call that I have Tourettes, answering a question or addressing sniggers on public transport."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/reclaiming-cultural-spaces-a-dialogue/|title=Reclaiming Cultural Spaces: A Dialogue - Exeunt Magazine|website=exeuntmagazine.com|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom regularly experiences discrimination as a result of having Tourette's. She has recounted one particularly bad experience in multiple interviews, when she went to see comedian [[Mark Thomas]] perform at Tricycle Theatre.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/09/backstage-in-biscuit-land-edinburgh-festival-2014-review-tourettes|title=Edinburgh festival 2014 review: Backstage in Biscuit Land – Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2014-08-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other audience members complained about the noise she was making as a result of her vocal tics and the venue's staff asked her to move into a sound booth, so she wouldn't be heard by other customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although initially the experience made her vow never to go to the theatre again, it eventually became the catalyst for her becoming a performer: "The creative way to respond was to occupy that space as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Council Arts|title=Jess Thom on accessibility and Dublin Theatre Festival 2016 (audio described)|date=2017-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHKQJ_V2lLs|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom is also a wheelchair user. Following the [[social model of disability]], Thom sees most of the challenges she faces not as a result of her unique neurology and physical impairment, but as a result of the 'disabling barriers' created by society, telling BBC News in 2014: "My wheelchair and my tics are not the thing that disables me; the thing that disables me is the inaccessible environment".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=BBC News|title=What is freedom? Jess Thom, 'Touretteshero' - BBC News|date=2014-03-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rqft1YfDDk|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom studied at the [[Royal College of Art]], London, graduating in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance-and-music/jess-thom-touretteshero|title=Jess Thom: Touretteshero - Performance at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

Prior to becoming a theatre-maker and performer, Thom's career began as a playworker, working with children and young people. She has also been a fundraiser and project coordinator at a charity based in south London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Touretteshero ===

In 2010, Thom and longstanding friend and collaborator Matthew Pountney co-founded Touretteshero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/about/|title=About Touretteshero|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea started out as a way of engaging people with the creative and humorous side of Tourette's, with Thom dressing up in a superhero costume and delivering performances and workshops, especially to children and young people. In 2011, Thom appeared on Episode 3, 'Uses and Abuses' of [[Stephen Fry]]'s five-part BBC series [[Fry's Planet Word]], to discuss her Tourette's and [[coprolalia]] - the involuntary use of swear words which 10% of people with Tourette's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Touretteshero|title=Fry's Planet Word - Touretteshero|date=2011-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOwPaBDFDi4|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01614w9|title=Uses and Abuses, Fry's Planet Word - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Souvenir Press published ''Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero'' based on entries on Thom's blog, for which Fry wrote the foreword.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Welcome-Biscuit-Land-year-Touretteshero-ebook/dp/B009K19DL2/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487761070&amp;sr=1-2|title=Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero|last=Thom|first=Jessica|last2=Fry|first2=Mrs Stephen|date=2012-09-29|publisher=Souvenir Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touretteshero has also put on creative events, like 'We Forgot The Lot!' - a collaboration with [[Tate]] for children and young people with and without Tourette's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/special-event/we-forgot-lot|title=We forgot the lot! - Special Event at Tate Britain {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backstage in Biscuit Land ===

Partly inspired by her negative experience of attending the Mark Thomas gig, and taking its name from Thom's most common vocal tic 'biscuit', ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' began development as a theatre piece which explores the creative opportunities of Thom's tics and also other people's reaction to them. In 2013, Thom met performer and puppeteer, Jess Mabel Jones at a performance of ''Beauty and the Beast'' by ONEOFUS ([[Mat Fraser]] and [[Julie Atlas Muz]]) in London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mabel Jones would later become a lead collaborator on ''Backstage in Biscuit Land''. Mabel Jones's role in this 'one-woman show for two' is to make sure Thom doesn't stray too far off topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to Thom's unique and sporadic ticcing, which is riffed on heavily in the show, no two performances are quite the same. The set for the show features 50 items that were the subjects of some of Thom's spontaneous vocal tics during the development cycle, including a 'babygrow for Les Dennis' and 'ducks dressed as pterodactyls'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' received R&amp;D funding from commissioning body Unlimited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/commission/touretteshero/|title=Touretteshero - Unlimited|newspaper=Unlimited|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but crowdfunding was sought to help bring the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reviews of the initial run at Edinburgh were very positive. Lyn Gardiner in ''The Guardian'' said: "Jess Thom's condition lends her show an absurdist edge Samuel Beckett would be proud of...Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo". She also described it as "extraordinarily entertaining" awarding it four stars.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Alice Jones in ''The Independent'' said: "The humour is black but it's also daft and uplifting, and in places, impossibly moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival/backstage-in-biscuit-land-pleasance-courtyard-review-remarkable-tourettes-inspired-comedy-9651503.html|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land, Pleasance Courtyard, review: Remarkable|date=2014-08-06|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV Bomb, were perhaps most effusive with their praise declaring: "There are more ideas and imagination in this one hour show than most of the Fringe programme combined," awarding it 5 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvbomb.co.uk/review/backstage-in-biscuit-land/|title=Review: Backstage in Biscuit Land: Pleasance Courtyard: Edinburgh: 5 Bombs|newspaper=TV Bomb {{!}} Reviews and Opinion|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its success at Edinburgh, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' went on a tour across the UK throughout 2015 and 2016 including a notable performance at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London. It continued to pick up glowing reviews with ''The Stage'' awarding it four stars and calling the show "a properly joyous thing, funny, informative, and eloquent about the need for theatre to be more accessible to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/backstage-biscuit-land-review-barbican-pit-celebratory-show/|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review at Barbican Pit – 'a celebratory show' {{!}} Review {{!}} Theatre {{!}} The Stage|newspaper=The Stage|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway Baby also awarded the show 4 stars "This show is one big tasty biscuit all right".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://broadwaybaby.com/shows/backstage-in-biscuit-land/706927|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land|website=Broadway Baby|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016 the production went international with a tour of North America which included performances at New York's BRIC, Toronto's Harbourfront, San Francisco's International Arts Festival and Los Angeles' Skirball Cultural Center. Performances in Australia included at the Sydney Opera House,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/whatson/kath17-backstage-in-biscuit-land.aspx|title=BACKSTAGE IN BISCUIT LAND|website=Sydney Opera House|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane and Melbourne International Festival. The performance at the latter earned the show 4 stars in the Australian edition of ''The Guardian,'' with Steph Harmon describing at as "unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Media appearances ===

Thom appeared on ITV's ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in May 2012 and was interviewed at length by [[Phillip Schofield]] and [[Holly Willoughby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mjp221972|title=Jess Thom Tourettes Hero Interview This Morning 2012|date=2012-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyav2KHZP_g|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Thom appeared on RTE's Saturday Night Show with [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]]. In September of that year, Thom delivered a talk about the misconceptions of Tourette's Syndrome at TEDxAlbertopolis, the first [[TED (conference)|TED]] event to take place at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7663|title=TEDxAlbertopolis {{!}} TED.com|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her appearance on Fry's Planet Word in 2014, Thom appeared on Radio 4's [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|The Today Programme]], discussing Tourette's and [[BBC News]] discussing her ideas about 'freedom' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9714000/9714435.stm|title=BBC News - Today - My Tourette's tics are really funny|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In October 2015, Thom was interviewed on BBC's ''[[Russell Howard's Good News|Russel Howard's Good News]],'' with the broadcast apparently reaching some 3 million people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/jess-thom-on-taking-biscuit-land-to-the-small-screen/|title=Jess Thom on taking Biscuit Land to the small screen - Disability Arts Online|newspaper=Disability Arts Online|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month a version of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', adapted for television entitled ''Broadcast from Biscuit Land'' had a 30-minute slot on BBC4's Live from Television Centre, the first live broadcast from Television Centre since the building was decommissioned in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/tvc-theatre|title=BBC - BBC announces return to Television Centre for live theatre broadcast - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Thom appeared on series 10 of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

Touretteshero won the 2014 Total Theatre Award, Best Emerging Company for ''Backstage in Biscuit Land''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/media/news/total-theatre-award-winners-announced|title=Total Theatre Award winners announced {{!}} Edinburgh Festival Fringe|website=www.edfringe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Disability Activism ==
Thom is an outspoken advocate of disabled people's rights. Her personal outlook often inverts the typical negative stereotypes associated with disability, for instance she sees her Tourette's as a source of creativity and her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She advocates for empowerment of disabled people via the social model of disability, telling Exeunt: &lt;blockquote&gt;As a society there are still lots of people who think about disability solely in negative terms. The medical model – 'disabled people are broken and need to be fixed' – and the charity model – 'tragic and in need of help' – are ways of conceptualizing disability that remain widespread even though the social model of disability – 'people are disabled by a failure to consider difference' – underpins our legislation and public services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following her own negative experiences of attending the theatre, Thom has campaigned to get more 'relaxed performances' (a performance where the audience are allowed to make noise and move around, which is more suitable for certain neurodiverse people) in theatres, as well as making every performance of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' a relaxed performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-relaxed-performance-20160530-snap-story.html|title=The theater world is opening its arms to people with Tourette's and autism|last=Greiving|first=Tim|website=latimes.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom has also been an outspoken critic of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]'s cuts to provision for disabled people, telling Disability Arts Online:&lt;blockquote&gt;So many of the structures that were in place to support disabled people to live independent lives have been dismantled in recent years. Ambitions are being capped because of the structures designed to disable and limit what we have access to. There is a big difference between having basic needs met and having the right to an independent life. With the abolition of the Independent Living Fund and Access to Work and all the other attacks on disabled peoples' rights our only option is to keep fighting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jesse Walsh''' is a fictional character in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]]. He was created by David Chaskin and portrayed by [[Mark Patton]]. Making his debut in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' in 1985, Jesse became the first male protagonist of the series. In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge|Freddy's Revenge]]'', Freddy enacts a plan to possess Jesse, using his body to kill in the real world, slowly gaining the strength to manifest his form physically. Outside of the films, Jesse has a main role in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise) #Novels|novels]]. Because of the [[Media portrayal of LGBT people|LGBT representation]] in a mainstream film, Jesse has developed a large fan base in the [[gay community]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/new-documentary-on-a-nightmare-on-elm-st-2-the-gayest-horror-movie-ever-made/|title=New Documentary on A NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST. 2, ‘The Gayest Horror Movie Ever Made'|last=Diaz|first=Eric|date=September 21, 2017|website=Nerdist|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/scream-queen-mark-patton/|title=Scream, Queen!

==Appearances==
===In film===
In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'', Jesse is a high school student who moves into [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]'s old house on Elm Street with his family and begins to have nightmares about [[Freddy Krueger]]. Jesse first encounters Freddy in nightmare sequence that takes place on a school bus. Jesse takes his friend Lisa to school and becomes friends with a boy named Ron Grady after they fight. Lisa helps Jesse unpack his things after school and they find a diary from Nancy Thompson explaining her nightmares. Jesse realizes that Freddy wants to possess him and use his body to kill in the real world. Freddy successfully controls him and kill's Jesse's coach and attempts to kill Jesse's sister though Jesse is able to resist. 

He seeks help from Ron and asks him to watch over him while he sleeps but when Ron falls asleep, Freddy regains control and murders Ron. Jesse retreats to Lisa's house during a party but Freddy again takes control, trying to kill her. Jesse fights back against his control and Freddy instead turns on the other teenagers present, murdering seven before disappearing. Freddy travels to the boiler room where he would take his child victims while still alive.  Lisa confronts Freddy and Jesse is able to finally regain control, exorcising Freddy. After this incident while travelling on the school bus with Lisa, their friend Kerry is impaled through the chest by Freddy and the bus careers off the road, revealing Freddy is still alive and has again trapped Jesse.  His fate is left ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-part-2-freddy-s-revenge-1200426664/|title=Review: ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street, Part 2: Freddy’s Revenge’|last=|first=|date=December 31, 1984|website=Variety|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse briefly appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003).

===In literature===
Jesse is the lead protagonist of the 1992 novelization of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge''. In 2012, Mark Patton released ''Jesse's Lost Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticmass.net/jesses-lost-journals-preface/ |title=Jesse's Lost Journal by Mark Patton - Preface &amp;#124; STATIC MASS EMPORIUM |publisher=Staticmass.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 68 journal entries that span 1982-1985. The first 30 entries closely follow the events of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'', though unveil new details not seen on screen (hints that Jesse's father is a pedophile; Jesse's platonic love for Lisa; his homosexual feelings for a classmate; his feeling of [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] as a kindred spirit). There is a different conclusion in that Jesse supposedly kills Lisa Webber at the power plant, rather than the film's final bus sequence (although she is later revealed to have survived). The remaining 38 journal entries focus on Jesse's time at a psychiatric ward, his sentencing for murdering Ron Grady and the apparent disappearance of Lisa's corpse, his escape from the institution, and his efforts to build a new identity. Jesse still wrestles with Freddy Krueger in his mind, and enters into a panic when Hollywood begins making the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' films based on Jesse's and Nancy Thompson's journal entries.

==Development==
===Conception===
In an interview, [[Mark Patton]] stated, "I don't think that [the character] Jesse was originally written as a gay character. I think it's something that happened along the line by serendipity."&lt;ref name="afterelton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/movies/2010/05/nightmare-elm-street-gay|title=New Documentary, "Never Sleep Again," Answers Age-Old Question: Was "Nightmare on Elm Street 2" Gay?|last=Hartinger|first=Brent|date=May 18, 2010|publisher=After Elton|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521233327/http://www.afterelton.com/movies/2010/05/nightmare-elm-street-gay|archivedate=21 May 2010|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Mark Patton]] beat out actors such as [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Matt Damon]] for the role of Jesse and revealed that he based certain aspects of the character on [[Ally Sheedy]]'s character in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Welcome to Our Nightmares: Behind the Scene with Today's Horror Actors|last=Norman|first=Jason|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=0-78647-986-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Attitude (magazine)|''Attitude'' magazine]], [[Robert Englund]] stated "... the second ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' is obviously intended as a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] themed film. It was early '80s, pre-[[AIDS]] paranoia. Jesse's wrestling with whether to [[coming out|come out]] or not and his own sexual desires was manifested by Freddy. His friend is the object of his affection. That's all there in that film. We did it subtly but the casting of Mark Patton was intentional too, because Mark was out and had done ''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144 |author=Matthew Todd |title=Hollywood Monster |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Attitude (magazine)|''Attitude'' magazine]] |accessdate=May 21, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904162007/http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144 |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In his book ''Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film'', Harry M. Benshoff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film|last=Benshoff|first=Harry|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-71904-473-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; references Jesse, stating the following:

:"Unlike the other films in the series, the protagonist of ''Freddy's Revenge'' is a teenage boy, one whom Freddy spends most of the film trying to "get inside of." Jesse is played with a sweet gay boy aura by actor Mark Patton, who played the preoperative transsexual Karen Black in Robert Altman's ''Come back to the Five-and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean'' (1982). Jesse is introduced as the new kid in town, a loner and an outcast, and spends much of the film in his jockey-shorts, sweat glistening off his bare chest as he repeatedly wakes up from Freddy Krueger-inspired nightmares, which, as at least one author has noted, also suggests the imagery of AIDS-related night sweats."

In ''The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television'',  Claude J. Summers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television|last=Claude|first=Summers|publisher=Cleis Press|year=2005|isbn=1-57344-209-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated: 

:"...''Nightmare on Elm Street 2'' (1985) features both an out homosexual in the form of a sadistic gym coach (who is brutally dispatched in a Grand Guignol shower scene) and a coded/closeted queer boy, Jesse (Mark Patton), whose outsiderness attracts the attention of the monster Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Harry Benshoff reads the scene of the coach's death-which occurs through Freddy's inhabiting, that is, penetrating, Jesse-as a version of homosexual panic that results in Jesse himself, an extension of the 1950s theme of the sophisticated older homosexual taking charge of a vulnerable, wavering younger man."

In ''Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Updated Edition'', Tony Williams notes that Jesse is a victim of a "dysfunctional family situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Updated Edition|last=Williams|first=Tony|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=2014|isbn=1-62674-351-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse and Freddy's relationship is intended to have a homo-erotic subtext with Freddy representing Jesse's fear of 'coming out'.  Commentators point to the lack of interest Jesse shows in Lisa and his retreat to Ron's bedroom after a failed attempt at kissing her, implying Ron is the object of Jesse's affection.  At one point in the film, he also ends up in a gay S&amp;M club where he is confronted by his homosexual gym teacher, Schneider.  This plot is not made obvious in the film though Krueger-actor, Robert Englund and writer David Chaskin both admit to the concealed subtext, indicating that the casting of openly gay actor Mark Patton to play the role was intentional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cc.usu.edu/~alexjack/viddiedreviews/nightmare2.html Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205140638/http://cc.usu.edu/~alexjack/viddiedreviews/nightmare2.html |date=2009-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="x-entertainment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0774/ |title=Movie Review: Nightmare On Elm Street Part II - Freddy's Revenge! |publisher=X-Entertainment |date= |accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904162007/http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144 |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies'', Jim Harper describes Jesse as "the main victim of the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies|last=Harper|first=Jim|publisher=Critical Vision|year=2004|isbn=1-90048-639-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Remaking Horror: Hollywood's New Reliance on Scares of Old'', James Francis, Jr. dubbed the character as a "final boy" and noted the parallels between Jesse and [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]], stating:

:"In the franchise this production became known as the "gay sequel," because the filmmakers presented the audience with a final boy scenario that adhered to final girl rules. In a reversal of conventional gender roles, Jesse wakes from his nightmares screaming in a high-pitched voice, his clothing is feminized (tight jeans, colorful shirts, ornate accessories), and his would-be girlfriend (Lisa) plays the supportive boyfriend role. He dances to cutesy pop music and visits his best male friend (a fit muscular guy clad only in tight briefs) in the dead of the night with the request that he watch over him while he sleeps-in the same manner Nancy petitioned Glen in the original film. Jesse takes Nancy's role as the final "girl," and the script befits a female protagonist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">'''Limes Transalutanus''' is a fortified frontier system of the [[Roman Empire]], built on the western edge of [[Teleorman|Teleorman's]] forests in the Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], modern-day [[Romania]]. The frontier was composed of a road following the border, a military stronghold, a three-metre [[vallum]] 10–12 metres wide, reinforced with wood [[palisade]]s on stone walls, and also a ditch. The Transalutanus limes was 235&amp;nbsp;km long, parallel to [[Olt river]] at a distance varying from 5 to 30&amp;nbsp;km east of the river. The construction was started in 107 under the command of [[Marcius Turbo]], and developed under [[Sextus Julius Severus|Iulius Severus]] (120–126); the final stage of the construction was performed under [[Septimius Severus]] (193–211 d.C.).[[File:Roman Gothic Walls Romania Plain.svg|thumb|400px|right|Transalutanus - red dotted line]]

Between 244–247, under [[Philip the Arab]], after the [[Carpi (people)|Carpian]] and [[Getae]] (or [[Goths]], confusion due to [[Jordanes]]) attacks, the [[Roman Imperial army]] abandoned the limes for some time. They returned to the limes, but closed the road to the [[Rucăr]]-[[Bran, Brașov|Bran]] pass, the same starting from the modern village of [[Băiculeşti, Argeş|Băiculeşti]].

Later, another limes was built in the area, known as [[Brazda lui Novac]].

Today the vallum is used by the [[Romanian Railways|Romanian railroad]] [[Curtea de Argeş]]-[[Piteşti]]-[[Roşiori de Vede]]-[[Turnu Măgurele]].

'''Liz Friedlander''' is an American [[Music video director|music video]] and [[television director]] and [[television producer]].

Originally from [[New York City]], Friedlander moved to [[Pennsylvania]] to attend the Drama Conservatory school at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref name="Liz at FilmBug"&gt;[http://www.filmbug.com/db/345716 Liz Friedlander at FilmBug.com]&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to [[Los Angeles]] where she attended the [[University of California Santa Cruz]] followed by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]], where she graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of her class.

''Lukasa'', "the long hand" (or claw), is a sophisticated memory device that was created, manipulated and protected by the Bambudye, a once powerful secret society of the [[Luba people|Luba]]. ''Lukasa'' are examples of [[Luba art]].

==History of the ''lukasa''==
The story of the ''lukasa'' is closely associated with the history of the [[Luba Kingdom|Luba kingdom]], which dominated most of northern Shaba during the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century. No candidate for political office could receive his title without first becoming a member of the Bambudye society, and the ruler of the Luba kingdom held the highest ranking Bambudye title. Reefe states that while it is not possible to date the origins of the ''lukasa'', the high degree of integration of the lukasa into the structure of the Bambudye society and into the oral lore of the Luba kingdom strongly suggests that this art form is of considerable antiquity.

==A Luba memory device==
Central to Luba artistry, ''lukasa'' aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the ''lukasa'' as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed. 

''Lukasa'' memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reefe|first=Thomas|title=Lukasa: A Luba Memory Device|journal=African Arts|date=July 1978|volume=10|issue=4|pages=48–50, 88|doi=10.2307/3335144|jstor=3335144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A ''lukasa'' serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

Lukasa are approximately the same size (20-25 centimeters long and about 13 centimeters wide) and have the same rectangular dish shape. A row of carved mounds called ''lukala'' runs across their concave surface, dividing it in half. Beads and shells are attached to the board by small slivers of wood or hand-made iron wedges driven through their centers, and cowrie shells are frequently attached at the top and bottom. Beads are arranged in three ways: a large bead surrounded by smaller beads, a line of beads, and one isolated bead. Each configuration lends itself to the transmission of certain kinds of information. Board surfaces also have holes and lines cut into them.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978" /&gt;

==Usage==
Court historians known as ''bana balute'' ("men of memory") run their fingertips across the surface of a ''lukasa'' or point to its features while reciting genealogies, king lists, maps of protocol, migration stories, and the great Luba Epic, a preeminent oral narrative that records how the culture heroes, Mbidi Kiluwe and his son Kalala Ilunga, introduced royal political practices and etiquette.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter Roberts &amp; Allen F.|title=Luba|year=2007|publisher=5 continents|location=Milan|isbn=8874392974}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works.&lt;ref name="Loughran 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughran|first=Kristyne|title=Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World|year=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press for the Canton Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University, and the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Seattle|pages=194–201|authorlink=Does It Have to Be Beautiful to Empower?|editor=T. Seligman and K. Loughran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture heroes are identifiable by beads whose colors have a fan of connotations triggering remembrance of their deeds and exploits, as well as their qualities and physical appearance. For example, Nkongolo Mwamba, the tyrannical anti-hero of the Luba charter, is always represented by a red bead, for he is the red-skinned rainbow-serpent associated with bloody violence. Blue beads (considered "black") stand for Mbidi Kiluwe, the protagonist and culture-bearer of kingship whose skin is shiningly black like that of a bull buffalo, symbol of ambivalent power and secret potential.&lt;ref name="Roberts 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Allen|title=Animals in African Art: From the Familiar to the Marvelous|year=1995|publisher=Prestel for the Museum for African Art|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paths of Luba migration and significant events and relationships are indicated by lines and clusters of beads. Chiefs and their counselors, sacred enclosures, and defined places are shown by circles of beads.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter|author2=Allen F. Roberts |title=Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History|journal=African Arts|date=Winter 1996|volume=29|issue=1|publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mbudye==
Mbudye is a council of men and women charged with sustaining and interpreting the political and historical principles of the Luba state. As authorities on the tenets of Luba society, Mbudye provide a counterbalance to the power of kings and chiefs, checking or reinforcing it as necessary. Members of Mbudye proceed through a series of stages within the society as they master successive levels of arcane knowledge. Only those at the apex of the association can decipher and interpret the ''lukasa's'' intricate designs and motifs. Mbudye members call the twin projections sprouting along the board's outer edge the "head" and "tail" of the ''lukasa'', zoomorphic elements that are meant to evoke the crocodile. An animal equally at home on land and in water, the crocodile's dual nature is suggestive of Luba political organization, whose existence relies on the interdependence of the kikungulu (the head of the Mbudye) and the kaloba (the "owner of the land," or chief).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory Board (Lukasa) [Democratic Republic of Congo; Luba] (1977.467.3)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1977.467.3|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Lukasa==
The ''lukasa'' fulfilled many mnemonic functions, for it could be interpreted in a number of ways, and while all memory boards shared certain common information, particular types of memory boards communicated specialized data. There were three distinct categories of lukasa, each emphasizing a certain kind of knowledge. First, the ''lukasa Iwa nkunda'', "the long hand of the pigeon," bears information on mythical heroes and early rulers and on the mythical migration routes of the Luba. Second, the ''lukasa Iwa kabemba'', "the long hand of the hawk," is concerned with the organization of the Mbudye society. A third type of memory board was created for the use of individual Luba rulers and contained secret information about divine chiefship. No examples of this type, referred to as the ''lukasa Iwa kitenta'', "the long hand of the sacred pool,"' still exist.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978" /&gt;

[[Image:MJ Winkler.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Margaret J. Winkler]]
'''Margaret J. Winkler,''' (April 22, 1895 – June 21, 1990) was a key figure in [[Animation Before Hollywood: The Silent Period|silent animation history]], having a crucial role to play in the histories of [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]], [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]], [[Otto Messmer]], and [[Walt Disney]]. She was the first woman to produce and distribute animated films. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. Winkler was the subject of a feature film [[Walt Before Mickey]]. 

==Early life and career==
Hungarian-born of German descent, Winkler began her career as personal secretary of [[Harry Warner]], one of the founders of [[Warner Brothers]]. Through most of the silent era, Warner Brothers was strictly a film distributor, and Harry Warner was the man who made the deals. In 1917, Warner Brothers began distributing cartoons of [[Mutt and Jeff]] in New York and New Jersey. Warner was impressed with Winkler's talents, and when Max and Dave Fleischer, owners of [[Fleischer Studios]], came to him with their series [[Out of the Inkwell]], he gave it to Winkler and encouraged her to form her own distribution company, Winkler Productions, on a state's rights basis.

In 1922, she signed a contract with [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan Productions]] to produce [[Felix the Cat]] cartoons. This established her reputation as the top distributor in the cartoon world. It was a good thing, because at the end of the same year the Fleischer brothers, flush with success as a result of Winkler's work, left her to form their own distribution company, Red Seal Pictures. However much Sullivan helped Winkler's business, he and Winkler were constantly fighting. In September 1923, the renewal of his contract came up, and his unrealistic demands meant Winkler Pictures might have to survive for a while without its biggest star. Winkler viewed a pilot reel, called "Alice's Wonderland", submitted by then neophyte animator Walt Disney, the first entry in the "[[Alice Comedies]]" series. Winkler was intrigued with the idea of a live-action girl in a cartoon world, and signed Disney to a year-long contract despite the fact that the [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio|studio]] that made the cartoon was now bankrupt.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Disney subsequently formed a new studio, Disney Brothers, which was the first cartoon studio in Hollywood and soon changed its name to [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Disney was helped by the tutelage of Winkler, who insisted on editing all of the "Alice Comedies" episodes herself. One of her suggestions was the addition of a suspiciously Felix-like character called Julius. This was apparently the "straw that broke the camel's back" for Sullivan, who signed with rival distributor [[E. W. Hammons]] of [[Educational Pictures]] in 1925.

Winkler was the first female member of the Motion Picture Producer's Guild. To disguise her gender, she would sign letters "M.J. Winkler."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ink-paint-the-women-of-walt-disneys-animation/oclc/968290213|title=Ink &amp; paint: the women of Walt Disney's animation|last=Johnson|first=Mindy|date=2017|isbn=9781484727812|language=English|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In 1924, she married [[Charles B. Mintz]], a film distributor who had been working for her since 1922. Soon after she had her first child and retired from the business, turning her company over to her husband. The couple had two children, Katherine and William.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Census, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Margaret J. Winkler died, aged 95 on June 21, 1990 in [[Mamaroneck, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-1009_1_margaret-winkler-mintz Margaret Winkler obituary], ''L.A. Times''. June 24, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mistress Nell Quickly''' is a fictional character who appears in several plays by [[William Shakespeare]]. She is an [[inn-keeper]], who runs the [[Boar's Head Inn|Boar's Head Tavern]], at which [[Sir John Falstaff]] and his disreputable cronies congregate. 

The character appears in four plays: ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

==Character and role==
In all the plays Quickly is characterised as a woman with strong links to the criminal underworld, but who is nevertheless preoccupied with her own respectable reputation. Her speech is filled with [[malapropism]]s, [[double entendres]] and "bawdy innuendo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Hattaway|first =Michael| authorlink =|title =The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's History Plays|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]| series =| volume =| edition =| year =2002|location =[[Cambridge]]| pages =169–171| language =| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=PLUcb-NK644C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22Mistress+Quickly%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6yI4UcbyIomArAHm3oDYCA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mistress%20Quickly%22&amp;f=false|doi =| isbn =9780521775397|mr =|zbl =|jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her name may be a pun on "quick lay", though "quick" also had the meaning of "alive", so it may imply "lively", which also commonly had a sexual connotation.&lt;ref name = "mad"&gt;J. Madison Davis, ''The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary'', Routledge, 2012, p.406.&lt;/ref&gt; Quickly's character is most fully developed in ''Henry IV, Part 2'' in which her contradictory aspirations to gentility and barely concealed vulgarity are brought out in her language. According to James C. Bulman, she "unwittingly reaveals her sexual history" by her blithe malapropisms and "her character is both defined and undone by her absurdly original speech"&lt;ref&gt;James C. Bulman "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2", ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's History Plays'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though her age is not specified, the comment that she is "pistol proof" has been interpreted to mean that she is past childbearing age,&lt;ref&gt;Melchiori, G (ed), ''The Second Part of King Henry IV'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt; and she says she has known Falstaff for twenty nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Henry IV, Part 2, Act 2, Scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the plays===
In ''Henry IV, Part 1'', Mistress Quickly is described as the proprietor of the [[Boar's Head Inn|Boar's Head Tavern]] in the London neighbourhood of [[Eastcheap]]. She is married, as Prince Hal asks after her husband, referring to him as "an honest man"; he does not appear in the play. She participates in the mock-court scene in which Falstaff pretends to be the king. 

In ''Henry IV, Part 2'', she asks the authorities to arrest [[Falstaff]], accusing him of running up excessive debts and making a fraudulent proposal of marriage to her (implying that she is now a widow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of that play, Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet are arrested in connection with the beating to death of a man by [[Ancient Pistol]]. 

In ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' she works as nurse to Caius, a French physician, but primarily acts as a messenger between other characters, communicating love notes in a plot largely concerned with misdirected letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Courtni Crump|title=The Women of Shakespeare's Plays: Analysis of the Role of the Women in Select Plays with Plot Synopses and Selected One-Act Plays|year=1993|publisher=University Press of America|pages=59–62|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dfRpv0n1kG4C&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Mistress%20Quickly&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=Mistress%20Quickly&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end she takes the role of the queen of the fairies in the practical joke played on Falstaff.

In ''Henry V'', she is referred to as Nell Quickly. She is with Falstaff at his deathbed, and describes his death to his friends. She marries Falstaff's ensign, Ancient Pistol, despite having previously been engaged to [[Corporal Nym]]. While Pistol is away in France, he receives a letter from which he learns that "my Doll is dead", having succumbed to the "malady of France" ([[syphilis]]). Many editors take the name Doll to be a misprint for "Nell", but it has also been interpreted as a reference to Doll Tearsheet rather than Quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Andrew Griffin, ''Locating the Queen's Men, 1583–1603'', Ashgate, 2013, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Continuity issues===
[[File:Falstaff and other theatrical characters.jpg|thumb|The earliest depiction of Mistress Quickly (labelled "hostes[s]") with Falstaff, in a print from 1662 depicting popular stage characters of the time.]]
Quickly's role in ''The Merry Wives'' is sufficiently different from her role in the other plays that some critics have suggested that she cannot be the same character.&lt;ref name = "mad"/&gt; Nothing suggests that she already knows Falstaff (or Bardolph and Pistol), and there is no explanation of how she comes to working for Dr. Caius. However, there are also many other continuity problems with other characters in the play. For example, the play is set at an unspecified period in the reign of Henry IV, but Shallow is feuding with Falstaff from the beginning, even though in the Henriad plays he only realises his mistake in trusting him after Henry V is crowned. These oddities may have arisen because the play was written rapidly for a specific occasion.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Craik (ed.), The Merry Wives of Windsor (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 1–13. See also H.J. Oliver (ed.). The Merry Wives of Windsor (London: Arden, 1972), lv and Leslie Hotson Shakespeare versus Shallow (London: Kessinger, 2003), 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some signs of attempts to make the events fit the action of the [[Henriad]] plays, for example the brief scene in which Pistol expresses his attraction to her and says "she is my prize". This fits with his marriage to her in ''Henry V''. There is no further reference to his pursuit of her in the play, but he plays the part of her consort in the fairy masque at the end.

There are similar, less glaring problems with the Henriad plays. In ''Henry IV, Part 1'' she is evidently a married innkeeper. No reference is made to the death of her husband in Part 2, just that Falstaff promises to marry her. Likewise, the tavern seems to evolve into a reputed brothel by the beginning of ''Henry V''.

==In other literature==
Mistress Quickly appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play ''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'' (1766), a comedy by [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]], which is set in the period between the end of ''Henry IV, Part 2'' and the beginning of ''Henry V''. Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting [[Robert Shallow]] and his young cousin Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so she ends up married to Pistol, as in ''Henry V''.

[[James White (1775–1820)|James White]]'s book ''Falstaff's Letters'' (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his associates, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. She had inherited them from Mistress Quickly herself, who kept them in drawer in the Boar's Head Tavern until her death in "August 1419". The collection includes letters written by Mistress Quickly to Falstaff complaining of his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;White, James, ''Falsteff's Letters'', London, Robson, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Skinner's novel ''Master Quickly'' (2013) attempts to fill in the gaps in Shakespeare by revealing the truth about her neglected husband.

'''''Mortal Kombat: Live Tour''''' was a [[martial art]] [[theatre|theatrical]] stage show featuring ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' characters, sound, and [[Laser lighting display|laser light effects]] on stage. The plot was based on three fighters rescuing their friends and retrieving a magic [[amulet]] from the evil master of Outworld, [[Shao Kahn]], in order to save the Earth.

The show debuted at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] on September 14, 1995, followed by a 200 city road trip into 1996. It replicated ''Mortal Kombat'' [[martial arts]] and [[video game]] moves on stage mixed with dancing and music. [[Lip synching]] were pre-recorded and used to demonstrate the official ''MK'' [[sound effects]], though there was no graphic violence or [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] visible in the show. The audience participated by yelling "Run!" or "Kick him!" as part of the live action.

==Production==
The lasers were produced by Laser Fantasy International of Seattle and operated by Dave Haskell and Chris Thornberry. A medium frame Spectra Physics and a 40 watt laser scope were used along with a custom fiber system for these effects. It was produced in part by "David Fishof Presents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidfishofpresents.com/ |title=David Fishof Presents |publisher=David Fishof Presents |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21420792.html?dids=21420792:21420792&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+24%2C+1995&amp;author=CHRIS+RIEMENSCHNEIDER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=%60Kombat'+Set+to+Battle+New+Terrain-and+Critics&amp;pqatl=google |title=`Kombat' Set to Battle New Terrain-and Critics|author=Riemenschneider, Chris|publisher=Los Angeles Times|via=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1995-08-24 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakim Alston (Jax) played an Outworld warrior who was defeated by [[Liu Kang]] ([[Robin Shou]]) in the original [[Mortal Kombat (film)|''MK'' movie]] a year earlier. Fight coordinator [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] also appeared in the movie as Shang Tsung.

Note that Mortal Kombat: Live Tour had two separate touring companies running simultaneously, which is why some dates are listed twice.

'''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sidney Drew''' were an American comedy team on stage and screen.  The team initially consisted of '''Sidney Drew''' (August 28, 1863 – April 9, 1919) and his first wife '''Gladys Rankin''' (October 8, 1870 – January 9, 1914).&lt;ref&gt;[http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/atho/atho.detail.people.aspx?personcode=per0061988 Sidney Drew: ''North American Theatre Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;  After Gladys died in 1914, Sidney Drew married '''Lucile McVey''' (1890–1925), and the two performed as Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew.

==Biography==
[[File:Taking a Rest - His First Tooth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ad for ''Help'', ''Taking a Rest'', and ''His First Tooth'' (1916).]]
'''Sidney Drew''' or ''Mr. Sidney Drew'' as he was usually billed, was an uncle of actors [[Barrymore family|Lionel, Ethel and John Barrymore]]. Drew's origins have been the subject of speculation. His mother [[Louisa Lane Drew|Mrs. Louisa Drew]] said she adopted him not long after the death of her husband [[John Drew (actor)|John Drew, Sr.]] in 1862. Researchers have speculated that Sidney was Mrs. Drew's biological child either from her late husband or from a love affair. It was noticed that she disappeared for some time to the country before returning to [[Philadelphia]] with baby Sidney. John Barrymore always said Sidney looked too much like Grandmother Louisa to be anyone else's child.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In his stage career, Sidney Drew was a light-hearted leading man along with his wife, Gladys Rankin, the first ''Mrs. Sidney Drew''.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, David (2002). ''McKeee Rankin and the Heyday of the American Theater'' pp. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, the pair introduced legitimate drama to the [[vaudeville]] stage.&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=YNc9VRnnP_MC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq= ''New York City Vaudeville''].

Gladys Rankin Drew died later that year from undisclosed causes. Sidney Drew was briefly paired with [[Clara Kimball Young]], with whom Drew starred in the two-reel melodrama satire ''Goodness Gracious; or, Movies as they Shouldn't Be'' (1914) directed by Clara's husband [[James Young (director)|James Young]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

He remarried to Lucile McVey, born in [[Sedalia, Missouri]], a [[Vitagraph]] scriptwriter who briefly went under the name Jane Morrow. Sidney Drew added his new wife to his one-reel comedies, acknowledging McVey as both a writer and co-director. As a comedy team, known as Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sidney Drew, the team perfected the situation comedy style that the team of [[John Bunny]] and [[Flora Finch]] started. Their style of comedy was usually gentle [[satire]] on [[marriage|married life]], but also poked fun at the world of [[show business]]. Sidney took sole credit as director for two five-reel features at Vitagraph, the groundbreaking cross-gender comedy ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'' (1914), in which [[Edith Storey]] played the leading female role, and the drama ''Playing Dead'' (1915), the Drews' only attempt at a "serious" film. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1916, the popular team was lured to [[Richard A. Rowland]]'s and [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s newly founded [[Metro Pictures|Metro]] company, where they continued to dominate in the field of marital comedy. During [[World War I]], Sidney Drew's son, actor-director [[S. Rankin Drew]], was killed in action. Drew never recovered from the loss. The team left Metro for personal appearances but was signed to V.B.K. Sidney Drew died suddenly on April 9, 1919. Lucile McVey Drew died in 1925 from [[cancer]], at the age of 35.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">{{about|the concept of free information|the organization|Open Knowledge}}

'''Open knowledge''' is knowledge that one is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Definition - Defining Open in Open Data, Open Content and Open Knowledge|url=https://opendefinition.org/od/|website=opendefinition.org|publisher=Open Knowledge Open Definition Group|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open knowledge is a set of principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution of how knowledge works in an ''open'' manner. Knowledge is interpreted broadly to include data, content and general information.

The concept is related to [[Open-source model|open source]] and the ''Open Knowledge Definition'' is directly derived from the [[Open Source Definition]]. Open knowledge can be seen as being a superset of [[open data]], [[open content]] and [[Gratis versus libre|libre]] [[open access]] with the aim of highlighting the commonalities between these different groups.

==History==
===Early history===
Similarly to other 'open' concepts such as open data and open content, though the term is rather new, the concept is old. For example, one of the earliest printed texts of which we have record is a copy of the Buddhist Diamond sutra produced in China around 868 AD, and in it can be found the dedication: "for universal free distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollock|first1=Rufus|title=The Value of the Public Domain|url=https://rufuspollock.com/papers/value_of_the_public_domain.html|website=rufuspollock.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
In the early twentieth century a debate about [[intellectual property rights]] developed within the [[German Social Democratic Party]]. A key contributor was [[Karl Kautsky]] who in 1902 devoted a section of a pamphlet to "Intellectual Production" which he distinguished from [[material production]]:
:"Communism in material production, anarchy in the intellectual that is the type of a Socialist mode of production, as it will develop from the rule of the proletariat—in other words, from the Social Revolution through the logic of economic facts, whatever might be: the wishes, intentions, and theories of the proletariat."&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kautsky|first1=Karl|title=The Social Revolution and, On the Morrow of the Social Revolution|date=1903|publisher=Twentieth Century Press|location=London|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}

This view was based on an analysis according to which [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Law of value]] only affected material production, not [[intellectual production]].

With the development of the public Internet from the early 1990s, it became far easier to copy and share information across the world. The phrase '[[information wants to be free]]' became a rallying cry for people who wanted to create an internet without the commercial barriers that they felt inhibited creative expression in traditional material production.

Wikipedia was founded in 2001 with the ethos of providing information which could be edited and modified to improve its quality. The success of Wikipedia became instrumental in making open knowledge something that millions of people interacted with and contributed to.

'''Ordubad Buzkhana''' – is an ice-house located in [[Ordubad]]. The architectural monument was built in the XIV century. It is one of the largest ice-houses in Azerbaijan. The ice-house is located on the southern side of the city of Nakhchivan, also near the Imamzadeh complex. It is one of three main ice houses in Nakhchivan, one of the other ones being [[Nakhchivan Buzkhana]].

It was restored in the XVIII century. In 2014, the historical and architectural buzkhana was restored and operated again.&lt;ref name="azertag"&gt;{{cite web|title= Buzxanalar Naxçıvanın tarixi abidələri sırasında özünəməxsus yer tutur|url= https://azertag.az/xeber/Buzxanalar_Naxchivanin_tarixi_abideleri_sirasinda_ozunemexsus_yer_tutur-1024511|publisher= azertag.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The total area of the ice house is 166 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, its height is 11,32 meters. The building consists of a large room in internal entrance, a double stair with 36 stairs and a cellar where the ice is kept. The ice house has 5 domes, a common hall, an entrance and an auxiliary room. The walls are built of baked bricks and lime-clay mixture. Thickness of the walls of the building is 0.8 meter. The ceiling of the room is flat.&lt;ref name="naxcivantv"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan inciləri: Buzxanalar|url= http://naxcivantv.az/index.php/x-b-rl-r/940-buzxana.html|publisher= naxcivantv.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dqmk"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan inciləri: Buzxanalar|url= http://www.dqmk.nmr.az/medeniyyet/tarixi_abideler/ordubad_buzxana.php|publisher= dqmk.nmr.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The ice house was built for commercial purposes. In the past, ice-houses were used by local residents to protect themselves, their personal belongings and their food products against heat in summer. Special people used to extract ice from the buzkhana by wearing special clothes and fed needs of people of Ordubad.&lt;ref name="dqmk"/&gt;

==Life==
Peter Trawny studied philosophy, [[musicology]] and [[art history]] at the [[Ruhr University]] Bochum, where he, after a guest stay at the [[Albert Ludwigs University]] in [[Freiburg]] in [[Breisgau]] and at the [[University of Basel]], the Magisterium graduated in 1992. In 1995, he received his doctorate at Klaus Held with a dissertation on [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the world. With a doctoral scholarship from the Study Foundation of the German people, he was promoted and awarded in 1997 with the Second Prize of all faculties of the University of Wuppertal. This was followed by a two-month stay at the [[University of Kyoto]] in Japan with a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Starting in 1997, Trawny was a research assistant at the University of Wuppertal in Klaus Held's department of phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo22228791.html |title=Heidegger and the Myth of a Jewish World Conspiracy |publisher=uchicago.edu |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he completed his habilitation at the University of Wuppertal about the time of the Trinity. Studies on the Trinity in [[Hegel]] and [[Schelling]]. Sponsored by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, after his habilitation he worked from 2001 to 2003 at the philosophy department of the Freiburg Albert Ludwigs University. In 2005, the German Literature Archive in [[Marbach on Neckar]] granted Trawny a full scholarship and honored him in 2006 with the Ernst Jünger grant from the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the same year he was appointed associate professor of philosophy at the University of Wuppertal. 2009 brought Trawny a W3 professorship at the University of Wuppertal for aesthetics and philosophy of culture. In 2011 he assumed a deputy professor at the [[Södertörns Högskola]] in [[Stockholm]] at the Center for Baltic and East European Studies. In 2012 Trawny founded the Martin Heidegger Institut in German at the Bergische Universität in Wuppertal, for whose support he would win, among others, the legacy of Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophie.uni-wuppertal.de/home/forschung/institute-und-zentren.html#c10940 (Stand: 24. Januar 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/wuppertal/einmalig-neues-uni-institut-erforscht-heideggers-lehren-1.1211804&lt;/ref&gt;

Trawny taught in addition to his international lecturing and research as a Visiting Professor at several international universities such as the [[University of Vienna]], the [[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]] or Södertörns Högskola in Stockholm at the Center for Baltic and East European Studies.

==Scientific work==
Trawnys approach to philosophical problems uses a phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The focus of his work are questions of political philosophy, ethics, art and media philosophy, as well as questions of art and literature.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/is-heidegger-contaminated-by-nazism |title=Is Heidegger Contaminated by Nazism? |date=April 28, 2014 |publisher=newyorker.com |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his most recent works, Trawny dedicated to the elaboration of a philosophical understanding of globalization and cosmopolitanism, which in itself Adyton suggests, and especially in medium and Revolution clearly differentiated. Trawny tries to interpret the globalization of their strained relationship with the media and thus comes to a determination of the medium as "the immaterial unity of technology and capital". On the basis of Heidegger's event thinking tries Trawny the Marxist revolution discourse in the historical-contextual conditions of the 21st Century to translate, thus intertwined with those of its designation of the medium, the questions of political philosophy and media art philosophy.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

In addition to his research and teaching, Trawny is consistently involved in the scholarly edition of Martin Heidegger's collected works.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

'''Poetry analysis''' is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, structural semiotics and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work.

The words ''poem''&lt;!--Poem redirects to Poetry--&gt; and ''[[poetry]]'' derive from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''poiēma'' (to make) and ''poieo'' (to create). That is, a poem is a ''made thing''&lt;!--this slightly awkward phrase is used for emphasis--&gt;: a creation; an artifact. One might think of a poem as, in the words of [[William Carlos Williams]],{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} a "machine made of words". [[Machine]]s produce some effect, or do some work. They do whatever they are designed to do. The work done by this "machine made of words" is the effect it produces in the reader's mind. A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works.

Like poetry itself, poetry analysis can take many forms, and be undertaken for many different reasons. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to his or her students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen his or her own mastery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Overview==

==="The Destruction of Sennacherib", by Lord Byron===
Similarly, one can derive pleasure&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bogan, 'The Pleasures of Formal Poetry', in Reginald Gibbons (ed.), ''The Poet’s Work: 29 Poets On The Origins And Practice Of Their Art'' (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1979) {{ISBN|978-0-395-27616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet's toolbox—[[Meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhyme]]—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology, as in this, the first [[stanza]] of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s "The Destruction of Sennacherib":

:The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
:And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
:And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
:When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Byron's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud. The lines have a powerful, rolling, and very evident rhythm, and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore. In other words, the ''physicality'' of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem's effect. The poem does not have a deep, hidden, [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] meaning. Rather, it is simply pleasurable to read, say, and hear.

Critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for ''why'' the language is pleasurable, and ''how'' Byron achieved this effect. The lines are not simply rhythmic: the rhythm is regular within a line, and is the same for each line. A poem having a regular rhythm (not all poems do) is said to follow a certain [[meter (poetry)|meter]]. In "The Destruction of Sennacherib", each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable, with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line. Those basic patterns are called [[Foot (prosody)|feet]], and this particular pattern (weak weak STRONG) is called an [[anapest]]. A line with four feet is said to be in [[tetrameter]] (''[[Wiktionary:tetra-|tetra-]]'', from the Greek for four). This poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm, and that rhythm has a name: this poem is written in ''anapestic tetrameter''. (This process of analyzing a poem's rhythms is called [[Meter (poetry)|scansion]].) The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem's language derives in part from Byron's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or [[rhyme scheme]]): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called [[couplet]]s. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by [[alliteration]], as in the repetition of ''s'' sounds in the third line: "And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea".

==Tools==

===Poetic forms===
Poems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the [[sonnet]] or [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]]. Such poems exhibit closed form.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--What does this mean?--&gt; Others (which exhibit [[Open Form|open form]]) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem's effect on the reading mind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Closed forms====
A poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the [[English language]] that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets ([[sonnet]]s, [[sestina]]s, [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside ([[Robert Frost|Frost's]] "[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]" is a good example).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Of all closed forms in English prosody, none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than '''[[blank verse]]''', which is [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme. In English, iambic pentameter is by far the most frequently employed meter. Among the many exemplary works of blank verse in English are [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and most of the verse passages from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays, such as this portion of a famous [[soliloquy]] from [[Hamlet]]:

:To be, or not to be—that is the question.
:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
:Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
:And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep —
:No more, and by a sleep to say we end
:The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
:That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
:Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
:To sleep—perchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub.

Note that Shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line. Rather, most lines have five strong syllables, and most are preceded by a weak syllable. The meter provides a rhythm that informs the line: it is not an invariable formula.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the '''[[heroic couplet]]'''. Two masters of the form are [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Dryden]]. The form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope's ''An Essay on Criticism''.

:’Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
:Appear in writing or in judging ill;
:But, of the two, less dang’rous is th’ offence,
:To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
:Some few in that, but numbers err in this,
:Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
:A fool might once himself alone expose,
:Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

Fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a '''[[sonnet]]'''. There are two major variants. The form originated in [[Italy]], and the word derives from "sonetto", which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "little song". The [[Italian sonnet]] or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CD CD CD, ABBA ABBA CCE DDE, or ABBA ABBA CDD CEE. In each of these, a group of eight lines (the [[Octave (poetry)|octave]]) is followed by a group of six (the [[sextet]]). Typically, the octave introduces a situation, idea, or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution. For example, consider [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s "The Sound of the Sea":

:The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,
:And round the pebbly beaches far and wide
:I heard the first wave of the rising tide
:Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep;
:A voice out of the silence of the deep,
:A sound mysteriously multiplied
:As of a cataract from the mountain's side,
:Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.
:So comes to us at times, from the unknown
:And inaccessible solitudes of being,
:The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul;
:And inspirations, that we deem our own,
:Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing
:Of things beyond our reason or control.

The octave presents the speaker's experience of the sound of the sea, coming to him from some distance. In the sestet, this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous.

English has (proportionally) far fewer rhyming words than Italian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Recognizing this, Shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to English by creating an alternate rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The poet using this, the [[English sonnet]] or [[Shakespearean sonnet]] form, may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought (as in "The Silken Tent" above), or treat the groups of four rhyming lines (the [[quatrains]]) as organizational units, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 73:

:That time of year thou mayst in me behold
:When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
:Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
:Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.
:In me thou seest the twilight of such day
:As after sunset fadeth in the west,
:Which by and by black night doth steal away,
:Death's second self, which seals up all in rest.
:In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
:That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
:As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
:Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
:This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
:To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

In lines 1–4, the speaker compares his time of life to autumn. In lines 5–8, the comparison is to twilight; in lines 9–12, the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire. Each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time, creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end, the death implied in the final couplet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

At the "high end" of closed forms are the '''[[sestina]]''' and '''[[villanelle]]'''. At the "low end" are forms such as the '''[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]''', which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter (three anapests per line), followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter (two anapests per line), followed by one line of anapestic trimeter. (The beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line.) Any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick, however most also follow an AABBA rhyme scheme. Most limericks are humorous, and many are ribald, or outright obscene (possible rhymes that could follow an opening like "[[There once was a man from Nantucket]]" are left as an exercise for the reader). Nonetheless, the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression:

:Titian was mixing rose madder.
:His model posed nude on a ladder.
::Her position to Titian
::Suggested coition
:So he nipped up the ladder and had her.

==== Open forms ====
In contrast, a poet using '''[[free verse]]''' (sometimes called "[[Open Form|open form]]"){{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem, letting the structure grow out of the poem's subject matter or inspiration. A common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form ([[Frost]] likened it to "playing tennis with the net down"&lt;ref&gt;Address at Milton Academy, Massachusetts (17 May 1935){{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--I must have missed that event--is it published somewhere?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
, but such is not necessarily the case (skeptics should ''try'' playing tennis without a net): success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding. In the best open form poems, the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form. As X. J. Kennedy has said, "Should the poet succeed, then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying" (582). The metre of ‘classical’ poetry is replaced in open verse by [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] in rhythm, line indentation, with pauses implied by the syntax, thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry, essential to an oral art form, composed to be read aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Sounds Aloud http://soundsaloud.blogspot.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Whitman]] was an important innovator of open form, and he demonstrates its merits in "[[A Noiseless Patient Spider]]".

:A noiseless patient spider,
:I marked where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
:Marked how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
:It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
:Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

:And you O my soul where you stand,
:Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
:Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
:Till the bridge you will need to be formed, till the ductile anchor hold,
:Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.

The long, rolling lines—unified, held together like strong cords, by [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]—partake of the same nature as the spider's filaments and the soul's threads. Two balanced stanzas, one describing a spider, the other the speaker's soul, perfectly frame the implicit comparison, with neither being privileged over the other. Just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance, the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words: isolated/detached, launched/fling, tirelessly/ceaselessly, surrounding/surrounded.

In this poem, Whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas, much like (but not exactly like) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems. The form works quite well, but there is no established term that describes it. Rather, Whitman created this form so that he could write this poem. Conceivably, other poets could adopt the form, and repeated examples would give literary analysts the material they would need to specify its defining characteristics and give it a name. But, that hasn't happened. Instead, we have one poem that deploys a structure very well suited to its subject. The poem has form, but the form was not imposed by previous conventions. It has open form.{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}

===Imagery and symbolism===
Most poetry can be read on several levels. The surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases (notably, the works of [[William McGonagall]]) there is little beyond the immediate. [[Allegory]], [[connotation]] and [[metaphor]] are some of the subtler ways in which a poet communicates with the reader.

Before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance, however, the reader should establish the theme of the poem. What is the 'story' that is being told? Not the literal story but the heart of the poem. For example: "Another" tells of a buried child; "The Destruction of Sennacherib" tells of the annihilation of an Assyrian army by divine intervention; "The Silken Tent" compares a woman to a tent. Part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem (who is speaking), and the rest of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s [[Just So Stories|"six honest serving men"]]: the events in the poem; when these occur; where is the 'speaker' and where do the events occur; why does the speaker speak? [[William Harmon]]{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} has suggested that starting an analysis with: "This poem dramatizes the conflict between ..." is a key technique.&lt;!---Verdun---&gt;

[[George Herbert]] in his poem ''Jordan (I)''&lt;ref&gt;Herbert pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; asks if poetry must be about the imaginary. The poem opens:

:Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair
:Become a verse?  Is there in truth no beautie?
:Is all good structure in a winding stair?
:May no lines passe, except they do their dutie
:Not to a true, but painted chair?

He was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for [[pastoral]] poetry above all other forms (as becomes apparent in subsequent verses). Curiously, this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject. False hair and a painted chair are decorations of the mundane. The winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning. Herbert is criticising the overuse of allegory, symbolism or elaborate language.

For most poets—even the plain-speaking Herbert—metaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly. Some metaphors become so widely used that they are widely recognised symbols and these can be identified by using a specialist dictionary.

Allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work. It was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century English but a more recent example is [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]]' ''The Masque of the Manuscript'', in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Ingraham&lt;/ref&gt; Allegories are usually readily apparent because of the heavy use of metaphor within them.

The symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor. Often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations. For example, the word "sheen" in ''The Destruction of Sennacherib'' has stronger connotations of polishing, of human industry, than does the similar "shine". The Assyrians did not simply choose shiny metal; they worked to make it so. The word hints at a military machine.

Other [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] that may be used to increase the level of allusion include [[irony]], [[litotes]], [[simile]], and [[metonymy]] (particularly [[synecdoche]]).

===Meter and rhythm===
English language poetic meter depends on [[lexical stress|stress]], rather than the number of [[syllable]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  It thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages, such as [[French language|French]], where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount. This often makes [[scansion]] (the analysis of metrical patterns) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to students of the craft.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--Which, French, or English practice?--&gt;

In the final analysis, the terms of scansion are blunt instruments, clumsy ways of describing the infinitely nuanced rhythms of language. Nonetheless, they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems (especially those employing closed form).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The terms fall into two groups: the names of the different feet, and the names of the varying line lengths.

The most common feet in poetry written in English are the [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] (weak STRONG), the [[anapest]] (weak weak STRONG), the [[trochee]] (STRONG weak), and the [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] (STRONG weak weak). The iamb and anapest are known as ''rising meters'' (they move "up" from weak to strong syllables); the trochee and dactyl are ''falling meters'' (they move "down" from strong to weak). Less common, but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line, are the [[monosyllabic foot]] (weak) and the [[spondee]] (STRONG STRONG).

The terms for line length follow a regular pattern: a Greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root "meter" (for "measure"): [[monometer]], [[dimeter]], [[trimeter]], [[tetrameter]], [[pentameter]], [[hexameter]], [[heptameter]], and [[octameter]] (lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare).

Another useful term is [[caesura]], for a natural pause within a line.

Meter and line length are not formulas for successful lines of poetry. They are rough forms of notation for the many satisfying and variable rhythms of language. Slavish adherence to meter produces [[doggerel]]. Skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length, and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect, as [[Robert Browning]] does in the first line of "My Last Duchess":

:That's my last Duchess painted on the wall.

The opening spondees, which throw the iambic line out of pattern, gives the Duke's words a certain virulent energy: he's spitting the words out.

[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme, with his theory and practice of [[sprung rhythm]], an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind's expectation of a regular meter.

===Sound, tone, diction, and connotation===
Analyzing diction and connotation—the meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry—is a good place to start for any poem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The use of specific words in the poem serve to create a [[Tone (literary)|tone]]—an attitude taken towards the subject. For example, consider the words "slither" and "sneak." When used in a poem, the words conjure up images of a snake. The sibilant ''s'' sound reinforces the image. The connotations of the words suggest something surreptitious and undercover. From the tone, one can infer that the author is suspicious or fearful of the subject.

A detached tone, or an opposite tone than the reader would expect, are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response. In the opening lines of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", [[T. S. Eliot]] quickly sets a certain tone, and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone:

:Let us go then, you and I,
:When the evening is spread out against the sky
:Like a patient etherized upon a table

===Visual and concrete poetry===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Poets such as [[E. E. Cummings]]&lt;!--using the man's own choice of format for his name--&gt; experiment with punctuation and the words' layout on a page. In doing so, they venture into a realm of poetry that really cannot be read aloud: it can only be experienced through the eye.

:l(a

:le
:af
:fa

:ll

:s)
:one
:l

:iness

Cummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements. To analyze the poem, the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units: a brief, evocative image—"a leaf falls"—appearing, like an unbidden thought, in the middle of a word, "loneliness". A single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness, but in order to fully experience the poem, the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which Cummings arranged them: a vertical line (like a leaf falling to the ground), followed by a horizontal series of letters (like a leaf laying flat on the ground). The vertical line is dominated by the word "one" (an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness) and by the letter "l" (which, on the page, looks like the numeral 1... it looks like "one").

Numerous other poets, including [[George Herbert]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[William Blake]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], and [[John Hollander]] have used the layout of words, letters, and images on the page to create effect in their poems. An analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind.

===Schools of poetry===

{{main|List of poetry groups and movements}}

There are many different 'schools' of poetry: oral, classical, romantic, modernist, etc. and they each vary in their use of the elements described above.

Schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them (such as [[Imagism]]), or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet (for example [[Movement (literature)|The Movement]]). To be a 'school' a group of poets must share a common style or a common ethos. A commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school; for example, [[Edward Lear]], [[George du Maurier]] and [[Ogden Nash]] do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Schools of criticism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself, with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as [[Plato]]. At various times and places, groups of like-minded readers and scholars have developed, shared, and promoted specific approaches to poetry analysis.

'''[[New criticism|The New Criticism]]''' dominated [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]] [[literary criticism]] from the 1920s to the early 1960s. The New Critical approach insists on the value of [[close reading]] and rejects extra-textual sources. The New Critics also rejected the idea that the work of a critic or analyst is to determine an author's intended meaning (a view formalized by [[W.K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] as the [[intentional fallacy]]). The New Critics prized [[ambiguity]], and tended to favor works that lend themselves to multiple interpretations.

'''[[Reader Response]]''' developed in Germany and the United States as a reaction to New Criticism. It emphasises the reader's role in the development of meaning.

'''[[Reception aesthetics]]''' is a development of Reader Response that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response.

===Reading poetry aloud===
All poetry was originally oral, it was sung or chanted; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances, but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, John ''Rymes Reason - A Gude to English Verse'', Yale University Press,  New Haven 1981 {{ISBN|978-0-300-04307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poems may be read silently to oneself, or may be read aloud solo or to other people.  Although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles, few people find it surprising in the case of poetry.

In fact, many poems reveal themselves fully only when they are read aloud. The characteristics of such poems include (but are not limited to) a strong narrative, regular poetic meter, simple content and simple form.  At the same time, many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by T. S. Eliot's "Journey of the Magi", for example. Poems that read aloud well include:

*"The Frog", by [[Jean Dao]]
*"One Art", by [[Elizabeth Bishop]]
*"[[The Tyger]]", by [[William Blake]]
*"Meeting at Night", by [[Robert Browning]]
*"[[She Walks in Beauty]]", by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]
*"The Song of the Western Men", by [[Robert Stephen Hawker]]
*"November in England", by [[Thomas Hood]]
*"Dream Variations", by [[Langston Hughes]]
*"[[The Ingoldsby Legends|The Jackdaw of Rheims]]", by [[Thomas Ingoldsby]]
*"To put one brick upon another", by [[Philip Larkin]]
*"Paul Revere's Ride", by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]
*"Adventures of Isabel", by [[Ogden Nash]]
*"Nothing but Death", by [[Pablo Neruda]] translated by [[Robert Bly]]
*"A Small Elegy", by [[Jirí Orten]] translated by [[Lynn Coffin]]
*"[[Ozymandias]]", by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
*"[[The Cat in the Hat]]", by [[Dr. Seuss]]
*"Sea Surface Full of Clouds", by [[Wallace Stevens]]
*"Silver", by [[Walter de la Mare]]
*"How to Tell a Story", by [[Robert Penn Warren]]
*"On Westminster Bridge", by [[William Wordsworth]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">'''Prophetic dance''' is a [[ritual dance]] in which the purpose is to obtain a communication from or to [[God]] (gods)  [[spirit]]s in order to receive a favorable response (rain and good harvests, for example). Is also present in modern [[Christian culture]], in which the term is fixed.

==Christian faith==

"Prophetic Dance" and or movements in the church can be classified in two distinct forms.
The first type most commonly used in conjunction with pageantry, presentation and performance primarily. Flags, banners, and processionals which are just a few ways to be used to minister to God. This type of ministry can have profoundly prophetic overtones but is still geared primarily for the benefit of God.
The second avenue in which prophetic dance or movement can be used is whereby the vehicle/person being used becomes the minister to and for the benefit of the people. Believers feel that dancing or any movement inspired by God can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not meaning in dance vocabulary but relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver and set people free from all types of sickness and disease. The Prophetic arts is described as God using our gifts and talents to reveal His heart.

'''RMJM''' ('''R'''obert '''M'''atthew '''J'''ohnson '''M'''arshall) is one of the largest [[architecture]] &amp; [[design]] networks in the world. Services include [[architecture]], development management, [[engineering]], [[interior design]], [[landscape design]], lead consultancy, [[master planning]], [[product design]], specialist advisory services, [[urban design]]. The network caters to a wide range of clients in sectors including mixed-use, education, healthcare, energy, residential, government and hospitality.&lt;ref name="rmjmhistory%26services"&gt;[http://www.rmjm.com/ "RMJM History &amp; Services"], RMJM Architecture &amp; Masterplanning Ltd., ''RMJM Website'', 25 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1956 by architects [[Robert Matthew]] and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, RMJM’s first offices were based in [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]]. In its earlier years, RMJM designed in a functional, [[Modern architecture|modern]] style, with Matthew and Johnson-Marshall being strong proponents of this in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
RMJM was founded by Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and [[Robert Matthew]] in 1956. The partnership began following Robert Matthew’s decision to hire Johnson-Marshall to manage the new [[London]] office of his architecture practice, which had been set up to oversee the construction of [[New Zealand House]] in Haymarket Road, London, described as "London's most distinguished 1960s office block".&lt;ref name="Paul Stallan 2006"&gt;Paul Stallan; Lucy Andrew; Adrian Boot (2006) "RMJM: Inside Out, Outside In". Black Dog Publishing. {{ISBN|1904772595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the firm took Tom Spaven, Kenneth Graham, Vernon Lee, John Richards, Chris Carter, and Alan Whiteman into partnership. As a result, the practice changed its name to RMJM &amp; Partners.&lt;ref name="Scottish Architects"&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202068 "Scottish Architects"], Scottish Architects Website., ''Scottish Architects Website', 25 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The change in name also marked a shift towards larger international projects; by 1967 the practice employed 350 members of staff between the [[Edinburgh]] and [[London]] offices.&lt;ref&gt;RMJM (1996) "RMJM 40: The First Forty Years". RMJM Publishing. {{ISBN|0952973804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RMJM began to take on more projects as the need for public sector construction grew,&lt;ref name="Scottish Architects"/&gt; expanding to include a Glasgow studio before extending its reach beyond the British borders.
In the late 1960s, the firm began working on projects in the United States. Further projects in the Middle East and Central Asia saw RMJM establish several more international studios in the following decades.

Over the next 20 years, RMJM continued to expand and the firms [[Modern architecture|modernist]], functional style became a trademark. As RMJM moved further into the [[emerging markets]] of the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa, it began to establish more offices within the respective countries. In 2016, RMJM announced the creation of two "PRO" studios with the capacity to provide sector-specific services, known as RMJM Sport and RMJM Healthcare. Today, RMJM has studios in 25 countries.&lt;ref name="rmjmhistory%26services"/&gt;

==RMJM Initiatives==

RMJM has been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at addressing issues within architecture. These include the [[Architecture for Everyone]] scheme, which aimed to provide opportunities to ethnic minorities looking to establish a career in architecture. The scheme was initiated in partnership with the [[Stephen Lawrence]] Trust, named after the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, who intended to study architecture at university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewire.com/news/40264/stephen-lawrence-centre-and-rmjm-architects-tackle-ethnic-divide-in#.Vfv2-MBViko/ "Sourcewire", News Distribution, September, 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Other initiatives with the Architecture for Everyone enterprise include a £1m investment to encourage young graffiti artists to pursue a career in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdonline.co.uk/rmjm-puts-up-%C2%A31m-to-make-architects-of-graffiti-artists/3118384.article "BDOnline", Building Design, September, 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

A '''record chart''', also called a '''music chart''', is a ranking of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]] according to certain criteria during a given period of time. Many different criteria are used in different charts, including [[record sales]], the amount of radio [[airplay]], and since the popularity of the Internet for music, the number of [[music download|downloads]] and the amount of [[streaming media|streaming]] activity.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location (although download charts are not easily pinned down in this way). The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

==Chart hit==
A ''chart hit'' is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. ''Chart-topper'' and related terms (like ''number one'', ''No. 1 hit'', ''top of the charts'', ''chart hit'', and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from "buzz charts" (based on opinions of various experts and [[:wiktionary:tastemaker|tastemaker]]s), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a ''chart-topper'' may be anything from an "insiders' pick" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.

Record chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to [[music recording sales certification]] methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period of time; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.

According to [[Joel Whitburn]], the American trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on August 4, 1958.  This was the first chart in the US to "fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles."&lt;ref name=whitburn&gt;{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|edition= 1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 0-89820-155-1|page=xi-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1958 until 1991, ''Billboard'' compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets.  Before 1958, several charts were published, including "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys" (later revived under the name [[Hot 100 Airplay]]), and "Most Played in Juke Boxes", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported.  On November 30, 1991, ''Billboard'' introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, "by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan."&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt;  Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a [[single (record)|single]].&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt; The Hot 100 continues to be published.

==Other terminology==
There are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.

A ''new entry'' is a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real ''new entry'' is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a "[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbling under]]" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.

A ''re-entry'' is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's "Thriller 25"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a "new" entry.

A ''climber'' is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term ''highest climber'' is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term "faller" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.

The ''top 10'', ''top 20'' and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the [[Official Charts Company]] produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.

A ''[[one-hit wonder]]'' is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term ''true one-hit wonder'' was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">[[Image:Tournai Kathedrale7.JPG|thumb|left|The Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius, 1247, in the [[Cathedral of Tournai]]]]
The great [[Gilding|gilt]]-copper and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] '''Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius''' in the [[cathedral of Tournai]] ([[Belgium]]), one of the masterpieces of [[Gothic art|Gothic metalwork]],&lt;ref&gt;"Doubtless the most sumptuous of all midthirteenth&lt;!--midthirteenth in original--&gt; century reliquaries now remaining to us" was the opinion of Marvin Chauncey Ross ("The Reliquary of Saint Amandus", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''18'''.2 [June 1936: 187&amp;ndash;197] p. 187).&lt;/ref&gt; was commissioned by Bishop Walter de Marvis of [[Tournai]], and completed in 1247,&lt;ref&gt;Otto von Falke and H. Frauberger, ''Die Deutsche Schmeltzarbeiten des Mittlealters'', (Frankfort) 1904:105, gives the date of completion.&lt;/ref&gt; on the occasion of the [[Translation (relics)|retranslation of relics]] of Saint [[Eleutherius of Tournai]], traditionally the [[bishop of Tournai|city's first bishop]]. The shrine takes the architectural form of a ''[[Chasse (casket)|chasse]]'' or gabled [[casket]]; its more distant prototype is the gabled [[sarcophagus]] that was an established [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] convention in Northern Europe, "a form which was quite fitting," Marvin Ross observed in discussing the similarly shaped gilt-copper and enamel reliquary of [[Saint Amand]] in the [[Walters Museum]] "since these châsses were in a sense also tombs".&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1936:187.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the prototypical tombs, a [[Arcade (architecture)|blind arcade]] runs along the base, forming [[niche (architecture)|niches]] with the protective seated figures of [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s and [[Prophet]]s. In its gable end St Eleutherius appears, holding his [[crozier]] in one hand and in the other a model of the cathedral with its five spires.&lt;ref&gt;The reliquary shrine was fully described and discussed by J. Warichez, ''La cathédrale de Tournai et son chapître'' (Wettern) 1934, vol. I illus. pls. XVIII and XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shrine was made in Tournai or its immediate vicinity, once part of a prolific production that is now all but lost; it has been attributed&lt;ref&gt;By Max Creutz, in P. Clemen, ed. ''Belgischer Kunstdenkmäler'' (Munich) 1923:147.&lt;/ref&gt; to the workshop that was founded by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], the leading goldsmith of [[Mosan art]], who completed the reliquary of Our Lady&lt;ref&gt;Also preserved at the cathedral of Tournai.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1205. It is conserved in the Treasury of the [[cathedral of Tournai]], housed in the former [[chapter house|chapterhouse]].

Two years following the completion of this reliquary, a separate one was made for the head of Saint Eleutherius, now lost with its contents.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1936:192.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Souls Grown Deep Foundation''' is a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting, preserving, and promoting the work of leading contemporary African American artists from the Southeastern United States. Its mission is to include their contributions in the canon of American art history through acquisitions from its collection by major museums, as well as through exhibitions, programs, and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/foundation|title=About Souls Grown Deep Foundation {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation derives its name from a 1921 poem by [[Langston Hughes]] (1902-67) titled "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," the last line of which is "My soul has grown deep like the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/negro-speaks-rivers|title=The Negro Speaks of Rivers|last=aapone|date=2003-04-10|website=The Negro Speaks of Rivers|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is led by [[Maxwell L. Anderson]], who serves as its President, and a member of its Board of Trustees. Anderson was previously director of the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/people|title=People {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The Souls Grown Deep Foundation Collection contains over 1,100 works by more than 160 artists, two-thirds of whom are women. Ranging from large-scale assemblages to works on paper, the Foundation is particularly strong in works dating from the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the end of the twentieth century. The roots of these works can be traced to slave cemeteries and secluded woods. Following the Civil War, when the southern agrarian economy collapsed and rural African American sharecroppers and tenant farmers were forced to migrate for survival to major population centers—particularly in and around Birmingham, Alabama, where iron and steel production created jobs—a new and more public language of quilts, funerary, and yard arts arose. Beyond painting, sculpture, assemblage, drawing, and textile-making, this tradition also included music, dance, oral literature, informal theater, culinary arts, and more. Much like jazz musicians, the artists of this tradition reflect the rich, symbolic world of the black rural South through highly charged works that address a wide range of revelatory social and political subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/foundation|title=About Souls Grown Deep Foundation {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Souls Grown Deep Foundation was founded in 2010, but traces its roots to the mid-1980s, when [[William Arnett|William S. Arnett]], an art historian and collector, began to collect the artworks of largely undiscovered African American artists across nine southeastern states. Developed outside of the structure of schools, galleries, and museums, these rich yet largely unknown African American visual art traditions present a distinct post–Civil Rights phenomenon that offers powerful insight and fresh perspectives into the most compelling political and social issues of our time. The majority of the works and ephemeral documents held by the Foundation were compiled by Arnett and his sons over three decades, with the goal of creating a collection that could serve as a record and legacy of this culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/177156/from-the-deep-south-an-overlooked-chapter-in-art-history/|title=From the Deep South, an Overlooked Chapter in Art History|date=2015-01-24|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1990s Arnett’s efforts culminated in an ambitious survey exhibition of this tradition titled ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/souls-grown-deep-african-american-vernacular-art-south Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South]'', presented in conjunction with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and in partnership with the City of Atlanta and the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] of Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/arts/at-the-atlanta-games-culture-will-be-a-serious-competitor.html|title=At the Atlanta Games, Culture Will Be a Serious Competitor|last=Applebome|first=Peter|date=1995-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent two-volume publication ''Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South'', remains the most in-depth examination of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Souls-Grown-Deep-Vol-Vernacular/dp/0965376605/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467216226&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=souls%20grown%20deep|title=Souls Grown Deep, Vol. 1: African American Vernacular Art of the South: The Tree Gave the Dove a Leaf|date=September 2000|publisher=Tinwood Books|isbn=9780965376600|editor-last=Arnett|editor-first=Paul|location=Atlanta, Ga.: Tinwood Books|language=English|editor-last2=Arnett|editor-first2=William S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several exhibitions in recent years have drawn works primarily from the collection today in the care of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, including ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/quilts-gees-bend The Quilts of Gee’s Bend]'', organized by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 2002, which traveled to the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Chrysler Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[High Museum of Art]], and four other museums;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/29/arts/art-review-jazzy-geometry-cool-quilters.html|title=ART REVIEW; Jazzy Geometry, Cool Quilters|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|date=2002-11-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/thornton-dial-21st-century Thornton Dial in the 21st Century]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/thornton-dial-21st-century|title=Thornton Dial in the 21st Century {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/hard-truths-art-thornton-dial Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial]'', organized by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in 2011, which traveled to the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]], the [[Mint Museum]], and the [[High Museum of Art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.high.org/exhibition/hard-truths-the-art-of-thornton-dial/|title=Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial|work=High Museum of Art|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[https://www.high.org/exhibition/fever-within/ Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett]'', organized by the [[Ackland Art Museum]] in 2016, which traveled to the [[American Folk Art Museum]] and the [[High Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.high.org/exhibition/fever-within/|title=Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett|work=High Museum of Art|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of collection ==
In 2014 the Souls Grown Deep Foundation began a multi-year program to transfer the majority of works in its care to the permanent collections of leading American and international art museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/news/souls-grown-deep-foundation-begins-series-giftspurchases-major-national-museums|title=Souls Grown Deep Foundation Begins Series of Gifts/Purchases by Major National Museums {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this program has led to the acquisition of over 200 works by 75 artists from the Foundation’s collection by museums including [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2014/souls-grown-deep|title=Souls Grown Deep Foundation Donates 57 Works to Metropolitan Museum of Art {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deyoung.famsf.org/press-room/fine-arts-museums-san-francisco-make-historic-acquisition-62-works-african-american-art|title=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco Make Historic Acquisition of 62 Works of African American Art from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation|date=2017-02-02|work=de Young|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/design/high-museum-thornton-dial.html|title=High Museum Acquires 54 African-American Artworks|last=Chow|first=Andrew R.|date=2017-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/06/new-orleans-museum-of-art-acquires-10-works-from-souls-grown-deep-foundation/|title=New Orleans Museum of Art Acquires 10 Works from Souls Grown Deep Foundation|last=Twersky|first=Carolyn|date=2017-07-06|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ackland Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uncnews.unc.edu/2017/09/14/acklandsouls/|title=Ackland Art Museum acquires 12 artworks from Souls Grown Deep Foundation - UNC News|date=2017-09-14|work=UNC News|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple major exhibitions and publications including [https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/revelations-art-african-american-south "Revelations: Art from the African American South"] at the [[De Young (museum)|de Young Museum]] in San Francisco.

'''''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria''''' by [[John Ruskin]] was originally written in 1841 for the twelve-year-old [[Effie Gray|Effie (Euphemia) Gray]], whom Ruskin later married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/ruskinchrn.html Cf. 1841 on this timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in book form in 1851, and became an early [[Victorian era|Victorian]] classic which sold out three editions. In the "Advertisement to the First Edition", which prefaces it, it is called a [[fairy tale]], one, it might be added, that illustrates the triumph of love, kindness, and goodness over evil; however, it could also be characterised as a [[fable]], a fabricated [[origin myth]] and a [[parable]]. It was illustrated with 22 illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]] (1824–83).&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Sesame and Lilies'', ''The Two Paths,'' ''The King of the Golden River'', Everyman's Library, (New York: Dutton, 1907), 243&lt;/ref&gt; It was then illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]] in 1932.

== Plot summary ==
The richness of the Treasure Valley, high in the mountains of Stiria or [[Styria]], southeastern [[Austria]], is lost through the evil of the owners, the two elder, "Black Brothers", Hans and Schwartz, who in their foolishness mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, who in turn floods their valley, washing away their "liquid assets", and turning their valley into a dead valley of red sand.

This personified wind has the power to keep things this way through his influence with other winds that had caused the valley's unique fertility. Forced into a trade other than farming Hans and Schwartz become goldsmiths. They cruelly melt their younger brother Gluck's prize heirloom, a golden mug, which consists of the head of a golden bearded man. This action releases the King of the Golden River for Gluck to pour out of the crucible as a finely dressed little golden dwarf. The Golden River is one of the high mountain cataracts, that surround the Treasure Valley. Gluck fancies that it would be good if that high majestic river would actually be what it appears in the setting sun, a river of gold. The dwarfish king disagrees with Gluck, but offers a proposition: if someone were to climb up to the source of the river and throw into it at least three drops of "[[holy water]]", it would become for that person only a river of gold. That person must do it on his first and only attempt or be overwhelmed by the river to become a black stone.
{{Wikisource|The King of the Golden River|''The King of the Golden River''}}
Hans and Schwartz desire to take the challenge, duel each other with the result that Schwartz is thrown into jail for disturbing the peace. Hans, who had the good sense to hide from the constable, steals holy water from the church and climbs up the mountains to the Golden River. He has a hard time of it on a glacier and gets away without his provisions and only his flask of holy water. Overcome with thirst Hans is forced to drink from this flask, knowing that only three drops are all that's needed. Along the path, Hans comes across three prostrate individuals dying of thirst, a puppy, a fair child, and an old man. Hans satisfies his own thirst while denying the three needy individuals.

The "demeanor" of the surroundings of his journey turns bleak and inauspicious, climaxing in Hans being transformed into a black stone once he has hurled the holy water flask into the Golden River. Gluck secures the release of his brother Schwartz, who, buying his holy water from a "bad priest", eventually fares likewise, spurning in his turn the fair child, the old man, and his brother Hans lying prostrate in his path. The Golden River then acquires another black stone around which to rush and wail.

Gluck takes a turn at climbing the mountain. He encounters first an old man walking down the mountain trail who begs water from the flask. Gluck allows him to drink, leaving only a third of the holy water. He then encounters a fair child, lying by the road, whom he allows to drink all but a few drops. Following these unselfish acts, Gluck's path is made bright and pleasant making him feel better than he had in his whole life—no doubt, due to his kindness. He then comes across the prostrate puppy, whom he gives the final drops of the holy water. The puppy turns into the King of the Golden River, who tells Gluck the reason for the deadly fate of his two brothers: the water they had thrown into the river was made unholy by their denying it to those dying of thirst on the way. Thereupon, he shakes three drops of dew from a lily into Gluck's flask to throw into the river and then vanishes by evaporation. Gluck throws the dew drops into the Golden River, and it forms a whirlpool where it goes underground and then emerges in the Treasure Valley. The Treasure Valley becomes lush and fertile once again. Gluck the new owner is a wealthy man, who never turns away the needy from his door. Ever afterward, though, the people show and tell travellers the tale of the two black stones in the Golden River, known as The Black Brothers.

==Characters==
* '''Schwartz''' – (his name means "black" in German),&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria'', [[Katharine Lee Bates]], ed., (Chicago: Rand, McNally &amp; Co., 1903), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the two "Black Brothers". He and his brother Hans are described as very ugly men with overhanging eybrows and small, "dull" eyes, which they kept half closed.
* '''Hans''' – (his name is the common "John" in German), the other of the two "Black Brothers". Both are cruel to both animals and people, and they enjoy nothing better than drinking out their last penny at the neighbouring alehouse.
* '''Gluck''' – (should be Glück; his name means "luck" or "happiness" in German; the name is a wish of "good luck": "G' Luck!"),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem''.&lt;/ref&gt; the twelve-year-old kid brother of the "Black Brothers". In striking contrast to his elder brothers, he is blond-haired and blue-eyed and kindly disposed to all living things.
* '''Southwest Wind, Esquire''' – a personified wind, who visits the three brothers in the Treasure Valley. He stands about four feet, six inches, has a brass coloured nose and red cheeks that look like he had been blowing a refractory fire for 48 hours, silky eyelashes, and a moustache that curls twice around on each side of his face. He wears a conical hat that is almost as tall as he is, and a cloak that stretches about four times his height when blown by the wind.After his ill treatment by Hans &amp; Schwartz, he—and the other winds—avoid Treasure Valley and cause it to become barren.
* '''The King of the Golden River''' – a golden dwarf entrapped by "a stronger king" as a golden heirloom mug in Gluck's possession, freed through the melting of the mug, king of the river that cascades from the cataracts surrounding the Treasure Valley.

== Structure and forces ==
This [[fairy tale]] also has the character of an [[origin myth|aetiological myth]]—a story devised to explain why things are as they are in the world. It is structured like an epic saga with each of the chapters closing on one solitary curiosity: Chapter One, the card identifying Southwest Wind, Esquire; Chapter Two, the mug becoming a released King of the Golden River; Chapter Three, Hans becoming a black stone; Chapter Four, Schwartz becoming a companion black stone; and Chapter Five, the black stones being known as the "Black Brothers".

[[Image:KGR Black Brothers.jpg|left|250px|thumb|''The Black Brothers'']]

Another view is that of Oliver Lodge, editor, of the Everyman's Library edition of the work:&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Sesame and Lilies'', ''The Two Paths,'' ''The King of the Golden River'', Everyman's Library, (New York: Dutton, 1907), X.&lt;/ref&gt; "The parable is in two halves, a sort of [[Paradise Lost]] and a [[Paradise Regained]]—lost by selfishness, regained by love."&lt;ref name="Ibidem"&gt;''Ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the force that makes and unmakes things. The Treasure Valley never fails to have the proper watering to be perpetually lush. It is then destroyed by the water of a torrential flood. It is restored through the water of the Golden River becoming for the kindhearted Gluck a river of gold. Water's power appears in the treacherous glacier, which frightens those who traverse it with its sounds of rushing water and cracking ice. Water as "holy water" causes the miraculous transformation of the Golden River into a "river of gold" at the behest of the king. The King of the Golden River himself disappeared through the process of evaporation, a "water" phenomenon.

In this fairy tale the environment responds positively or negatively to human good or evil. There is the interplay of personified forces of nature like winds and rivers.

Lodge also enlightens us as to the lesson learned by the Black Brothers becoming goldsmiths and Gluck's wish that the Golden River become a literal river of gold: "And the restoration of wealth to Treasure Valley, by restoring the fertility of its soil instead of by metalliferous undertakings, is entirely in harmony with the author's consistent teaching that all true material increase must come from the soil".&lt;ref name="Ibidem"/&gt; Note that the King of the Golden River was imprisoned through "metalliferous undertakings".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', X-XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
As stated above, this story could also be classed as a fable by which John Ruskin can impart to his readers that love, kindness, and philanthropy could transform the world as it did the Treasure Valley. No doubt, he speaks through the King of the Golden River when he tells Gluck: "the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy, though it had been defiled with corpses".&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria'', Katharine Lee Bates, ed., (Chicago: Rand, McNally &amp; Co., 1903), 57, lines 1075–1080.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag''''' is an art [[art installation|installation]] by John Sims. The controversial installation consists of a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] hanging from a noose at a 13-foot gallows. ''The Proper way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was first shown in Schmucker Gallery at [[Gettysburg College]] in 2004 as a part of Sims' ''Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress''. ''Recoloration Proclamation'' targets specific traditional symbols of southern heritage, which are inextricably linked to slavery and racism in America. Included in the exhibition are recolored Confederate flags, a Confederate flag hanging from the gallows, a contemporary rewrite of the [[Gettysburg Address]], contemporary recordings of the song "[[Dixie]]", and a documentary film. A notable piece featured in the exhibition ''Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress'' is ''ReVote,'' an installation featuring three voting booths used in Florida's disputed 2000 presidential election with re-colored Confederate flags hanging above, including black, red, and green for the [[Pan-African Flag]] of the African Liberation Movement. Pink and lavender Confederate flags with feathers and sequins were also created for the exhibition signifying "drag flags". John Sims received national media attention for his [[lynching]] of the Confederate flag.

A related exhibition, [[Dread Scott]]'s interactive installation ''What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' was first shown at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1989. Scott's piece became the center of national controversy over its use of the American flag. Dread Scott's piece begins with a photomontage of American flags draped over coffins as well as South Korean citizens burning American flags while protesting American foreign policy. The question, "What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. flag?" is written across the images. The photomontage hangs above a table where exhibit visitors are invited to write their answers to Scott's question in a blank book. A three by five foot American flag is placed on the ground in front of the table, and if visitors want to write in the book, they must first step on the flag. ''What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' joined Sims' ''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' in Sarasota, Fl at the Crossley Gallery in 2006.

==Evolution of exhibitions==
[[Image:John Sims Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Puzzle globe logo|Schmucker Gallery, Gettysburg]]
'''Schmucker Gallery''' Gettysburg, PA '''2004''' :The lynching exhibit was initially set to be installed outdoors in front of Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College, and would have remained open to the public for three weeks. [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association (GBPA), and other members of the community objected strongly to the exhibition. Detractors interpreted the exhibit as anti-southern heritage. Sims wrote about his motivation, "...Our sense of history is segregated, our social identity is fractured and our vocabularies for discussing race, symbols and respect are bare." Ultimately, Gettysburg College administration changed the location and duration of the exhibit. ''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was installed inside of Schmucker Gallery. John Sims boycotted the exhibition.

'''Georgia State University''' Atlanta, GA '''2005''' :
''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was shown in a group show, ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship''. The group exhibition examines the role of artistic controversy in shaping a free society. Through two exhibitions, presentations of spoken word and performance artists, artists' talks, panel discussions, a film screening and a series of legal seminars, this project reflects an environment that nurtures contentious art. Artists included in the exhibition are [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Critical Art Ensemble]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Benita Carr]], Alex Donis, [[Karen Finley]], [[Eric Fischl]], Tom Forsythe, John Jota Leaños, Gayla Lemke, Alma Lopez, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], Carolee Scheemann, Dread Scott, [[Andres Serrano]], Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, David Avalos, John Sims, John Anthony Trobaugh, [[Pat Ward Williams]], Nancy Worthington, Marilyn Zimmerman, and The File.

'''Brogan Museum''' Tallahassee, FL '''2007''' :
Sims' exhibition remained on display despite protests from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who called it once again an affront to Southern heritage. The Mary Brogan Museum of Art and Science said it stands by Sims' work, which was part of a larger exhibit, ''AfroProvocations''.

'''Kennedy Museum of Art''', Ohio University, Athens OH '''2017'''
On October 26, 2017 in front of the E.W. Scripps Amphitheater at Ohio University, Sims's concept came was fully realized. "Confederate Flag: A Public Hanging" took place as originally conceived: with community participation, music, speeches and readings. The flag was ritually hung from a 13-foot gallows in a symbolic act of judgment against the history of white supremacy. Following this performance event, the flag was carried to the Kennedy Museum of Art and installed in the exhibition "Expression and Repression: Contemporary Art Censorship in America" as "The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag." The exhibition also featured Kara Walker, Sue Coe and David Wojnarowicz, and was on view through December 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garnett|first1=Joy|title=John Sims: "Confederate Flag: A Public Hanging" at Ohio University and the Kennedy Museum of Art|url=http://ncac.org/blog/john-sims-confederate-flag-a-public-hanging-at-the-kennedy-museum-of-art|website=NCAC.org|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Fontane''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtʰeːodoɐ̯ fɔnˈtaːnə|lang}}; 30 December 1819 – 20 September 1898) was a [[Germany|German]] [[novelist]] and [[poet]], regarded by many as the most important 19th-century [[German-language]] [[Literary realism|realist]] writer. His well-known novel ''[[Effi Briest]]'' is still widely read in English-speaking countries.

==Youth==
Fontane was born in [[Neuruppin]], a town 30 miles northwest of Berlin, into a [[Huguenot]] family. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an [[apothecary]], his father's profession. He became an apothecary himself, and in 1839, at the age of 20, wrote his first work (''Heinrichs IV. erste Liebe'', now lost). His further education was in [[Leipzig]], where he came into contact with the progressives of the [[Vormärz]].

Fontane's first published work, the novella ''Geschwisterliebe'' (Sibling Love), appeared in the ''Berlin Figaro'' in December 1839. His biographer [[Gordon A. Craig]] observes that this gave few indications of his promise as a gifted writer: "Although the theme of [[incest]], which was to occupy Fontane on later occasions, is touched upon here, the mawkishness of the tale... is equalled by the lameness of its plot and the inertness of the style in which it is told, and [the characters] Clärchen and her brother are both so colorless that no one could have guessed that their creator had a future as a writer."&lt;ref&gt;''Theodor Fontane: Literature and History in the Bismarck Reich'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), {{page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontane's first job as apothecary was in [[Dresden]], after which he returned to his father's shop in the provincial town of [[Letschin]] in the [[Oderbruch]] region. Fleeing its provincial atmosphere, Fontane published articles in the Leipzig newspaper ''[[Die Eisenbahn]]'' and translated [[Shakespeare]]. In 1843, he joined a literary club in Berlin called [[Tunnel über der Spree]] (Tunnel over the River [[Spree]]) where he came into contact with many of the most renowned German writers, including [[Theodor Storm]], [[Joseph von Eichendorff]] and [[Gottfried Keller]].

==Newspaper writer and critic==
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]] in Berlin, Germany – built in 2006 to commemorate [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention, c. 1445, of movable printing type.]]
In 1844 Fontane enlisted in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army and set out on the first of numerous journeys to England, which fostered his interest in [[Old English poetry|Old English ballads]], a form he began to imitate. He became engaged to his future wife, Emilie Rouanet-Kummer, whom he had met when still at school.

He briefly participated in the revolutionary events of [[revolution of 1848|1848]]. In 1849 he quit his job as an apothecary and became a full-time journalist and writer. In order to support his family, he took a job as a writer for the Prussian [[intelligence agency]] ''Zentralstelle für Presseangelegenheiten'', which was intended to influence the press towards the German nationalist cause. There he specialized in British affairs, and the agency made him for several years its correspondent in [[London]], where he was later joined by his wife and two sons. While still in London, he quit his government job, and on his return to Berlin became editor of the conservative paper ''[[Neue Preussische Zeitung]]''. As a man of [[liberalism|liberal]] sympathies, Fontane ruefully wrote to a friend about his job with the ''Zeitung'': "I sold myself to the reaction for thirty pieces of silver a month...These days one cannot survive as an honest man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Gordon Alexander |title=Theodor Fontane: Literature and History in the Bismarck Reich |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London==
Fontane's books about Britain include ''Ein Sommer in London'' (A Summer in London, 1854), ''Aus England, Studien und Briefe'' (From England: Studies and Letters, 1860) and ''Jenseit des Tweed, Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland'' (Beside the Tweed, Pictures and Letters from Scotland, 1860). The success of the historical novels of [[Walter Scott]] had helped to make British themes much in vogue on the Continent. Fontane's ''Gedichte'' (Poems, 1851) and ballads ''Männer und Helden'' (Men and Heroes, 1860) tell of Britain's former glories.
[[File:Fontane1860.jpg|thumb|right|Fontane, ca. 1860]]
Back in Germany, Fontane became particularly interested in his home province, the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|March of Brandenburg]]. He enjoyed rambling through its rural landscapes and small towns and delighted in the growth of its capital city, Berlin. His fascination with the countryside surrounding Berlin may be seen in his picturesque ''[[Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg]]'' (Walks through the Province of Brandenburg, 1862–82, 5 vols.), in which he transposed his former fascination with British historical matters to his native soil.

==Wars of German Unification==
In 1870, he quit his job at the ''Kreuzzeitung'' and became [[Theatre|drama critic]] for the liberal ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', a position he held until retirement. He had already written about [[Second war of Schleswig|Prussia's war against Denmark]] in ''Der schleswig-holsteinische Krieg im Jahre 1864'' (1866) and the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in ''Der deutsche Krieg von 1866'' (1869). He went to the front to observe the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, and after being taken prisoner at [[Vaucouleurs]], remained in French captivity for three months. He set down his experiences in ''Kriegsgefangen Erlebtes 1870'' (Experiences as a Prisoner of War, 1871) and published his observations on the campaign in ''Der Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870–71'' (The War against France, 1870–71, published 1874–76). In his observations, he vociferously critiqued Prussian militarism: "The mere glorification of the military, without moral content and elevated aim, is nauseating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Gordon A. |title=Theodor Fontane: Literature and History in the Bismarck Reich |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
At the age of 57 Fontane finally set to work in the genre for which he is remembered: the novel. A fine [[historical novel|historical romance]], ''Vor dem Sturm'' (''Before the Storm'', 1878) was followed by a series of novels of modern life, notably ''L'Adultera'' (''Woman Taken in Adultery'', 1882), which was considered so risqué that it took Fontane two years to find it a publisher.

[[File:Fontanegrab.JPG|thumb|250px|Graves of Theodor and Emilie Fontane in the Französische Friedhof, Liesenstraße, Berlin.]]
In his novels ''Irrungen, Wirrungen'' (''Trials and Tribulations'', 1888), ''[[Frau Jenny Treibel]]'' (1892) and ''[[Effi Briest]]'' (1894–95), he found his own tone, yielding insights into the lives of the [[nobility]] and of the common man. His achievement there was later described as poetic realism. In ''[[Der Stechlin]]'' (written 1895–97), his last completed novel, Fontane adapted the realistic methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to the conditions of Prussian life.

==Death==
Fontane died on September 20, 1898, in Berlin. As a member of the French Protestant Church of Berlin, he was buried in the congregation's cemetery on the Liesenstraße. His wife, Emilie, was buried beside him four years later. Their graves were damaged in World War II but later restored.

{{nihongo|'''''Yōga'''''|洋画||literally "Western-style painting"}} is a style of [[painting]]s by Japanese artists, made in accordance with Western (European) traditional conventions, techniques and materials. The term was coined in the [[Meiji period]], to distinguish such works from indigenous traditional [[Japanese painting]]s, or {{nihongo|''[[Nihonga]]''|日本画}}.

== History ==
European painting was introduced to Japan during the late [[Muromachi period]] along with [[Christian missionaries]]. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of ''Yōga''. However, the [[sakoku|policy of national seclusion]] introduced by the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] in the [[Edo period]] effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] via [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

In 1855, the Tokugawa ''bakufu'' established the ''[[Bansho Shirabesho]],'' a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by [[Kawakami Togai]], whose assistant [[Takahashi Yuichi]] was a student of English artist [[Charles Wirgman]]. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Yōga painter.

In 1876, the ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' ([[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Technical Art School]]) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated ''Yōga'' art school. [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|Foreign advisors]], such as the Italian artist [[Antonio Fontanesi]], were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as [[Asai Chu]] in the latest western techniques.

In the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the ''[[Nihonga]]'' movement caused the temporary decline of ''Yōga''. The ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' was forced to close in 1883, and when the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'' (the forerunner of the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]) was established in 1887, only ''Nihonga'' subjects were taught.

However, in 1889, the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by ''Yōga'' artists, and in 1893, the return of [[Kuroda Seiki]] from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the ''Yōga'' genre. From 1896, a Yōga department was added to the curriculum of the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'', and from that point onwards, ''Yōga'' has been an accepted component of Japanese painting.

Since that time, ''Yōga'' and ''Nihonga'' have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual ''[[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]]'' exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

== Materials ==
''Yōga'' in its broadest sense encompasses [[oil painting]], [[watercolor]]s, [[pastels]], [[pen-and-ink drawing|ink sketches]], [[lithography]], [[etching]] and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, ''Yōga'' is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.
