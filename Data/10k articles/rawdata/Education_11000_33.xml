==Plot==
In the fictional town of Santa Mira, California, a man witnesses student Stacey Lockwood ([[Tori Spelling]]) (whom he drove home after she went to his house to telephone her parents) being stabbed by an unseen 'friend', who followed them to her house. When her family arrives home, they find paramedics and police gathered outside, as Stacey is rushed to the hospital, where she dies.

In a flashback to ten months earlier, Angela Delvecchio ([[Kellie Martin]]) is a shy high school [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]] who aspires to be popular, beautiful and perfect in everything. She performs well academically in school, attends [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] regularly, and sets high goals for herself. She idolizes Stacey, who is the most popular girl at school, as well as a cheerleader. One of the reasons why Angela admires Stacey is because one of Angela's goals is to become a cheerleader. When Angela is accepted into the Larks, the school's popular [[clique]], she tries to forge a friendship with the rich, snobbish and self-centered Stacey, who rejects her. She then further suffers being rejected for a coveted position as one of the [[yearbook]] staff and in an audition for the cheerleading squad, leaving her humiliated and feeling like a failure.

The events of the night of Stacey's stabbing are shown from Angela's perspective. Still determined to be friends with Stacey, Angela calls Stacey's mother and anonymously invites her to a party under the guise of there being a special dinner for the Larks. Once Stacey gets in the car with Angela, she reveals that the "dinner" story was a lie she told Stacey's mother so she would be allowed to meet Angela. Infuriated, Stacey demands to be taken home. Angela tries to explain how much she admires Stacey and wants to be like her, but Stacey is less than sympathetic. Unmoved, she calls Angela "pathetic" and exits the car, stating that everyone in school will now laugh at Angela. Stacey then runs to a nearby house, where she asks to use the telephone, explaining that the 'friend' she was with had 'gotten a little weird', and manages to get a ride home. Angela follows the car back to Stacey's home, and out of fear that Stacey will spread rumors about her, Angela stabs Stacey multiple times and leaves her for dead.

Angela avoids capture in the weeks following the incident. Although Angela is interviewed by the police, she is not named as a suspect. Angela, along with all of the Larks, attends Stacey's [[Requiem Mass|Funeral Mass]]. Most of the students blame one of their classmates, Monica Whitley ([[Kathryn Morris]]), for Stacey's murder. At first, no one suspects Angela because she is seemingly too nice to commit the crime. Furthermore, Jamie Hall ([[Marley Shelton]]), Angela's former best friend and one of Stacey's friends, tells Angela that she never really liked Stacey, and was only afraid of her.

As her junior year begins, Angela becomes more involved with the community, taking up such activities as peer counseling and candy striping. Overwhelmed by Stacey's murder, one of the Larks brings up the idea of disbanding. Determined not to let this happen, Angela argues that they should remain active, noting that the group was not only important to Stacey, but also to the various community activities in which they take part. This idea not only saves the Larks but also wins Angela the position of secretary/treasurer.

In the meantime, a harassment campaign is waged against Monica until she finally leaves the school. At this point, authorities resume their investigation and begin re-interviewing possible suspects, including Angela. With the authorities slowly closing in on her, she becomes more and more consumed by her guilt, until she finally confesses to her priest and then to her parents in a letter.

Devastated by the arrest, Jamie, who had gone to St. Joseph's Catholic School with Angela prior to high school, confesses to their priest to having left her in a ski lodge alone during a ski trip the year before, all because she did not have the courage to stand up to Stacey. The high school's principal, Ed Saxe, declared Angela a 'sick kid' and that there is no problem with materialism. As the trial begins, the Prosecutor argues that Angela should be charged with first-degree murder as there was evidence of premeditation. Angela's lawyer claims it was second-degree murder.

The judge agrees with the defense, after listening to Angela's taped confession. Stating that, other than the tape, the rest of the evidence was just circumstantial and that the prosecution failed to prove the crime to be premeditated. Angela is then sentenced to [[Imprisonment|confinement]] until the age of 25. Back at the church, the priest gives a homily on the community's responsibility for the death of Stacey, stating that the unrealistic high expectations and pressures to be "perfect" contributed to Angela's actions. As the movie ends, Jamie writes a letter to Angela that she quit the Larks (having left when she realized how mean they were to Angela) and that she plans to leave Santa Mira High School and go back to her former school, St. Joseph's.

==DVD==
On March 25, 2002, the film was released on Region 2 [[DVD]] as ''Death of a Cheerleader''.

==Murder of Kirsten Costas==
{{main article|Murder of Kirsten Costas}}
The film was based on the murder of Kirsten Costas. On June 23, 1984, in [[Orinda, California]], Costas was murdered by her classmate, Bernadette Protti. Protti had been jealous of Costas, who was the daughter of affluent parents and very popular at [[Miramonte High School]]. Kirsten had been a member of the yearbook committee and a cheerleader. However, Bernadette was not accepted by the yearbook committee and tried out for cheerleading, but was not picked. Kirsten, who was chosen to be a cheerleader, saw Bernadette as a [[Poseur|wannabe]] and didn't take her seriously.

On June 23, 1984, Costas was lured with a phony invitation to a dinner for the Bob-o-Links, a sorority-like group at school. According to Protti's later testimony, she had planned to take Costas to the party to befriend her, but Costas got angry when she was told that there was no dinner for the new "Bobbies". The girls quarreled, and Costas fled to the home of Alex and Mary Jane Arnold, living nearby, telling them that her friend had gone "weird". When Costas could not reach her parents by telephone, Alex Arnold drove her home, noticing that a Pinto–the Protti's family car–was following them. At the Costas home, Arnold, sitting in his car, saw Protti attack Costas. He thought that he was seeing a fist-fight but, in fact, Protti stabbed Costas five times with a kitchen knife and fled. The Costas' neighbors called an ambulance, but Kirsten was mortally wounded and died at a nearby hospital.

It took the police almost six months to find Costas' killer. After Protti passed a [[lie detector]] test, her alibi went unverified. After attempting to confirm Protti's alibi and rereading her lie detector test, the police knew that the girl had lied. After speaking with an FBI agent, Protti wrote her mother a letter in which she made a full confession.
Protti claimed to have found the kitchen knife by chance, and her older sister, Gina, testified in court that she used to have that knife in her car to cut vegetables. The Costas did not believe this story – they claimed that nobody would use an 18-inch-long (460&amp;nbsp;mm) knife to slice tomatoes and that Protti, casually dressed on that evening, never intended to take Kirsten to a party, but had planned to murder her. Protti was sentenced to a maximum of nine years but was released seven years later on parole.

The Costas family left Orinda and moved to Hawaii. Protti was released from prison in 1992 at the age of 23. Costas' parents vehemently opposed Protti's release.

==In popular culture==
* The band [[Marcy Playground]] has a song called "Death of a Cheerleader", which is based on the  Bernadette Protti and Kirsten Costas murder case, as well as being influenced by the film.
* ''[[Deadly Women]]'' is a series that airs on the [[Investigation Discovery]] channel. The "Deadly Delinquents" episode featured the Bernadette Protti and Kirsten Costas murder case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28952">'''Academic journal publishing reform''' is the advocacy for changes in the way [[academic journals]] are created and distributed in the age of the [[Internet]] and the advent of [[electronic publishing]]. Since the rise of the Internet, people have organized campaigns to change the relationships among and between academic authors, their traditional distributors and their readership. Most of the discussion has centered on taking advantage of benefits offered by the Internet's capacity for widespread distribution of reading material.

==History==
Before the advent of the Internet it was difficult for scholars to distribute articles giving their research results.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Mike|title=It’s Not Academic: How Publishers Are Squelching Science Communication|journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|date=21 February 2012|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/02/21/its-not-academic-how-publishers-are-squelching-science-communication/|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically publishers performed services including [[proofreading]], [[typesetting]], [[copy editing]], [[printing]], and worldwide distribution.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; In modern times all researchers became expected to give the publishers digital copies of their work which needed no further processing.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; For digital distribution printing was unnecessary, copying was free, and worldwide distribution happens online instantly.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; In science journal publishing, Internet technology enabled the four major scientific publishers—[[Elsevier]], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]], and [[Informa]]—to cut their expenditures such that they could consistently generate profits which exceed a third of their revenue.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

The Internet made it easier for researchers to do work which had previously been done by publishers, and some people began to feel that they did not need to pay for the services of publishers. This perception was a problem for publishers, who stated that their services were still necessary at the rates they asked.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Critics began to describe publishers' practices with terms such as "corporate scam" and "[[Racket (crime)|racket]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist |title=Academic publishers make Murdoch look like a socialist |first=George |last=Monbiot |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 August 2012 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars sometimes obtain articles from fellow scholars through unofficial channels, such as posting requests on [[Twitter]] using the [[hashtag]] "[[ICanHazPDF|#icanhazpdf]]" (a play on the [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]] meme), to avoid paying publishers' access charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://labandfield.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/how-icanhazpdf-can-hurt-our-academic-libraries/|title=How #icanhazpdf can hurt our academic libraries|work=The Lab and Field}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altmetric.com/blog/interactions-the-numbers-behind-icanhazpdf/|title=Interactions: The Numbers Behind #ICanHazPDF - Altmetric.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for reform==
&lt;!-- This section and a section of the same name in "open access" share content and that section directs readers to this article. Match the content, if you like. --&gt;
Although it has some historical precedent, [[open access]] became desired in response to the advent of electronic publishing as part of a broader desire for academic journal publishing reform. Electronic publishing created new benefits as compared to paper publishing but beyond that, it contributed to causing problems in traditional publishing models.

The premises behind open access are that there are viable funding models to maintain traditional [[academic publishing]] standards of quality while also making the following changes to the field:
#Rather than making journals be available through a [[subscription business model]], all academic publications should be free to read and published with some other funding model. Publications should be gratis or "free to read".&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Rather than applying traditional notions of [[copyright]] to academic publications, readers should be free to build upon the research of others. Publications should be [[Gratis versus libre|libre]] or "free to build upon".&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Everyone should have greater awareness of the serious social problems caused by restricting access to academic research.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Everyone should recognize that there are serious economic challenges for the future of academic publishing. Even though open access models are problematic, traditional publishing models definitely are not sustainable and something radical needs to change immediately.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;

Open access also has ambitions beyond merely granting access to academic publications, as access to research is only a tool for helping people achieve other goals. Open access advances scholarly pursuits in the fields of [[open data]], [[open government]], [[open educational resources]], [[free and open-source software]], and [[open science]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems addressed by academic publishing reform===

The motivations for academic journal publishing reform include the ability of computers to store large amounts of information, the advantages of giving more researchers access to [[preprints]], and the potential for interactivity between researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odlyzko|first=Andrew M.|title=Tragic Loss or Good Riddance? The Impending Demise of Traditional Scholarly Journals|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|date=January 1995|pages=49–53|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199501/forum.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various studies showed that the demand for open access research was such that freely available articles consistently had [[impact factors]] which were higher than articles published under restricted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antelman|first=Kristin|title=Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact?|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|pages=372–382|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/372.short|accessdate=27 February 2012|doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Steve|title=Free online availability substantially increases a paper's impact|journal=Nature|date=31 May 2001|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/lawrence.html|accessdate=27 February 2012|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|bibcode=2001Natur.411..521L|volume=411|page=521|doi=10.1038/35079151|issue=6837|pmid=11385534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities reported that modern "package deal" subscriptions were too costly for them to maintain, and that they would prefer to subscribe to journals individually to save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mayor | first1 = S. | title = US universities review subscriptions to journal "package deals" as costs rise | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7431.68 | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7431 | pages = 68 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14715586| pmc = 1150298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems which led to discussion about academic publishing reform have been considered in the context of what provision of open access might provide. Here are some of the problems in academic publishing which open access advocates purport that open access would address:

&lt;!-- The Suber book cited contains additional citations backing these statements, and those should be added to each of these statements.--&gt;
#A pricing crisis called the [[serials crisis]] has been growing in the decades before open access and remains today. The academic publishing industry has increased prices of academic journals faster than inflation and beyond the library budgets.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#The pricing crisis does not only mean strain to budgets, but also that people actually are losing access to journals.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Not even the wealthiest libraries in the world are able to afford all the journals that their users are demanding, and less rich libraries are severely harmed by lack of access to journals.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Publishers are using "bundling" strategies to sell journals, and this marketing strategy is criticized by many libraries as forcing them to pay for unpopular journals which their users are not demanding.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Libraries are cutting their book budgets to pay for academic journals.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Libraries do not own electronic journals in permanent archival form as they do paper copies, so if they have to cancel a subscription then they lose all subscribed journals. This did not happen with paper journals, and yet costs historically have been higher for electronic versions.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Academic publishers get essential assets from their subscribers in a way that other publishers do not.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt; Authors donate the texts of academic journals to the publishers and grant rights to publish them, and editors and referees donate peer-review to validate the articles. The people writing the journals are questioning the increased pressure put upon them to pay higher prices for the journal produced by their community.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Conventional publishers are using a business model which requires access barriers and creates artificial scarcity.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt; All publishers need revenue, but open access promises models in which scarcity is fundamental to raising revenue.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Scholarly publishing depends heavily on government policy, public subsidies, [[gift economy]], and [[anti-competitive practices]], yet all of these things are in conflict with the conventional academic publishing model of restricting access to works.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Toll access journals compete more for authors to donate content to them than they compete for subscribers to pay for the work. This is because every scholarly journal has a natural [[monopoly]] over the information of its field. Because of this, the market for pricing journals does not have [[feedback]] because it is outside of traditional market forces, and the prices have no control to drive it to serve the needs of the market.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Besides the natural monopoly, there is supporting evidence that prices are artificially inflated to benefit publishers while harming the market. Evidence includes the trend of large publishers to have accelerating prices increases greater than small publishers, when in traditional markets high volume and high sales enables cost savings and lower prices.
#Conventional publishers fund "content protection" actions which restrict and police content sharing.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#For-profit publishers have economic incentives to decrease rates of rejected articles so that they publish more content to sell. No such market force exists if selling content for money is not a motivating factor.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Many researchers are unaware that it might be possible for them to have all the research articles they need, and just accept it as fate that they will always be without some of the articles they would like to read.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;
#Access to toll-access journals is not scaling with increases in research and publishing, and the academic publishers are under market forces to restrict increases in publishing and indirectly because of that they are restricting the growth of research.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"/&gt;

==Motivations against reform==
Publishers state that if profit was not a consideration in the pricing of journals then the cost of accessing those journals would not substantially change.&lt;ref name="publisherview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beschler|first=Edwin F.|title=Pricing of Scientific Publications: A Commercial Publisher's Point of View|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|date=November 1998|pages=1333–1343|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199810/beschler.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers also state that they add value to publications in many ways, and without academic publishing as an institution these services the readership would miss these services and fewer people would have access to articles.&lt;ref name="publisherview"/&gt;

Critics of open access have suggested that by itself, this is not a solution to scientific publishing’s most serious problem&amp;nbsp;– it simply changes the paths through which ever-increasing sums of money flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/08/07/yale-university-libraries-cancel-biomed-central-membership-in-the-face-of-spiraling-costs/|title=Yale University Libraries Cancel BioMed Central Membership in the Face of Spiraling Costs - Depth-First|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this does exist and for example, Yale University ended its financial support of BioMed Central’s Open Access Membership program effective July 27, 2007. In their announcement, they stated,

{{quote|text=The libraries’ BioMedCentral membership represented an opportunity to test the technical feasibility and the business model of this open access publisher. While the technology proved acceptable, the business model failed to provide a viable long-term revenue base built upon logical and scalable options. Instead, BioMedCentral has asked libraries for larger and larger contributions to subsidize their activities. Starting with 2005, BioMed Central article charges cost the libraries $4,658, comparable to single biomedicine journal subscription. The cost of article charges for 2006 then jumped to $31,625. The article charges have continued to soar in 2007 with the libraries charged $29,635 through June 2007, with $34,965 in potential additional article charges in submission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/science/news.html Science Libraries News | Yale University Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620032623/http://www.library.yale.edu/science/news.html |date=June 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar situation is reported from the University of Maryland, and Phil Davis commented that,

{{quote|text=The assumptions that open access publishing is both cheaper and more sustainable than the traditional subscription model are featured in many of these mandates. But they remain just that&amp;nbsp;— assumptions. In reality, the data from Cornell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/236|title=Calculating the Cost per Article in the Current Subscription Model|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; show just the opposite. Institutions like the University of Maryland would pay much more under an [[author-pays model]], as would most research-intensive universities, and the rise in [[author processing charges]] (APCs) rivals the inflation felt at any time under the subscription model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/04/28/umaryland-faculty-vote-no-oa/|title=Open Access Voted Down at Maryland|work=The Scholarly Kitchen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Opponents of the open access model see publishers as a part of the scholarly information chain and view a pay-for-access model as being necessary in ensuring that publishers are adequately compensated for their work. "In fact, most STM [Scientific, Technical and Medical] publishers are not profit-seeking corporations from outside the scholarly community, but rather learned societies and other non-profit entities, many of which rely on income from journal subscriptions to support their conferences, member services, and scholarly endeavors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Rick |title=Open access – clear benefits, hidden costs |url=http://www.alpsp.org/ngen_public/article.asp?aid=723 |publisher=The Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers |accessdate=16 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721002616/http://www.alpsp.org/ngen_public/article.asp?aid=723 |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly journal publishers that support pay-for-access claim that the "gatekeeper" role they play, maintaining a scholarly reputation, arranging for [[peer review]], and editing and indexing articles, require economic resources that are not supplied under an open access model. Conventional journal publishers may also lose customers to open access publishers who compete with them. The Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine (PRISM), a [[Political action committee|lobbying organization]] formed by the [[Association of American Publishers]] (AAP), is opposed to the open access movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/08/28/prism_open_access/index.html |title=Science publishers get even stupider |first=Andrew |last=Leonard |date=August 28, 2007 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205150952/http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/08/28/prism_open_access/index.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISM and AAP have lobbied against the increasing trend amongst funding organizations to require open publication, describing it as "government interference" and a threat to peer review.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Deahl [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518143330/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6471211.html AAP Tries to Keep Government Out of Science Publishing]. Publishers Weekly. 23 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

For researchers, publishing an article in a reputable scientific journal is perceived as being beneficial to one's reputation among scientific peers and in advancing one's academic career. There is a concern that the perception of open access journals do not have the same reputation, which will lead to less publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Ji-Hong|author2=Jian Qin|title=Exploring the Willingness of Scholars to Accept Open Access: A Grounded Theory Approach|journal=Journal of Scholarly Publishing|year=2007|volume=38|doi=10.1353/scp.2007.0009|series=2|page=30|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park and Qin discuss the perceptions that academics have with regard to open access journals. One concern that academics have "are growing concerns about how to promote [Open Access] publishing." Park and Qin also state, "The general perception is that [Open Access] journals are new, and therefore many uncertainties, such as quality and sustainability, exist."

Journal article authors are generally not directly financially compensated for their work beyond their institutional salaries and the indirect benefits that an enhanced reputation provides in terms of institutional funding, job offers, and peer collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholas | first1 = D. | last2 = Rowlands | first2 = I. | year = 2005 | title = Open Access publishing: The evidence from the authors | url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/open-access-publishing-the-evidence-from-the-authors/ | journal = The Journal of Academic Librarianship | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 179–181 | doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are those, for example PRISM, who think that open access is unnecessary or even harmful. David Goodman argued that there is no need for those outside major academic institutions to have access to primary publications, at least in some fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/105958 DLIST&amp;nbsp;– Goodman, David (2005) Open Access: What Comes Next]. Arizona.openrepository.com (2005-11-27). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that publicly funded research should be made openly available has been countered with the assertion that "taxes are generally not paid so that taxpayers can access research results, but rather so that society can benefit from the results of that research; in the form of new medical treatments, for example.  Publishers claim that 90% of potential readers can access 90% of all available content through national or research libraries, and while this may not be as easy as accessing an article online directly it is certainly possible."&lt;ref name="Worlock2004"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html |title=The Pros and Cons of Open Access |author=Worlock, Kate |work=Nature Focus |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |year=2004 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument for tax-payer funded research is only applicable in certain countries as well. For instance in Australia, 80% of research funding comes through taxes, whereas in Japan and Switzerland, only approximately 10% is from the public coffers.&lt;ref name="Worlock2004"/&gt;

For various reasons open access journals have been established by predatory publishers who seek to use the model to make money without regard to producing a quality journal. The causes of [[predatory open access publishing]] include the low barrier to creating the appearance of a legitimate digital journal and funding models which may include author publishing costs rather than subscription sales.
Research reviewer [[Jeffrey Beall]] publishes a "List of Predatory Publishers" and an accompanying methodology for identifying publishers who have editorial and financial practices which are contrary to the ideal of good research publishing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beall |first=Jeffrey |title=Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers (2nd edition) |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/11/30/criteria-for-determining-predatory-open-access-publishers-2nd-edition/ |work=Scholarly Open Access |accessdate=19 June 2013 |date=1 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603123106/http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/11/30/criteria-for-determining-predatory-open-access-publishers-2nd-edition/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = D. | title = Investigating journals: The dark side of publishing | doi = 10.1038/495433a | journal = Nature | volume = 495 | issue = 7442 | pages = 433–435 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23538810| pmc = |bibcode = 2013Natur.495..433B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform initiatives==

===Public Library of Science===
{{Main|Public Library of Science}}
The Public Library of Science is a nonprofit open-access scientific publishing project aimed at creating a library of [[open access journal]]s and other [[scientific literature]] under an [[open content]] license. The founding of the organization had its origins in a 2001 online petition calling for all scientists to pledge that from September 2001 they would discontinue submission of papers to journals which did not make the full-text of their papers available to all, free and unfettered, either immediately or after a delay of several months.&lt;ref name="Ploshistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/early-history/ |title=Early History of PLoS |first= |last= |work=plos.org |year=2012 |accessdate=26 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219081439/http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/early-history/ |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition collected 34,000 signatures but the publishers took no strong response to the demands. Shortly thereafter, the Public Library of Science was founded as an alternative to traditional publishing.&lt;ref name="Ploshistory"/&gt;

===HINARI===
{{Main|HINARI}}
HINARI is a 2002 project of the [[World Health Organization]] and major publishers to enable developing countries to access collections of biomedical and health literature online at reduced subscription costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Maurice|title=Bridging the knowledge gap The HINARI programme|journal=The Biochemist|date=December 2003| pages=27–29 |url=http://www.biochemist.org/bio/02506/0027/025060027.pdf |accessdate=27 February 2012 |publisher=[[Biochemical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Works Act===
{{Main|Research Works Act}}
The Research Works Act was a bill of the [[United States Congress]] which would have prohibited all laws which would require an [[open access mandate]] when US-government-funded researchers published their work. The proposers of the law stated that it would "ensure the continued publication and integrity of peer-reviewed research works by the private sector".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3699&amp;tab=committees|title=H.R. 3699

|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Research Works Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the law stated that it was the moment that "academic publishers gave up all pretence of being on the side of scientists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/16/academic-publishers-enemies-science |title=Academic publishers have become the enemies of science |first=Mike |last=Taylor |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 January 2012 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2012, Elsevier withdrew its support for the bill. Following this statement, the sponsors of the bill announced they will also withdraw their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislation to Bar Public-Access Requirement on Federal Research Is Dead|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|publisher=The Chronicle|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Legislation-to-Bar/130949/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cost of Knowledge===
{{Main|The Cost of Knowledge}}
The Cost of Knowledge is a campaign begun in 2012 specifically targeting the scientific publishing company Elsevier.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier |title=Scientists sign petition to boycott academic publisher Elsevier |first=Alison |last=Flood |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 February 2012 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65VHiGo2Z?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier |archivedate=16 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was begun by a group of prominent mathematicians who each made a commitment to not participate in publishing in Elsevier's journals.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

===Access2Research===
{{Main|Access2Research}}
Access2Research is a 2012 United States-based campaign in which open access advocates appealed to the [[United States government]] to require that taxpayer-funded research be made available to the public under open licensing.

===''PeerJ''===
{{Main|PeerJ}}
''PeerJ'' is an open-access journal launched in 2012 that charges publication fees per researcher, not per article, resulting in what has been called "a flat fee for 'all you can publish'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Van Noorden | first1 = R. | title = Journal offers flat fee for 'all you can publish' | doi = 10.1038/486166a | journal = Nature | volume = 486 | issue = 7402 | pages = 166 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22699586| pmc = |bibcode = 2012Natur.486..166V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Knowledge Project===
{{Main|Public Knowledge Project}}
Since 1998, PKP has been developing free open source software platforms for managing and publishing peer-reviewed open access journals and monographs, with [[Open Journal Systems]] used by more than 7,000 active journals in 2013.

===Schekman boycott===
2013 Nobel Prize winner [[Randy Schekman]] called for a boycott of traditional academic journals including ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'', and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name="9Dec2013Sample"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/09/nobel-winner-boycott-science-journals |title=Nobel winner declares boycott of top science journals |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=theguardian.com |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he promoted the open access journal ''[[eLife]]''.&lt;ref name="9Dec2013Sample"/&gt;

===Initiative for Open Citations===
[[Initiative for Open Citations]] is a [[CrossRef]] initiative for improved [[citation analysis]]. It was supported by majority of the publishers effective from April 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''Access to Knowledge''' ('''A2K''') movement is a loose collection of [[civil society]] groups, [[government]]s, and individuals converging on the idea that access to [[knowledge]] should be linked to fundamental principles of [[justice]], [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and [[economic development]].

==History ==

The [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] from 2003 is a major declaration reflecting the goals of the movement pertaining to academic publishing.

In October 2004, the [[Geneva declaration on the future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]] emerged from a call from [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] for a development agenda for the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and was supported by hundreds organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters included the [[Free Software Foundation]], with a statement ''Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation": Supporting the Geneva Declaration.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfe.org/activities/wipo/wiwo.en.html|title=FSFE - Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the proposals of the declaration was to a «call for a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology. The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/futureofwipodeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the [[mailing list]] of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly at https://web.archive.org/web/20090213032523/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/, now at http://lists.keionline.org/mailman/listinfo/a2k_lists.keionline.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
A draft "A2K treaty" was later produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/a2k_treaty_may9.pdf |title=Treaty on Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=19&amp;res=1280_ff&amp;print=0 |title=Experts Debate Access To Knowledge &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Watch |publisher=Ip-watch.org |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights debate===
Access to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 27
Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn= 1354788 |title=The Right to Science and Culture |first=Lea |last=Shaver|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1354788 |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |date=2010 |volume=1 |pages=121–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporters==

=== Knowledge Ecology International ===
[[CP Tech]] (now [[Knowledge Ecology International]]) say: "the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers International===
Many different groups refer to the A2K movement. [[Consumers International]] is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a2knetwork.org/ |title=A global advocacy network for consumers in the digital age |publisher=A2Knetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030152718/http://a2knetwork.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defines the movement as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;
These goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.

'''Adjunct professor''' ('''adjunct lecturer''' and '''adjunct instructor''', or '''adjunct faculty''' collectively) is a type of academic appointment in [[higher education]]. 

* In the [[Academic ranks in the United States|United States]], an adjunct is a non-[[Academic tenure|tenure-track]] faculty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/teaching-careers/adjunct-professor/|title=What is an Adjunct Professor? Job Description &amp; Salary|date=1 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/adjunct-professor-earn-less-than-pet-sitter|title=I am an adjunct professor who teaches five classes. I earn less than a pet-sitter - Lee Hall|first=Lee|last=Hall|date=22 June 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be a scholar or teacher whose primary employer is not the school or department with which they have adjunct status. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/handbook/appointments-and-promotions/classification-of-ranks-and-titles|title=Classification of Ranks and Titles »  Faculty Handbook  - Boston University|website=www.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Academic ranks in Australia|Australia]], the term ''adjunct'' is reserved for academics and researchers from outside the university who have a close association with the university, e.g. through supervision of PhD students, recognised by an honorary title reflective of their rank and standing (Adjunct Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Associate Professor or Professor). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hr.uwa.edu.au/policies/policies/titles/adjunct-and-clinical-titles|title=Adjunct and clinical titles|first=The University of Western|last=Australia,|website=www.hr.uwa.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/5.20.15-honorary-and-adjunct-title-holders|title=Policies and Procedures Library -  The University of Queensland, Australia|website=ppl.app.uq.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/hr-staff-development/adjunct-appointments|title=Adjunct Appointments|website=www.jcu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://policies.scu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00027|title=SCU Policy Library - Adjunct, Visiting and Conjoint Appointments Policy|first=(TWEEK!)|last=www.tweek.com.au|website=policies.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, adjunct professors are often nominated in recognition of active involvement with the appointing institution, while they are employed by government, industry, a profession or another institution &lt;ref&gt;https://www.unb.ca/gradstudies/_assets/pdfs/policyprocedure-adjunctprofessor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The position Course Lecturer, rather than adjunct, is used if the appointment is strictly to teach one or more courses, contrasting with US usage of the title for all instructors.
* In [[Portugal]] the designation ''Professor Adjunto'' imply a stable full-time employment in a Polytechnic University.
* In countries such as [[Academic ranks in Argentina|Argentina]] and [[Academic ranks in Brazil|Brazil]], a similar designation, ''Professor adjunto'', does imply stable full-time employment.
* In parts of [[Academic ranks in Spain|Spain]], ''Profesor Adjunto'' is a non-tenured position.
* In [[Academic ranks in Hungary|Hungary]], there exists a similar term ''Adjunktus'', as well as ''Adiunkt'' in [[List of academic ranks#Poland|Poland]].
* In [[Academic ranks in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], private universities follow the title Adjunct Professor/Adjunct Associate Professor to imply non-tenure faculty members.
* In [[Academic ranks in Thailand|Thailand]], Adjunct (Assistant/Associate) Professors are considered "non-regular officers".
* In [[List of academic ranks#Pakistan|Pakistan]], Adjunct (Assistant/Associate) Professors are also considered as non-regular faculty members and usually posts are given to Pakistani overseas scientists under Faculty Development Program.
* In [[Finland]], the Docents' Union of Finland and the Finnish Ministry of Education recommend the term Adjunct Professor in English as a translation of the title of [[Docent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/suomendosenttiliitto|title=Suomen Dosenttiliitto|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A docentship should be regarded as an educational title not connected with the employment pyramid as such, rather an assurance of the level of expertise, to enable the person to advance further in his/her academic career. The rank of a docent entitles scientists to be principal investigators, lead research groups and act as the supervisors of doctoral students.

'''Adolph Hallis''' (4 July 1896 – 1987) was a South African pianist, composer and teacher.

==Life==
Hallis was born in [[Port Elizabeth]] and travelled to England in his twenties, where he studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]; his teachers there included [[Tobias Matthay]] and Oscar Beringer. He made his debut at the [[Wigmore Hall]] in 1919, and after a wide-ranging European career settled back in South Africa in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Mears (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a teacher at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. He died in South Africa in 1987.

==Career==
During his career Hallis premiered numerous works, including [[piano concerto]]s by [[Alan Rawsthorne]] and [[Erik Chisholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Mears (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave the first British performance of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|First Piano Concerto]] in Birmingham in 1936. Although [[Arnold Cooke]]'s Piano Concerto (1939/'40) was written for Hallis, the outbreak of WWII prevented him giving its première, which was given instead by Louis Kentner with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Clarence Raybould in 1943 in a studio broadcast for the BBC's Third Programme. In 1938 he made, for [[Decca Records]], the first complete recording of the piano [[Préludes (Debussy)|Préludes]] of [[Claude Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siek (2011), 324–5.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Sophie Wyss]], [[Alan Rawsthorne]], [[Christian Darnton]] and [[Benjamin Britten]] he formed the Hallis Concert Society, which gave a number of innovative concerts in London in the period 1936–1939. These included British premieres of both contemporary and historical British and European music, including works of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[François Couperin]], [[Arnold Cooke]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Elisabeth Lutyens]] and [[Elizabeth Maconchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Plant (n.d.) Details of the programmes of these concerts are given at the [http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/4505 Concert Programmes: Darnton collection] site of the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (accessed 10 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst Hallis's compositions were [[film music]], (sometimes under the pseudonym of "Hal Dolphe"), including music for two films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''[[Rich and Strange]]'' (1931) and ''[[Number Seventeen]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;Sloan (1995), 104, 109; Anon, [http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Adolph_Hallis "Adolph Hallis"] in [http://the.hitchcock.zone/ The Hitchcock Zone] website, accessed 10 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His other works include a piano concerto and various piano pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Mears (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

His students included many South African keyboard players of the postwar generations, amongst them [[Michael Blake (composer)|Michael Blake]], [[Neville Dove]], [[Marian Friedman]], [[Paul Hepker]], [[Petronel Malan]], [[Anton Nel]], [[Elizabeth de la Porte]], [[Renee Reznek]], and [[Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amity Gaige''' (born 1972) is an American novelist, known for her books ''O My Darling'', ''The Folded World'' and ''Schroder''. In 2006 the [[National Book Foundation]] named her a 5 under 35 honoree.

==Early life==
Amity Gaige was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], United States, to an academic father and a psychologist mother.  The Gaige family moved several times before settling in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. She graduated from [[Brown University]], where she studied English and theater.  She later obtained an M.F.A. from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] (1999).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.yale.edu/people/full-part-time-lecturers-creative-writers/amity-gaige|title=Amity Gaige &amp;#124; English|last=|first=|date=|website=english.yale.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Her first novel, ''O My Darling'' (Other Press, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otherpress.com/books/book?ean=9781590511749 |title=O My Darling |publisher=Other Press |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923005111/http://www.otherpress.com/books/book?ean=9781590511749 |archivedate=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; won her a place in the inaugural year of the [[National Book Foundation]]’s 5 Under 35 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/5under35_2006.html |title=National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35 Fiction Selections for 2006 |publisher=Nationalbook.org |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second novel, ''The Folded World'', was published in 2007 (Other Press, Random House),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otherpress.com/books/book?ean=9781590512487 |title=The Folded World |publisher=Other Press |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923005126/http://www.otherpress.com/books/book?ean=9781590512487 |archivedate=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and garnered independent publishing awards that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://botya.forewordreviews.com/winners/2007/ |title=2007 Winners — Book of the Year Awards |publisher=Botya.forewordreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=512#m3368 |title=for Monday, September 10, 2007 |publisher=Shelf Awareness |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third novel, ''Schroder'' (Twelve Books, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/schroder-a-novel/oclc/785786661&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat book listing]&lt;/ref&gt; was a shortlist nominee for Britain's inaugural GB₤40,000 [[Folio Prize]] in 2014. The novel stirred controversy in its depiction of a reckless young father who flees with his six-year-old daughter on a road trip through [[New England]] after a custody battle. The author drew inspiration from  the real-life [[Christian Gerhartsreiter]] story,  though the book is not a novelization of that story. In style and form, ''Schroder'' drew comparison to works by [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/02/14/book-review-schroder-amity-gaige/PCF9efhpjvAi0DIVEx7rVI/story.html |title=Book review: "Schroder’’ by Amity Gaige - Books |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wernecke |first=Ellen |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/amity-gaige-schroder,95847/ |title=Amity Gaige: Schroder &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; Book Review |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote, “''Schroder’s'' closest literary relative is probably [[Lolita]] (minus the pedophilia),”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/21/entertainment/la-ca-jc-amity-gaige-20130224 |title=A real impostor's tale inspires fascinating fiction in 'Schroder' - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2013-02-21 |accessdate=2013-08-25 |first=Janelle |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kathryn Schulz]] suggested that Gaige intended ''Schroder'' as an homage and an “appropriation” of ''Lolita'' in New York Magazine, which published a scratched-out image of Nabokov’s cover art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulz |first=Kathryn |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/02/kathryn-schulz-on-schroder-by-amity-gaige.html |title=Kathryn Schulz on Amity Gaige’s Novel Schroder |publisher=Vulture |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaige also cited [[Pale Fire]] as an influence in an interview with [[The New York Times]]' John Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/desperate-dad-amity-gaige-talks-about-schroder/ | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Williams | title=Desperate Dad: Amity Gaige Talks About ‘Schroder' | date=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was sold pre-publication for translation into fifteen languages, and was endorsed on the Dutch television show [[De Wereld Draait Door]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deleesfabriek.nl/2013/03/schroder-amity-gaige/ |title=Schroder – Amity Gaige ‹ De Leesfabriek |publisher=Deleesfabriek.nl |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; sending the book into numerous reprintings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5652">'''Dr. Anita Marie Caspary''' (November 4, 1915, [[Herrick, South Dakota]] – October 5, 2011, [[Los Angeles, California]]) ''' '''was the only woman in American history to hold the positions of Mother General of an order of Catholic [[Religious Sisters|sisters]] and the first president of a Christian ecumenical community.  Under her leadership over 300 sisters relinquished their canonical status and religious vows and formed the new Immaculate Heart Community of California.  This was the largest exodus of Catholic sisters in U.S. history. Acknowledged as a transformative leader in the post Vatican II Catholic Church, she was featured on the cover of TIME Magazine February 23, 1970.

==Biography==
A "cradle Catholic" who took her vows in 1936 as Sister Humiliata in the [[Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], Caspary became increasingly at-odds with the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[James Cardinal McIntyre]] in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In December 1969, after a standoff, more than 300 sisters at an Immaculate Heart community meeting voted to become a non-canonical community, thereby freeing themselves of Cardinal McIntyre's jurisdiction. Around fifty of these continued to operate with diocesan recognition. {{Clarify|date=October 2011}} Approximately 250 sisters ceased teaching in the archdiocese's Catholic schools. Caspary recalled that establishing a voluntary lay community "relieved us from threats and difficulties with the church under which we lived at that time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Valerie|title=Anita Caspary dies at 95; 'rebel nun' founded Immaculate Heart Community|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/16/local/la-me-anita-caspary-20111016|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caspary was president of Immaculate Heart College, which was operated by her order, from 1958–63. (The school continued to operate after the schism in 1970, but closed in 1980.) After the break with the Church, she taught at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and served on the staff of the Peace and Justice Center of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox |first=Thomas |title=Anita Caspary, religious visionary, dies in Los Angeles |url=http://ncronline.org/news/women-religious/anita-caspary-religious-visionary-dies-los-angeles |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020150622/http://ncronline.org/news/women-religious/anita-caspary-religious-visionary-dies-los-angeles |archivedate=October 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir==
Caspary taught high school English while studying toward a master's degree at the [[University of Southern California]]. She received her Ph.D. in 1948 from [[Stanford University]]. She wrote a 2003 memoir, ''Witness to Integrity''. In 2012, a collection of her poems, ''FROM THE HEART: Poems by Anita M. Caspary, I.H.M.'', was published posthumously.

==Death==
Anita Caspary died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on October 5, 2011, aged 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=Anita Caspary, Nun Who Led Breakaway From Church, Dies at 95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/us/anita-caspary-95-nun-who-led-breakaway-from-church-dies.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009/2010 20.165 Norwegian students were studying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanekassen.no/Hovedmeny/Om_Lanekassen/Nyheter/Arkiv/Flere-tar-full-studiegrad-i-utlandet/|title=Flere tar full studiegrad i utlandet|publisher=Lånekassen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101118092148/http://lanekassen.no/Hovedmeny/Om_Lanekassen/Nyheter/Arkiv/Flere-tar-full-studiegrad-i-utlandet/| archivedate= 18 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 ANSA has over 10.000 members at over 1.200 educational institutions in more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.no/om-ansa/|title=Om ANSA|publisher=ANSA|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101119110003/http://ansa.no/Om_ANSA/| archivedate= 19 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
ANSA in particular works to influence rules and regulations governing student grants and loans, arguing that all students should have the right to study any subject in any country as they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.no/Spraksider/ANSA_in_English/ |title=ANSA in English |publisher=ANSA |accessdate=20 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119104830/http://ansa.no/Spraksider/ANSA_in_English/ |archivedate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian government has been funding higher education for Norwegian students abroad for more than 60 years, with the [[Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund]] (''Lånekassen'') providing students with loans and grants. ANSA was founded by Norwegian students in 1956 to address difficulties students encountered in dealing with Lånekassen. 

The organisation targets services at students prior to, during, and after studies abroad. A range of membership benefits are central in attracting students as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.no/For_studiene/Bli_ANSAmedlem/|title=Info om medlemskap|publisher=ANSA|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101119103842/http://ansa.no/For_studiene/Bli_ANSAmedlem/| archivedate= 19 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANSA's Information Centre for higher education abroad is funded by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] to provide unbiased advice on higher education abroad. The Membership Department deals with enquiries from potential and current members, while ANSA's Student Adviser provides advice to students encountering problems during their studies abroad, such as with regards to their university, their insurance, or Lånekassen.

==Headquarters and Governance Structures==
ANSA is manned by 12 full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.no/Spraksider/ANSA_in_English/ |title=ANSA in English |publisher=ANSA |accessdate=20 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119104830/http://ansa.no/Spraksider/ANSA_in_English/ |archivedate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary-General heads the office in [[Oslo]].

The President of ANSA is elected at the annual general assembly. The President's main responsibility is lobbying for ANSA’s political priorities towards the Norwegian authorities. The President is also chair of ANSA’s Board and main spokesperson of ANSA.

The board of ANSA consists of six students abroad, two students who previously have studied abroad, ANSA’s president and a representative for the employees at ANSA. The Board is responsible for ANSA’s political priorities and the main goals of the organisation.

Among ANSA's members are over 500 volunteers who organise various social and cultural events and represent ANSA at their places of study.

'''Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick''' is assistant professor of [[political sociology]] at the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies at the [[University of San Diego]]. He was previously assistant professor of political sociology at the [[School of Public Policy at Central European University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spp.ceu.hu/people/austin-choi-fitzpatrick |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104133936/http://spp.ceu.hu/people/austin-choi-fitzpatrick |archivedate=2015-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He specializes in the interplay between culture and politics in times of social change. He is also core faculty at the [[Center for Media, Data and Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmds.ceu.hu/faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

His current project, funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], explores the impact social movements have on human rights violators in rural [[India]]. Early work along these lines can be found in a volume co-edited with [[Alison Brysk]]: ''From Human Trafficking to Human Rights: Reframing Contemporary Slavery'' (University of Pennsylvania Press Series on Human Rights).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14907.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In his most recent book, ''What Slaveholders Think: How Contemporary Perpetrators Rationalize What They Do'',&lt;ref&gt;2017, [https://cup.columbia.edu/book/what-slaveholders-think/9780231181822 Columbia University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Choi-Fitzpatrick argues that slaveholders have been overlooked by the contemporary [[abolitionist]] movement. Taking them seriously, he suggests, advances scholarship on social movements, human rights, and anti-trafficking. Policy implications include the possibility that international development efforts recognize that some of their beneficiaries are also rights violators.&lt;ref&gt;Shorter articles along these lines can be found in [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-chose-to-research-what-slaveholders-think_us_58bef21be4b05386ddc0ca64 ''Huffington Post''], [https://aeon.co/essays/this-is-what-slavery-looks-like-today-in-the-eyes-of-slavers ''Aeon''], and ''[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/28/what-i-learned-from-india-slaveowners-austin-choi-fitzpatrick The Guardian]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Choi-Fitzpatrick is currently working on a new book that explores the ways social movements use new technologies. In particular he focuses on the ways [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs, or "drones") are used by civil society actors as they work to hold both businesses and governments accountable. Early efforts to sketch an overview of public usage of the technology and to advance an ethical framework for its use can be found in an the ''[[Journal of International Affairs]]''. He is working on an innovative method for estimating the size of protest events and other mass gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTH5zDJdSuk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sppdronelab.com&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from this project have been presented at Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, and Central European University. Shorter essays on the topic can be found at [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/authors.austin_choifitzpatrick.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al Jazeera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aljazeera.com/profile/austin-choi-fitzpatrick.html|title=Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick|website=aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With students at the Kroc School he has authored a report on non-violent drone use from 2009-2015.

Choi-Fitzpatrick holds a PhD in sociology from the [[University of Notre Dame]], where he was Assistant Director at the Center for the Study of Social Movements and Social Change.&lt;ref&gt;http://cssm.nd.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to academia he worked as a [[human rights]] advocate. From 2003 through 2009 he was on staff at [[Free the Slaves]], the sister organization of [[Anti-Slavery International]], itself the world's first and longest-running human rights NGO. He studied human rights and international security at the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]] at the University of Denver.

'''BabyFirst''' is a TV channel that produces and distributes content for babies through television, the internet, and mobile applications. The channel is owned by First Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BABYFIRST Now on Verizon Fios |url=https://www.multichannel.com/pr-feed/babyfirst-now-verizon-fios-412437 |accessdate=September 15, 2018 |work=Multichannel |agency=Media Financial Management Association |date=April 25, 2017 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content is intended to develop an infant's skills, such as color recognition, counting and vocabulary. There are about 90 BabyFirst TV shows and 41 apps for mobile devices. As of 2014, the network is distributed to 81 million homes, and is based in [[Los Angeles, California]].

BabyFirst was founded in 2003 by Guy Oranim and Sharon Rechter. Its first broadcast was through [[DirecTV]] in 2006. It was founded by [[Regency Enterprises]], Kardan, and Bellco Capital. Distribution expanded through agreements with the Echostar [[Dish Network]], [[Comcast]], [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] and others. It also developed a premium BabyFirst YouTube channel, and mobile apps. One app developed with AT&amp;T U-verse allows babies to interact with the television programming by drawing on a mobile device.

==History==

===Origins===
BabyFirst was founded in 2004&lt;ref name="canal"/&gt; by Guy Oranim and Sharon Rechter.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; The network was launched on May 11, 2006 on DirecTV and was later made available through EchoStar's Dish Network that June.&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Post|date=May 12, 2006 |title='Screen Test' Toddler - Kid &amp; Folks Rate Baby TV |pp=8 |last=Robinson |url=https://nypost.com/2006/05/12/screen-test-toddler-kid-folks-rate-baby-tv/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BabyFirst network is based in [[Los Angeles]] and was initially funded by Regency Enterprises (a Hollywood movie studio), Kardan (a holding company) and Bellco Capital (a private fund).&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|title=EchoStar to offer BabyFirst channel|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=June 14, 2006|first=Joyzelle|last=Davis|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146996029.html|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BabyFirst was controversial when it was introduced, because it was the first 24-hour channel for children six months to three years in age.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=TV Moves A Step Closer To the Womb|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=May 21, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/arts/21itzk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the channel was popular among parents&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite news|title=Diaper Demographic; TV, Video Programming for the Under-2 Market Grows Despite Lack of Clear Educational Benefit|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 24, 2007|first=Annys|last=Shin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen B.

===Distribution expansion===
In 2011, BabyFirst obtained agreements to distribute the channel in the [[United Kingdom]] through the BSkyB satellite network as well as in Mexico through Sky Mexico and Cablevision.&lt;ref name="odlo"&gt;{{cite news|title=BabyFirstTV crawls its way to U.S.|date=March 2006, 2011|first=Steve|last=Brennan|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=May 23, 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/babyfirsttv-crawls-way-us-132343}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French version was introduced with CanalSat in 2011.&lt;ref name="canal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox, CanalSat members of a baby boom |date=December 21, 2011 |first1=Elizabeth |last=Guid |first2=Rebecca |last2=Leffler|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-canalsat-members-a-baby-152187|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2011, it had arranged broadcasting agreements throughout [[Europe]],&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite news|title=24-hour TV for kids under 3 is on the air|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=July 27, 2012|first=Shannon|last=Proudfoot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Middle East]]&lt;ref name="odlo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"/&gt; and [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BabyFirst crawling onto Canadian TV|date=July 26, 2012|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

BabyFirst also started broadcasting in ten territories in the Asia Pacific, such as China and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Television Asia|title=Crossing the channels: despite the economic crisis, this year has seen a slew of new channels roll out in the region, with some still set to launch|date=November 1, 2008 | last=Wong|first=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, SingTel started distributing the channel to the Singapore audience.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Television Asia|title=BabyFirstTV on SingTel's mio TV|date=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also being broadcast in Africa and Latin America.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;{{cite news|title=What can TV do for your baby? 2 channels specialized in child fare are thriving, but critics cite risks of too much viewing|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=May 19, 2008 | first=Doreen|last=Carvaja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, it signed a distribution agreement with [[Time Warner Cable]].&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Warner to carry BabyFirst|first=Michael|last=Schneider|url=https://variety.com/2008/more/news/time-warner-to-carry-babyfirst-1117985425/|date=May 9, 2008|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, HBO Asia became the exclusive distributor for the channel in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HBO Asia strikes agreement to represent BabyFirst, WarnerTV across Asia|publisher=Television Asia|date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bilingual Latin/English channel, BabyFirst Americas, was launched with [[Comcast]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comcast to start new minority-owned cable channels|publisher=Associated Press|date=February 21, 2012 |first=Frazier|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Comcast Outlines Plan to Carry 4 Minority-Owned Channels|work=The New York Times|page=2|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A premium BabyFirst [[YouTube]] channel was introduced in June 2013.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|date=June 6, 2013|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/06/business/la-fi-ct-babyfirst-youtube-channel-new-investor-20130606|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|first=DiAngelea |last=Miller |title=BabyFirst, with premium YouTube channel and new investor, expands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] responded to a complaint by the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood alleging that BabyFirst's advertising that it helped babies develop skills was misleading. The FTC did not impose any sanctions.&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lafayette|first=Hayes|title=McPherson Seeks More Carriage for Kid-TV Net|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, it has 81 million viewers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KneeBouncers Joins BabyFirst to Develop Interactive TV Series|first=Cherese |last=Jackson|date=February 22, 2014|url=http://guardianlv.com/2014/02/kneebouncers-joins-with-babyfirst-to-develop-interactive-tv-series/#zhFveRZ1PCYc57YY.99|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadcast in over 100 territories, in thirteen languages.&lt;ref name="baby" /&gt;

==Programming==

The format of the network limits each of the network's presentations to three to five minutes of length that are either live-action or animated.&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baby"/&gt;

''The New York Times'' described the content as "decidedly unhurried" and said it makes extensive use of bright colors and upbeat music.&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"/&gt; Programming development is guided by child psychology experts and is designed to encourage a child's skills development, such as counting, vocabulary and color recognition.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Phoenix |date=July 27, 2007 |title=New network for the newly born; Commercial-free, 24-hour station for babies to launch in Canada |first=Shannon |last=Proudfoot |pp=B8 |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=da6d6cd3-43a5-4da1-8a9f-7b97ae147f73 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809190507/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=da6d6cd3-43a5-4da1-8a9f-7b97ae147f73 |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BabyFirst logo in the corner changes colors to indicate the skills a segment is intended to develop. Late-night programming is intended to lull viewers to sleep.&lt;ref name="Itzkoff" /&gt;

There are also 41 BabyFirst apps for mobile devices.&lt;ref name="baby"&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby Boom: Profile: BabyFirst|date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An app available to AT&amp;T U-verse viewers allows children to draw on a mobile device and have the drawing appear on the television screen.&lt;ref name="olop" /&gt;

Some experts argue that exposing children to television at such an early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch with the realities of raising a child.&lt;ref name="Brooks2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Brooks|title=Consuming Innocence: Popular Culture and Our Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mmFBXf-m7YC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2008|publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press|isbn=978-0-7022-3645-7|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite news|title=BabyFirst develops baby's first apps|first=Nicole|last=Villalpando|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/lifestyles/parenting/babyfirst-develops-babys-first-apps-1/nRNjW/|date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2014|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends against exposing children under the age of two to television, while a 2003 study by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; According to ''The Washington Post'', very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

'''''Blocksworld''''' is a physics-based 3D [[Sandbox game|sandbox]] [[video game]] developed by [[Linden Lab]] for the [[iPad]], the [[iPhone]] in July 26, 2013, and released later on [[Steam (software) | Steam]] in September 25, 2017.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Blocksworld tutorial.png|thumb|In-game Blocksworld tutorial]]
In ''Blocksworld'', players can create their own games and experiences from 3D building blocks that can be combined to construct simple or complex creations in unique 3D environments. Players can also use “action blocks” and a drag-and-drop visual programming tool to add interactivity and gaming to their creations. Examples include drivable cars, flyable jets, and playable games with win/lose conditions, health systems, and other attributes. Due to the creative and building aspects of Blocksworld, some game critics have compared the game to ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Roblox]]'', [[Lego]], and [[Animal Jam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Apps for Kids 41: Blocksworld|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/08/16/apps-for-kids-41-blocksworld.html|publisher=boingboing.net|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this free-to-download app, players can share and play their creations with other ''Blocksworld'' players around the world. Coin rewards serve as in-game currency that can be earned as player creations are liked by the community or featured within the game. These coins can also be purchased and used to buy a variety of themed building “sets” including original offerings, like Heroes of Aero, City Blocks, and Star Rangers, plus licensed sets including ''My Little Pony'', ''Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return'', G.I. Joe and ''Transformers'' sets.

Other game features include weekly build challenges and a “record and share” feature that enables players to instantly upload videos of their creations or gameplay to YouTube.*
* Kamcord not available

Certain blocks have a bronze, silver, or gold ring around them that symbolizes how special they are. The blocks are sorted into categories known as blocks, models, props, textures, colors, blocksters, gear, action blocks, actions, and sounds. Blocksters are ''Blocksworld'' people, that are in different kinds. Models are made by blocksworld but can also be made by the player. Action blocks are blocks with their own actions, although other blocks may have unique actions as well. Actions are placed in a panel with infinite space to store all actions needed although colors, textures, and any sound effect can be placed in the panel as well.

Lots of players create games and models to share.

Some players achieve a particularly high level of popularity within the games community, such as Okayzee, a skilled pixel artist, with a strong fan base consisting of over 10,000 followers, and Illumablocki, a game creator with over 7,000 followers.

==Development==

''Blocksworld'' was initially developed by Swedish [[independent video game]] developer [[Boldai]], which was acquired by U.S.-based [[Linden Lab]] in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahey|first=Mike|title=This Beautiful Blocky Building Toy is Going Global|url=http://kotaku.com/5978792/this-beautiful-blocky-building-toy-is-going-global|publisher=kotaku.com|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version of the game was briefly available in 2012 in Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=App Detail » App Annie Analytics|url=https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/blocksworld-hd/app-ranking/#daily=2013-06-24&amp;type=ranks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for the subsequent global release, the game was repositioned as a [[freemium]] offering where players have the option to purchase premium sets and games, additional building objects and pieces, coins, and other upgrades and extras for a small fee.

Virtual coins serve as the [[in-game currency]], which can be either purchased via the in-app shop or rewarded through various community actions such as having creations rated via stars.

Players used have the option to pay 7.99 (US) or (CAD) dollars for Blocksworld Premium, which gives an infinite amount of designated blocks. Now, Blocksworld Premium is a subscription which has to be paid monthly/yearly and gives more benefits than the original Blocksworld Premium.

In September 2017, Blocksworld was released on Steam, prior to that, you could only play it on your browser or on your mobile device.

==Popularity==

Since its initial U.S. release, Blocksworld has reached number one on iTunes in the Education category for the iPad (U.S.) and number three in the overall Games category for the iPad (U.S.). In addition, the game has found high visibility on YouTube with over 45,000 user-created gameplay videos.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A '''boycott''' is an act of voluntary and intentional abstention from using, buying, or dealing with a person, organization, or country as an expression of protest, usually for moral, [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], or [[Environmentalism|environmental]] reasons. The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target, or to indicate a moral outrage, to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior.

Sometimes, a boycott can be a form of [[consumer activism]], sometimes called [[moral purchasing]]. When a similar practice is legislated by a national government, it is known as a [[Economic sanctions|sanction]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Charles Cunningham Boycott (Vanity Fair).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' caricature of Charles C. Boycott]]
The word ''boycott'' entered the English language during the [[Ireland|Irish]] "[[Land War]]" and derives from Captain [[Charles Boycott]], the land agent of an absentee landlord, [[John Crichton, 3rd Earl Erne|Lord Erne]], who lived in  Lough Mask House, near [[Ballinrobe]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Ireland]], who was subject to social [[ostracism]] organized by the [[Irish Land League]] in 1880. As harvests had been poor that year, Lord Erne offered his tenants a ten percent reduction in their rents. In September of that year, protesting tenants demanded a twenty five percent reduction, which Lord Erne refused. Boycott then attempted to evict eleven tenants from the land. [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], in a speech in [[Ennis]] prior to the events in Lough Mask, proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was first applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated – his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[André Deutsch]]|isbn=0-233-96430-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Captain+Boycott&amp;dq=Captain+Boycott&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iJUwTPyODeiTOOidtYYC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ|pages=133–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerted action taken against him meant that Boycott was unable to hire anyone to [[harvest]] the crops in his charge. Eventually 50 [[Orange Institution|Orangemen]] from [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] volunteered to do the work. They were escorted to and from [[Claremorris]] by one thousand [[Royal Irish Constabulary|policemen]] and soldiers, despite the fact that the local Land League leaders had said that there would be no violence from them, and in fact no violence happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[André Deutsch]]|isbn=0-233-96430-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Captain+Boycott&amp;dq=Captain+Boycott&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iJUwTPyODeiTOOidtYYC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ|pages=157–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection ended up costing far more than the harvest was worth. After the harvest, the "boycott" was successfully continued. Within weeks Boycott's name was everywhere. The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reporter, James Redpath, first wrote of the boycott in the international press. The Irish author, George Moore, reported: 'Like a comet the verb 'boycott' appeared.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Jane, That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by ''[[The Times]]'' in November 1880 as a term for organized isolation. According to an account in the book ''The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland'' by [[Michael Davitt]], the term was promoted by Fr. John O'Malley of County Mayo to "signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott". ''The Times'' first reported on November 20, 1880: "The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink." The ''Daily News'' wrote on December 13, 1880: "Already the stoutest-hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'." By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: "Dame Nature arose.... She 'Boycotted' London from Kew to Mile End" (The Spectator, January 22, 1881).

'''Girlcott''' is a [[portmanteau]] of girl and boycott intended to focus on the rights or actions of women. The term was coined in 1968 by American [[Track and Field|track]] star Lacey O'Neal during the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], in the context of [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|protests]] by male [[African American]] athletes. Speaking for black women athletes, she advised that the group would not "girlcott" the [[Olympic Games]], because female athletes were still focused on being recognized. It also appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1970, and was later used by retired [[tennis]] player [[Billie Jean King]] in reference to [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], to emphasize her argument regarding [[equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for women players.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The term "girlcott" was revived in 2005 by women in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] protesting what they said were sexist and degrading [[T-shirt#Decoration|T-shirt slogan]]s on [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=3590221 |title=Teen Girls Protest Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Shirts |publisher=ABC Inc. |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of boycotts}}
Although the term itself was not coined until 1880, the practice dates back to at least the 1790s, when supporters of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of the slave trade in Britain]] advocated [[Free produce movement|boycotting slave-produced sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fox, ''An Address to the People of Great Britain, on the Utility of Refraining from the Use of West India Sugar and Rum''. 1791&lt;/ref&gt;  Other instances include:
* the Iranian [[Tobacco_Protest|Tobacco Boycott]], 1891
* [[Civil Rights Movement]] boycotts (e.g., [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery]] &amp; [[Tallahassee bus boycott|Tallahassee]] Bus Boycotts)
* the [[United Farm Workers of America|United Farm Workers]] union grape and lettuce boycotts
* the American boycott of British goods at the time of the [[American Revolution]]
* the 1905 Chinese boycott of American products to protest the extension of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. X. Lee|title=Chinese Americans: The History and Culture of a People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcLQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR26|year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[swadeshi|Indian boycott of British goods]] organized by [[Mohandas Gandhi]]
* the successful Jewish boycott organised against Henry Ford in the USA, in the 1920s
* the [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China after the [[May Fourth Movement]]
* the [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|Jewish anti-Nazi boycott]] of German goods in Lithuania, the US, Britain, Poland and [[Mandatory Palestine]] during 1933
* the antisemitic [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish-owned businesses]] in [[Nazi Germany]] during the 1930s
* the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]] and companies trading with Israel.
* the worldwide [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign led by Palestinian civil society against the State of Israel.

During the [[1973 oil crisis]], the [[Arab]] countries enacted a [[crude oil]] embargo against the West. Other examples include the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow]], the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles]], and the movement that advocated "[[disinvestment]]" in [[South Africa]] during the 1980s in opposition to that country's [[apartheid]] regime. The first Olympic boycott was in the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] with several countries boycotting the games for different reasons. Iran also has an informal Olympic boycott against participating against Israel, and Iranian athletes typically bow out or claim injuries when pitted against Israelis (see [[Arash Miresmaeili]]).

==Application and uses==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
[[File:BP Oil Flood Protest Boycott Wheres Cheney.JPG|thumb|Protesters advocating boycott of [[BP]] due to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]]]
A boycott is typically a one-time affair intended to correct an outstanding single wrong. When extended for a long period of time, or as part of an overall program of awareness-raising or reforms to laws or regimes, a boycott is part of [[moral purchasing]], and some prefer those economic or political terms.

Most organized consumer boycotts today are focused on long-term change of buying habits, and so fit into part of a larger political program, with many techniques that require a longer structural commitment, e.g. reform to [[commodity markets]], or government commitment to [[moral purchasing]], e.g. the longstanding boycott of [[South Africa]]n businesses to protest [[apartheid]] already alluded to.  These stretch the meaning of a "boycott."

Boycotts are now much easier to successfully initiate due to the [[Internet]].  Examples include the [[homosexuality|gay and lesbian]] boycott of advertisers of the "[[Dr. Laura]]" [[talk show]], gun owners' similar boycott of advertisers of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s talk show and (later) magazine, and gun owners' boycott of [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] following that company's March 2000 settlement with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration.  They may be initiated very easily using either Web sites (the Dr. Laura boycott), newsgroups (the Rosie O'Donnell boycotts), or even mailing lists.  Internet-initiated boycotts "snowball" very quickly compared to other forms of organization.

''Viral Labeling'' is a new boycott method using the new digital technology proposed by the Multitude Project and applied for the first time against Walt Disney around Christmas time in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective boycott campaigns – Multitude Project|work=Outreach|url=http://sites.google.com/site/multitude2008/Home/organize-efficient-boycott-campaigns|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of consumer boycotting is substitution for an equivalent product; for example, [[Mecca Cola]] and [[Qibla Cola]] have been marketed as substitutes for [[Coca-Cola]] among [[Muslim]] populations.

Academic boycotts have been organized against countries. For example, the mid and late 20th century [[academic boycotts of South Africa]] in protest of [[apartheid]] practices and the more recent{{when|date=October 2017}} [[academic boycotts of Israel]].
[[File:Dontstopdontshop.JPG|thumb|right|African-Americans in Dallas boycotting a Korean owned [[Diamond Shamrock and Kwik Stop Boycott|Kwik Stop]] in a mostly black community.]]
Some boycotts center on particular businesses, such as recent{{when|date=October 2017}} protests regarding [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[Ford Motor Company]], or the diverse products of [[Altria Group#Food .26 Beverage|Philip Morris]]. Another form of boycott identifies a number of different companies involved in a particular issue, such as the Sudan Divestment campaign, the [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] campaign. The [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] website was set up by [[Ethical Consumer]] after U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] failed to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]] – the website identifies Bush's corporate funders and the brands and products they produce. A prime target of boycotts is [[consumerism]] itself, e.g. "[[International Buy Nothing Day]]" celebrated globally on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] in the United States.

Another version of the boycott is targeted divestment, or disinvestment. Targeted divestment involves campaigning for withdrawal of investment, for example the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216155609/http://www.sudandivestment.org/home.asp Sudan Divestment] campaign involves putting pressure on companies, often through shareholder activism, to withdraw investment that helps the Sudanese government perpetuate genocide in Darfur. Only if a company refuses to change its behavior in response to shareholder engagement does the targeted divestment model call for divestment from that company. Such targeted divestment implicitly excludes companies involved in agriculture, the production and distribution of consumer goods, or the provision of goods and services intended to relieve human suffering or to promote health, religious and spiritual activities, or education.

As a response to consumer boycotts of large-scale and multinational businesses, some companies have marketed brands that do not bear the company's name on the packaging or in advertising. Activists such as [[Ethical Consumer]] produce information that reveals which companies own which brands and products so consumers can practice boycotts or moral purchasing more effectively. Another organization, [[Buycott.com]], provides an Internet-based smart-phone application that scans [[Universal Product Code]]s and displays corporate relationships to the user.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Conner |first=Claire |title=New App Lets You Boycott Koch Brothers, Monsanto And More By Scanning Your Shopping Cart |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/05/14/new-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart/ |publisher=Forbes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140321130346/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fclareoconnor%2F2013%2F05%2F14%2Fnew-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart%2F |archivedate=March 21, 2014 |date=May 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |quote=Burner figured the average supermarket shopper had no idea that buying Brawny paper towels, Angel Soft toilet paper or Dixie cups meant contributing cash to Koch Industries through its subsidiary Georgia-Pacific. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Boycotts" may be formally organized by governments as well. In reality, government "boycotts" are just a type of [[embargo]]. Notably, the first formal, nationwide act of the Nazi government against German Jews was a national [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|embargo of Jewish businesses]] on April 1, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Holocaust Museum and Memorial |work=Outreach |url=http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/boycott.htm |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003092626/http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/boycott.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the target of a boycott derives all or part of its revenues from other businesses, as a newspaper does, boycott organizers may address the target's commercial customers.

When students are dissatisfied with a political or academic issue, a common tactic for [[students' union]]s is to start a boycott of classes (called a [[student strike]] among faculty and students since it is meant to resemble [[strike action]] by [[organized labor]]) to put pressure on the governing body of the institution, such as a university, vocational college or a school, since such institutions cannot afford to have a cohort miss an entire year.

== Collective behavior ==
The sociology of [[collective behavior]] is concerned with causes and conditions pertaining to behavior carried out by a collective, as opposed to an individual (e.g., [[riot]]s, [[mass panic|panics]], [[fad|fads/crazes]], boycotts). Boycotts have been characterized by some as different from traditional forms of collective behavior in that they appear to be highly rational and dependent on existing norms and structures. Lewis Killian criticizes that characterization, pointing to the [[Tallahassee bus boycott]] as one example of a boycott that aligns with traditional collective behavior theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killian|first=Lewis M.|date=1984-01-01|title=Organization, Rationality and Spontaneity in the Civil Rights Movement|jstor=2095529|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=770–783|doi=10.2307/2095529}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philip Balsiger points out that political consumption (e.g., boycotts) tends to follow dual-purpose action repertoires, or scripts, which are used publicly to pressure boycott targets and to educate and recruit consumers. Balsiger finds one example in Switzerland, documenting activities of the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]], a public [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-backed campaign, that highlighted and disseminated information about local companies' ethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balsiger|first=Philip|date=2010-08-01|title=Making Political Consumers: The Tactical Action Repertoire of a Campaign for Clean Clothes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2010.493672|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=9|issue=3|pages=311–329|doi=10.1080/14742837.2010.493672|issn=1474-2837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon, Martin, and Nau analyzed 31 collective behavior campaigns against corporations that took place during the 1990s and 2000s. Protests considered successful included boycotts and were found to include a third party, either in the capacity of state intervention or of media coverage. State intervention may make boycotts more efficacious when corporation leaders fear the imposition of regulations. Media intervention may be a crucial contributor to a successful boycott because of its potential to damage the reputation of a corporation. Target corporations that were the most visible were found to be the most vulnerable to either market (protest causing economic loss) or mediated (caused by third-party) disruption. Third-party actors (i.e., the state or media) were more influential when a corporation had a high reputation—when third-party activity was low, highly reputable corporations did not make the desired concessions to boycotters; when third-party activity was high, highly reputable corporations satisfied the demands of boycotters. The boycott, a prima facie market-disruptive tactic, often precipitates mediated disruption. The researchers' analysis led them to conclude that when boycott targets are highly visible and directly interact with and depend on local consumers who can easily find substitutes, they are more likely to make concessions. Koku, Akhigbe, and Springer also emphasize the importance of boycotts' threat of reputational damage, finding that boycotts alone pose more of a threat to a corporation's reputation than to its finances directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Marc|last2=Martin|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Nau|first3=Michael|date=2016-04-12|title=Social Protest and Corporate Change: Brand Visibility, Third-Party Influence, and the Responsiveness of Corporations to Activist Campaigns *|url=http://mobilizationjournal.org/doi/10.17813/1086-671X-21-1-65|journal=Mobilization: An International Quarterly|language=EN|volume=21|issue=1|pages=65–82|doi=10.17813/1086-671x-21-1-65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koku|first=Paul Sergius|last2=Akhigbe|first2=Aigbe|last3=Springer|first3=Thomas M.|date=1997-09-01|title=The Financial Impact of Boycotts and Threats of Boycott|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296396002792|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=40|issue=1|pages=15–20|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(96)00279-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe Delacote points out that a problem contributing to a generally low probability of success for any boycott is the fact that the consumers with the most power to cause market disruption are the least likely to participate; the opposite is true for consumers with the least power. Another collective behavior problem is the difficulty, or impossibility, of direct coordination amongst a dispersed group of boycotters. Yuksel and Mryteza emphasize the collective behavior problem of free riding in consumer boycotts, noting that some individuals may perceive participating to be too great an immediate personal utility sacrifice. They also note that boycotting consumers took the collectivity into account when deciding to participate, that is, consideration of joining a boycott as goal-oriented collective activity increased one's likelihood of participating. A corporation-targeted protest repertoire including boycotts and education of consumers presents the highest likelihood for success. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delacote|first=Philippe|date=2009-09-01|title=On the Sources of Consumer Boycotts Ineffectiveness|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1070496509338849|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=306–322|doi=10.1177/1070496509338849|issn=1070-4965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuksel|first=Ulku|last2=Mryteza|first2=Victoria|date=2009-02-01|title=An evaluation of strategic responses to consumer boycotts|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296308000477|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Anti-consumption|volume=62|issue=2|pages=248–259|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

[[File:HANDS OFF GAZA STOP THE BOMBING FREE PALESTINE - UK NATIONAL DEMONSTRATION.jpg|thumb|Protesters calling for a boycott of Israel]]

Boycotts are generally legal in developed countries. Occasionally, some restrictions may apply; for instance, in the United States, it may be unlawful for a union to engage in "[[secondary boycott]]s" (to request that its members boycott companies that supply items to an organization already under a boycott, in the United States);&lt;ref&gt;National Labor Relations Act, § 8(e), 29 U.S.C.A. § 158(e).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Local 917, Intern. Broth. of Teamsters v. N.L.R.B.'', 577 F.3d 70, 75 (C.A.2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; however, the union is free to use its right to speak freely to inform its members of the fact that suppliers of a company are breaking a boycott; its members then may take whatever action they deem appropriate, in consideration of that fact.

===United States===
Boycotts are legal under common law. The right to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship includes the implied right not to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship. Since a boycott is voluntary and nonviolent, the law cannot stop it. Opponents of boycotts historically have the choice of suffering under it, yielding to its demands, or attempting to suppress it through extralegal means, such as force and coercion.

In the United States, the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all "U.S. persons", defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates. The antiboycott provisions are intended to prevent United States citizens and companies being used as instrumentalities of a foreign government's foreign policy. The EAR forbids participation in or material support of boycotts initiated by foreign governments, for example, the [[Arab League]] boycott of [[Israel]]. These persons are subject to the law when their activities relate to the sale, purchase, or transfer of goods or services (including the sale of information) within the United States or between the United States and a foreign country. This covers exports and imports, financing, forwarding and shipping, and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security|work=Office of Antiboycott Compliance|url=http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered|accessdate=March 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092529/http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EAR only applies to ''foreign government initiated'' boycotts: a domestic boycott campaign arising within the United States that has the same object as the foreign-government-initiated boycott appears to be lawful, assuming that it is an independent effort not connected with the foreign government's boycott. 
Other legal impediments to certain boycotts remain. One set are [[Refusal to deal]] laws, which prohibit concerted efforts to eliminate competition by refusal to buy from or to sell to a party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/concerted-refusal-to-deal.html Business Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, boycotts may also run afoul of [[Anti-discrimination laws]], for example [[New Jersey]]'s Law Against Discrimination prohibits any place that offers goods, services and facilities to the general public, such as a restaurant, from denying or withholding any accommodation to (''i.e.'', not to engage in commerce with) an individual because of that individual's race (etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcr/accom.html New Jersey State official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CRCC Asia began in August 2006 as two separate companies founded by Daniel Nivern and Edward Holroyd Pearce: China Consulting Ltd., a business development consulting firm; and China Recruitment, Ltd., a company that provided internships and Mandarin Chinese language courses to university students. In December 2008, the two companies merged and formed CRCC Asia Ltd.

The company received the New Horizons Award from the [[Cathay Pacific]] China Business Awards in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelio.net/cathay-pacific-announces-winners-of-2010-cathay-pacific-china-business-awards.html|title=Cathay Pacific announces winners of 2010 Cathay Pacific China Business Awards|publisher=Travelio|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognized the company's commitment to China through business innovation and corporate social responsibility. In November 2012, CRCC Asia was named as Entrepreneur of the Year in the British Business Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishchamber.cn/content/succeeding-china-crcc-asia-wins-bba-entrepreneur-year-award|title=Succeeding in China: CRCC Asia Wins BBA Entrepreneur of the Year Award|publisher=British Chamber of Commerce in China|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbusinessawards.cn/press/the-british-business-awards-2012-winners-announced/|title=The British Business Awards 2012 Winners Announced|publisher=British Business Awards|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luise Schafer OBE joined CRCC Asia as a senior adviser in 2012. She was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 2012 in recognition of her work for British business in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/understanding-china-is-vital-for-todays-graduates-8513453.html|title=Understanding China is vital for today's graduates|publisher=The Independent (London)|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music competition in Japan===
In 2012, Hebert published ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools'',&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012). ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese School''. Dordrecht: Springer Press {{ISBN|9400721773}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that identified the world's largest music competition and documented the experiences of its participants. With more than 14,000 competing [[wind bands]] and widely admired performances, Japan is an especially important nation for instrumental [[music education]], and Hebert's ethnographic and historical monograph has been described in the journal ''Music Education Research'' as "the most comprehensive information about concert (wind) band participation in any country."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gouzouasis and Alan Henderson (2012). Secondary Student Perspectives on Musical and Educational Outcomes from Participation in Band Festivals. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14613808.2012.714361 "Music Education Research"], 14(4), pp.479-498.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in the ''British Journal of Music Education'', "David Hebert delved deep under the surface of the seemingly everyday where he discovered anomalies and cultural specifics that are unlike anything found in the West ... His book performs the remarkable: a call to explore new ways of doing high school band programmes differently."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Stanfield (2014). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9196573&amp;fileId=S0265051714000047 "British Journal of Music Education"], 31(1), pp.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt; A sociologist with Tokyo Metropolitan University has said that this book "can serve as an important reference and inform the decisions of those attempting to advance changes to the educational system."&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima, Hiroshi (2013). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. [http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/2/337.extract "Social Science Japan Journal"], 16(2), pp.337-340.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also describes Japanese composers, and has been used for concert program notes by prominent conductors, such as [[Eugene Corporon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lonestarwindorchestra.com/connect/concert-programs/notes-from-japan/ | title=Lonestar Wind Orchestra: Notes from Japan | publisher= Lonestar Wind Orchestra, Dallas, Texas, USA | accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Reynish (who describes it as "compulsory reading for anyone interested in Japanese music")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timreynish.com/repertoire/repertoire-by-country/japan.php#windb|title=Repertoire By Country - Repertoire - Tim Reynish|work=timreynish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book helps to explain why [[music competitions]] are a global phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David G. (2018, in press). Competition in Music. ''SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture'' (Janet Sturman, Ed.), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music globalization, transculturation and hybridity===
According to Roberta Pike, Hebert asserts that "research is needed to explore the role of culture in music education."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta E. Pike, Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects (Fremont, CA: Jain, 2007), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; From a global perspective, Hebert has examined how musical practices, technologies, and genres are adopted into new contexts, including educational and religious traditions within institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D.

He twice served as keynote speaker for conferences on Music and [[Globalization]] in Poland (2014 and 2015), from which proceedings were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | last2 = Rykowski | first2 = Mikolaj |title = Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/music-glocalization | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9781527503939}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Pluralism and music institutions===
Hebert's work has also addressed the challenges of representing [[cultural diversity]] and embracing pluralism in music education, claiming for music a unique role in [[intercultural communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2010). "Ethnicity and Music Education: Sociological Dimensions". In Ruth Wright (Ed.), ''Sociology and Music Education.'' Aldershot: Ashgate Press, pp.93-114. {{ISBN|0754668010}}; David G.

Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.88-91.&lt;/ref&gt; He has advocated for [[popular music pedagogy]] and [[world music]] pedagogy as innovative approaches for reaching a wider population of students.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. [https://www.amazon.com/Multicultural-Perspectives-Education-William-Anderson/dp/1607095408 Jazz and Rock Music]. In W. M. Anderson &amp; P. S. Campbell (Eds.), ''Multicultural Perspectives in Music Education'', Vol.1 (third edition) (pp.112-127). Lanham, MD: Rowman-Littlefield Publishers (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher educators have noted that Hebert "guides the reader toward a sociological understanding" of diversity,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Schmidt (2012). Book Review – Sociology and Music Education [http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/v22n1/visions/Schmidt_Book_Review_Sociology_and_Music_Education.pdf "Visions of Research in Music Education"], 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and offers "suggestions for 'empowering music teachers to respond appropriately to the complexity of ethnic differences'."&lt;ref&gt;Tami J. Draves (2011). Sociology and Music Education. "Journal of Historical Research in Music Education", 33(1), pp.109.&lt;/ref&gt; Extending in directions pioneered by his PhD mentor [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]], Hebert has also written of "the challenges of multicultural teaching in music" and "the central role that ethnic identity plays in musical meaning and engagement."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon G. Davis (2013). Sociology in Music Education [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14613808.2013.801593 "Music Education Research"], 15(2), pp.249-251.&lt;/ref&gt; His research in this area has often been in collaboration with [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] scholars, including Eva Saether&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evasaether.com|title=Eva Sæther|work=evasaether.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marja Heimonen.&lt;ref&gt;Marja Heimonen and David G.

===Nationalism in music education===
Hebert co-edited with Alexandra Kertz-Welzel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandrakertzwelzel.com|title=Alexandra Kertz-Welzel|work=alexandrakertzwelzel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Professor and Chair, [[University of Munich]]), the 2012 book ''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book includes contributions by music education researchers from several continents, and discusses "how music contributes to the creation of an emotional climate in schools, and its function in fostering the formation of particular loyalties, identities and dispositions."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Parker (2016). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0046760X.2015.1088077 "History of Education"], 45(3), pp.395-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Music psychologist [[John Sloboda]] described this book as "a 'must read' resource for anyone interested in this topic."&lt;ref&gt;John Sloboda (2012). Patriotism and nationalism in music education: A review essay [http://www.ijea.org/v13r2/index.html#.VMOGxWTF_0h "International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts"], 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', Hebert and Kertz-Welzel pose "challenging questions about the role of music teachers in propagating and inculcating patriotic sentiments", and the book is relevant beyond the [[sociology of music]], to any "scholars engaged in researching comparative and political educational issues."&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Jamset. (2013). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. "Fontes Artis Musicae", 60(2), pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Hebert has argued that "intercultural music transmission" enables national boundaries to be positively transcended via music participation.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2001). [http://jrm.sagepub.com/content/49/3/212.abstract "The Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra: A Case Study of Intercultural Music Transmission"].

Hebert's interests in global music [[historiography]] developed as he explored such topics as how European music was adopted in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2178-4_2 "Where are These Bands From? – An Historical Overview"] in ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools''. Dordrecht: Springer Press, pp.11-82. {{ISBN|9400721773}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how the American genres of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] ironically struggled to gain acceptance in American schools.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2011).

International Journal of Music Education, 36(1), pp. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he produced a book with Jonathan McCollum (Washington College) entitled ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''.&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Historical-Ethnomusicology-Jonathan-McCollum/dp/0739168266 ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''] Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through use of "a broad spectrum of geocultural examples, the volume includes several engaging strategies for using and writing about history in order to understand the world's musics".&lt;ref&gt;Justin R. Hunter (2016). Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/608918 "NOTES"], 72(3), pp.534-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicologists Keith Howard, Daniel M. Neuman and Judah Cohen contributed chapters. Hebert now edits a book series in this field with Jonathan McCollum for [[Rowman and Littlefield]] press, ''The Lexington Series in Historical Ethnomusicology: Deep Soundings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://sociomusicology.blogspot.nl/2017/03/historical-ethnomusicology-book-series.html | title=Historical Ethnomusicology Book Series: Deep Soundings | publisher= Sociomusicology blog| accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Music technology and online music education===
Hebert has also been active in researching the application of new technologies in [[online music education]] and research.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. (2016). Technology and Arts Education Policy. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2016.1187932 "Arts Education Policy Review"], 117(3), pp.1-5 (Editorial Introduction, ''Technology'' Special Issue).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming interested in "[[big data]]", he authored an article examining the challenges of educating music teachers in a fully online doctoral program (at [[Boston University]]).&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2008). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25487541 "Reflections on Teaching the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music Online"].

[http://www.stthomas.edu/rimeonline/vol5/index.htm "Five Challenges and Solutions in Online Music Teacher Education"]. Research and Issues in Music Education, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked some debate – with Kenneth H. Phillips, among others – that led to further publications on projects in Europe and Africa that made use of the Internet to support intercultural music exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthmann, Alex and Hebert, David (2012) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199928019.013.0037 "Music Learning and New Media in Virtual and Online Environments"].

===East Asian studies===
Hebert has researched music in Japan, where he lived for about 5 years, and he often lectures for leading universities and conservatories in China. He has published several articles and book chapters on western music in Japan (and Korea), and is editor of ''International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies'' (Springer), the 25th anniversary proceedings of the Nordic Association for Japanese and Korean Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | title = International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies | publisher = Springer | location = New York | url = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319684321 | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9783319684321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert has also drawn attention to East Asian arts through the [[International Sociological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://isaconf.confex.com/isaconf/wc2014/webprogram/Session4110.html

== Philosophical orientation ==
Hebert claims that [[postmodernist]] discourse no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices, and that most music philosophy suffers from an [[Ethnocentrism |ethnocentric]] orientation. Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of "digital prehistory" to enter a phase of "data saturation" through ubiquitous [[mass surveillance]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). "Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.85-148 {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing conditions he describes as "glocalimbodied,"&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2009). [http://www.parlando.hu/2009-4-web-Herbert-Eng.htm "On Virtuality and Music Education in Online Environments"]. Parlando, 48(4) [in Hungarian translation, by Mariann Abraham].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that local and global forces converge to "stamp" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media. Hebert also argues that music, now most commonly consumed in digital form, may be understood as "content" in a "selfie-stick society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | last2 = Rykowski | first2 = Mikolaj |title = Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/music-glocalization | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9781527503939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, this new context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles. Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of "flexibility",&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2009) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-2700-9_4 "Musicianship, Musical Identity and Meaning as Embodied Practice"] In T. Regelski &amp; J. T. Gates (Eds.), ''Music Education for Changing Times: Guiding Visions for Practice''. Dordrecht: Springer Press, pp.39-55. {{ISBN|9048126991}}&lt;/ref&gt; with inclusion of marginalized traditions, cultivation of both acoustic and digital competencies, and rejection of any ties to "[[aesthetic]] [[fundamentalism]]", [[techno-utopianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. (2016). Technology and Arts Education Policy. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2016.1187932 "Arts Education Policy Review"], 117(3), pp.1-5 (Editorial Introduction, ''Technology'' Special Issue).&lt;/ref&gt; [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2015) [http://mej.sagepub.com/content/101/3/77.abstract "Militarism and Music Education"]. ''Music Educators Journal'', vol.101, no. 3, pp.77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Music scholars have noted that Hebert "believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity'," and that "Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‘embodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts’."&lt;ref&gt;Jeananne Nichols (2011). Music education for changing times: A review essay [http://ijea.org/v12r2/index.html "International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts"], 12.&lt;/ref&gt; An advocate for increased [[contemporary music]], [[music technology]], and [[popular music]] in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should not be seen as panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions – including the heritage of "classical" [[art music]] – still legitimately require ample space in school education.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert and Marja Heimonen (2013). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2013.803421 "Public Policy and Music Education in Norway and Finland"]. Arts Education Policy Review, 114(3), special issue on "Cosmopolitanism and Policy", pp.135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert's work especially promotes the value of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] in [[teacher education]],&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert, Tuovi Martinsen, and Keld Hosbond (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Launching the Nordic Master of Global Music Program"].

Music Education Research, 16(4), pp.418-435.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasizes the importance of an international-comparative perspective for envisioning improvements to educational policies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1584974/Keynote_International_Comparisons_in_the_Improvement_of_Education "International Comparisons in the Improvement of Education"]. Signum Temporis: Journal of Pedagogy and Psychology, 5(2), pp.17-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism.'' 
While largely accepted, some of Hebert's conclusions have faced opposition from other scholars. His research in Japan controversially suggests that some important aspects of music history are inaccurately "remembered", and he has argued that similar issues may be found in common music history textbooks in the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). "Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.85-148 {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert asserts that music contests can have not only positive, but also negative consequences for participants and the musical traditions they display, and require careful design for desirable outcomes. Some music educators defend traditional pedagogies that Hebert and others claim need to be redeveloped or supplemented with new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fonder [https://genius.com/Mark-fonder-professor-of-music-education-at-ithaca-college-no-default-or-reset-necessary-large-ensembles-enrich-many-annotated "No Default or Reset Necessary – Large Ensembles Enrich Many."]; See debate between Hebert and Kenneth Phillips in 2008, [http://www.stthomas.edu/rimeonline/vol6/index.htm "Research and Issues in Music Education"], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Walker and [[Roger Scruton]] would disagree with Hebert's position regarding the value of [[popular music pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walker (2007). ''Music Education: Cultural Values, Social Change and Innovation''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Bates has argued that a "cosmopolitan" perspective may already receive excessive emphasis in the field of music education,&lt;ref&gt;Vincent C. Bates (2014). [http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates13_1.pdf "Rethinking cosmopolitanism in music education."]. Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 13(1): 310–27.&lt;/ref&gt; while Thomas Regelski has suggested that "culture" – a concept emphasized in much of Hebert's writings – is a nebulous construct with questionable utility for the field.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Regelski (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Culturalism, Multi-Culturalism, and Multi-Musical Prosperity."].

'''Education in [[Iran]]''' is centralized and divided into [[K-12 education]] plus [[higher education]]. K-12 education is supervised by the [[Ministry of Education (Iran)|Ministry of Education]] and higher education is under supervision of [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology|Ministry of Science and Technology]] and [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Iran)]]. As of September 2015, 93% of the Iranian adult population are literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13940629000008|title=خبرگزاری فارس - 93 درصد جمعیت ایران باسواد هستند|date=20 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 85% of the Iranian adult population were literate, well ahead of the regional average of 62%. This rate increases to 97% among young adults (aged between 15 and 24) without any gender discrepancy.&lt;ref name=BY/&gt; By 2007, Iran had a student to [[Economy of Iran#labor force|workforce population]] ratio of 10.2%, standing among the countries with highest ratio in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obs-ost.fr/fileadmin/medias/PDF/P3_SP1.pdf |title=L'espace mondial |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112142630/http://www.obs-ost.fr/fileadmin/medias/PDF/P3_SP1.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary school]] (''Dabestân دبستان'') starts at the age of 6 for a duration of 6 years. [[Middle school]], also known as First 3 years of Dabirestân  (''Dabirestân دوره اول دبیرستان''), goes from the seventh to the ninth grade. [[High school]] (''Dabirestân دوره دوم دبیرستان''), for which the last three years is not mandatory, is divided between theoretical, vocational/technical and manual, each program with its own specialties.&lt;ref name="wes.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/iran/firedov.htm |title=WEP-Iran |publisher=Wes.org |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224011506/http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/iran/firedov.htm |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to enter into higher education is to have a [[High school diploma]], and finally pass the national university entrance examination, [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] (''Konkur کنکور''), which is the equivalent of the French [[baccalauréat]] exam.

[[Universities]], [[institutes of technology]], [[medical school]]s and community colleges, provide the higher education. Higher education is sanctioned by different levels of diplomas: ''Fogh-e-Diplom'' or ''Kārdāni'' after 2 years of higher education, ''Kārshenāsi'' (also known under the name “licence”) is delivered after 4 years of higher education ([[Bachelor's degree]]). ''Kārshenāsi-ye Arshad'' is delivered after 2 more years of study ([[Master's degree]]). After which, another exam allows the candidate to pursue a doctoral program ([[PhD]]).&lt;ref name="wes.org"/&gt;

[[File:UIS Literacy Rate Iran population plus 15 1975-2015.png|thumb|Literacy Rate of Iran population plus 15 1975-2015 by UNESCO Institute of Statistics]]
The first Western-style public schools were established by Haji-Mirza [[Hassan Roshdieh]].  Amir Kabir (the Grand Minister) helped the first modern Iranian college establish in the mid-nineteenth century, and the first Iranian University modelled after European Universities established during the first Pahlavi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassan Pour|first1=Faramarz|title=Design of Higher Education Learning Spaces in Iran; From the Qajar Period to the Present Time|journal=Snapshots International Symposium on Learning Spaces, the University of Melbourne|date=5 June 2014|doi=10.13140/2.1.2169.5040|hdl=11343/42271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are both free public schools and private schools in Iran at all levels, from elementary school through university. Education in Iran is highly centralized.  The Ministry of Education is in charge of educational planning, financing, administration, curriculum, and textbook development. Teacher training, grading, and examinations are also the responsibility of the Ministry. At the university level, however, every student attending public schools is required to commit to serve the government for a number of years typically equivalent to those spent at the university, or pay it off for a very low price (typically a few hundred dollars) or completely free if one can prove inability to pay to the Islamic government (Post secondary and university). During the early 1970s, efforts were made to improve the educational system by updating school curriculation, introducing modern textbooks, and training more efficient teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Iran-EDUCATION.html |title=Education - Iran - system |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] continued the country's emphasis on education with the new government putting its own stamp on the process. The most important change was the [[Islamization]] of the education system. All students were segregated by sex. In 1980, the Cultural Revolution Committee was formed to oversee the institution of Islamic values in education. An arm of the committee, the Center for Textbooks (composed mainly of clerics), produced 3,000 new college-level textbooks reflecting Islamic views by 1983.&lt;ref name='Iran'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia= Powered by JRank Encyclopedia of the Nations |title=Iran - Education |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Iran-EDUCATION.html |accessdate=2009-07-12 |edition= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching materials based on Islam were introduced into the primary grades within six months of the revolution.

There are three school types: the theoretical branch, the technical-vocational/professional branch, and the manual skills branch (Kar-Danesh). The latter two prepare students to directly enter the job market in the trading, agricultural, industrial professions.

==Education reform==
{{see also|Education reform}}
The ''[[Economy of Iran#Five-year socio-economic development plan|Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (2005-2010)]]'' has envisaged upgrading the quality of the educational system at all levels, as well as reforming education curricula, and developing appropriate programs of [[vocational training]], a continuation of the trend towards labor market oriented education and training.&lt;ref name='Irandev'&gt;{{Citation| first= | last=| contribution=Iran: Country Brief| title=Development Progress| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=[[World Bank]]| place=| pages=| date=June 2009| id= | contribution-url=http://go.worldbank.org/KQD2RP3RX0| format=| accessdate=2009-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new education reform plan in 2012, the Pre-university year will be replaced with an additional year in elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/Program/230432.html|title=PressTV|author=|date=|website=www.presstv.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students will have the same teacher for the first 3 years of primary school. Emphasis will be made on research, knowledge production and questioning instead of math and memorizing alone. In the new system the teacher will no longer be the only instructor but a facilitator and guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presstv.com/Program/265250.html|title=PressTV|author=|date=|website=presstv.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other more general goals of the education reform are:
#Making the education more global in terms of knowledge.
#Nurturing children who believe in the one God.
#Providing a socially just education system.
#Increasing the role of the family in the education system.
#Increasing the efficiency of the education system.
#Achieving the highest standard of education in the region.

==Teacher education==
[[Farhangian University]] is the university of teacher education and human resource development in Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87_%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86&amp;oldid=12775502|title=دانشگاه فرهنگیان|author=|date=18 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher Training Centers in Iran are responsible for training teachers for primary, orientation cycle, and gifted children’s schools.  These centers offer four-year programs leading to a BA or BS degree in teaching the relevant subject. Students that enter Teacher Training Centers, have at minimum, completed  a High school diploma. A national entrance examination is required for admission.

There are 98 teacher-training centers in Iran, all belonging to Farhangian University.

==Foreign languages==
{{See also|Iran Language Institute|Media in Iran}}
[[Persian language|Persian]]  is officially the national language of Iran. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as the language of [[Koran]], is taught grades 6-11. In addition to Arabic, students are required to take one foreign language class in grades 7-12. Although other foreign languages such as German, French, Spanish and Chinese are offered in most urban schools, English continues to be the most desired language.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/component/content/article/94791 |title=With the verve of words: Learning foreign languages in Iran |publisher=Tehran Times |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123103827/http://www.tehrantimes.com/component/content/article/94791 |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kanoun-e-Zabaan-e-Iran'' or [[Iran Language Institute|Iran's Language Institute]] affiliated to Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults was founded in 1979. Persian, English, French, Spanish, German and Arabic are taught to over 175,000 students during each term.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;

[[English language]] is studied in rahnamaei (literally meaning, guidance or orientation), an equivalent for middle school in other countries. Middle school is a period of three years and it covers grades 6-8 for students aged 11 to 13 years old. The government is now considering teaching English language from primary school level. However, the quality of English education in schools is not satisfactory and most of students in order to obtain a better English fluency and proficiency have to take English courses in private institutes.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;

Presently, there are over 5000 foreign language schools in the country, 200 of which are situated in [[Tehran]]. A few television channels air weekly English and Arabic language sessions, particularly for university candidates who are preparing for the annual entrance test.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;

Most teaching of English starts in middle school (age 12-14), but before 2018, some primary schools (age 12 and below) also taught English. However, in January 2018, a senior educational official announced on state television that teaching English is banned in primary schools, including non-government primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran bans English in primary schools after leaders' warning|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/iran-english/iran-bans-english-in-primary-schools-after-leaders-warning-idINKBN1EW0L7|accessdate=7 January 2018|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=7 January 2018|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and distance education==
{{See also|Communications in Iran}}

[[Communications in Iran#Internet|Full Internet service is available in all major cities]] and it is very rapidly increasing. Many small towns and even some villages now have full Internet access. The government aims to provide 10% of government and commercial services via the [[Internet]] by end-2008 and to equip every school with computers and connections by the same date.&lt;ref name="EIU"&gt;{{Citation| first= | last=| contribution=Telecoms And Technology Forecast for Iran| title=Economist Intelligence Unit| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=August 18, 2008| id= | contribution-url=| format=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of [[Higher education in Iran|university education in Iran]] goes back to the early centuries of Islam. By the 20th century, however, the system had become antiquated and was remodeled along [[France|French]] lines. The country's 16 universities were closed after the 1979 revolution and were then reopened gradually between 1982 and 1983 under Islamic supervision.

While the universities were closed, the Cultural Revolution Committee investigated professors and teachers and dismissed those who were believers in [[Marxism]], [[liberalism]], and other "[[imperialistic]]" ideologies. The universities reopened with Islamic curricula. In 1997, all higher-level institutions had 40,477 teachers and enrolled 579,070 students.

Admission to public universities, some are tuition-free, is based solely on performance on the nationwide [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Konkour]] exam. Some alternative to the public universities is the [[Islamic Azad University]] which charges high fees.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokhi-Khajeh-Pasha, Y., Nedjat, S., Mohammadi, A., Rad, E. M., Majdzadeh, R., Monajemi, F., ... &amp; Yazdani, S. (2012). The validity of Iran’s national university entrance examination (Konkoor) for predicting medical students’ academic performance. BMC medical education, 12(1), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The syllabus of all the universities in Iran is decided by a national council as a result the difference of the quality of education among the universities is only based on the location and the quality of the students and the faculty members. Among all top universities in the country there are three universities each notable for some reasons:

The [[University of Tehran]] (founded in 1934) has 10 faculties, including a department of Islamic theology. It is the oldest (in the modern system) and biggest university in Iran. It has been the birthplace of several social and political movements.

[[Tarbiat Modares University]] (means: professor training university) also located in Tehran is the only exclusively post-graduate institute in Iran. It only offers Master's, PhD, and Postdoc programs. It is also the most comprehensive Iranian university in the sense that it is the only university under the Iranian Ministry of Science System that has a Medical School. All other Medical Schools in Iran are a separate university and governed under the Ministry of Health; for example [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] (commonly known as Medical School of Tehran University) is in fact separate from [[Tehran University]].

[[Sharif University of Technology]] also located in Tehran is nationally well known for taking in the top undergraduate Engineering and Science students; and internationally recognized for training competent under graduate students.

===Entrepreneurship===
{{See also|Economy of Iran|Banking in Iran#Venture capital|Communications in Iran#Technology start-ups|Science and technology in Iran|l2=Venture capital in Iran|l3=Technology start-ups in Iran|Iranian Business School}}

In recent decades [[Iran]] has shown an increasing interest in various [[entrepreneurship]] fields, in higher educational settings, policy making and business. Although primary and secondary school textbooks do not address entrepreneurship, several [[Higher education in Iran|universities]] including [[Tehran University]] and [[Sharif University]], offer courses on [[entrepreneurship]] to undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.iranea.com/ |title=Our Method |accessdate=2015-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916151554/http://en.iranea.com/ |archivedate=2015-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanjesh.org|title=سازمان سنجش آموزش کشور|author=|date=|website=sanjesh.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2284010|title=Entrepreneurship Education in Iranian Higher Education: The Current State and Challenges|first=saeid |last=karimi|date=|website=academia.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=دانشگاه شیراز |url=http://www.shirazu.ac.ir/index.php?page_id=4516 |website=www.shirazu.ac.ir |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamafarini.com/images/newsfiles/32.pdf |title=Launching The Venture Capital Industry in Iran |access-date=2015-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024709/http://www.hamafarini.com/images/newsfiles/32.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the [[Economy of Iran#National economic planning|third five-year development plan]], the “entrepreneurship development plan in Iranian universities”, (known as KARAD Plan) was developed, and launched in twelve universities across the country, under the supervision of [[Management and Planning Organization of Iran|Management and Planning Organization]] and the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiran.org/main/images/files/20140429102612_IranEntrepreneurshipEcosystemReport-IEA2013-v2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915104200/http://www.cgiran.org/main/images/files/20140429102612_IranEntrepreneurshipEcosystemReport-IEA2013-v2.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 September 2015|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in education==
{{See also|Women in Iran}}


In September 2012, women made up more than 60% of all universities’ student body in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Sahraei, Fariba. “Iranian University Bans on Women Causes Consternation.” BBC 21 Sept. 2012. Web. 30 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the numbers were not always this promising; this high level of achievement and involvement in high education is a recent development of the past decades. The right to a respectable education has been a major demand of the Iranian women’s movement starting in the early twentieth century. Before the 1979 revolution a limited number of women went to male-dominated schools and most traditional families did not send their girls to school because the teachers were men or the school was not Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;Esfandiari, Golnaz. “Iran: Number Of Female University Students Rising Dramatically.” 	Rferl.org. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 19 Nov. 2012. Web. 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, women’s enrolment in educational institutions began to increase. The establishment and the expansion of private universities “daneshgah-e-azad-e islami” 
also contributed to the increasing enrollment for both women and men. Under the presidency of Rafsanjani and the High council of cultural Revolution, the Women’s social and cultural council was set up and charged with studying the legal, social, and economic problems of women. The council, with the support of Islamic feminists worked to lift all restrictions on women entering any fields of study in 1993. After the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his new regime prioritized the Islamization of the Iranian education system for both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Rezai-Rashti, Goli. “Women and Education in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Repressive Policies, Unexpected Outcomes&lt;/ref&gt; When Khomeini died in 1989, under president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, many but not all restrictions on women’s education were lifted, albeit with controversy. The right to education for everyone without discrimination is explicitly guaranteed under Iran’s constitution and international documents, which Iran has accepted or to which it is a party.&lt;ref&gt;“Joint Statement on the Right to Education and Academic Freedom in Iran.” iranhrdc.org. 	n.p., May 2012. Web. 3 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that women have poor access to higher education because of certain policies and the oppression of women’s right in Iran’s strictly Islamic society. However, Iranian women do have fair access to higher education as seen by a significant increase in female enrollment and graduation rates as women university students now outnumber males, Iranian women emerge to more prominent positions in the labor force, and the presence and confidence of professional women in the public sphere. The opportunities for women education and their involvement in higher education has grown exponentially after the [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="payvand.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/03/nov/1133.html |title=Number Of Female University Students Rising Dramatically in Iran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2003-11-19 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNESCO]] world survey, Iran has the highest female to male ratio at primary level of enrollment in the world among sovereign nations, with a girl to boy ratio of 1.22 : 1.00.&lt;ref name="nationmaster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_gir_to_boy_rat_pri_lev_enr-boys-ratio-primary-level-enrolment |title=Girls to boys ratio, primary level enrolment statistics - countries compared |publisher=NationMaster |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools for Gifted Children==
The [[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] (NODET), also known as SAMPAD (سمپاد), maintains middle and high schools in Iran. These schools were shut down for a few years after the revolution, but later re-opened. Admittance is based on an entrance examination and is very competitive. Their tuition is similar to private schools but may be partially or fully waived depending on the students' financial condition.
Some [[NODET]] alumni are world-leading scientists.
Other schools are Selective Schools which are called "Nemoone Dolati".These schools are controlled by the government and have no fees.Students take this entrance exam alongside with NODET exams.

==Life and work==
{{Anthroposophy}}

Elisabeth Vreede was born in [[The Hague]] in 1879. She was her parents' second child. Her father was a lawyer and her mother devoted her time to charitable work. She was a sensitive person and later on played an important part in the Anthroposophical life in the [[Netherlands]].

Elisabeth Vreede came into contact with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] in her home growing up. She was interested early on in the starry sky, read the works of [[Camille Flammarion]] and learned French at the same time. She first went to school at the age of seven. She completed her years in primary and higher schools and afterwards took private studies for two years, so as to gain qualifications for university entrance.

At the [[University of Leyden]] she studied mathematics, astronomy, philosophy (especially [[Hegel]]) and Sanskrit. She was also actively involved in student life, founding a boatclub, and was a council member of the students' union.

Her first meeting with [[Rudolf Steiner]] took place at the Theosophical Congress in London in 1903. Her parents were theosophists and she, too, was a member of the [[Theosophical Society]]. At the congress Rudolf Steiner straightaway made a great impression on her. A year later she heard Steiner's lecture on 'Mathematics and Occultism' given at the Congress of the Federation of European Sections of the Theosophical Society at Amsterdam in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, 'Mathematics and Occultism', lecture given in Amsterdam, June 1904 [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19040621p01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The next European Congress was in 1906 when Steiner held a cycle of 18 lectures there.

After receiving her diploma in 1906, she gave instruction in mathematics at a higher girls school until 1910. From 1910, she lived in Berlin, working on her dissertation and occasionally working as a secretary for Rudolf Steiner. In April 1914 she moved to [[Dornach]] to help in the work for the first [[Goetheanum]], where she would often be found carving the wood required for the building.

M. P. van Deventer&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine (‘Maddy’) van Deventer (1888-1983)[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/YoungDoctors/YngDoc_intro.html],  author of ''Elisabeth Vreede: Ein Lebensbild'', Natura-Verlag,
1976 [http://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9783858170705/M.+P.+van+Deventer/Elisabeth+Vreede%3A+Ein+Lebensbild/]; and ''The Anthroposophical Medical Movement and the Different Stages of its Development'', translated into English by J.M. Josephson, Natura Verlag, Goetheanum, 1991 [http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Anthroposophical-Medical-Movement-Different-Stages-Development/9141006104/bd]&lt;/ref&gt; who would become Vreede's biographer first met her in the summer of 1915. She was living with her parents in a small house in [[Neu-Reinach]]. From an  elevated position there was a beautiful view over the building and over the chain of the [[Canton of Jura]], with the [[Gempen]].&lt;ref name=Deventer&gt;M.P. van,Deventer ''3/Esoteric Studies: From Mathematics to Star-Lore--Elisabeth Vreede'', Temple Lodge Publishing, 1994, {{ISBN|0-904693-64-3}}, pp. 4-11&lt;/ref&gt;

During the War years 1916/17 Elisabeth Vreede broke off from her residence in Dornach to work in Berlin as a coworker of [[Elisabeth Rotten]], caring for prisoners of war.

After the War, Rudolf Steiner developed his idea of the [[threefold social order]]. Vreede had an intense interest in this initiative and work and she was the first to bring this idea to England. Around 1918 she began to construct the library and archive at the Goetheanum, using her own means to purchase the expensive lecture transcripts as soon as they were typed from the stenogram. Occasionally friends contributed to her efforts to build an archive.

In 1920 Vreede moved to [[Arlesheim]] where she had built a small house of her own. It was the second dwelling-house for which Rudolf Steiner himself had given the model in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;See Erich Zimmer, Rudolf Steiner als Architekt von Wohn- und Zweckbauten, p.&amp;nbsp;105 ff., Verlag Freies Geistesleben, Stuttgart 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; There, in Arlesheim, [[Ita Wegman]] founded the first anthroposophical medical clinic in 1921.

In December 1923 Vreede was appointed as leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Constitution of the School of Spiritual Science: Its arrangement in Sections'' 1964, republished 2013. {{ISBN|9781855843820}}&lt;/ref&gt; She belonged to the board of directors (''Vorstand'') of the General [[Anthroposophical Society]] from December 1923 to 1935. Between September 1927 and August 1930, in her capacity as leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section,&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davidson, Foreword to ''Astronomy and Spiritual Science: The Astronomical Letters of Elizabeth Vreede'', 2007 [http://steinerbooks.org/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=179581]&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote a monthly letter, then available by subscription, about both modern astronomy and classical astrology in the light of spiritual science. The letters included explanations of the fundamentals of astronomy and discussions of astrology in the modern world, with reference to such topics as [[nutation]], [[precession of the equinoxes]], [[comet]]s, [[solar eclipse]]s and [[lunar eclipse]]s and the meaning of the Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Whitsun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellspringbookshop.co.uk/Astronomy_and_Spiritual__Elizabeth_Vreede_9780880105880.asp Book content description, Vreede ''Astronomy and Spiritual Science'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Letters in English translation were published in 2007 with the title ''Astronomy and Spiritual Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steinerbooks.org/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=179581 Publisher, 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-88010-588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9 and 11, 1930 she held two lectures in Stuttgart with the title ''The [[Bodhisattva]] Question in the History of the Anthroposophical Society'', published in English translation in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;English translation included in ''The Bodhisattva Question'' by T.H. Meyer, Elisabeth Vreede, John M. Wood (Translator), 1993, Temple Lodge Publishing, London from the German edition 1989 [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9417046-the-bodhisattva-question]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the separation within the Anthroposophical Society took place in 1935 Vreede was expelled from the ''Vorstand'' and her Section passed into other hands. This resulted after internal discussions in the Anthroposophical Society. On her exclusion from the ''Vorstand'' along with Ita Wegman, Vreede was cut off from the observatory and archives that she herself helped assemble.

The last years of her life became more lonely. She was cut off from her friends abroad by the War. The death of Ita Wegman at the beginning of March, 1943, was a great shock for her. At the internal commemoration in the clinic she spoke words at her eulogy. It was the first time she faced her former colleagues on the ''Vorstand''.

On the anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's death (30 March) she spoke to the circle of friends and co-workers in Ita Wegman's clinic at Arlesheim. They wanted to commemorate not just Rudolf Steiner but also the many who had been leading Anthroposophists but who to most were no longer known. She spoke in a devoted way of [[Edith Maryon]], and with a fine characterization of her being about Alice Sauerwein.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Sauerwein, founder of the publishing house "l'Aube". General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in France.[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=596]&lt;/ref&gt; She portrayed Count Keyserlingk&lt;ref&gt;Count Keyserlingk, author of ''Birth of a New Agriculture'', UK, Temple Lodge Publishing 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Louis Werbeck.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Werbeck, artist and anthroposophist.[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=764], author of ''Repräsentanten des Kulturverfalls'', Volume 2, Verl. Der kommende Tag, 1924 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Repr%C3%A4sentanten_des_Kulturverfalls.html?id=s5YZcgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally she told about Caroline von Heydebrand&lt;ref&gt;Caroline von Heydebrand, author of  ''Childhood'' English edition Anthroposophic Press, USA, 1995, one of the founder teachers at the first [[Waldorf school]] in Stuttgart [https://www.amazon.com/Childhood-Caroline-von-Heydebrand/dp/0880102691/ref=la_B001KIRSR4_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391729476&amp;sr=1-1][http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=350]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugen Kolisko]].

At the beginning of May she spoke once more on the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Copernicus]]. At the lecture it was noticed that only by exceptional exertion could she keep herself upright. A few days later, on 6 May, she had to take her bed. She, who had never before been ill nor depended on people, was treated at home thanks to the devoted care of Frl. Schunemann.

It was a case of septic disease. Phases of high fever with shivering fits repeatedly recurred. Nourishment could not be taken and complications supervened, like cardiac insuffiency and blood-poisoning. For her treatment Dr. Kaelin and Dr. Martin stood beside her biographer, M. P. van Deventer, with advice and help. The [[septicaemia]] spread rapidly. After a  slight improvement she went finally to Ascona, where the Casa Andrea Cristoforo clinic had been founded by Ita Wegman, and died there on 31 August 1943.

==Early life, education, and teaching==
Volokh was born "Yevhen Volodymyrovych Volokh" ({{lang-uk|Євге́н Володимирович Волох}};&lt;ref name="uclamag"&gt;{{Cite web|title=UCLA Magazine|work=The Contrarian|url=http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/year2002/summer02_05.html|accessdate=November 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Евге́ний Влади́мирович Во́лох}}) on February 29, 1968, to a Jewish family residing in [[Kiev|Kiev, Ukraine]], which was then still part of [[Soviet Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Yeah, I'm Jewish too"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/posts/2005/03/09/yeah_im_jewish_too|newspaper=Foreign Policy|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=March 9, 2005|title=Yeah, I'm Jewish too|publisher= Foreign Policy|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Eugene Volokh, Un-American Legal Conspirator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterlawyer.com/eugene-volokh-un-american-legal-conspirator|title=Interview with Eugene Volokh, Un-American Legal Conspirator|date=January 11, 2010|website=Bitter Lawyer|publisher=Bitter Lawyer|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated with his family to the United States at the age of seven. Volokh exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age, attending university level mathematics and calculus courses at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-18/local/me-6057_1_high-school-students Nancy Graham, "Professor's Gift Is Nurturing Gifted, Steering Them to UCLA"], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 18, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 10, he earned a 780 out of a possible 800 on the math portion of what is now called the [[SAT-I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002246698301700104 Julian C.

(Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY))&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 12, he began working as a [[Computer programming|computer programmer]]. He attended the [[Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcssim.org/about-our-alumni/|title=About our Alumni|work=hcssim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a junior at UCLA, he earned $480 a week as a programmer for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="time19820503"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,953474,00.html|title=Here Come the Microkids|accessdate=February 23, 2011|author1=Nash, J. Madeleine|author2=Frederic Golden|author3=Philip Faflick|date=May 3, 1982|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Volokh's achievements were featured in an episode of ''OMNI: The New Frontier'', a television series hosted by [[Peter Ustinov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videodetective.com/movie_trailer/OMNI-_THE_NEW_FRONTIER/trailer/P00528576.htm|title=Omni: The New Frontier (1989) trailer|work=Video Detective|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from UCLA at age 15 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in mathematics and [[computer science]].&lt;ref name="bruin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Fiona|title=UCLA alum goes from programmer to law professor|url=http://dailybruin.com/2014/01/28/ucla-alum-goes-from-programmer-to-law-professor/|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=Daily Bruin|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1989, Volokh entered the [[UCLA Law School]]. He graduated in 1992 with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree.&lt;ref name="bruin"/&gt; After law school, he [[law clerk|clerked]] for Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], then for Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Threats to the First Amendment – Hon.

==Politics==
Volokh is commonly described as politically conservative or libertarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckett|first1=Lois|title=Milwaukee sheriff says it's 'pitchforks and torches time' and stands by Trump|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/milwaukee-sheriff-david-clarke-pitchforks-torches-time-twitter|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=October 15, 2016|quote=Eugene Volokh, a Libertarian second amendment scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berrier|first1=Justin|title=The Volokh Conspiracy And Washington Post's Move To The Right|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/01/22/the-volokh-conspiracy-and-washington-posts-move/197694|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=Media Matters for America blog|date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, one commentator described Volokh's politics as "soft libertarian", and Volokh as an "unpredictable libertarian-leaning" writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|title=Election loss focuses attention on new conservative views|url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Brooks-Election-loss-focuses-attention-on-new-4054781.php|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=Houston Chronicle|date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Volokh supported former Tennessee Senator [[Fred Thompson]], saying Thompson had good instincts on legal issues and that he preferred Thompson's positions on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and political speech to [[John McCain|McCain]]'s sponsorship of [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|campaign finance reform]]. Volokh also liked Thompson's position in favor of [[Gun politics in the United States|individual gun ownership]].&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;[[Emily Bazelon|Bazelon, Emily]] (November 26, 2007) [http://www.slate.com/id/2177688/ On the advice of counsel], Slate.com; accessed February 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Thompson "takes federalism seriously, and he seems to have a fairly deep-seated sense that there is a real difference between state and federal power."&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;

Volokh is a supporter of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom to Marry, Freedom to Dissent: Why We Must Have Both|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/04/22/freedom_to_marry_freedom_to_dissent_why_we_must_have_both_122376.html|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Volokh's article about "The Commonplace Second Amendment",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/common.htm Law.ucla.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; was cited by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s majority opinion in the landmark [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] case of ''[[District of Columbia v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2858">'''Fatbardha Gega''' (1919-1999) was an Albanian [[pedagogist]], and one of the best-known academics of Albanian [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] thought in the second half of the twentieth century in [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;Hajrullah Koliqi:Gruaja ndër shekuj (Arsimimi dhe emancipimi i saj), Libri Shkollor, Prishtinë, 2009, fq. 376 {{ISBN|978-9951-07-716-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gega was born in [[Fier]], [[Albania]]. After finishing the Woman’s Institute Nana Mbretneshë in [[Tirana]], she studied in the Faculty of Medicine of the [[University of Florence]] in [[Italy]].

She started working as a teacher of history in 1942 at the school ''"[[Donika Kastrioti]]"'' in [[Shkodër]]. She was the director of this school and deputy director of history, [[pedagogy]] and [[psychology]] in the Tirana secondary pedagogical school ''"17 Nëntori"''. In 1965, she worked as a scientific collaborator in the Institute of Studies and School Publications, while from 1966 she was in the Directorate of Pedagogical Studies in the [[Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education.]]

==Works==
Gega left many creative works as a legacy for the fund of Albanian pedagogy. She compiled the text ''"Psychology" (for secondary pedagogical schools)'' and was co-author of the text ''"Methods of teaching – educational work in school"'' (1972). In the book ''"To forge strong characters"'' (1968), she raised her voice against pedagogical bureaucracy and offers an original treatment of modern Albanian pedagogy. She did the same in her works. ''"The school and the family, (Important factors in the civic education of children)"'', ''"Teacher – pupil relations"'' and others. New pages in didactic and historical pedagogical thought were written in her articles. Her principal work were collected and published in [[Tirana]] with title ''"For you teachers and parents"'' (2002).&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fatbardha Gega: Për ju mësues dhe prindër, KAD, Tiranë, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Gecaj:[http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/news/id_11838/Murat-Gecaj:-Fatbardha-Gega-M%C3%ABsuese-e-Popullit-dhe-edukatore-e-talentuar.html Fatbardha Gega - ''Mësuese e Popullit'' dhe edukatore e talentuar] 15.12.2009.http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/ 24.05.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentlewomen.al/2016/09/14/fatbardha-gega-to-forge-strong-characters/ Fatbardha Gega: To forge strong characters (Extracted from the book “Distinguished Albanian Women” – Edi Shukriu)], September 14, 2016, www.gentlewomen.al, Accessed 10.16.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Critical pedagogy}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
In [[composition studies]], [[feminism]] is generally focused on giving feedback while taking into account gender difference. Thus, an instructor with a [[feminist pedagogy]] is unlikely to favor an androcentric method of teaching. A feminist approach in composition "would focus on questions of difference and dominance in written language".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Flynn, Elizabeth. "Composing as a Woman." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 243–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
In the 1960s, the second wave of feminism began and one major goal was to raise society’s consciousness of the struggles of women. The goals of feminists were largely carried out in university classrooms. Specifically, in the composition classroom, Faye Spencer Moar claimed that the way writing was taught largely favored male writers.&lt;ref&gt;Moar, Faye Spencer. "Part One: Introduction." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary P Hiatt claimed that women implicitly write differently than men, and that men tended to write in the dominant, most oft taught style.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hiatt, Mary P. "The Feminine Style: Theory and Fact." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiatt argues that the terms "masculine" and "feminine" are applied to styles of writing–that of men and women, respectively–but, instead of describing the style, what is actually described is the male views on both men and women. Her examples include "strong", "rational", and "logical" for men, and "emotional", "hysterical", and "silly" for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Thus, the aim of feminism in composition studies was to create a classroom in which women perceived themselves intellectually and in which their voices were relevant in what some feminists perceive to be an androcentric world.

==Pedagogy==
[[Elizabeth Flynn]] writes that feminist theory "emphasize[s] that males and females differ in their developmental processes and in their interactions with others".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus, a feminist instructor will take into account the implicit differences between male and female writers and teach appropriately, without favoring or focusing on androcentric or gynocentric studies. [[Feminist pedagogy]] involves reading texts written by women, and taking care to understand those texts are not simply appropriations of texts written by men, without any sort of critique of androcentrism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Focus is also placed upon the reading and reviewing of student-created texts. Feminist instructors try to create a supportive classroom environment and validate student’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Jarratt 2003. 263–280"&gt;Jarratt, Susan C. "Feminism and Composition: The Case for Conflict." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 263–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Jarratt]] mentions a feminist pedagogy that advocates women writing about "personal experiences after reading women’s autobiography, history, and fiction".&lt;ref name="Jarratt 2003. 263–280"/&gt;

One style of feminist theory that is being utilized in the composition classroom is the theory of Invitational Rhetoric. Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin, &lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K,. and Cindy L. Griffin. "Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric." Communication Monographs 62.1 (1995) 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed the idea of Invitational Rhetoric as "grounded in the feminist principles of equality, imminent value and self-determination" (5). Originally this was considered a communication theory. More recently, it has grown across curriculums, including the use in English composition classrooms. As a newer philosophy in English composition, the use of invitational rhetoric is used as a way to make students feel comfortable in the classroom setting. By using Foss and Griffin’s Invitational Rhetoric theory as a guide in conducting classes, instructors are able to encourage their students to share their beliefs and learn to respect others opinions, without having to feel like opposite views are being force-fed to them in a way that would cause them to turn away from debate or discussions that could foster critical thinking. According to Foss and Griffin, Invitational Rhetoric works through the use of debate and discussion as a way to learn about various viewpoints, with the freedom to ultimately make up one’s own minds about the topic. Abby Knoblauch &lt;ref&gt;Knoblauch, A. Abby. "Disrupting Disruption: Invitational Pedagogy as." Disrupting Pedagogies in the Knowledge Society: Countering Conservative Norms with Creative Approaches:Countering Conservative Norms with Creative Approaches (2011): 122.&lt;/ref&gt;describes the use of Invitational Rhetoric as a way to make sure conservative students are not put on the offensive by more liberal teachers and their ideals. By using Invitational Rhetoric as a guide in presenting material, an instructor can in turn foster a student’s creativity and encourage them to write about what is important to them.

==Research==
Flynn researched the narratives of her first-year composition students for their disparities. She says, "The narratives of the female students are stories of interaction, of connection, or of frustrated connection. The narratives of the male students are stories of achievement, of separation, or of frustrated achievement".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Feminist research "tries to arrive at hypotheses that are free of gender loyalties," says Patricia A. Sullivan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sullivan, Patricia A. "Feminism and Methodology in Composition Studies." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 124–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] lists three characteristics of feminist research in her book ''Feminism and Methodology'' that Sullivan deems appropriate for consideration into feminist studies of composition, not just the social sciences, which is what Harding is concerned with. These characteristics are, first, using women’s experiences as an "indicator of the realist against which hypotheses are tested." Second, the research is "designed for women" and provides "social phenomena that [women] want or need." Third, it "insists that the inquirer her/himself be placed in the same critical plane as the overt subject matter" .&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Sullivan believes these three characteristics are relevant to composition studies because of the common practice to conduct research from a standpoint that is gender-neutral (neither men over women, nor vice versa), gender-inclusive (considering both male and female perspectives, processes, and styles, not just those of females), and researcher disinterestedness (the common practice of keeping one’s self out of the research process in order to allow for an unbiased analysis).

[[File:Gauri Ma.jpg|thumb|210px|Sannyasini Gauri Ma, a monastic disciple of Ramakrishna, c. 1900]]
'''Gauri Ma''' (February, 1857 – 1 March 1938), born '''Mridani''',&lt;ref&gt;Swami Mumukshananda (1997), Great Women of India, Published by Advaita Ashrama, {{ISBN|81-85301-30-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent Indian disciple of [[Ramakrishna]], companion of [[Sarada Devi]] and founder of [[Kolkata]]'s Saradeswari [[Ashram]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Sarada Devi – The Great Wonder (1984), published by Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta, {{ISBN|81-85301-57-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Gauri Ma was living at Dakshineswar, Sri Ramakrishna gave her the ochre robes of a sannyasini and made arrangements for the accompanying rituals. Sri Ramakrishna himself offered a bilva leaf into the homa fire. Prior to this, Gauri Ma had worn a sannyasini's robes as an external sign of renunciation, but she had not taken any formal vows. After this ritual, he gave her a new name Gauriananda. Sri Ramakrishna usually called her Gauri or Gauridasi, and some people called her Gaurma. But Gauri Ma was the name by which she was generally known.&lt;ref&gt;Sannyasini Gauri Mata Puri Devi, A Monastic Disciple of Sri Ramakrishna (1995,2007), By Swami Shivatatvananda, Published by Mothers Trust Mothers Place, Ganges, Michigan, {{ISBN|978-1-4257-3539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life ==
Gauri Ma was born in [[Sibpur]], [[Howrah]], India. Even as a child she possessed a strong tendency toward [[Hindu]] spirituality. By her thirteenth year, Gauri Ma had developed a distaste for marriage, telling her mother, "I shall marry only that bridegroom who is immortal," meaning she wished to marry [[Krishna]] and no other.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Mumukshananda (1997), Great Women of India, Published by Advaita Ashrama, {{ISBN|81-85301-30-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gauri Ma was young she had received from a [[yogini]] a stone image of [[Sri Krishna]]. The yogini told her, "This image of God is my all in all and is alive with Divine energy. He has fallen in love with you, so I am handing him over to you. My child, worship him. It will do good to you."&lt;ref&gt;Durga Puri Devi (1955), Gauri-ma, Published by Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Gauri Ma accepted the gift and took the image of [[Sri Krishna]] as her husband. For the rest of her life she carried the stone image with her and served him lovingly. Gauri Ma received initiation from Sri Ramakrishna at an early age in Ghola.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Chetanananda (1989), They Lived With God, Published by the Vedanta Society of St. Louis, {{ISBN|0-916356-61-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Gauri Ma left with relatives and neighbours to go on [[pilgrimage]] to [[Gangasagar]]. On the third day of her stay, she disappeared into a crowd of [[pilgrims]], disguising herself as a sadhvi to evade recognition. She began travelling by train and by foot to holy sites and [[monasteries]] throughout India. During her years of pilgrimage Gauri Ma practised severe austerities such as [[fasting]], observing silence, and long hours of [[meditation]]. She also spent a great deal of time studying the [[Hindu scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;Swami Chetanananda (1989), They Lived With God, Published by the Vedanta Society of St. Louis, {{ISBN|0-916356-61-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ramakrishna and Sarada Devi ==
Gauri Ma lived as a companion to [[Sarada Devi]], the wife of Ramakrishna, whenever she was at [[Dakshineswar]]. Gauri Ma also sometimes cooked for her Guru [[Ramakrishna]], and sang to him. Ramakrishna had a very high opinion of her, declaring, "Gauri is a perfect soul – a [[gopi]] of [[Vrindavan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Durga Puri Devi (1955), Gauri-Ma, Published by the Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; 

While Gauri Ma was living at Dakshineswar, Sri Ramakrishna gave her the ochre robes of a sannyasini and made arrangements for the accompanying rituals. Sri Ramakrishna himself offered a bilva leaf into the homa fire. Prior to this, Gauri Ma had worn a sannyasini's robes as an external sign of renunciation, but she had not taken any formal vows. After this ritual, he gave her a new name Gauriananda. Sri Ramakrishna usually called her Gauri or Gauridasi, and some people called her Gaurma. But Gauri Ma was the name by which she was generally known.&lt;ref&gt;Sannyasini Gauri Mata Puri Devi, A Monastic Disciple of Sri Ramakrishna (1995,2007), By Swami Shivatatvananda, Published by Mothers Trust Mothers Place, Ganges, Michigan, {{ISBN|978-1-4257-3539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Ramakrishna encouraged Gauri Ma to settle down from her life of pilgrimage and devote herself to working for the betterment of women in India. The women of India's plight was great, and Ramakrishna wished her to work to improve their education and development, both intellectually and spiritually. Gauri Ma protested, that she had neither the proper training nor education for such a feat. Ramakrishna replied, "I am pouring the water. You knead the clay."&lt;ref&gt;Subrata Puri Devi (1996), Durga-Ma, The Only Sannyasini Disciple of Sri Sri Sarada Devi, Published by Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Vivekananda]] echoed Ramakrishna's praise for Gauri Ma stating, "Where is Gauri Ma? We want a thousand such mothers with that noble stirring spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Vivekananda (1968), The Complete Works of Swami Vivekanada, Published by Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta, Volume IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauri Ma was gently reminded by [[Sarada Devi]], "The Master (Ramakrishna) said that your life was meant for serving women – the living goddess."&lt;ref&gt;Durga Puri Devi (1955), Gauri-Ma, Published by the Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

== [http://saradeswariashram.org/ Saradeswari Ashram] ==
In 1895, the Saradeswari [[Ashram]] was started by Gauri Ma. Residence, board and instruction were free to unmarried, married and widowed women. Village girls also came in the afternoon. After returning from his first visit to [[United States|America]], Swami Vivekananda visited the ashram and told Gauri Ma, "I have talked to the western people about you, and shall take you there and show them what the type of women India can produce."&lt;ref&gt;Gauri-Mata, Published by the Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Vivekananda wrote, "There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. Hence, in the Ramakrishna incarnation, the acceptance of woman as the Guru, hence his practising in the women's garb and attitude, hence too his preaching the Motherhood of women as the representations of the Divine Mother. Hence it is my first endeavour to start a math (convent) for women. This math shall be the origin of Gargis and Maitreyis and women of even higher attainments than these... (Letters of Vivekananda)
Please show this letter to Gauri Ma, Jogin M, etc., and through them establish a women's math. Let Gaur Ma be the President there...I shall supply all the necessary expenses for that work also." (Letter from England 1896).&lt;ref&gt;Sannyasini Gauri Mata Puri Devi, A Monastic Disciple of Sri Ramakrishna (1995,2007), By Swami Shivatatvananda, Published by Mothers Trust Mothers Place, Ganges, Michigan, {{ISBN|978-1-4257-3539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1911, the [[Ashram]] moved to [[Kolkata]]. [[Sarada Devi]] often visited the [[ashram]], serving as an inspiration to those who were living there. For thirteen years, the [[ashram]] was located in rented houses, moving four times to accommodate its growing population. After raising funds, in 1924 a three-story permanent [[ashram]] was constructed at its present location.&lt;ref&gt;Gauri-Mata, Published by the Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational ideas ==
Education, to Gauri Ma, was a national duty. She taught that if the training of women is neglected, the whole nation suffers. A mother's intelligence, love and insight nurture the child. The Saradeswari [[Ashram]], therefore, pursued programs of education that strived for the regeneration of womankind.

Gauri Ma carefully selected teachers for the [[ashram]] who lived ideal lives of simplicity and purity, of high thinking, and who dedicated themselves to the cause of women. The Saradeswari [[Ashram]] had four purposes: 1. To spread education among women according to the ideas of [[Hinduism]] and society; 2. To organise women to be workers for the Ashram; 3. To give shelter to girls and widows in indigent circumstances but belonging to respectable families; 4. To help women in their endeavour to live decent and virtuous lives.&lt;ref&gt;Gauri-Mata, Published by the Saradeswari Ashram, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Business Simulation Strategy Game,''' or "Glo-Bus," by [[McGraw-Hill]] Irwin is a [[Business simulation]] game.

It was developed in 2008 to help educate students in the field of Business Strategy. Glo-Bus is the sister game to its old brother Business Strategy Game that dates back to the early 1990s.

The strategy game focuses upon aspects such as Production design, marketing, assembly (for both entry-level and multi-featured), compensation and labor, discount bids, corporate citizenship,and finance and cash flow.

Every player makes decisions in their respective companies which is submitted before a due date in which the game "turns" one year. The next financial year shows who has met investor expectations or who is clearly the most profitable in the industry.

The five criteria which companies are ranked on are [[earnings per share]], [[credit rating]], stock price, [[return on equity]], and image rating.

The Business Strategy Game is used in many post secondary [[Bachelor of Business]] programs in North America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is usually a cornerstone assignment in a [[strategic management]] class. Those who are able to beat their entire class are crowned Industry Champions and are invited to attend the Glo-Bus Invitational (BSI). Roughly 8% of all students who play Glo-Bus become Industry Champions. Those who win the BSI (Less than half a percent of all students who have played Glo-Bus), become Grand Champions which is the highest level of accomplishment in the Business Strategy Game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Howard S. Barrows''' (March 28, 1928 – March 25, 2011) was an American physician and medical educator who was Professor Emeritus at the [[Southern Illinois University School of Medicine]] where he had previously served as Associate Dean for Educational Affairs and Chair of Medical Education.  Trained as a neurologist, Barrows is best known today for his many innovations in medical education, particularly teaching using [[Problem-Based Learning|Problem-Based Learning (PBL)]],&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Tamblyn, R.  ''Problem-Based Learning: An Approach to Medical Education.'' New York: Springer, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS.   ''How to Design a Problem-based Curriculum for the Preclinical Years.'' New York: Springer, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS.  ''The Tutorial Process.'' Springfield, IL: Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; developed while he was a professor at [[McMaster University Medical School]], assessing clinical skills using [[simulated patient]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS.  ''Simulated Patients.'' Springfield, IL: C.C. Thomas, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS.  An overview of the uses of standardized patients for teaching and evaluating clinical skills. ''Academic Medicine'' (1993); 68(6):399-405.&lt;/ref&gt; and studying clinical reasoning using stimulated recall techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Tamblyn, R.  ''Stimulated Recall:  Personalized Assessment of Clinical Reasoning.'' Springfield, IL: Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Barrows was born in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] on March 28, 1928.  He attended a community college in [[San Mateo, California]] and went on to complete a BA in Zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1949.   He attended medical school at [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|University of Southern California (USC) College of Medicine]] and completed his M.D. in 1953.   He interned at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York city and subsequently served two years at [[Parks Air Force Base]] in California as a medical officer.  Barrows returned to New York city in 1957 to complete his residency in neurology  at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.

Barrows joined the USC faculty in 1960, advancing to the rank of Professor of Neurology.  In 1971, he joined the recently founded [[McMaster Faculty of Health Sciences|Faculty of Medicine at McMaster University]] in Hamilton Ontario.  It was at McMaster where he developed the PBL curriculum. A decade later, he was recruited to serve as the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs at [[Southern Illinois University School of Medicine|Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine]] in Springfield, Illinois.  At SIU he was instrumental in establishing a [[Problem-Based Learning|PBL]] track modeled after the Problem-Based Curriculum at McMaster.  Under his direction, SIU became a center for the development of [[Problem-Based Learning|PBL]] teaching materials and faculty training. He played an instrumental role in creating the journal ''Teaching and Learning in Medicine'' and served as an associate editor for many years.  He also established the Problem-Based Learning Institute in conjunction with the local public school district to promote the use of [[Problem-Based Learning|PBL]] in secondary education.  After his retirement in 1999, Barrows and his wife Phyllis returned to Hamilton, Ontario.

Over his long and productive career, Barrows was to receive a number of awards.  He  was the first recipient of the John P. Hubbard Award from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) in 1984 and was later to receive the [[Abraham Flexner]] award from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC).

==Innovations in medical education==
Early in his career, Barrows conducted basic research on clinical reasoning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Bennett K.  An investigation of diagnostic problem solving.  ''Mathematical Biosciences'' (1972); 15:163-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Norman GR, Neufeld VR, Feightner JW.  The clinical reasoning of randomly selected physicians in general medical practice.  ''Clinical and Investigative Medicine'' (1982); 5:49-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  When he joined the Faculty of Medicine at McMaster, the undergraduate curriculum was just in the process of being designed.  Barrows argued that the teaching of medicine should be organized in a way that emulates the reasoning of a skilled practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Tamblyn R, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;    Rather than presenting information to students in a decontextualized, discipline-based way, Barrows proposed that students should be allowed to engage new information in the context of solving authentic clinical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Seiji|last2=Maskarinec|first2=Gregory G.|date=2003-12-01|title=‘Authentic’ problem-based learning, instrumental rationality, and narrative|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1444-1683.2003.00099.x/abstract|journal=Asia Pacific Family Medicine|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=226–228|doi=10.1111/j.1444-1683.2003.00099.x|issn=1447-056X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the course of exploring a problem, students in a PBL curriculum identify deficiencies in their understanding and identify their own resources for redressing these deficiencies.  This is thought to foster skills for lifelong learning.

Traditionally, the assessment of student learning in medical education has relied almost entirely on written exams.  But there would seem to be more to being a competent practitioner than could ever be assessed using a paper and pencil test.  Barrows' pioneering work on training actors to serve as [[simulated patient]]s opened the door to a new way of evaluating clinical skills.   Simulated patients could be used to test the students' interactional and problem-solving skills.&lt;ref&gt;Barrows HS, Williams RG, Moy, RH.  A comprehensive performance-based assessment of fourth-year students' clinical skills.  ''Journal of Medical Education'' (1987) 62: 805-809.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of "performance-based" assessment has now been incorporated into national licensure exams for all U.S. medical students.&lt;ref&gt;van Zanten M, Boulet JR, McKinley DW, DeChamplain A, Jobe A.  Assessing the communication and interpersonal skills of graduates of international medical schools as part of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) Exam.  ''Academic Medicine'' (2007) 82(10): S65-S68.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical resident work hours''' refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by [[medical intern]]s and residents during their [[medical residency]].

As per ACGME residents are allowed to work a max of 80hours a week. so typically residents will work 40-80  hours a week depends on speciality and rotation within the speciality ,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week.&lt;ref name=HRG&gt;[http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201116/http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.&lt;ref name="dishonesty" /&gt;

Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Defoe, Deidre M., et al. "Long Hours and Little Sleep: Work Schedules of Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology." ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'', vol. 97, no. 6, June 2001, pp. 1015–18. ''ScienceDirect'', doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01363-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 3604 first- and second-year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=DeWitt C.|last2=Daugherty|first2=Steven R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue in Residency Training: Results of a National Survey of First- and Second-Year Residents|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/27/2/217/2708402|journal=Sleep|volume=27|issue=2|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/sleep/27.2.217|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of high workloads ==
Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse.

Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US [[National Resident Matching Program#Controversy and lawsuits|have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to]], meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision.&lt;ref name="HRG"/&gt;  This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges|accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts]], thus reducing the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for residents, despite the work for much larger numbers of residents being available.

In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.

There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive.

The medical culture has also been blamed. "Generation-bashing", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork.&lt;ref name=schultz/&gt; A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt; A higher "entry barrier", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired.

There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods.

The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt;

==Effects on health==

===Effects of sleep deprivation on residents===
The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust.

Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;See Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991); {{cite journal | author = Bøggild Henrik, Knutsson Anders | year = 1999 | title = Shift Work, Risk Factors, and Cardiovascular Disease | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Health | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 85–99 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.410}}; and Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), "Shiftwork and Health," special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Yo-El S|last2=Ooms|first2=Sharon J|last3=Sutphen|first3=Courtney|last4=Macauley|first4=Shannon L.|last5=Zangrilli|first5=Margaret A.|last6=Jerome|first6=Gina|last7=Fagan|first7=Anne M.|last8=Mignot|first8=Emmanuel|last9=Zempel|first9=John M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2104/3933862|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=8|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1093/brain/awx148|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauppinen |first=Timo |year=2001 |title=The 24-Hour Society and Industrial Relations Strategies |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=European Industrial Relations Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |year=2003 |title=Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients===
The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s and affect [[Sleep deprivation#On attention and working memory|attention and working memory]].

Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. "Night float" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1| issn = 1949-8357| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 349–363| last1 = Bolster| first1 = Lauren| last2 = Rourke| first2 = Liam| title = The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review| journal = Journal of Graduate Medical Education| date = 2015| pmid = 26457139| pmc = 4597944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0014013031000085671| issn = 0014-0139| volume = 46| issue = 7| pages = 653–663| last1 = CAVALLO| first1 = ANITA| last2 = RIS| first2 = M.

Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Coggins R, Rosekind MR, Buccino KR.

A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors [[blind experiment|blinded]] to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study.&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some new doctors are working 30-hour shifts at hospitals around the U.S. |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 28, 2015 |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib19Nov2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Northwestern-led study of medical residents working 28-hour shifts decried |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 19, 2015 |last=Russell |first=John |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-northwestern-long-hours-1119-biz-20151119-story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duty hour restrictions ==
===Effects of duty hour restrictions===
Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Residents Work Long Hours Despite Rules| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2016-05-06| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/12/04/166477987/medical-residents-work-long-hours-despite-rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|problems]]. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed.

Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs.

===Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US===
The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the [[ACGME]] allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff.

One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Najma|last2=Devitt|first2=Katharine S.|last3=Keshet|first3=Itay|last4=Spicer|first4=Jonathan|last5=Imrie|first5=Kevin|last6=Feldman|first6=Liane|last7=Cools-Lartigue|first7=Jonathan|last8=Kayssi|first8=Ahmed|last9=Lipsman|first9=Nir|date=2014-06-01|title=A systematic review of the effects of resident duty hour restrictions in surgery: impact on resident wellness, training, and patient outcomes|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=259|issue=6|pages=1041–1053|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000595|issn=1528-1140|pmc=4047317|pmid=24662409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolster|first=Lauren|last2=Rourke|first2=Liam|date=2015-09-01|title=The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=7|issue=3|pages=349–363|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1|issn=1949-8357|pmc=4597944|pmid=26457139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Wang|first6=Yanli|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=975–983|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.975|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 reform===
One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Canamucio|first6=Anne|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among patients in VA hospitals in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=984–992|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.984|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Kanaka D.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jayanta|date=2007-07-17|title=Changes in hospital mortality associated with residency work-hour regulations|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=2|pages=73–80|issn=1539-3704|pmid=17548403|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 reform===
When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Srijan|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry R.|last3=Didwania|first3=Aashish K.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Ann C.|last5=Amarnath|first5=Sudha|last6=Kolars|first6=Joseph C.|last7=Dalack|first7=Gregory W.|last8=Nichols|first8=Breck|last9=Guille|first9=Constance|date=2013-04-22|title=Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=8|pages=657–662; discussion 663|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.351|issn=2168-6114|pmc=4016974|pmid=23529201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Anindita|last3=Friedman|first3=William A.|date=2011-12-01|title=Results of a national neurosurgery resident survey on duty hour regulations|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1162–1170|doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182245989|issn=1524-4040|pmid=21606883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choby|first=Beth|last2=Passmore|first2=Cindy|date=2007-06-01|title=Faculty perceptions of the ACGME resident duty hour regulations in family medicine|journal=Family Medicine|volume=39|issue=6|pages=392–398|issn=0742-3225|pmid=17549647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Megha|last2=Drolet|first2=Brian C.|last3=Tammaro|first3=Dominick|last4=Fischer|first4=Staci A.|date=2014-10-01|title=Resident duty hours: a survey of internal medicine program directors|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1349–1354|doi=10.1007/s11606-014-2912-z|issn=1525-1497|pmc=4175662|pmid=24913004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|Problems with duty hour restrictions]].

=== Problems with duty hour restrictions ===
It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours&lt;ref name=dishonesty&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Charles L.|date=2013-12-01|title=Are Duty Hour Regulations Promoting a Culture of Dishonesty Among Resident Physicians?|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=5|issue=4|pages=553–555|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-13-00220.1|issn=1949-8349|pmc=3886449|pmid=24454999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even punished if they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.169| issn = 2168-6262| volume = 148| issue = 5| pages = 427–433| last1 = Drolet| first1 = Brian C.| last2 = Sangisetty| first2 = Suma| last3 = Tracy| first3 = Thomas F.| last4 = Cioffi| first4 = William G.| title = Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations| journal = JAMA Surgery| date =2013| pmid = 23677406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, these studies – particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jena|first=Anupam B.|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2013-09-01|title=Duty hour reform in a shifting medical landscape|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1238–1240|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2439-8|issn=1525-1497|pmc=3744286|pmid=23568191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty Hours, Quality of Care, and Patient Safety: General Surgery Resident Perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1072-7515|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Stuart H.|last2=Miller|first2=Robert H.|last3=Weng|first3=Cindy|last4=Gurgel|first4=Richard K.|date=2014-10-01|title=The effect of duty hour regulation on resident surgical case volume in otolaryngology|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume=151|issue=4|pages=599–605|doi=10.1177/0194599814546111|issn=1097-6817|pmid=25135524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hundert|first=Samuel A.|last2=White|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Reilly|first3=Dominic F.|date=2015-08-01|title=Number of General Medicine Hospital Admissions Performed by Internal Medicine Residents Before and After the 2011 Duty-Hour Regulations|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=108|issue=8|pages=476–481|doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000323|issn=1541-8243|pmid=26280773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision-making and medical errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed methods of reducing workloads ==
The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilkey/&gt;

Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 ''[[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/AnnualReports/PY2012/Healthcare%20Labor%20Shortages%20and%20Potential%20Solutions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment.

===Regulations===

====EU regulation====
Junior doctors in the [[European Union]] fall under the [[European Working Time Directive]], which specifies:

* 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
* 11 hours continuous rest per day 
* one day off each week, or two days off each [[fortnight]] 
* 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours

However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours.  Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bma.org.uk/support-at-work/ewtd/ewtd-juniors&lt;/ref&gt;

====American regulation====
The issue is politically controversial in the [[United States]], where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's [[medical residency]]. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/dh-ComparisonTable2003v2011.pdf Regulation changes]&lt;/ref&gt; regulations from the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours for first, second, and third year residents.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2003rulesJAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert I, Friedmann P, Williams WT |title=New requirements for resident duty hours |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=9 |pages=1112–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12204081 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.9.1112|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011rulesNEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas J.

What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts.  While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report [https://archive.is/20121211093643/http://www.iom.edu/residenthours ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''.] While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1).  The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours.  The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance.   The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, David A., et al.

''Taylor and Francis+NEJM'', doi:10.1056/NEJMp1703690.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bilimoria KY, Chung JW, Hedges LV, et al.

Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the survey of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These residents cited "additional experience" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by "opportunity to see rare cases" (46.5%) and "continuity with patients" (31.8%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====Towards an 80-hour work week=====
The [[Libby Zion Law|Libby Zion case]], in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Nachiket|date=2014-12-30|title=Learning lessons: the Libby Zion case revisited|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=64|issue=25|pages=2802–2804|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.007|issn=1558-3597|pmid=25541134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=2006-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there."&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medial Residents' Working Hours |url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/healthcare/articles.cfm?ID=6666 |publisher=Public Citizen, Health Research Group |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="ACGMEDutyHours"/&gt;

The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require:
# An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
# A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
# A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
# No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
# One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
# In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.&lt;ref&gt;"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs."  2006.  Page 45 of 154.  [http://www.osteopathic.org/pdf/sir_postdoctrainproced.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call.
#The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours.
#The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period.
#Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.
#All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity.
#Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts.
#The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved.
#The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period.

Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection.&lt;ref name=Wilkey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert Neil|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum-Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CF8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3D2b8NT76sEuLZ0QGn8cTZBQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy.  Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce.  Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.).  Additionally, a one-size-fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties.

==Coping mechanisms== 
Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R.|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T.|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty hours, quality of care, and patient safety: general surgery resident perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77; discussion 77–79|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1879-1190|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions.

Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

[[File:BeethovenSymponyNo5.JPG|thumb|[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], music sheet released by the Mutopia Project]]
The '''Mutopia Project''' is a volunteer-run effort to create a library of [[free content]] [[sheet music]], in a way similar to [[Project Gutenberg]]'s library of public domain books.  It started in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; Portal page at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20010123221500/http://www.mutopiaproject.org/index.html Internet Archive] Retrieved January 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music is reproduced from old scores that are in the [[public domain]]. New scores are [[Music engraving#Computer music engraving|digitally typeset]] with [[LilyPond|GNU LilyPond]] and distributed in the following formats:
* [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] in both [[Letter (paper size)|letter]] and [[A4 paper#A series|A4]] paper sizes for printing,
* [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] for aural reproduction, and 
* [[LilyPond]] source code format.

Currently, there are more than 2,000 pieces of music available, more than half of which are pieces for piano. There are also many pieces for voice, and various other musical instruments. The Mutopia Project home page has a list of links to the most recently added pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5403">'''Niwot Ridge''' is an alpine ecology research station located 65&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Denver in north-central Colorado. It is on the [[Front Range]] of the southern [[Rocky Mountains]] and lies within the [[Roosevelt National Forest]].&lt;ref name=MAB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=USA+29&amp;mode=all|title=Biosphere Reserve Information: Niwot Ridge|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USFS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/data/lcms/niwot/|title=Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research Site|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niwot Ridge was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]] in 1979 and was one of 17 reserves in the United States withdrawn from the programme in June 2017.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/|title=Biosphere Reserves: Europe &amp; North America|author=UNESCO|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/23-new-sites-added-unesco-s-world-network-biosphere-reserves|title=23 new sites added to UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research Site''' was established in 1980 as a [[United States Forest Service]] experimental ecology reserve.&lt;ref name=USFS/&gt;

The site is characterized by "extensive alpine tundra, a variety of glacial landforms, glacial lakes and moraines, cirques and talus slopes, patterned ground, and permafrost", and is home to [[Arikaree Glacier]].&lt;ref name=NWT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niwot.colorado.edu/location/2nd_order_location/nwt|title=Niwot Ridge (USFS - UNESCO Biosphere Reserve)|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitats include western spruce-fir forest, lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta'') subalpine forest, alpine meadows as well as ponderosa pine (''Pinus ponderosa'') shrubland. The site is little influenced by human impact and is thus an excellent site to monitor biological, chemical, and physical responses to changes in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The site is administered cooperatively by the U.S. Forest Service and the [[University of Colorado Boulder]]'s [[Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research]] (INSTAAR) for experimental and long-term studies of alpine tundra.&lt;ref name=MAB/&gt;

A mountain research station facilitates research from atmospheric chemistry to alpine and sub-alpine ecology.

Today, the substantial increases in nitrogen deposits during the past three decades are one of the major concerns since they may alter biological processes in alpine tundra and surrounding catchment areas. Educational programmes in the biosphere reserve focus primarily on the university level, but also include high schools and the general public.&lt;ref name=MAB/&gt;

{{merge to|Open-door academic policy|date=December 2017|discuss=Talk:Open admissions}}

'''Open admissions''', or '''open enrollment''', is a type of unselective and noncompetitive [[college admissions in the United States|college admissions process in the United States]] in which the only criterion for entrance is a [[high school diploma]] or a [[General Educational Development]] (GED) certificate.&lt;ref name="petersons"&gt;[http://www.petersons.com/common/article.asp?id=979&amp;path=ug.fas.advice&amp;sponsor=1 Peterson's Guide: Glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
This form of "inclusive" admissions&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;[http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=796 Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: Undergraduate Profile Technical Details]&lt;/ref&gt; is used by many [[Public school (government funded)|public]] [[junior college]]s and [[community college]]s&lt;ref name="petersons"/&gt; and differs from the selective admission policies of most [[private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]]s and [[research universities]] in the United States, which often take into account [[standardized test]] scores as well as other academic and character-related criteria.&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;

==History==
The open admissions concept was heavily promoted in the 1960s and 1970s as a way to reduce discrimination in college admissions and to promote education of the [[underprivileged]]. The first major application was at the [[City University of New York#Open admissions and remedial education|City University of New York]] (CUNY). It later applied the policy only to two-year [[community college]]s since they are better prepared for [[remedial education]].&lt;ref name="Ref_1970"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Education: Open Admissions: American Dream or Disaster?|date=19 Oct 1970|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944161-5,00.html|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduation rates==
The graduation rates of colleges are closely tied to their admissions policies. Six years after beginning a four-year program, an average of 60% of students nationwide will have graduated. However, that rate varies from 89% at colleges that accept less than a quarter of applicants to less than 36% at those with an open admissions policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Types of Fellowships ==

After completion of an accredited [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] program in [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|Oral/Maxillofacial Surgery]], [[surgeon]]s can complete [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]]s in multiple sub specialties.  Fellowships are not limited to those with medical degrees.  There are currently no [[board certification]]s for sub specialties under AAOMS/ADA.  There are board certifications available under non-AAOMS/non-ADA boards. There are also AAOMS accredited and non-accredited fellowships by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). http://www.aaoms.org/fellowship_opportunities.php

In a [[United Kingdom]] [[universities]], an '''ordinance''' is detailed legislation that translates the broad principles of the university's charter and statutes.

All UK universities created before 1992 are established by [[Royal Charter]].  Under their charters, they are empowered to make [[Statute (university)|statutes]], but any changes to these require the approval of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].   However, the charter and statutes empower the university to create and modify ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/&lt;/ref&gt;  These constitute more detailed legislation that translates the broad principles enshrined in Charter and Statutes into practical effect.  Typically any change to ordinances will require the agreement of the governing body of the university.  Ordinances frequently require or allow the promulgation of regulations which can be approved by lesser bodies.

Because of their different history, Universities created since 1992 (the so-called "[[New Universities]]") have a different scheme of governance, and a different vocabulary to accompany it.

Some university systems influenced by the UK model, particularly in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], use the word ordinance in the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6010">The '''Reproducibility Project: Psychology''' was a collaboration of 270 contributing authors to repeat 100 published experimental and correlational psychological studies. This project was led by the [[Center for Open Science]] and its co-founder, [[Brian Nosek]], who started the project in November 2011. The results of this collaboration were published in August 2015. [[Reproducibility]] is the ability to produce a copy or duplicate, in this case it is the ability to replicate the results of the original studies. The project has illustrated the growing problem of failed reproducibility in social science. This project has started a movement that has spread through the science world with the expanded testing of the reproducibility of published works.&lt;ref name=ResearchDigest2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarrett|first1=Christian|title=This is what happened when psychologists tried to replicate 100 previously published findings|url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/|website=Research Digest|publisher=BPS Research Digest|accessdate=8 November 2016|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility Project ==
Brian Nosek of [[University of Virginia]] and colleagues sought out to replicate 100 different studies that all were published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Kristen|title=A reproducibility crisis?|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/10/share-reproducibility.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project pulled these studies from three different journals'', [[Psychological Science]]'', the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]'',  published in 2008 to see if they could get the same results as the initial findings.  In their initial publications 97 of these 100 studies claimed to have significant results. To stay as true as they could the group went through extensive measures to remain true to the original studies, to the extent of consulting the original authors. Even with all the extra steps taken to ensure the same conditions of the original 97 studies only 35 of the studies replicated (36.1%), and if they did replicate their effects were smaller than the initial studies effects. The authors emphasized that the findings reflect a problem that affects all of science not just psychology, and that there is room to improve reproducibility in psychology.

== Statistical relevance ==
Failure to replicate can be caused by a few different reasons. The first is a [[type II error]], which is when you accept the null hypothesis when it is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/type+II+error|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=24 November 2016|title=type II error}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be classified as a false negative. A [[type I error]] is the rejection of a null hypothesis even if it is true, so this is considered a false positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/type%20I%20error|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=24 November 2016|title=type I error}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Open Science ==
The [[Center for Open Science]] was founded by Brian Nosek and Jeff Spies in 2013 with a $5.25 million grant from the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Wired2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apple|first1=Sam|title=The Young Billionaire Behind the War on Bad Science|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/john-arnold-waging-war-on-bad-science/|work=Wired|date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have built a team that today has about 50 individuals on it. The goal of the group is to help increase the openness, integrity and reproducibility of scientific research. The COS which is a rather small number of individuals oversee much larger groups that are helping with the COS's mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforopenscience.org/about_mission/|title=COS {{!}} About Our Mission|last=Cohoon|first=Johanna|website=centerforopenscience.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is made up of multiple different kinds of scientists which include astronomers, biologists, chemists, computer scientists, education researchers, engineers, neuroscientists, and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforopenscience.org/about_team/|title=COS {{!}} About Our Team|last=Cohoon|first=Johanna|website=centerforopenscience.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017 the Foundation had provided an additional $10 million in funding.&lt;ref name=Wired2017/&gt;

== Outcome and importance ==
There have been multiple implications of the Reproducibility Project. People all over have started to question the legitimacy of scientific studies that have been published in esteemed journals. Journals typically only publish articles with big [[effect sizes]] that reject the null hypothesis. Leading into the huge issue of people re-doing studies that have already found to fail, but not knowing because there is no record of the failed studies, which will lead to more false positives to be published. It is unknown if any of the original study authors committed fraud in publishing their projects, but some of the authors of the original studies are part of the 270 contributors of this project.

One earlier study found that around $28 billion worth of research per year in [[Medicine|medical]] fields is non-reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165|title=PLOS Biology|work=plos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also references theoretical, political and psychological works associated with the [[feminist movement]] of the 1970s, such as [[Anne Koedt]]'s ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]''. She renounced her United States citizenship in 1995 to become German.{{r|Hite (2003)}}

==Early life, education, and career==
Hite was born '''Shirley Diana Gregory''' in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]] to Paul and Shirley Hurt Gregory. She later took the surname of her stepfather, Raymond Hite.{{r|NovelGuide.com}} She graduated from [[Seabreeze High School]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. After she received a [[masters degree]] in history from the [[University of Florida]] in 1967, she moved to [[New York City]] and enrolled at [[Columbia University]] to work toward her Ph.D. in [[social history]]. Hite says that the reason for her not completing this degree was the conservative nature of Columbia at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the 1970s, she did part of her research while at the [[National Organization for Women]]. She appeared nude in ''[[Playboy]]''{{Issue needed|date=March 2017}} while studying at Columbia University{{When|date=March 2017}} and also posed provocatively in a typewriter ad to earn money for her college fees. But when she read the ad's [[strapline]], "The typewriter is so smart she doesn't have to be," she joined a feminist protest against the very ad in which she had appeared.{{r|Courtney}}

Hite teaches at [[Nihon University]] ([[Tokyo, Japan]]), [[Chongqing University]] in China, and Maimonides University, North [[Miami Beach, Florida]], USA.{{r|Jayson}}

==Research focus==
Hite has focused on understanding how individuals regard sexual experience and the meaning it holds for them. Hite believed that the ease at which women orgasm during masturbation contradicted traditional stereotypes about female sexuality. Hite's work concluded that 70% of women do not have [[orgasm]]s through in-out, [[pelvic thrusting|thrusting]] [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] but are able to achieve orgasm easily by [[masturbation]] or other direct [[clitoris|clitoral]] stimulation.{{r|Hite (2004)}}&lt;ref&gt;Shere Hite: "I was making the point that clitoral stimulation wasn't happening during coitus. That's why women 'have difficulty having orgasms' - they don't have difficulty when they stimulate themselves.&lt;br&gt;[[Tracey Cox]]: "It's disappointing that one of Hite's main messages - that 70 per cent of women don't have orgasms through penetration - is not completely accepted today. Plenty of women don't feel comfortable admitting it, even to themselves, for fear their partners will love them less. But women are far more experimental now." {{cite news |title=Shere Hite: On Female Sexuality in the 21st Century |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=April 30, 2006 |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/shere-hite-on-female-sexuality-in-the-21st-century-475981.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Lloyd}} She, as well as [[Elisabeth Lloyd]], have criticized Masters and Johnson for uncritically incorporating cultural attitudes on sexual behavior into their research; for example, the argument that enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm should be provided by thrusting during intercourse, and the inference that the failure of this is a sign of female "[[sexual dysfunction]]."{{r|Lloyd}} While not denying that both Kinsey and Masters and Johnson have played a crucial role in sex research, Hite believes that society must understand the cultural and personal construction of sexual experience to make the research relevant to sexual behavior outside the laboratory. She offered that limiting test subjects to "normal" women who report orgasming during coitus was basing research on the faulty assumption that having an orgasm during coitus was typical, something that her own research strongly refuted.{{r|Hite (2004)}}{{page needed|date=March 2016}}

==Methodology==
Hite used an individualistic research method. Thousands of responses from anonymous questionnaires were used as a framework to develop a discourse on human responses to gender and sexuality. Her conclusions were met with methodological criticism.{{r|Jones}}{{page needed|date=March 2016}} The fact that her data are not [[random sample|probability samples]] raises concerns about whether the sample data can be generalized to relevant populations. As is common with surveys concerning sensitive subjects such as sexual behavior, the proportion of nonresponse is typically large. Thus the conclusions derived from the data may not represent the views of the population under study because of [[sampling bias]] due to nonresponse.{{r|Stark}} Hite supporters {{who|date=April 2017}} defend her methodology by saying that it is more likely to get to the truth of women's sexuality than studying women engaged in prostitution as if they were examples of women in general, or to study in laboratory conditions women who claim to orgasm during coitus {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Hite has been praised for her theoretical fruitfulness in sociological research.{{r|Ekerwald}} The suggestion of bias in some of Hite's studies is frequently used as a [[talking point]] in university courses where [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling methods]] are discussed, along with ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' poll of 1936. One discussion of sampling bias is by Philip Zimbardo,&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo (Episode 2: Understanding Research)&lt;/ref&gt; who explained that women in Hite's study were given a survey about marriage satisfaction, where 98% reported dissatisfaction, and 75% reported having had extra-marital affairs, but where only 4% of women given the survey responded. Zimbardo argued that the women who had dissatisfaction may have been more motivated to respond than women who were satisfied and that her research may just have been "science-coded journalism." Some or all of her published surveys&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Hite Report on Female Sexuality'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Hite Report on the Family: Growing Up Under Patriarchy'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; depended on wide multi-channel questionnaire distribution, opportunity for many long answers on a respondent's own schedule, enforced respondent anonymity, and response by mail rather than polling by telephone. Lohr argues that the distribution of questionnaires to women's organizations and the length of the questions and the allowance for long responses introduces a bias towards people who are not typical. She also argues that several of the questions are leading the respondent to reply in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;Sampling: Design and Analysis. Sharon L. Lohr.Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hite has no children.{{r|Courtney}} In 1985, she married German concert pianist [[:de:Friedrich Höricke|Friedrich Höricke]], who is 19 years her junior.{{r|Hewitson}} The couple divorced in 1999.{{r|Bach-cantanas.com}}
Especially [[Social conservatism in the United States|conservative groups]] in the US protested against Hite's provocative studies. She was exposed to harsh insults, physical assaults, and even murder threats. She accepted German nationality in 1996, since she regarded the German society as more tolerant and open-minded towards her work.{{r|Hite (2003)}}

[[File: Fortier 361 Timbuktu Sidi-Yabya Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Postcard published by [[François-Edmond Fortier|Edmond Fortier]] showing the mosque in 1905-1906]]
'''Sidi Yahya''' is a [[mosque]] and [[madrassa]] of [[Timbuktu]] in [[Mali]] which finished construction in 1440. Sidi Yahya along with [[Djinguereber]] and [[Sankore]] compose the "University" of Timbuktu. Sidi Yahya's mausoleum was destroyed on 2 July 2012 following the [[Battle of Gao and Timbuktu]]. The sacred legend of this holy site states that the "End of The World" main gate of Sidi Yahya mosque would not be opened until the last day (of the world), or [[end time#Islam|end times]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/02/us-mali-crisis-idUSBRE8610JQ20120702 Defiant Mali Islamists pursue wrecking of Timbuktu], [[Reuters]], 2 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sidi Yahya is named for its first [[imam]] and head professor Sidi Yahya (also called '''Sidi Yahya Tadelsi''' or '''Sidi Yahya Al Andulusi'''). The mosque is located south of the more famous Sankoré Mosque. Construction of the Sidi Yahya mosque was begun in 1400 by Sheikh [[El-Mokhtar Hamalla]] in expectation of a great holy person. It took 40 years to complete. In 1441 [[Mohamed Naddah]], the city-governor of Timbuktu, appointed his close friend Sidi Yahya as its first imam. This marked the beginning of the mosque as a madrassa and a great center of learning for the region.

==Changes==
The Sidi Yahya mosque was restored in 1577 or 1578 by '''Cadi Al Akib'''. Its original shape was altered in 1939 to reduce its appearance as a military fortress. The original [[minaret]], however, is still in place. Beneath it are the [[sepulchres]] of Sidi Yahya and Mohamed Naddah who are said to have died one week apart. The doors of the mosque were also repaired.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Notable features==
Sidi Yahya closely resembles the other famous mosques in Timbuktu (Sankore and Djinguereber). Key differences are it is not as tall and the doors are ornately made reflecting [[Morocco|Moroccan]] influence. The mosque has three rows of pillars facing north-south. The main courtyard is located in the southern part of the city and towered over by the minaret. The courtyard was converted into a cemetery that is no longer in use. The imams of the school are buried in an underground area located to the north of the mosque. Evening and morning prayers are performed there. It also contains lodgings for the mosque’s guard. A smaller, external courtyard is used as reading space during the celebration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad. Compared to other mosques of Timbuktu, this one benefits from greater care and maintenance.

==Desecration==
{{Further|Islamist destruction of Timbuktu heritage sites}}
In the summer of 2012, members of [[Ansar Dine]] broke down the doors of the mosque, which according to legend were not to be opened until the [[end times]].  They claimed that the reverence for the site was idolatrous, but offered roughly $100 US dollars to repair the mosque.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

{{morefootnotes|date=May 2016}}

A '''smart mob''' is a group whose coordination and communication abilities have been empowered by [[Information and communications technology|digital communication technologies]].&lt;ref name="HarperPalen2006"/&gt; Smart mobs are particularly known for their ability to mobilize quickly.&lt;ref name="HarperPalen2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. Harper|author2=L. Palen|author3=A. Taylor|title=The Inside Text: Social, Cultural and Design Perspectives on SMS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fdDZ66TvbgC&amp;pg=PA290|date=30 March 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3060-4|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was introduced by [[Howard Rheingold]] in his book ''[[Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Henderson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Henderson|title=Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Tla6d153uwC|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1003-5|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold defined the smart mob as follows: "Smart mobs consist of people who are able to act in concert even if they don’t know each other... because they carry devices that possess both communication and computing capabilities".&lt;ref name="Rheingold2007-12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Rheingold|title=Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0ZKQ7aCd2QC&amp;pg=PR12|date=1 March 2007|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00439-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, the "smart mob" concept was highlighted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' "Year in Ideas".&lt;ref name="NYT-Yearinideas"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Year in Ideas: Smart Mobs |last=Thompson |first=Clive |work=New York Times |date=2002-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
These technologies that empower smart mobs include the [[Internet]], [[computer-mediated communication]] such as [[Internet Relay Chat]], and [[wireless]] devices like [[mobile phone]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s. Methodologies like [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[ubiquitous computing]] are also changing the ways in which people organize and share information.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

Smart mobs sometimes are manipulated by the [[dispatcher]]s who control the 'mobbing system' (i.e., those who own the contact list and the means to forward instant messages to a group) and are induced to cause distress and aggravation to individuals who have been targeted or singled out for whatever reason.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

There is a tendency to keep the dynamics of smart mobbing 'covert', and not to discuss such incidents on the internet.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

[[Flash mob]]s are a specific form of smart mob, originally describing a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, do something unusual and pointless for a brief period of time, then quickly disperse. The difference between flash and smart mobs is primarily with regards to their duration: flash mobs disappear quickly, but smart mobs can have a more enduring presence.&lt;ref name="Henderson2009" /&gt; The term ''flash mob'' is claimed to have been inspired by "smart mob".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/flashmob.asp wordspy.com], flash mob&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart mobs have begun to have an impact in current events, as mobile phones and text messages have empowered everyone from revolutionaries in [[Malaysia]] to individuals protesting the second [[Iraq War]]. Individuals who have divergent worldviews and methods have been able to coordinate short-term.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

A 2009 entry in the ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology'' noted that the term may be "fading from public use".&lt;ref name="Henderson2009" /&gt;

==Early instances==
A forerunner to the idea can be found in the work of anarchist thinker Kropotkin, "fishermen, hunters, travelling merchants, builders, or settled craftsmen came together for a common pursuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kropotkin|first= Peter|date= |title= Mutual Aid|url= |location= Montreal|publisher= Black Rose Books |isbn= 978-0-921689-26-3|author-link= Peter Kropotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]], the first smart mobs were teenage "thumb tribes" in Tokyo and Helsinki who used [[text messaging]] on [[cell phone]]s to organize impromptu [[rave]]s or to stalk celebrities. For instance, in Tokyo, crowds of teenage fans would assemble seemingly spontaneously at subway stops where a rock musician was rumored to be headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/03/timep.smart.mobs.tm/|title=CNN.com - Day of the smart mobs - Mar.  3, 2003|last=Taylor|first=Chris|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an even earlier example is the ''[[Dîner en blanc]]'' phenomenon, which has taken place annually in [[Paris]], [[France]], since 1988, for one night around the end of June. The invited guests wear only white clothes and gather at a chosen spot, knowledge of which they have only a short time beforehand. They bring along food, drink, chairs and a table and the whole group then gathers to have a meal, after which they disperse. The event has been held each year in different places in the centre of Paris. It is not a normal cultural event because it is not advertised and only those who have received an invite attend—information on the chosen location is transferred by text message or more recently [[Twitter]]. The number of people attending has grown, in 2011, to over 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/topthemen/veranstaltungen/le-diner-blanc/index.html essen-und-trinken.de], ''Le Diner Blanc: weißes Dinner in Paris''. [&lt;gs id="a0c64f95-2c36-4271-a2a7-520486d6f119" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="80c0748f-83bb-4c1f-8f79-29d42597507e" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"&gt;in&lt;/gs&gt; German]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dîner en blanc'' would be considered a smart mob rather than a flash mob, because the event lasts for several hours.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

The [[Professional Contractors Group]] organised the first smart mob in the UK in 2000 when 700 contractors turned up at The House of Commons to lobby their MP following an email sent out a few days before. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ipse.co.uk/news/pcg-2-fighting-ir35-parliament|title=PCG 2: Fighting IR35 in Parliament|work=IPSE|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days after the U.S. presidential election of 2000, online activist [[Zack Exley]] anonymously created a website that allowed people to suggest locations for gatherings to protest for a full recount of the votes in Florida. On the first Saturday after the election, more than 100 significant protests took place—many with thousands of participants—without any traditional organizing effort. Exley wrote in December 2000 that the self-organized protests "demonstrated that a fundamental change is taking place in our national political life. It's not the Internet per se, but the emerging potential for any individual to communicate—for free and anonymously if necessary—with any other individual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherjones.com/politics/2000/12/organizing-online "Organizing Online"] ''Mother Jones'', December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]] in 2001, a group of protesters organized via text messaging gathered at the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]], the site of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 revolution]] that overthrew [[Ferdinand Marcos]], to protest the corruption of President [[Joseph Estrada]]. The protest grew quickly, and Estrada was soon removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/03/timep.smart.mobs.tm/ "Day of the smart mobs"], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bicycling events, dating back to 1992, are also sometimes compared to smart mobs, due to their self-organizing manner of assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/articles/flash_mob.shtml "Dadaist lunacy or the future of protest?"], Social Issues Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue6/issue6_nicholson.html "Flash! Mobs in the Age of Mobile Connectivity"] ''Fibreculture Journal'', issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Essentially, the smart mob is a practical implementation of [[collective intelligence]]. According to Rheingold, examples of smart mobs are the street protests organized by the [[anti-globalization movement]]. The [[Free State Project]] has been described in '[[Foreign Policy]]' as an example of potential "smart [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]".&lt;ref name="FP-smartmobrule"&gt;{{cite news |title=Smart Mob Rule |work=Foreign Policy |last=McGirk |first=James |page=92 |date=May–June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of smart mobs include:

*Smart mobs who arrange the meet up over the internet and show up at a retailer at a specific time and use their number to negotiate a discount with the retailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=7121669|title=Shop affronts|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[eBay]]  a collection of users who are empowered by the internet and eBay to buy and sell and maintainin the quality control over all transactions through the rating system. People can leave positive, negative or neutral feedback, depending on how they felt about their transaction with that seller.{{fact|date=March 2009}}
*[[Text message]]s that were sent in the [[Philippines]], which are thought to be partly responsible for the demonstration that ousted former President [[Joseph Estrada]]. Examples of such a text message read "Wear black to mourn the death of democracy", "Expect there to be rumbles" and "Go to [[EDSA Shrine|EDSA]]".{{fact|date=May 2016|Howard Rheingold=Smart Mob}}
*The [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks]] (11M), and the reaction from the people against the government in the Spanish elections of 14 March 2004.{{fact|date=May 2016|Wikipedia=2004 Madrid train bombings}}
*The [[2005 civil unrest in France]] exhibited smart mobs—the French national police spokesman, Patrick Hamon, was quoted in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as saying that youths, mainly those of the Muslim faith, in individual neighborhoods were communicating by cellphone text messages, online blogs, and/or email—arranging meetings and warning each other about police operations.{{fact|date=May 2016}}
*The [[2006 student protests in Chile]] and [[2007 Chilean government-Microsoft agreement]] are the example in [[Latin America]] about the smart mobs and the use of weblogs, Fotologs, Photoblogs, text messages and digital organization in a few hours. Also due to their online organization has called the attention of the press as a source of news because of the strong activism online.{{fact|date=May 2016}}
*On July 5, 2005, during [[U2]]'s performance of the song ''New Year's Day'' at a stadium in [[Chorzów]], [[Poland]], the audience of 70,000 waved colored articles of clothing to form a giant Polish flag of white and red: fans on the pitch waved red, those in the bleachers waved white. This behavior was coordinated by fans communicating on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1031144.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215184050/http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1031144.php |archivedate=2008-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 6, 2008, more than 500 students across Taiwan began a sit-in protest in front of the [[Executive Yuan]]. Known as the Wild Strawberry Students Movement [[Wild Strawberries Movement|野草莓學運]], this assembly was mobilised overnight with the help of an on-line Bulletin Board System (BBS). The students were equipped with mobile technology such as HSDPA (high speed download packet access) and web-cameras. They soon set up a live broadcast that aired for 24 hours a day over the internet for more than a week, and they used mobile devices to keep up to date with government reactions on the mass media. One of the main themes of the protest was for amendment of the Assembly and Parade Law that curbed freedom of expression: this demand earned support from various non-government organizations nationwide.{{fact|date=May 2016}}
*The release of the Baauer song, [[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]] is one of 2013's most recent smart mob phenomena.  The song reached 700 million views in the month of February on YouTube.  The song and dance has influences from a dance originally released in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/a-brief-history-of-the-harlem-shake-8518071.html|title=A brief history of the Harlem Shake|author=Emily Dugan, Louise Fitzgerald|date=3 March 2013|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon involves large groups of people banding together, utilizing their weak ties, and all filming a video dancing to the Harlem Shake.  On February 10, 2013, the upload rate of the "Harlem Shake" videos was 4,000 per day onto YouTube. The increasing popularity has enabled the video to become used as a political statement, such as in Egypt, where a smart mob formed to perform the dance outside the Egyptian Islamic president's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/01/17144225-how-the-harlem-shake-is-being-used-to-push-for-change-in-egypt?lite|title=How the Harlem Shake is being used to push for change in Egypt|author=World News|date=12 May 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rhinegold's characteristics of what makes a smart mob, such as a lack of centralized control and peer to peer influence, the "Harlem Shake" is the epitome of a smart mob.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demos.co.uk/files/File/networklogic15rheingold.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The comic book ''[[Global Frequency]]'', written by [[Warren Ellis]], describes a covert, non-governmental intelligence organization built around a smart mob of people that are called on to provide individual expertise in solving extraordinary crises.

[[David Brin]]'s speculative science fiction novel, ''Existence'' ({{ISBN|978-0-765-30361-5}}), similarly posits the use of on-the-fly smart mobs by credible journalists as sources of information and expertise.

The '''Treasure State Academic Information &amp; Library Services''' ('''TRAILS''') is a statewide [[consortium]] of [[Academic library|academic libraries]] including all 24 of [[Montana]]'s [[Public university|public]], [[Private university|private]], [[Tribal colleges and universities|tribal]], [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and university institutions. TRAILS services over 49,500 students, faculty, researchers, and community members and provides access to over 4,000,000 library items. The consortium is expected to provide a cost avoidance of seven million dollars over the next five years. TRAILS maximizes returns on resource investment, enhances teaching and research, improves user experience, and encourages shared expertise among members from institutions from across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trailsmt.org/|title=Treasure State Academic Information and Library Services (TRAILS)|last=|first=|date=|website=trailsmt.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In May of 2014, Dr. Kenning Arlitsch, Dean of [[Montana State University Library]] and John Greer, Head of IT and Library System Administrator at [[University of Montana]], presented a proposal of a unified [[content management system]] for Montana's academic libraries to the University's Board of Regents. The proposal passed with a 7-0 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mus.edu/board/meetings/2014/July2014cc/May_2014_BORMinutes.pdf|title=Minutes - Montana Board of Regents Montana State University - Northern|last=|first=|date=21-23 May 2014|website=Montana University System|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;That same year funding was requested from the [[Montana Legislature|Montana State Legislature]] to implement the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/montana-college-libraries-asking-legislature-for-million/article_24d4d150-7f39-11e4-a328-ebec607fe5ce.html|title=Montana college libraries asking Legislature for $1.79 million|last=Schontzler|first=Gail|date=2014-08-14|work=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;The TRAILS consortium was formed in 2016 with the aim of increasing efficiency and improving access to resources for the students, researchers, and communities of Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bate.montana.edu/news/16243/msu-library-to-share-resources-statewide|title=MSU Library to share resources statewide|last=|first=|date=2016-06-27|work=Montana State University News|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;It allows users to access many [[Academic journal|journals]], databases, and other resources that may not be available had their institutions chosen not to participate in TRAILS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AF1tQkyp2E|title=Montana University System Board of Regents: May 2018 Day One|last=|first=|date=2018-05-03|website=Montana University System Office of Commissioner of Higher Education You Tube Channel|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to sharing resources and negotiating better prices for materials, it also includes the group purchase of a [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] library services platform which further increases efficiency and resource sharing allowing users to search all 17 libraries using the system simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.montana.edu/news/17296/msu-library-part-of-statewide-consortium-designed-to-provide-better-services-save-resources|title=MSU Library part of statewide consortium designed to provide better services, save resources|last=Cantrell|first=Anne|date=2017-11-21|work=Montana State University News|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the future TRAILS hopes to initiate a statewide implementation of an [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]] program such as free online textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/local/montana-board-of-regents-prepare-for-lean-legislative-session-in/article_681c191a-99fb-557a-b0ac-121b31c2dc2d.html|title=Montana Board of Regents prepare for lean legislative session in 2019|last=Szpaller|first=Keila|date=2018-05-23|work=missoulian.com|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2017, the accrediting agency [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] lauded the [[Montana State University Library|MSU Library]] for its leadership in the TRAILS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montana.edu/accreditation/documents/Accreditation%20commendations%20and%20recommendations%20Oct%2018%202017.pdf|title=Montana State University Year Seven Comprehensive Evaluation|last=|first=|date=2017-11-18|website=Montana State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a result of this and several other successful programs and initiatives the MSU Library was named 2018 Library of the Year by the [[Montana Library Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qspnlive.com/en/406news-desk/qspnlive-edu-news/693-msu-library-named-library-of-the-year-by-montana-library-association.html|title=MSU Library named Library of the Year by Montana Library Association|last=Ricci|first=Julian|date=2018-04-16|website=QSPNLive.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;The consortium is currently made up of 24 institutions from across the state.TRAILS includes all institutions in the Montana University System (MUS), the state's seven tribal colleges, and four private colleges.

The '''Fairchild Challenge''' is an [[environmental education]] outreach program of [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden]] in [[Coral Gables]], [[Florida]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairchildchallenge.org] The Fairchild Challenge website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The Fairchild Challenge is promotes environmental awareness, scholarship and stewardship in students in grades pre-K through 12, and by extension in their families, schools and communities, through a combination of hands-on research, creativity and a variety of competitive projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairchildgarden.org/portals/0/docs/education/2013-2014%20%20fairchild%20challenge%20annual%20report-hi%20res.pdf] Fairchild Education Annual Report 2013-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Facts ==
The Fairchild Challenge is a [[multidisciplinary]], [[environmental science]] competition designed to engage [[South Florida]] students of diverse interests, abilities, talents and backgrounds to explore the natural world. In 2014, the program was recognized by the American Public Gardens Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicgardens.org] American Public Gardens Association website&lt;/ref&gt; as a benchmark for exceptional STEM education and for empowering PreK-12th grade students to become the next generation of scientists, researchers, educated voters, policy makers, and environmentally-minded citizens.

The Fairchild Challenge is supported by numerous private and public sources, as well as fundraising by the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden’s young professionals’ organization, The Fairchild Palms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairchildpalms.org] The Fairchild Palms Young Professionals Group website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The program ==
The Fairchild Challenge consists of three parallel programs for elementary, middle and high schools. Individual schools submit projects, called Challenges, which are aligned with state academic standards. In addition to the sciences, the projects cover social studies, English, art, music and vocational classes. Past challenge outcomes have included newsletters, opinion and research papers; artwork, postcards, environmental cartoons, posters and T-shirts; performing songs and skits on stage; creating and/or restoring gardens or designated habitats; conducting oral debates; preparing meals; designing solar-powered devices; and undertaking ecological initiatives such as recycling, conducting waste and energy audits, and initiating tree plantings at home, at school and in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/fairchildchallenge/collections/] The Fairchild Challenge Flickr Collections&lt;/ref&gt; Submissions are reviewed by judges, who designate points based on scoring rubrics, and top-scoring schools are recognized with Fairchild Challenge Awards at annual ceremonies at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden at the end of each school year.

== Impact ==
During the 2013-2014 school year, participants included 125,000 students from 272 K-12 schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairchildgarden.org/portals/0/docs/education/2013-2014%20%20fairchild%20challenge%20annual%20report-hi%20res.pdf] Fairchild Education Annual Report 2013-14&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding in 2002, The Fairchild Challenge has spread beyond South [[Florida]] by conducting partner site trainings for dozens of museums, zoos, botanical gardens and other institutions throughout the [[United States of America]] as well as other countries. These institutions provide their own customized Fairchild Challenge programs for their area schools based on the original South Florida model.

'''Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky''' ({{lang-rus|Васи́лий Васи́льевич Канди́нский|Vasily Vasilyevich Kandinsky}}) ({{OldStyleDate|16 December|1866|4 December}}&amp;nbsp;– 13 December 1944) was a Russian painter and art theorist.

He is credited with painting one of the first recognized purely [[abstract art|abstract]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/first-abstract-artist-and-its-not-kandinsky|title=The first abstract artist? (And it's not Kandinsky) - Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in [[Odessa]], where he graduated at [[Grekov Odessa Art school]]. He enrolled at the [[University of Moscow]], studying law and economics. Successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of [[Roman Law]]) at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]]—Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of&amp;nbsp;30.

In 1896, Kandinsky settled in [[Munich]], studying first at [[Anton Ažbe]]'s private school and then at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]]. He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I. Following the [[Russian Revolution]], Kandinsky "became an insider in the cultural administration of [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindsay |first1=Kenneth |first2=Peter |last2=Vergo |title=Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art |location=New York |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1994 |pages= |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dp59Urv9Qi4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped establish the Museum of the Culture of Painting.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Kenneth; Vergo, Peter (1994).

There, he taught at the [[Bauhaus]] school of art and architecture from 1922 until the [[Nazism|Nazis]] closed it in 1933. He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art. He died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in 1944.

Kandinsky's creation of abstract work followed a long period of development and maturation of intense thought based on his artistic experiences. He called this devotion to [[inner beauty]], fervor of spirit, and spiritual desire ''inner necessity''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}; it was a central aspect of his art.

=== Youth and inspiration (1866–1896) ===

Kandinsky was born in Moscow, the son of Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky, a tea merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kandinsk.htm |title=Wassily Kandinsky |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226040033/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kandinsk.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z76AeDVf_RkC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Lidia+Ticheeva+Kandinsky |title=Wassily Kandinsky 1866–1944: a Revolution in Painting |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04|isbn=978-3-8228-5982-7 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his great grandmothers was a [[Gantimurov family|Princess Gantimurova]], probably explaining the "slight Mongolian trait in his features".&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Harold Robsjohn-Gibbings]], ''Mona Lisa's Mustache: A Dissection of Modern Art'', A. A. Knopf (1947), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow.  He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics.  Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow. In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work.  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, "Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul".&lt;ref name="Sadler2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|others=translated by Michael T. H. Sadler (2004)|title=Concerning the Spiritual in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AV8LSrexjYC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=26 December 2012|year=1911|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4191-1377-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky was also the uncle of Russian-French philosopher [[Alexandre Kojève]] (1902-1968).

In 1896, at the age of 30, Kandinsky gave up a promising career teaching law and economics to enroll in the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Munich Academy]] where his teachers would eventually include [[Franz von Stuck]].&lt;ref name="Düchting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Düchting|first1=Hajo|title=Wassily Kandinsky, 1866-1944: A Revolution in Painting|date=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=3822859826|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not immediately granted admission, and began learning art on his own. That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:

{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognize it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing. And I noticed with surprise and confusion that the picture not only gripped me, but impressed itself ineradicably on my memory. Painting took on a fairy-tale power and splendour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsay|first=Kenneth C.|title=Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art|year=1982|publisher=G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Wassily Kandinsky}}

Kandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} He was also spiritually influenced by [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), the best-known exponent of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. Kandinsky's book ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (1910) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in ''[[Thought Forms]]'' (1901) influenced him visually.&lt;ref&gt;Sixten Ringbom, The sounding cosmos; a study in the spiritualism of Kandinsky and the genesis of abstract painting, (Abo [Finland]: Abo Akademi, 1970), pgs 89 &amp; 148a.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Artistic metamorphosis (1896–1911)}}Metamorphosis ===
In the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited [[Gabriele Münter]] to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted, and their relationship became more personal than professional.
Art school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased in the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognizable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. ''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. [[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works.  Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.

Perhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known). Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider. This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911–1914 period. In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.

From 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. In 1908 he bought a copy of ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. ''The Blue Mountain'' (1908–1909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which color is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders.

=== Blue Rider Period (1911–1914) ===
{{See also|Der Blaue Reiter}}
[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, Landscape with Factory Chimney, oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, ''Landscape with Factory Chimney'', oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]
Kandinsky's paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force. Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings "improvisations" and described more elaborate works as "compositions."

In addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of [[Western art]] stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the [[Neue Künstlervereinigung München]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele Münter]]. The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]].

[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1912 - Improvisation 27, Garden of Love II.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, ''Improvisation 27 (Garden of Love II)'', 1912, oil on canvas, 120.3 x 140.3 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]
His writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise "On the Spiritual In Art" (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.

These ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Paraskos, "English Expressionism," MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News.''&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in "The Art News," 9 March 1912, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Frederick Gore, "The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)", in "The Art News," 4 August 1910, p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several woodprints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in [[Leeds]], either in the University or the premises of the [[Leeds Arts Club]], between 1913 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Steele, "Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club 1893-1923" (Mitcham, Orage Press, 2009) 218f&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Russia (1914–1921) ===
[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1919 - In Grey.jpg|thumb|right|''In Grey'' (1919) by Kandinsky, exhibited at the 19th State Exhibition, Moscow, 1920]]
{{quote|The sun melts all of Moscow down to a single spot that, like a mad tuba, starts all of the heart and all of the soul vibrating. But no, this uniformity of red is not the most beautiful hour. It is only the final chord of a symphony that takes every colour to the zenith of life that, like the fortissimo of a great orchestra, is both compelled and allowed by Moscow to ring out.|Wassily Kandinsky&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, by Hajo Duchting, Taschen, 2007, pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1916 he met Nina Andreevskaya (1899-1980), whom he married on February 11, 1917. 

From 1918 to 1921, Kandinsky was involved in the cultural politics of Russia and collaborated in art education and museum reform. He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] in [[Moscow]] of which he was the first director. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]].

===Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922–1933) ===
In May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the "Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists".&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, “A Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists’ Groups” (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = Düchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting—particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations—as in ''Yellow – red – blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time.

The two-meter-wide ''Yellow – red – blue'' (1925)  of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checkerboards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation—not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.

Kandinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in [[Paris]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Great Synthesis (1934–1944) ===

Living in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings—forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.

This period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939 he painted his two last major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. ''Composition IX'' has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of ''Composition X'' as star fragments (or [[Solar filament|filaments]]), while enigmatic [[hieroglyph]]s with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky’s work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 38-45 (The disclosure of pictoriality)&lt;/ref&gt; He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonized and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.

== Kandinsky's conception of art ==
=== The artist as prophet ===
[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|thumb|''Composition&amp;nbsp;VII'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. According to Kandinsky, this is the most complex piece he ever painted (1913)|alt=Large, colorful abstract painting]]
Writing that "music is the ultimate teacher,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky - Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend [[Gabriele Münter]]. While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of ''Composition II''), a Nazi raid on the [[Bauhaus]] in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky's first three ''Compositions.'' They were displayed in the State-sponsored exhibit "[[Degenerate Art]]", and then destroyed (along with works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Franz Marc]] and other modern artists).

Fascinated by [[Christian eschatology]] and the perception of a coming New Age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Yakov|title=Kandinsky:   Master of the Mystic Arts|url=http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Kandinsky.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common theme among Kandinsky's first seven ''Compositions'' is the [[apocalypse]] (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the "artist as prophet" in his book, ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'', Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a fervent belief in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death–rebirth and destruction–creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world.

As he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from "an internal necessity" inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist–prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.

''Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.

[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicolored abstract painting]]
As the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorizing with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]]). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships—claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below).

Kandinsky's legendary stage design for a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s "[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]" illustrates his synaesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bauhaus|last=Fiedler|first=Jeannine|publisher=h.f.ullmann publishing GmbH|year=2013|isbn=978-3-8480-0275-7|location=Germany|pages=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 in the theater of Dessau, Wassily Kandinsky realized the stage production of "Pictures at an Exhibition". In 2015 the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director's script of Felix Klee.

During the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk. While he was out, Gabriele Münter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side. Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen. He had been liberated from attachment to an object. As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In another episode with Münter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. Münter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' ("deluge" or "flood") and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Theoretical writings on art ==
Kandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience. He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 5-11&lt;/ref&gt; This subjective experience is something that anyone can do—not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  "absolute subjectivity" or the "absolute [[phenomenological life]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Concerning the spiritual in art'' ===

Published in 1911, Kandinsky's text, ''Über das Geistige in der Kunst'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view.&lt;ref name="Pompidou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-kandinsky-mono/ENS-kandinsky-monographie.html|title=Vassily Kandinsky|website=mediation.centrepompidou.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky compares the [[spirituality|spiritual]] life of humanity to a [[pyramid]]—the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work. The point of the pyramid is those few, great artists. It is a spiritual pyramid, advancing and ascending slowly even if it sometimes appears immobile. During decadent periods, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] sinks to the bottom of the pyramid; humanity searches only for external success, ignoring spiritual forces.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Colours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy. This effect can be much deeper, however, causing a vibration of the soul or an "inner resonance"—a spiritual effect in which the colour touches the soul itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, pp. 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;

"Inner necessity" is, for Kandinsky, the principle of art and the foundation of forms and the harmony of colours. He defines it as the principle of efficient contact of the form with the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 112 et 118&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[shape|form]] is the delimitation of a surface by another one; it possesses an inner content, the effect it produces on one who looks at it attentively.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; This inner necessity is the right of the artist to unlimited freedom, but this freedom becomes licence if it is not founded on such a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Art is born from the inner necessity of the artist in an enigmatic, mystical way through which it acquires an autonomous life; it becomes an independent subject, animated by a spiritual breath.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The obvious properties we can see when we look at an isolated colour and let it act alone, on one side is the warmth or coldness of the colour tone, and on the other side is the clarity or obscurity of that tone.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Warmth is a tendency towards yellow, and coldness a tendency towards blue; yellow and blue form the first great, dynamic contrast.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow has an ''eccentric'' movement and blue a ''concentric'' movement; a yellow surface seems to move closer to us, while a blue surface seems to move away.&lt;ref name="Kandinsky, 1989, p. 143"&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow is a typically terrestrial colour, whose violence can be painful and aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Blue is a celestial colour, evoking a deep calm.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, pp. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of blue and yellow yields total immobility and calm, which is green.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 150-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarity is a tendency towards white, and obscurity is a tendency towards black. White and black form the second great contrast, which is static.&lt;ref name="Kandinsky, 1989, p. 143" /&gt; White is a deep, absolute silence, full of possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Black is nothingness without possibility, an eternal silence without hope, and corresponds with death. Any other colour resonates strongly on its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The mixing of white with black leads to gray, which possesses no active force and whose tonality is near that of green. Gray corresponds to immobility without hope; it tends to despair when it becomes dark, regaining little hope when it lightens.&lt;ref name="Kandinsky, 1989, p. 157"&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Red is a warm colour, lively and agitated; it is forceful, a movement in itself.&lt;ref name="Kandinsky, 1989, p. 157" /&gt; Mixed with black it becomes brown, a hard colour.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed with yellow, it gains in warmth and becomes orange, which imparts an irradiating movement on its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; When red is mixed with blue it moves away from man to become purple, which is a cool red.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, pp. 162-163&lt;/ref&gt; Red and green form the third great contrast, and orange and purple the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, pp. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Point and Line to Plane'' ===
[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1920 - Points.jpg|thumb|''Points'', 1920, 110.3 × 91.8 cm, [[Ohara Museum of Art]]]]
In his writings, Kandinsky analyzed the geometrical elements which make up every painting—the ''point'' and the ''line.'' He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the ''basic plane'', or BP.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', éd. Denoël, 1989, p. 45 : "Les idées que je développe ici sont le résultat d'observations et d'expériences intérieures" c'est-à-dire purement subjectives. Cela vaut également pour ''Point et ligne sur plan'' qui en est "le développement organique" (avant-propos de la première édition, éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

A point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 25-63&lt;/ref&gt;

A line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends).&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 67-71&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue. A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow. A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

A force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, pp. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt; The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square).&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square. therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143-145&lt;/ref&gt; The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist "fertilizes" and feels "breathing".&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt;

Each part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, p. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt;

This book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky’s works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care, that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul.&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd. Gallimard, 1991, Appendice, p. 185-235&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art market ===
In 2012, [[Christie's]] auctioned Kandinsky's ''Studie für Improvisation 8 (Study for Improvisation 8)'', a 1909 view of a man wielding a broadsword in a rainbow-hued village, for $23 million. The painting had been on loan to the [[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]], Switzerland, since 1960 and was sold to a European collector by the Volkart Foundation, the charitable arm of the Swiss commodities trading firm Volkart Brothers. Before this sale, the artist's last record was set in 1990 when [[Sotheby's]] sold his ''Fugue'' (1914) for $20.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (November 7, 2012), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323894704578105882889840890 Christie's Sells Monet for $43.8 Million] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2016 [[Christie's]] auctioned Kandinsky's ''Rigide et courbé (rigid and bent)'', a large 1935 abstract painting, for $23.3 million, a new record for Kandinsky.&lt;ref name="AN20161117"&gt;{{cite news|title=MONET SELLS FOR $81.4 M., A NEW RECORD, AT $246.3 M.

=== In popular culture ===
The 1990 play ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' refers to a "double-sided Kandinsky" painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/movies/film-to-fake-it-well-on-the-set-it-pays-to-be-genuine.html|title=FILM; To Fake It Well on the Set, It Pays to Be Genuine|date=16 May 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such painting is known to exist; in the [[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|1993 film version of the play]], the double-sided painting is portrayed as having Kandinsky's 1913 painting ''Black Lines'' on one side and his 1926 painting ''Several Circles'' on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Does-a-two-sided-Kandinsky-like-the-one-shown-in-the-movie-actually-exist|title=Does a two-sided Kandinsky, like the one shown in the movie actually exist? - Quora|website=www.quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 film ''[[Double Jeopardy (1999 film)|Double Jeopardy]]'' makes numerous references to Kandinsky, and a piece of his, ''Sketch'', figures prominently in the plotline. The protagonist, Elizabeth Parsons (Ashley Judd), utilizes the registry entry for the work to track down her husband under his new alias. Two variations of the almanac cover of ''Blue Rider'' are also featured in the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://paintingsinmovies.com/m/view/id/104&lt;/ref&gt;
