'''''99% Invisible''''' is an independently produced radio show created by [[Roman Mars]] that focuses on design and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; 99% Invisible |publisher=99percentinvisible.org |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212211134/http://99percentinvisible.org/about/ |archivedate=2014-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a collaborative project between San Francisco [[public radio]] station [[KALW]] and the [[American Institute of Architects]] in San Francisco. Versions of the show are distributed by [[Public Radio Exchange|PRX]] for broadcast by a number of radio stations, and as a [[podcast]] as part of the [[Radiotopia]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.prx.org/PRXRadiotopia_release_FINAL.pdf |title=PRX launches Radiotopia, new podcast network of story-driven public radio shows |publisher=Media.prx.org |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221174630/http://media.prx.org/PRXRadiotopia_release_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The show's name is taken from a quote by [[Buckminster Fuller]]: "Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designenvy.aiga.org/99-invisible-roman-mars/ |title=Design Envy · 99% Invisible: Roman Mars |publisher=Designenvy.aiga.org |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221222141/http://designenvy.aiga.org/99-invisible-roman-mars/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to expose the unseen and overlooked aspects of design, architecture, and activity in the world. Each episode generally focuses on a single topic or specific example of design, often including interviews with architects, experts, or people who have been influenced by the design.

In 2014, ''99% Invisible'' began its fourth season, the first in which it had a weekly release schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/news/kickstart-season-4-weekly/ |title=Kickstart Season 4- Weekly! &amp;#124; 99% Invisible |publisher=99percentinvisible.org |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011425/http://99percentinvisible.org/news/kickstart-season-4-weekly/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2018 staff include episode producers Avery Trufelman, Katie Mingle, Delany Hall, Emmet FitzGerald, technical producer Sharif Yousseff, administrative assistant Taryn Mazza, musical composer Sean Real, and digital director Kurt Kohlstedt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/about/the-staff/|title=About &amp;#124; 99% Invisible|last=|first=|date=2015-12-05|website=|publisher=99percentinvisible.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074107/https://99percentinvisible.org/about/the-staff/|archivedate=2018-03-10|dead-url=no|accessdate=March 9, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

'''Body image''' is a person's perception of the [[aesthetics]] or [[sexual attractiveness]] of their own body. It involves how a person sees themselves according to the standards that have been set by society. The Austrian [[neurologist]] and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Paul Schilder]] coined the phrase ''body-image'' in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Schilder1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= Schilder|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Schilder|title= The Image and Appearance of the Human Body: Studies in the Constructive Energies of the Psyche|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNWxKdWhMC&amp;pg=PA17|year= 1999|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-21081-2|orig-year= 1935|p=11 | quote = The body schema is the tri-dimensional image everyone has about himself. We may call it 'body-image'.}} This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Human society]] has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's perception of their own body may not correspond to society's standards.

The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[feminist studies]]; the media also often uses the term . Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how people view themselves in the mirror, or in their minds. It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one's own appearance, and overall attitudes towards one's height, shape, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title= What is Body Image?|publisher= National Eating Disorders Association|access-date= 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's impression of their body is also assumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.

The issues surrounding body image can be examined through body negativity and through [[body positivity]]. Negative body image consists of a disoriented view of one's shape; whereby one may often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from having low [[Self-Esteem, Self-Love|self-esteem]], sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of [[eating disorders]], isolation, and [[mental illnesses]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having a negative body-image may lead to a more serious mental illness such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]: "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their [[Body dysmorphic disorder|dysmorphic]] part on their person..."{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= May 2018}}
Positive body image on the other hand, is described as a clear true perception of one's figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual's appearance does not reflect their character or self-worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] found that a culture-wide [[sexualization]] of girls and women was contributing to increased female [[anxiety]] associated with body image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls |year= 2007 |format = PDF |publisher= American Psychological Association |url= http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian government]] [[Australian Senate committees|Senate Standing Committee]] report on the [[sexualization of children]] in the media reported similar findings associated with body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/sexualisationofchildren/report/index|title= Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media|date= June 26, 2008|publisher= Parliament of Australia |access-date= 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.&lt;ref name="tamiu"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ferguson |first= C. |author2= Winegard, B. |author3= Winegard, B.M. |title= Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal= Review of General Psychology |date= March 2011 |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi= 10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate= 2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body image can have a wide range of psychological effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people to live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many factors contribute to a person's body image; some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for [[obesity]] or [[malnutrition]], and cultural expectations (e.g., [[Media depictions of body shape|media]] and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Derenne|first= J. L.,|author2= Beresin E.

Society often constructs our behaviors and beliefs, such as personal developments, physiological and psychological interactions, and the common "perception of our bodies as a reflection of self worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livelifegetactive.com/blog/body-image-self-esteem|title=Body image, self-esteem and the influence of society|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Live Life Get Active|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.

During [[Ancient Egyptian]] times, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rehabs.com/explore/womens-body-image-and-bmi/|title=Women's Body Image and BMI: 100 Years in the US|publisher=rehabs.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards were reformed in [[Ancient Greece]], when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With the need to reflect her husband's status, the behaviors and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset cinching the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The era also introduced the [[Gibson Girl]], which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by [[Charles Gibson]], he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were also often shown in magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the Gibson Girl transformed into the [[Flapper]], which dominated the period of the "[[Roaring Twenties]]". Women transitioned towards [[Androgyny|androgynous]] looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dress senses become more casual as well, and is said to have been a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the matron like image of the women behind the alcohol [[Prohibition]] movement in the USA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/|title=A Look Back at Beauty Through History|date=2016-05-10|publisher=Science of People|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.

The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the [[hourglass figure]], through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since this era was part of the [[Hollywood Golden Age|golden age of Hollywood]], many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. [[Pin-up girls]] and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Sophia Loren]], and [[Jessica Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Should Body-Shaming Ads Be Banned |magazine=Scholastic Choices |date=November–December 2016 |url=https://choices.scholastic.com/issues/2016-17/110116/should-body-shaming-ads-be-banned.html |pages=32(3), 2–5}}&lt;!-- Was book ref lacking URL; have I got the right ref? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] and the [[Barbie|''Barbie'' doll]] during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from 1960s onwards. The "[[Swinging Sixties]]" saw a similar look to the Flapper&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the emergence of high-fashion model [[Twiggy]], who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and an adolescent but androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This eventually resulted in an increase in [[anorexia nervosa]] sufferers during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress [[Farrah Fawcett]] introduced a more toned and athletic body type.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with [[Jane Fonda]] and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Cindy Crawford]], dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater issues arose in the 1990s, when supermodel [[Kate Moss]] popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'heroin-chic' look, which dominated the [[catwalks]] during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the [[Victoria's Secret]] models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent [[thigh gap]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, positive measures are being taken to promote a better body image such as the emergence of fitness trends and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== The media ==

On account of the evolution of society today; [[text messaging]], [[e-mails]], [[social media]], and other technological advancements have dominated an individual's sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a "platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/eating-disorder/body-image-technology|title=How Technology Influences Body Image |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by ''[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'', only 4% of women thought they were beautiful,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Cindy |title=Sex, College, and Social Media: A Commonsense Guide to Navigating the Hookup Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZicxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81858-2|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dove-global-body-image-report_uk_5762a6a1e4b0681487dcc470|title=Dove's Largest Ever Body Image Report Proves The Media Needs To Up Its Game|date=2016-06-21|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]'' reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/body-image-statistics/|title=Body Image Statistics|date=2017-02-19|publisher=Statistic Brain|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Women "all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30205/1/how-should-we-tackle-fashion-s-body-image-issues|title=How should we tackle fashion's body image issues? |date=2016-03-04|publisher=Dazed|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be it [[Ageism|age]], [[Colorism|skin tone]], or [[Anti-fat bias|size]]. A large facet of "[[social currency]] for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look, social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate [[Commodification|commodity]], and used for the selling of products.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web | title = how the fashion industry affects the bodies of young women | last = Mair | first = Avril | publisher = i-D | date = November 21, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-11-16 | url = https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kybkv/how-the-fashion-industry-affects-the-bodies-of-young-women | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of many advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fueling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems are more likely to purchase their products. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|publisher=The Balance|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisements today display an image of the 'perfect' woman with an idealistic body and flawless facial features. This ideal woman creates an unrealistic image for women and puts pressure on them to live up to that certain standard. According to [[Naomi Wolf]] "our culture disempowers women by holding them prisoner to an unattainable beauty ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eating Disorders and the Role of the Media|last1=Spettigue|first1=Wendy|first2= Katherine A. |last2=Henderson|pmc=2533817|journal=The Canadian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Review|date=February 2004 |volume=13|issue=1|pp=16–19|pmid=19030149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reference various researcher's experiments in this field and the results that were found. For example, they refer to Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hargreaves|first=Duane|date=|title=Longer-term implications of responsiveness to 'thin-ideal' television: support for a cumulative hypothesis of body image disturbance?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.509/full|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=11|pages=465–477|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/erv.509|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they look at how exposure to television adverts that contain women of a thin-ideal effects the body image of the women watching them. They found that the exposure led to an increase in body dissatisfaction.

The need for body satisfaction and appearance esteem continues to increase with the abundance of [[billboards]], magazines, and conversations displaying "unrealistic images of beauty" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in the media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet''.[[Body image#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability. This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the [[mainstream media]], whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance.[[Body image#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Hence, a women's attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society's obsession with thinness.  A study was done by Rachel Cohen in 2015 to investigate if [[Facebook]] impacted the number of women experiencing body dissatisfaction, 'Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the relationship between appearance comparison and body image dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social media images, compared to conventional media images'

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a [[The Thin Ideal|damaging mentality,]] and negative habits in young, adult females.

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] are gradually rising in adolescent girls.

Actress/comedian [[Amy Schumer]] spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in [[Glamour Magazine]] as a "Plus Size Woman".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/entertainment/amy-schumer-glamour-body-shaming-feat/index.html|title=Amy Schumer to Glamour: I'm not plus-size|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the magazines publication, Schumer posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, D., Slade, P., &amp; Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions. 	Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; unattainable. "Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality" Paraskeva et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paraskeva|first=Nicole|date=|title=Consumer opinion on social policy approaches to promoting positive body image: Airbrushed media images and disclaimer labels|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=22|pages=164–175|via=sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1359105315597052|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref name="tamiu" /&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

Women are constantly exposed to the retouched bodies of celebrities, which reflect society's ideal thin body in the media. This leads to the women developing poor self-images. Women begin to see the thin ideal body, which they see constantly in the media, as the perfect body that they should aim to achieve.&lt;ref name="GrabeWard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Shelly|last2=Ward|first2=L.

=== Men ===
Males also face similar burdens in regards to attractiveness, whereby the media's depiction of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues among young men. Teenage boys in particular, are now three times more likely to suffer from [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)]], with numbers reaching 45% since 1991.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The main causes of male body issues include 25% being teased about their weight,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A factor that affects male body image on social media sites is "celebrity involvement". Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image.&lt;ref name="HoLee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Shirley S.|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund W. J.|last3=Liao|first3=Youqing|title=Social Network Sites, Friends, and Celebrities: The Roles of Social Comparison and Celebrity Involvement in Adolescents' Body Image Dissatisfaction|journal=Social Media + Society|volume=2|issue=3|year=2016|pages=205630511666421|issn=2056-3051|doi=10.1177/2056305116664216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others. Men may also suffer from the mental disorder bigorexia, also known as [[muscle dysmorphia]]. Sufferers of bigorexia tend to constantly chase their ideal muscular body. However, many sufferers never attain this ideal body due to never being fully satisfied with their physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women face expectations to be increasingly thin, endorsements featuring the muscular ideal therefore causes numerous problems for men. Granting both genders may share the idealised image of narrow waists and hips, other characteristics specific to the mesomorphic and muscular V-shaped body, include broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned six-pack abs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The "bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls."&lt;ref name="Adams2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/body-image-boys_n_5637975.html|title=It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-09-17|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential and that they should strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Adams2014" /&gt; A new term named 'Fitspiration' has even come into play over recent years. 'Fitspiration,' a term that combines "fitness" and "inspiration", is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food'.&lt;ref name="TiggemannZaccardo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiggemann|first1=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|title="Exercise to be fit, not skinny": The effect of fitspiration imagery on women's body image|journal=Body Image|volume=15|year=2015|pages=61–67|issn=1740-1445|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular slogan of 'Fitspiration' photos is "Strong is the New Skinny", an expression that encourages people to not be afraid of getting strong and working out.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title='Strong is the new skinny': A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|page=135910531663943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of a desire to achieve a good body and healthy lifestyle has increased in the last decade due to fitness accounts of Facebook and [[Instagram]]. Although 'Fitspiration' accounts and pictures have the intention of motivating people to pursue healthy lifestyles, they oftentimes contain objectifying elements or only show a certain body type, which can negatively affect many women's body images. For instance, 'Fitspiration' images tend to focus on specific poses or features of a woman such as washboard abs, which in turn objectifies the person.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"/&gt;

Regardless of the lower number of products targeting males, negative messages can be communicated through fitness websites, video games, pop culture, movies, and other types of media as well. Based on a report by the Picture of Health, 53% of boys cited advertisements as a "major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/News/Ads_add_to_boys_bodyimage_pressure/37212|title=Ads add to boys' body-image pressure |publisher=WARC |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% cited it was healthy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

With rising pressures to achieve a muscular physique, many teenage boys thus participate in extreme workouts and weight trainings for long periods of the day. Some eventually abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 31% have admitted to [[Purging disorder|purging]] or [[binge eating]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== The fashion industry ==
The [[fashion industry]] is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41174739|title=Dior and Gucci ban super-skinny models|date=2017-09-06|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% "felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny",&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teens, Social Media And Body Image|last=Gallivan|first=H|publisher=Park Nicollet Melrose Cente|year=2014|isbn=|location=MN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; while 46% will strive to achieve it.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing "the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/anorexia/underweight-models-french-fashion-brands|title=French Fashion Brands Are Refusing to Hire Models Under Size 2. Here's Why That's So Important|publisher=Health.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.

The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice. [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'' magazine]] in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances, leading to 69% of girls stating it influenced their ideal body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/articles/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/|title=Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising |publisher=HealthyPlace|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infographiclist.com/2012/05/18/body-culture-how-media-shapes-our-thoughts-and-ideas-about-beauty-eating-and-image-infographic/|title=Body Culture: How Media Shapes Our Thoughts and Ideas About Beauty, Eating and Image [INFOGRAPHIC]|date=2012-05-18|publisher=Infographic List|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high number of publications featuring articles promoting unhealthy weight loss, the ''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' reported an astounding 90% of teenage girls voiced the need to change their appearances,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title=What is Body Image?|publisher=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 81% of 10 year olds were already afraid of being fat.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As a result, many argue that fashion and media's powerful role on body image and self-perception, will spiral into eating disorders, According to a survey by the ''[[Manchester Metropolitan University]]'', "self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it"&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;'''.'''

According to ''Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence'' report, "a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including 'real' women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, "body [[fascism]] is [still] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.

Less is usually known about the pressures models in the industry face, but striving hard to meet the requirements of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/02/fashion-week-brings-questions-about-body-image-front-and-center/|title=Fashion Week brings questions about body image front and center|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Another 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) level. A study published in the [[International Journal of Eating Disorders]], discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; which qualifies for anorexia.

In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was ecorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; [[Luisel Ramos]], and [[Ana Carolina Reston]]. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, a high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, [[Fasting|fasts]], and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
{{See|Body image law}}

With the aim of protecting models and projecting a healthier body image, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Israel]], passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer Rayne|date=2013-05-22|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models,&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and the need for a medical certificate to verify their health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/france-laws-thin-models-retouched-photographs|title=Digital fakery? My dear, that is just so last year |last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=2017-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; ''[[Kering]]'' and ''[[LVMH]]'', recently "announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This Isn't the Answer to Fashion's Body-Image Issues|publisher=Racked|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to "send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lvmh-kering-pledge_uk_59b0f9d7e4b0354e440f56c9|title=Will French Fashion Brands' Ban On Size Zero And Underage Models Really Make A Difference?|date=2017-09-07|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributable to the level of interest in women who do not match the proportions of average models, [[plus-size model]]s are slowly emerging in the mainstream media. With several utilising their positions to promote body positivity, their continued presence in the industry, undoubtedly reign beneficial to the health of other models and customers. Health reporter Philippa of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29569473|title=Does social media impact on body image?|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2014-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[BBC News]] discusses how the introduction of more diversity upon body images can be a helpful factor into improving self-confidence for all body types. Prominent names include [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]]; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer ''[[Lane Bryant]]'', and [[Iskra Lawrence]]; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer ''[[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]''. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]].&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Real Women Have Curves |last=Bazilian |first=Emma |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=April 25, 2016 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA451229452&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=d7d9761b9b364c6d5dbff6ac2a615991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=Article says attention was national not worldwide}}

Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used ''Instagram'' as a tool to "encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the ''#DearNYFW'' campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/started-breaking-ribs-fashion-week-models-hit-back-against-pressure/|title='I started breaking my ribs': Fashion week models hit back against the pressure to lose weight|last=Rahim|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start "prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway".&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer [[Tarik Carroll]] released a photo series titled the ''EveryMAN Project''. The project showcased large-framed [[queer]] and [[transgender men]] of color, with the purpose of "challenging [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] and [[gender norms]], while bringing body-positivity to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fashion-photographer-promotes-acceptance-everyman-n783881|title=Fashion photographer promotes acceptance of "EveryMAN"|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry on the other hand, has given rise to the ''#PlusIsEqual'' movement. There was often a misconception by retailers that full-figured women{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} were not interested in purchasing trendy styles. However, high-street brands such as [[Forever 21]], and [[ASOS.com|ASOS]], have increased product offerings to include plus-size options for their customers.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/marketing/loud-proud-social-media-pushed-retail-body-positive/|title='Loud and proud': How social media pushed retail to be more body-positive - Digiday|date=2016-02-25|publisher=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other brands include, ''[[Victoria Beckham]]'' who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL in the upcoming months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/the-beauty-curve-here-s-how-the-fashion-industry-embraced-plus-sizes/story-A3zwYFeeZIMAsTs1vQWEpK.html|title=The beauty curve: Here's how the fashion industry is embracing plus sized clothes|date=2017-07-12|work=Hindustan Times |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'' who expanded their plus size collection to cater for sizes 1X to 3X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nike-plus-size-range-xl-xxxl-body-positive-sportswear-clothing-a7609341.html|title=Nike has finally launched its first plus size range|date=2017-03-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the criticisms surrounding the term plus-size causing unnecessary labeling, ''[[Kmart]]'' therefore replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, "lovely" and "fabulous" instead.&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nosizefitsall-the-rise-of-body-positive-fashion.html|title=#NoSizeFitsAll: The rise of body-positive fashion|publisher=Cafe Babel|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesting against photo retouching is another important aspect towards body positivity, with the most famous example being Aerie's ''ArieReal'' campaign. Since 2014, the movement promised to display "campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Other brands such as ''Neon Moon'', which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of "diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool".&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll" /&gt; U.S. e-tailer ''[[ModCloth]]'' on the other hand, explored other methods including, employing their staff as models for the swimwear collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/style/modcloth-proves-we-all-have-swimsuit-bodies-new-body-positive-t90081|title='We all have swimsuit bodies': See Modcloth's empowering new campaign|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=Today |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
In the past, exposure to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, the accessibility of the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which "force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before".&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://verilymag.com/2017/03/body-image-beauty-standards-media|title=Here's How Body Image Issues Can Affect You (Even if You Don't Have an Eating Disorder)|publisher=Verily|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, is the creation of [[social media]]. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; "sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, "the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment."&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2017-Media-Releases/The-beauty-myth-puts-big-users-of-social-at-risk-of-low-self-esteem-media/|title=The beauty myth puts big users of social media at risk of low self-esteem |publisher=University of South Austalia |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also "encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2016, psychologists confirmed the relationship between social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged the effect of the "social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image";&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107683/female-body-image-statistics-2016|title=This Is How Women Actually Feel About Their Bodies|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another study by the ''[[University of South Australia]]'', discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Applications such as ''Instagram'' have become a "body-image battleground",&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; while the "selfie" is now the universal lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; ''Facebook'' and ''[[Snapchat]]'' also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by ''[[Common Sense Media|Common Sense]]'' reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if it did not receive the amount of attention they hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image |author=Caroline Knorr |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos in order to meet the media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the ''[[Renfrew Center Foundation]]'', 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/friends-pictures-on-social-media-biggest-impact-body-image|title=Friends' pictures on social media have biggest impact on body image|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=2017-03-05|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-11-01 |issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.

With the growth of the wellness industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of [[Fitness culture|fitness]] influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these [[bloggers]] and companies have received numerous criticism because the "drive for 'wellness' and 'clean eating' has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/|title=How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror|work=Time|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by "fitspiration" websites are sometimes identical to the "thinspiration" or pro-anorexia types.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jm5nvp/ruby-tandoh-eat-clean-wellness|title=The Unhealthy Truth Behind 'Wellness' and 'Clean Eating'|date=2016-05-13|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident through "language inducing [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about weight or the body, and promoted dieting".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause "increasingly [[disordered eating]]",&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as [[Orthorexia nervosa|Orthorexia]]; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
As an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called ''Be Real,'' after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://academytoday.co.uk/Article/almost-a-third-of-11-16-year-olds-have-body-image-anxiety|title=Almost a third of 11-16 year-olds have body image anxiety|publisher=Academy Today|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual's body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial.

Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed as a tool to share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular [[hashtag]]s and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.

In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as ''Instagram'', have banned the use of '''thinspiration''' and '''thinspo''' related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of hashtags such as ''#SelfLove'' and ''#BodyPositivity''&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.self.com/story/side-by-side-photos|title=20 Side-by-Side Photos That Show How Misleading Social Media Can Be|last=Lanquist|first=Lindsey|work=Self |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual's fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to "serve as inspiration for people looking to change themselves physically or live healthier lives",&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, ''[[Eating Disorder Hope]]'' launched the ''Pro-Recovery'' ''Movement''. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/positive-uses-social-media-body-image-advocacy|title=Positive Uses of Social Media in Body Image Advocacy |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations such as [[Project HEAL|ProjectHEAL]], introduced a campaign called ''#WhatMakesMeBeautiful'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clementine-desseaux/what-makes-me-beautiful-heal-project_b_9287398.html|title=#WhatMakesMeBeautiful Campaign With Heal Project|date=2016-02-22|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the "need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens".&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;
[[Celebrity culture]] is known as one of the main influences on body image for this generation. Studies in this area have been carried out with the majority proving that viewing media images affects participants abilities to correctly estimate the size and parts of their own bodies. We are subjected to [[PhotoShop|photoshop]] so often when they were shown a range of photos of famous celebrities the women with body dissatisfaction consistently choose the photos of the celebrity being photoshopped to look skinnier than the original.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="KingTouyz2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Natalie|last2=Touyz|first2=Stephen|last3=Charles|first3=Margaret|title=The effect of body dissatisfaction on women's perceptions of female celebrities|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=27|issue=3|year=2000|pages=341–347|issn=0276-3478|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(200004)27:3&lt;341::AID-EAT12&gt;3.0.CO;2-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

Body image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in girls can have many negative effects, including an increased rate of [[smoking]] and a decrease in comfort with [[sexuality]] when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.{{efn|An increase in women's weight dissatisfaction is found when women see idealized images of women viewed as passive sexual objects or angelic sexual subjects.{{cite journal|last1=Halliwell|first1=Emma|last2=Malson|first2=Helen|last3=Tischner|first3=Irmgard|title=Are Contemporary Media Images Which Seem to Display Women as Sexually Empowered Actually Harmful to Women?|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=35|issue=1|year=2011|pages=38–45|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1177/0361684310385217}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Healthy body image: tips for guiding girls.|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|publisher=MayoClinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monteath and McCabe found that 44% of women express negative feelings about both individual body parts and their bodies as a whole.&lt;ref name="MonteathMcCabe1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monteath|first1=Sheryl A.|last2=McCabe|first2=Marita P.|title=The Influence of Societal Factors on Female Body Image|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=137|issue=6|year=1997|pages=708–727|issn=0022-4545|doi=10.1080/00224549709595493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine, ''[[Psychology Today]]'' found that 56% of the women and about 40% of the men who responded to their survey in 1997 were dissatisfied with their overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-19970201-000023&amp;page=2 Psychology Today: Body Image Poll Results] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130104095000/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-19970201-000023&amp;page=2 |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American youth (37.7% of males and 51% of females) express dissatisfaction with their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al Sabbah|first1=Haleama|last2=Vereecken|first2=Carine A |last3=Elgar|first3= Frank J |last4=Nansel|first4= Tonja |last5=Aasvee|first5= Katrin |last6=Abdeen|first6=Ziad |last7=Ojala|first7= Kristiina |last8=Ahluwalia|first8=Namanjeet |last9= Maes|first9= Lea |displayauthors=3 |title=Body weight dissatisfaction and communication with parents among adolescents in 24 countries: international cross-sectional survey|journal=BMC Public Health|date=January 1, 2009|volume=9|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-9-52 |pmid=19200369 |pmc=2645388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a [[Dieting|diet]] or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become a very common thing to not only teenage girls but even younger children as well. The [[National Eating Disorders Association]] has found out that 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls actually feel better about themselves when they are on a diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nault|first=Kelly|title=How the Media Affects Teen Girls|url=http://www.insteadoftv.com/how-the-media-affects-teen-girls.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 40 "instruments" used to measure body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=J. K.|last2=Altabe|first2=M.|last3=Johnson|first3=S.|last4=Stormer|first4=S.

Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it makes it difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, [[ethnicity]], culture, and age.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullari|first=S.,|author2=Vosburgh, M.|author3=Shotwell, A.|author4=Inzodda, J.|author5=Davenport, W.|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided measurement technique.|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2002|issue=4(2)|pages=221–232|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2002-17480-006&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figure preferences ===

In figure preferences the use of silhouettes is the most commonly used method. [[Silhouette]]s can be defined by a figures shape or dark outline upon a lighter background. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are not realistic looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"/&gt; Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=1d539162-5f98-4f55-bcb2-3670ba57a382@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided meas...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Photoshop to fit their personal preference upon their body image, altering body tones, shape or size.

=== Video projection techniques ===

In one study participants were shown a series of images flashing before them; each image was a picture of them but either increased weight or decreased weight. They were measured in self-report by responding to the pictures. Also they were measured by startle-based measures and testing their eyeblink response. "The startle response is a complex set of physiological changes that occur in response to unexpected and intense stimulus."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grillon|first=Christian|last2=Baas|first2=Johanna|date=2003-09-01|title=A review of the modulation of the startle reflex by affective states and its application in psychiatry|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=114|issue=9|pages=1557–1579|issn=1388-2457|pmid=12948786|doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(03)00202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements can be useful because "Objective, [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spresser|first=C.

=== Questionnaires ===

Questionnaires are another very commonly used method of measurement. One example of a questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, [[muscle tone]], height, and weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giovannelli|first=Thorayya Said|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Henson|first3=James M.|last4=Engle|first4=Erin K.|date=2008-06-01|title=The measurement of body-image dissatisfaction-satisfaction: is rating importance important?|journal=Body Image|volume=5|issue=2|pages=216–223|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.01.001|issn=1873-6807|pmid=18463010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can have confounding variable though. For instance, "Acquiescent response style (ARS), or the tendency to agree with items on a survey, is more common among individuals from Asian and African cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|first=M.,|author2=Skouteris, H.|author3=McCabe, M.|author4=Mussap, A.|author5=Mellor, D.|author6=Ricciardelli, L.|title=An evaluation of equivalence in body dissatisfaction measurement across cultures.|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|year=2012| issue=94(4)|pages=410–417| doi=10.1080/00223891.2012.662186|volume=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Chuansheng|last2=Lee|first2=Shin-ying|last3=Stevenson|first3=Harold W.|date=1995-05-01|title=Response Style and Cross-Cultural Comparisons of Rating Scales Among East Asian and North American Students|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/6/3/170|journal=Psychological Science|volume=6|issue=3|pages=170–175|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00327.x|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sara Dolnicar|last2=Bettina Grün|date=2007-04-24|title=Cross-cultural differences in survey response patterns|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/02651330710741785|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=24|issue=2|pages=127–143|doi=10.1108/02651330710741785|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamamura|first=Takeshi|last2=Heine|first2=Steven J.|last3=Paulhus|first3=Delroy L.|date=2008-03-01|title=Cultural differences in response styles: The role of dialectical thinking|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886907003820|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=44|issue=4|pages=932–942|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.10.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==

Gender differences related to body image are increasingly prevalent between men and women. Although dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body image perceptions: Do gender differences exist? | journal = Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research | year = 2010 | first = Maggie A. | last = Brennan |author2=Christopher E.

[[Adolescence]] is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=David|author2=Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|author3=Marita P.

Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of [[Human Physiology|human physiology]]. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced as far back as the Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sideris |first=A.|url=https://www.academia.edu/481380/The_Athletic_Body_Image_and_Power=|title=The Athletic Body: Image and Power|journal=Imeros|volume=5|issue=1|year= 2005|pages= 287–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men with lower, more feminine, [[Waist–hip ratio]] (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pazhoohi| first1=Farid| last2=Hosseinchari|first2=M.|last3=Doyle|first3=J.

In general, research shows that body image in regards to appearance becomes less of a [[Psychological stress|stress]] for women as they age. Studies show a decline in dissatisfaction of body image in college-aged women as they progress from the first semester of college to subsequent semesters. Their appearance rating of themselves tends to increase, while males' do not significantly change and often become worse. This suggests that the early years of [[college]] serve as a period for body image development, which can later affect the mental and physical well being of an individual.&lt;ref name='PsycInfo 2011-30272-014'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender and racial/ethnic differences in body image development among college students | journal = Body Image | date = January 2012 | first = Meghan M. | last = Gillen |author2=Eva S.

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning.  Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2011-30272-014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body dissatisfaction and perceived sociocultural pressures | journal = Salud Mental | date = February 21, 2010 | first = Igor | last = Esnaola |author2=Arantzazu Rodríguez|author3=Alfredo Goñi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9| id =  | type =  PDF | accessdate = 2012-06-26 |url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v33n1/v33n1a3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical appearance remains important later in life, but the functional aspects of the body take precedence over contentment with appearance.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"/&gt; Women are reported to benefit from the [[Ageing|ageing process]], becoming more satisfied with their images, while men begin to develop more insecurities and issues.  Women reach a certain stage where they are no longer subject to the social pressures that heavily emphasize the importance of appearance.  Men from the same studies are reported as becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their physical appearance as they age. Men are also less likely to implement appearance-enhancing activities into their daily lives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The older women become the more satisfied with their body image they are likely to become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2009-11492-005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Lucie|author2=Eyal Gringart|date=August 2009|title=Body image and self-esteem in older adulthood|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|type=PDF|volume=29|issue=6|pages=977–95|doi=10.1017/S0144686X09008721|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older men become, the more dissatisfied they are likely to become due to increased physical and perceived incompetency.

Adrienne Adams and Eaaron Henderson-king claim that the rates of cosmetic surgery have increased in recent years. It has been proven that the majority of people that undergo cosmetic surgery is a highly gendered activity. However, rates are increasing for men. it is predominantly women who spend more time attending to their to their bodies. Cosmetic surgery was initially developed largely in response to the reconstructive needs of wounded soldiers, but it is now primarily used in a much more feminine way to improve people's physical appearance and attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance messages AND Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weight ==

{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight. Kashubeck-West ''et al.'' reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashubeck-West S, Mintz LB, Weigold I |title=Separating the Effects of Gender and Weight-Loss Desire on Body Satisfaction and Disordered Eating Behavior |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=7–8, |pages=505–518 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7138-4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y07h74u11ug0x245/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] reported that "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991 /&gt; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As [[Charisse Goodman]] put it in her article, "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: "Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body size was larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Martin Brett A.

Many, like journalist [[Marisa Meltzer]], have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: "Never before has the 'perfect' body been at such odds with our true size."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |authorlink=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty are Used Against Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgfokiNQl0sC|year=1991|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-986190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Marisa.

However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

Research by [[The Lancet Psychiatry|The Lancent Psychiatry]] discusses the relationship between mass media and eating disorders stating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Emilio|last2=Carrera|first2=Olaia|date=February 2016|title=Anorexia nervosa and body-image disturbance|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00581-7/fulltext|journal=The Lancet Psychiatry|language=English|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e9–e10|doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00581-7|issn=2215-0366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Body-image disturbance and weight and shape concerns are the result of an acculturation process spread through the therapeutic milieu and the mass media." The struggles caused by body imaging have led to the increase of Anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that results in significant weight loss due to a persons own distorted body image. Its increasing rate shows the correlation between the effects body imaging through social media has on people especially upon women and how it effects the measures of weight loss.

Post-1997 studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Obesity Statistics: U.S. Obesity Trends|url = http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|publisher = North American Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate = 2008-03-08|year = 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206185213/http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|archivedate = 2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their body but are not.

In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's ''positive'' effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an "[[obesity epidemic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics Related to Overweight and Obesity|url = http://www.win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|year = 2006|accessdate = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mxm007v1|title = The obesity epidemic in the United States—gender, age, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic characteristics: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis|last1 = Wang|first1 = Youfa|last2 = Beydoun|first2 = May A|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|year = 2007 |doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm007|pmid = 17510091|volume = 29|pages = 6–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be even more severe than they already are.&lt;ref name="ThompsonHeinberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

[[Miss Representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis. (January 1, 2014). Retrieved May 5, 2014, from http://film.missrepresentation.org/synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], exploring and displaying the role that mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting the lives of people from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.

The 2007 documentary [[America the Beautiful (film)|America the Beautiful]] explores how the fashion and beauty industries are contributing to the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses a wide range of topics like [[plastic surgery]], dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young [[Middle school|middle-school]] aged girls were portrayed in the beginning of the film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/america-the-beautiful-a-problem-of-self-image/82590/|title='America the Beautiful': A Problem of Self-Image|last=Snyder|first=S.

In a study performed by Leslie J. Heinberg of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], and J.

In a study done at [[Old Dominion University]], Thomas F. Cash, [[Julie Ancis|Julie R. Ancis]] and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist identity and body image. "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image [[dysphoria]] in women's daily lives."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Ancis | first2 = J.

Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]], body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.

In the same study from [[Arizona State University]], it was said that the idea of beauty is generated from these media messages. "Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women."&lt;ref name="Rubin, L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = L | year = 2004 | title = Exploring Feminist Women's Body Consciousness | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study from Old Dominion University, the authors state the importance of research in this area. "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and sub clinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; Even though there is research being done, there is still much more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.

The link between body image and eating disorders is becoming increasingly prominent in the younger generations as the growth of social media and social influencers inhibits their perspective on their own bodies.&lt;ref name="NaeimiHaghighian2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeimi|first1=Alireza Farsad|last2=Haghighian|first2=Hossein Khadem|last3=Gargari|first3=Bahram Pourghassem |last4=Alizadeh|first4=Mohammad|last5=Rouzitalab|first5=Tohid|title=Eating disorders risk and its relation to self-esteem and body image in Iranian university students of medical sciences|journal=Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity|volume=21|issue=4|year=2016|pages=597–605|issn=1124-4909|doi=10.1007/s40519-016-0283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race ==
Perceptions of races have drastically changed over the years dating all the way back to the [[medieval era]] referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which left ideas of idealism for [[White people|Caucasians]] and a negative idea of any other race. [[White nationalism|Caucasian nationalists]] such as Goldstein also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/graywhite1e/#t_823553____|title=Freedom on my mind: A history of African Americans|last=Bay|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins |year=2013|last1=|first1=Mia|accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference.

Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.

The [[fashion industry]] is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214658/http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-12-10|title = The Beauty Ideal: The Effects of European Standards of Beauty on Black Women|last = Bryant|first = Susan L|date = n.d.|journal = Columbia Social Work Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive [[white people|white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students.

[[Weight loss]] is one such method. For instance, [[Mexican American]] women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the [[White normalcy|white norm]]. In spite of the fact that certain ethnicities naturally have different body types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/race-is-part-of-the-body-image-conversation-so-why-dont-we-talk-about-it-8600605.htm|title = Race is part of the body image conversation, so why don't we talk about it?|date = May 2, 2013|accessdate = October 25, 2015|newspaper=The Independent |last = Devon|first = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst [[Latino|Latinas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Beauty Whitewashed: How White Ideals Exclude Women of Color |url = http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|publisher = Beauty Redefined |accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306151312/http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|archivedate = 2011-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastic surgery]] is another method, and is especially popular in Asia for "[[Westernization|Westernizing]]" facial features. Two of the most popular treatments are [[rhinoplasty]] (nose lifts), and [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid lifts), which are done to make these features look more Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin-lightening|Skin lightening]] products are also prevalent in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In [[Racism in India|India]] alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url = http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/market-trends/skin-lightening-trend-in-asia-boosts-global-market|publisher = CosmeticsDesign-Asia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of these whitening cosmetics are known to have dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; [[hydroquinone]], for instance, is known to cause irritation and [[leukemia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is known to cause [[rash]]es and pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bob Fredericks |title=Health officials warn of mercury levels in skin-lightening creams |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/06/health-officials-warn-of-mercury-levels-in-skin-lightening-creams/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly "whitewashed" – with digitally lightened skin and hair – or may already have features that are considered "white").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fashion industry believes that by advertising unattainable standards of beauty, they fuel a customer demand by "creating a craving that can't be satisfied".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can using different types of models benefit brands?|url = http://www.ellecanada.com/living/culture/can-using-different-types-of-models-benefit-brands/a/58327 |publisher = Elle Canada|accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by [[Elle Canada]] has proven the exact opposite: products featured by models that accurately represent the consumer's race – as well as weight and age – will increase the consumer's willingness to purchase a product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Book of Fermoy''' ({{Lang-ga|Leabhar Fhear Maí}}, aka '''RIA MS 23''' or the '''Book of Roche''', ''leabhar de Róiste'') is a medieval Irish text dated to the 14th to 16th century AD.{{sfn|RIA}}

==History==
The book was written in the [[Irish language]] in the 15th C. by several scribes. The 238 pages contain numerous tales, histories, and biographies.{{sfn|RIA}} [[James Henthorn Todd]] acquired the work in 1858 - he suggested the title "Book of Roche" would be equally applicable to the work due to the large quantity of content relating to the history of the Roche Family of Fermoy; one "David [Mór] son of Maurice son of John Roche" is mentioned in the text as a patron of one set of scribes.{{sfn|RIA}}

The CCI is charged with the duty "to promote the proper care and perservation of Canada's moveable cultural heritage, and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation."&lt;ref name= Commission &gt;{{cite book |last= Turko |first= Karen|date= February 1996|title= Preservation Activities in Canada: A Unifying Theme in a Decentralised Country|url= https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub60/pub60.pdf|location= |publisher= The Commission on Preservation and Access|page= |isbn= 1-887334-47-5|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CCI originated within the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in 1957, as its Conservation and Scientific Research Division under the leadership of Dr. Nathan Stolow.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; In 1964, the division was granted greater autonomy and became the National Conservation Research Laboratory ("NCRL").&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in [[Doors Open Ottawa]], held June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The following are but some of the services CCI provides:&lt;ref name = NSERCC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wright|first= Julia|date= 18 November 2016|title= Historic quilt stitches together Confederation story|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confederation-quilt-restored-1.3855102| work= |location= |access-date= 11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardinal Lamberto''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He is portrayed by [[Raf Vallone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000826/|title=Cardinal Lamberto (Character)|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20079/The-Godfather-Part-III/cast|title=The Godfather, Part III (1990)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the film==
Lamberto is a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the man favoured to succeed the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] [[Pope Paul VI]] as head of the Church. He is visited by [[Michael Corleone]] on the advice of Don Tommasino, and Michael tells him of his swindle at the hands of corrupt Vatican bank officials Frederick Keinszig, Licio Lucchesi, and Archbishop Gilday. Lamberto encourages Michael to confess his sins; Michael is initially reluctant, but eventually gives in under the Cardinal's gentle prodding. He breaks down in tears when confessing that he ordered the murder of his brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. Upon the conclusion of the confession, Lamberto tells Michael that he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, yet [[absolution|absolves]] him and tells him he still has a chance for redemption.

Upon the death of Paul VI, Lamberto is elected the new Pontiff; he takes the name [[John Paul I]] upon his accession. A moral, thoroughly honest man, he immediately calls for an investigation into the activities of the [[Vatican Bank]] and requests a meeting with Keinszig, the Bank's chief accountant. However, Keinszig has left [[Rome]] with a large sum of money and several documents. Fearing that their corruption will be exposed, Keinszig, Lucchesi, and Gilday plot to murder the Pope. Gilday poisons the Pontiff's tea, killing him in his sleep.

==Inspiration==
The character of Lamberto and the film's depiction of the events which led to his murder are based upon one of the [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] surrounding the sudden death of the real-life [[Pope John Paul I]], Albino Luciani.  Like the Lamberto character, Luciani was discovered dead in his bed in 1978, 33 days after his election to the papacy.  Various theories, such as the one outlined in [[David Yallop]]'s 1984 book, ''[[In God's Name]]'', have suggested that Luciani was murdered because he was investigating and planning reforms for the Vatican Bank, in light of the [[Banco Ambrosiano]] scandal.

The '''Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies''' (CUCS) was founded in 1981, as a joint creation between the [[University of Manitoba]] and [[St. Andrew's College (Winnipeg)|St. Andrew's College]].  The mission of the Centre is to create, preserve and communicate knowledge dealing with [[Ukrainian Canadian]] culture and scholarship.  It is located in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

The Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies, provides undergraduate courses and interdisciplinary programs of study in areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian culture. The Centre also encourages and promotes research and scholarship in all areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers nineteen courses in such areas as [[Ukrainian language]], Ukrainian Canadian literature and folklore, the history of [[Ukraine]] and of the Ukrainians in [[Canada]], the geography of Ukraine, the government and politics of Ukraine, [[Eastern Christianity]], [[Byzantine art]], and the Ukrainian arts in Canada. These courses can be taken singly, for general interest, as options, or as components of programs in various departments in the Faculty of Arts or in the School of Art.

For students interested in specializing in the area, the Centre offers interdisciplinary programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies leading to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with a general major, an advanced major, or a minor in this field. The University of Manitoba is the only university in Canada which offers undergraduate degree programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers courses on the University of Manitoba campus, and at off-campus locations in Winnipeg. From time to time, the Centre is also able to offer courses at other locations in Manitoba and through teleconference, as well as specialized programs during the summer.

Although the Centre does not offer graduate courses, it is possible to pursue graduate work in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies at the M.A. and Ph.D. levels through Interdisciplinary Programs in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the University of Manitoba. Several fellowships are available.

Individual scholars are encouraged to pursue their own research agenda within a Ukrainian Canadian context. Topics of current interest include an exploration of Ukrainian Canadian history, the occurrence of Ukrainian Canadiana within North American popular culture, explorations of Ukrainian Canadian arts including folklore, fine arts, and literature, issues in genealogy, and the study of music both popular and classical) with a Ukrainian Canadian focus.

An additional new direction is the development of an online courses on Ukrainian Canadian folklore.

The Centre, since 2002, has held a bi-annual Tarnawecky Distinguished Lecture program at the University of Manitoba. This program is intended to bring academics and experts as speakers to the University.

The acting director, since 2016, is Dr. Orest Cap.

'''Charlotte Shakespeare''' was a professional, non-profit theatre company in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].  The company specialized in intimate and accessible performances of traditional and modern classics, with an emphasis on the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] and with a mission of presenting plays "that reflect timeless truths about the human condition and honor Shakespeare’s genius for storytelling and language".

==History==
The company was founded by Elise Wilkinson and Joe Copley in 2006 under the name Collaborative Arts Theatre.  It was granted status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2008. The name was changed to Charlotte Shakespeare in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrickschneider.photoshelter.com/gallery/-/G0000gge.DZPy9rk/ Charlotte Shakespeare Festival on the Green in Uptown]&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlotte Shakespeare has never had a performance venue of its own.  In its first two years productions took place in a tavern, in a series of apartments, and on the Green.  Since that time all plays have been produced in theaters at [[North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center#Theaters|Spirit Square]] or on [[The Green (Charlotte, North Carolina)|The Green]]. The company went on hiatus in the summer of 2015 and has not reopened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/article25767040.html Charlotte Shakespeare cancels summer season] By Lawrence Toppman, [[Charlotte Observer]] June 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[non-fiction]] [[book]], a '''conclusion''' is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing.  This generally follows the body or perhaps an [[afterword]], and the conclusion may be followed by an [[epilogue]], [[outro (book)|outro]], [[postscript]], appendix/[[Addendum#In books|addendum]], [[glossary]], [[bibliography]], [[index (publishing)|index]], [[erratum|errata]], or a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. [[Aristotle]], in ''The Rhetoric'', tells us a good writer should do this in the conclusion: "make the audience well-disposed towards ourselves and ill-disposed to our opponent." It's a good opportunity to make inferences or predictions, or to ask the audience to consider what would happen if they do not accept our point of view by making a connection to society in general.

'''''Crak!''''' (sometimes '''''Crack!''''') is a 1963 [[pop art]] [[lithograph]] by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] in his [[comic book]] style of using [[Ben-Day dots]] and a [[text balloon]]. It was used in marketing materials for one of Lichtenstein's early shows. It is one of several of his works related to [[military art]] and monocular vision.

== Background ==
[[File:Crak! source.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The source of ''Crak!'' is a story from ''[[Star Spangled War Stories]]'' #102&lt;!--, written by [[Bob Haney]] and illustrated by [[Jack Abel]]--&gt;. © April–May 1962, National Periodical Publications (DC).]]
When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in New York City in February 1962, it sold out before opening.  The exhibition included ''[[Engagement Ring (Roy Lichtenstein)|Engagement Ring]]'', ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]'' and ''The Refrigerator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|author=Tomkins, Calvin|isbn=0-8109-2356-4|page=25|year=1988|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962. After a west coast exhibition at [[Ferus Gallery]] in Los Angeles from April 1–27, 1963, Lichtenstein had his second solo exhibition at the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery from September 28&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 1963 that included ''[[Whaam!]]'', ''[[Drowning Girl]]'', ''[[Torpedo...Los!]]'', ''[[Baseball Manager]]'', ''[[In the Car]]'', and ''Conversation''.&lt;ref name=RLOF4&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|page=2-4|chapter=Reviews 1962–64|author=Judd, Donald|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lfchron1.htm|title=Chronology|accessdate=June 9, 2013|publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606071341/http://lichtensteinfoundation.org/lfchron1.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for its [[onomatopoeic]] graphic text, ''Crak!'' is an offset lithograph on lightweight, white wove paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=3783&amp;year=1963&amp;decade=60|title=CRAK!|accessdate=June 26, 2013|publisher=LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, it was a marketing poster that "was published to announce Lichtenstein's exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery, September 28 [&amp;ndash;] October 24, 1963." The foundation notes that the work is sometimes dated 1964 with numbered impressions that are inscribed reflecting that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/search.php?string=Crak&amp;search_year=&amp;search_series=|title=Search Result: CRAK!|accessdate=June 26, 2013|publisher=LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
The [[Screen printing|screen-printed]] poster image presents a [[beret]]-clad woman shooting a rifle. Lichtenstein recomposed the comic book source — from a story written by [[Bob Haney]] and illustrated by [[Jack Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/16867/ "The Town That Wouldn't Die!",] ''Star Spangled War Stories'' #102 credits, Grand Comics Database. Accessed July 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Star Spangled War Stories]]'' #102 (Apr./May 1962) — by replacing the mound of sand with what seems to be a stack of [[sandbag]]s. He also isolated the figure by cropping the foreground and background elements.&lt;ref name=RLGB&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|pages=118&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monocular vision is the motif in which the subject is "depicted frontally in such a way as to expose both eyes to the viewer, yet which has one eye closed or otherwise obscured" and not those in which the subject is depicted in profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Footnote 32|author=Lobel, Michael|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main subject has one eye opened and one eye closed, which relates to a pervasive theme of monocularity in Lichtenstein's art with works such as ''[[Torpedo...Los!]]'' and ''[[I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!]]''. The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of "machine and embodied vision" as exhibited in works such as ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'', ''[[Bratatat!]]'', and ''[[Jet Pilot (Roy Lichtenstein)|Jet Pilot]]''.&lt;ref name=RLGB/&gt;

'''Dialogue''' (sometimes spelled '''dialog''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]&lt;ref&gt;See entry on "dialogue (n)" in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a written or spoken [[conversation]]al exchange between two or more people, and a [[literature|literary]] and [[theatrical]] form that depicts such an exchange. As a [[narrative]], [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[didactic]] device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the [[Socratic dialogue]] as developed by [[Plato]], but antecedents are also found in other traditions including [[Indian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples|page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0824800788|isbn=0824800788 |first=Hajime |last=Nakamura |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Paulo Freire]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[David Bohm]]. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Promise of Dialogue: The dialogic turn in the production and communication of knowledge|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9ZwM1XEI4IC&amp;pg=PA26|first=Louise|last=Phillips|isbn=9789027210296|pages=25–26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as Freire and [[Ramón Flecha]] have also developed a body of theory and techniques for using [[egalitarian dialogue]] as a pedagogical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ramón|last=Flecha|year=2000|title=Sharing Words: Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dialogue stems from the Greek διάλογος (''dialogos'', conversation); its roots are διά (''dia'': through) and λόγος (''logos'': speech, reason). The first extant author who uses the term is Plato, in whose works it is closely associated with the art of dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/14987/6295|title = From Dialogos to Dialogue: The Use of the Term from Plato to the Second Century CE|last = Jazdzewska|first = K.|date = 1 June 2015|journal = Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 54.1 (2014), p. 17-36|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin took over the word as ''dialogus''.&lt;ref&gt;"Dialogue", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==As genre==
[[File:Politeia beginning. Codex Parisinus graecus 1807.jpg|thumb|Oldest extant text of Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'']]

===Antiquity and the Middle Ages===

Dialogue as a genre in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]] dates back to ancient works, such as [[Sumerian disputations]] preserved in copies from the late third millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;G. J., and H. L. J. Vanstiphout. 1991. Dispute Poems and Dialogues in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East: Forms and Types of Literary Debates in Semitic and Related Literatures. Leuven: Department Oriëntalistiek.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rigvedic dialogue hymns]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

In the East, In 13th century Japan, dialogue was used in important philosophical works. In the 1200s, Nichiren Daishonin wrote some of his important writings in dialogue form, describing a meeting between two characters in order to present his argument and theory, such as in "Conversation between a Sage and an Unenlightened Man" (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin 1: pp.99-140, dated around 1256), and "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" (Ibid., pp.6-30; dated 1260), while in other writings he used a question and answer format, without the narrative scenario, such as in "Questions and Answers about Embracing the Lotus Sutra" (Ibid., pp.55-67, possibly from 1263). The sage or person answering the questions was understood as the author.

In the West, [[Plato]] (c. 437 BC – c. 347 BC) has commonly been credited with the systematic use of dialogue as an independent literary form.{{sfn|gosse|1911}} Ancient sources indicate, however, that the Platonic dialogue had its foundations in the ''mime'', which the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] poets [[Sophron]] and [[Epicharmus]] had cultivated half a century earlier.{{sfn|Kutzko|2012|p=377}} These works, admired and imitated by Plato, have not survived and we have only the vaguest idea of how they may have been performed.{{sfn|Kutzko|2012|p=381}} The ''Mimes'' of [[Herodas]], which were found in a papyrus in 1891, give some idea of their character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V21AAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR9|page=ix|title=The Mimes of Herodas|first=John Arbuthnot|last=Nairn|year=1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato further simplified the form and reduced it to pure [[Logical argument|argumentative]] conversation, while leaving intact the amusing element of [[fictional character|character]]-drawing.&lt;ref name="gosse"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Dialogue |volume=8|pages=156-157|first=Edmund |last=Gosse |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; By about 400 BC he had perfected the [[Socratic dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA322|pages=322–323|year=1995|isbn=9780877790426}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his extant writings, except the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and [[Epistles (Plato)|Epistles]], use this form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QE_CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA405|page=405|title=Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece|first=George|last=Sarton|year=2011|isbn=9780486274959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Plato, the dialogue became a major literary genre in antiquity, and several important works both in Latin and in Greek were written. Soon after Plato, [[Xenophon]] wrote his own ''[[Symposium (Xenophon dialogue)|Symposium]]''; also, Aristotle is said to have written several philosophical dialogues in Plato's style (of which only fragments survive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmic and Meta-Cosmic Theology in Aristotle's Lost Dialogues |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004091556|isbn=9004091556 |first=A. P. |last=Bos |year=1989 |page=xviii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period to the present===
{{see also|Closet drama}}
Two French writers of eminence borrowed the title of Lucian's most famous collection; both [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] (1683) and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]] (1712) prepared ''Dialogues des morts'' ("Dialogues of the Dead").{{sfn|gosse|1911}} Contemporaneously, in 1688, the French philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] published his ''Dialogues on [[Metaphysics]] and Religion'', thus contributing to the genre's revival in philosophic circles. In English non-dramatic literature the dialogue did not see extensive use until [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] employed it, in 1713, for his treatise, ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]''.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt; His contemporary, the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] wrote ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.'' A prominent 19th-century example of literary dialogue was [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]'s ''[[Imaginary Conversations]]'' (1821–1828).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Walter Savage Landor|title=English Prose of the Nineteenth Century|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWWX3INTw78C&amp;pg=PA215|first1=Hardin|last1=Craig|first2=Joseph M.|last2=Thomas|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] adopted this form for several important satirical works published between 1780 and 1799. In Spanish literature, the ''Dialogues'' of [[Juan de Valdés|Valdés]] (1528) and those on ''Painting'' (1633) by [[Vincenzo Carducci]] are celebrated. Italian writers of collections of dialogues, following Plato's model, include [[Torquato Tasso]] (1586), [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1632), [[Ferdinando Galiani|Galiani]] (1770), [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]] (1825), and a host of others.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt;

In the 19th century, the French returned to the original application of dialogue. The inventions of "[[Sibylle Gabrielle Marie Antoinette Riqueti de Mirabeau|Gyp]]", of [[Henri Léon Emile Lavedan|Henri Lavedan]], and of others, which tell a mundane [[anecdote]] wittily and maliciously in conversation, would probably present a close analogy to the lost mimes of the early Sicilian poets. English writers including [[F. Anstey|Anstey Guthrie]] also adopted the form, but these dialogues seem to have found less of a popular following among the English than their counterparts written by French authors.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt;

The [[Platonic dialogue]], as a distinct genre which features Socrates as a speaker and one or more interlocutors discussing some philosophical question, experienced something of a rebirth in the 20th century. Authors who have recently employed it include [[George Santayana]], in his eminent ''Dialogues in Limbo'' (1926, 2nd ed. 1948; this work also includes such historical figures as [[Alcibiades]], [[Aristippus]], [[Avicenna]], [[Democritus]], and [[Dionysius the Younger]] as speakers). Also [[Edith Stein]] and [[Iris Murdoch]] used the dialogue form. Stein imagined a dialogue between [[Edmund Husserl]] (phenomenologist) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (metaphysical realist). {{Anchor|Murdoch}}Murdoch included not only Socrates and Alcibiades as interlocutors in her work ''Acastos: Two Platonic Dialogues'' (1986), but featured a young Plato himself as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iris Murdoch and the Art of Imagining |first=Marije|last=Altorf |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2008 |isbn=9780826497574|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02QhAQAAIAAJ|page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Timothy Williamson]] wrote ''Tetralogue'', a philosophical exchange on a train between four people with radically different [[Epistemology|epistemological]] views.

==As topic==
{{main article|Philosophy of dialogue}}
[[File:David Bohm.jpg|thumb|[[David Bohm]], a leading 20th-century thinker on dialogue.]]
[[Martin Buber]] assigns dialogue a pivotal position in his [[theology]]. His most influential work is titled ''[[I and Thou]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beacons of the Light: 100 Holy People Who Have Shaped the History of Humanity|page=560 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1846941857|isbn=1846941857 |first=Marcus|last=Braybrooke|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buber cherishes and promotes dialogue not as some purposive attempt to reach conclusions or express mere points of view, but as the very prerequisite of authentic relationship between man and man, and between man and [[God]]. Buber's thought centers on "true dialogue", which is characterized by openness, honesty, and mutual commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogical Philosophy from Kierkegaard to Buber|page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0791406237|isbn=0791406237 |first=Samuel Hugo |last=Bergman |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Vatican Council]] placed a major emphasis on dialogue with the World. Most of the Council's documents involve some kind of dialogue : dialogue with other religions (''[[Nostra aetate]]''), dialogue with other Christians ([[Unitatis Redintegratio]]), dialogue with modern society (''[[Gaudium et spes]]'') and dialogue with political authorities ([[Dignitatis Humanae]]).{{sfn|Nolan|2006}} However, in the English translations of these texts, "dialogue" was used to translate two Latin words with distinct meanings, ''colloquium'' ("discussion") and ''dialogus'' ("dialogue").{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=30}} The choice of terminology appears to have been strongly influenced by Buber's thought.{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=174}}

The [[physicist]] [[David Bohm]] originated a related form of dialogue where a group of people talk together in order to explore their assumptions of thinking, meaning, communication, and social effects. This group consists of ten to thirty people who meet for a few hours regularly or a few continuous days. In a [[Bohm dialogue]], dialoguers agree to leave behind [[debate]] tactics that attempt to convince and, instead, talk from their own experience on subjects that are improvised on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dialogue and The Art Of Thinking Together|page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0307483789|isbn=0307483789 |first=William |last=Isaacs |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential works, [[Russians|Russian]] philosopher and [[semiotician]]&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] provided a [[linguistics|linguistic]] methodology to define the dialogue, its nature and meaning:&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Dialogic relations'' have a specific nature: they can be reduced neither to the purely [[logical]] (even if dialectical) nor to the purely linguistic ([[Composition (language)|compositional]]-[[Syntax|syntactic]]) They are possible only between complete [[utterance]]s of various speaking subjects... Where there is no word and no [[language]], there can be no dialogic relations; they cannot exist among objects or logical quantities (concepts, judgments, and so forth). Dialogic relations presuppose a language, but they do not reside within the system of language. They are impossible among elements of a language.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1986, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Brazil]]ian educationalist [[Paulo Freire]], known for developing popular education, advanced dialogue as a type of pedagogy. Freire held that dialogued communication allowed students and teachers to learn from one another in an environment characterized by respect and equality. A great advocate for oppressed peoples, Freire was concerned with praxis—action that is informed and linked to people's values. Dialogued pedagogy was not only about deepening understanding; it was also about making positive changes in the world: to make it better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Narrative as Pedagogy |first1=Ivor|last1=Goodson|first2=Scherto|last2=Gill |isbn=9781623566890|year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7xnAwAAQBAJ|publisher=Bloomsbury |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As practice==
{{main article|Dialogic learning}}
[[File:Shimer College Classroom Upshot.jpg|thumb|A classroom dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]

Dialogue is used as a practice in a variety of settings, from [[education]] to [[business]]. Influential theorists of dialogal education include [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Ramon Flecha]].

In the United States, an early form of dialogic learning emerged in the [[Great Books]] movement of the early to mid-20th century, which emphasized egalitarian dialogues in small classes as a way of understanding the foundational texts of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Great Books Programs|title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science |year=1973|volume=10 |pages=159–160 |first1=Otto A.|last=Bird|first2=Thomas J.|last2=Musial }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions that continue to follow a version of this model include the [[Great Books Foundation]], [[Shimer College]] in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Guardian|first=Ronson|last=Jon|authorlink=Jon Ronson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/06/shimer-college-illinois-worst-school-america|date=2014-12-06|title=Shimer College: The Worst School in America?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/|title=Why SJC?|accessdate=2015-01-18|publisher=St. John's College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarian dialogue===
{{main article|Egalitarian dialogue}}
Egalitarian dialogue is a concept in [[dialogic learning]]. It may be defined as a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning|first=Ramon|last=Flecha|authorlink=Ramon Flecha|year=2000|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structured dialogue===
Structured dialogue represents a class of dialogue practices developed as a means of orienting the dialogic discourse toward problem understanding and [[consensus|consensual]] action. Whereas most traditional dialogue practices are unstructured or semi-structured, such conversational modes have been observed as insufficient for the coordination of multiple perspectives in a problem area. A disciplined form of dialogue, where participants agree to follow a dialogue framework or a [[Facilitation (business)|facilitator]], enables groups to address complex shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Family Business and Social Capital|page=xxi |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1849807388|isbn=1849807388 |first=R. L.|last=Sorenson|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Christakis|Aleco Christakis]] (who created ''structured dialogue design'') and [[John N. Warfield]] (who created ''science of generic design'') were two of the leading developers of this school of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Onlife Manifesto|page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3319040936|isbn=3319040936 |editor=Floridi, Luciano |chapter=Reengineering and Reinventing both Democracy and the Concept of Life in the Digital Era|first=Yiannis|last=Laouris }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for engaging structured dialogue follows the observation that a rigorous bottom-up democratic form of dialogue must be structured to ensure that a sufficient variety of stakeholders represents the problem system of concern, and that their voices and contributions are equally balanced in the dialogic process.

Structured dialogue is employed for complex problems including [[peacemaking]] (e.g., [[Civil Society Dialogue project in Cyprus]]) and indigenous community development.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory and Practice of Dialogical Community Development|page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1136272852|isbn=1136272852 |first1=Peter|last1=Westoby|first2=Gerard|last2=Dowling|year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as government and social policy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Youth Policy Manual: How to Develop a National Youth Strategy|page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9287165769|isbn=9287165769 |first=Finn Yrjar |last=Denstad|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one deployment, structured dialogue is (according to a European Union definition) "a means of mutual communication between governments and administrations including [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] and young people. The aim is to get young people's contribution towards the formulation of policies relevant to young peoples lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthweek.magusine.net/spip.php?article46 Definition of structured dialogue focused on youth matters]&lt;/ref&gt; The application of structured dialogue requires one to differentiate the meanings of discussion and deliberation.

Groups such as Worldwide Marriage Encounter and Retrouvaille use dialogue as a communication tool for married couples. Both groups teach a dialogue method that helps couples learn more about each other in non-threatening postures, which helps to foster growth in the married relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage Enrichment: Preparation, Mentoring, and Outreach|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0876309139|isbn=0876309139 |first1=Richard A. |last1=Hunt|first2=Larry|last2=Hof|first3=Rita|last3=DeMaria|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogical leadership===
The German philosopher and classicist [[:de:Karl-Martin Dietz|Karl-Martin Dietz]] emphasizes the original term of dialogue, which goes back to Heraclitus: "The logos [...] answers to the question of the world as a whole and how everything in it is connected. Logos is the one principle at work, that gives order to the manifold in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. From Dialogical Leadership to a Dialogical Corporate Culture. Heidelberg: Menon 2013. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For Dietz dialogue (gr. dia-logos) means "a kind of thinking, acting and speaking, which the logos "passes through""&lt;ref&gt;Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, talking to each other is merely one part of "dialogue". Acting dialogically means directing someone's attention to another one and to reality at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz: Dialog die Kunst der Zusammenarbeit. 4. Auflage. Heidelberg 2014. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this background and together with Thomas Kracht, Karl-Martin Dietz developed what he termed "[[:de:Dialogische Führung|dialogical leadership]]" as a form of organizational management.&lt;ref name="Karl-Martin Dietz 2011"&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz, Thomas Kracht: Dialogische Führung. Grundlagen - Praxis Fallbeispiel: dm-drogerie markt. 3. Auflage. Frankfurt am Main: Campus 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In several German enterprises and organisations it replaced the traditional human resource management, e.g. in the German [[drugstore]] chain [[dm-drogerie markt]].&lt;ref name="Karl-Martin Dietz 2011"/&gt;

Separately, and earlier to Thomas Kracht and Karl-Martin Dietz, Rens van Loon published multiple works on the concept of [https://books.google.nl/books?id=yHA8etYwBLwC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;ots=1r56caF9Bk&amp;dq=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&amp;f=false Dialogical Leadership], starting with a chapter in the Dutch book, The Organization as Story (2003). Van Loon is the chair of Dialogical Leadership at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, Department of Humanities and Ethics.

===Moral dialogues===
Moral dialogues are social processes which allow societies or communities to form new shared moral understandings. Moral dialogues have the capacity to modify the moral positions of a sufficient number of people to generate widespread approval for actions and policies that previously had little support or were considered morally inappropriate by many. Communitarian philosopher Amitai Etzioni has developed an analytical framework which—modeling historical examples—outlines the reoccurring components of moral dialogues. Elements of moral dialogues include: establishing a moral baseline; sociological dialogue starters which initiate the process of developing new shared moral understandings; the linking of multiple groups' discussions in the form of “megalogues”; distinguishing the distinct attributes of the moral dialogue (apart from rational deliberations or culture wars);  dramatization to call widespread attention to the issue at hand; and, closure through the establishment of a new shared moral understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69623-2_4|title=Moral Dialogues|isbn=978-3-319-69623-2|language=en|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral dialogues allow people of a given community to determine what is morally acceptable to a majority of people within the community.

'''Emily Gilmore''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] who appears in the American [[comedy-drama]] television series ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' (2000 – 2007) and its revival ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life]]'' (2016) as the matriarch of the [[Eponym|eponymous]] family. Portrayed by actress [[Kelly Bishop]], the character was created by series creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] in order to add a [[Tragedy|tragic]] element to the show's light-hearted nature. Emily has had a complicated relationship with her daughter [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] ever since the character runs away at age 17 to raise her newborn daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] on her own. They remain estranged for several years until Lorelai asks her parents to help pay for Rory's schooling, to which Emily agrees on the condition that her daughter and granddaughter visit them for dinner every Friday evening.

One of the show's central storylines, Emily's relationship with Lorelai remains strained for the majority of the series, improving incrementally over time. Bishop, who prefers portraying acerbic over nice women, based her performance on her own grandmother. In ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'', Emily, recently widowed after the passing away of Richard, continues to mourn his death from which she struggles to move on. The death of her co-star and close friend [[Edward Herrmann]], who portrayed Richard, was written into the revival; Bishop used her character's storyline about adjusting to life without her husband to cope with her own grief over Herrmann's passing, as well as drawing upon inspiration from the death of her own mother. The actress nearly did not reprise her role in the revival due to her own husband's health at the time.

Bishop's performances in both the original series and its sequel have been positively received by [[Television criticism|television critics]]. Critics and audiences were initially divided over the character's personality, debating her unlikeability and whether or not she is a bad mother. However, their opinions towards Emily have softened in retrospect, growing to sympathize with the character and defend her as one of the show's most [[Round character|complex characters]] who truly cares for the well-being of her family members. Despite being accused of racism in regards to the way in which she treats her maids, Emily's arc in ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'', in which she takes on a more central role, has been widely acclaimed by critics and fans alike, becoming a fan favorite and experiencing renewed popularity. Critics and fans have since dubbed her the "third Gilmore girl", after Lorelai and Rory.

== Development ==

=== ''Gilmore Girls'' ===

==== Conception and writing ====
Creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] originally pitched ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' to [[The WB]] as a series about Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a young mother and daughter duo whose close relationship is more similar to that of a pair of best friends as opposed to family members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/06/6-fun-facts-about-gilmore-girls.html|title=6 Things We Learned About Gilmore Girls From the Cast’s Today Show Interview|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=June 11, 2015|website=Vulture.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614021601/http://www.vulture.com/2015/06/6-fun-facts-about-gilmore-girls.html|archive-date=2017-06-14|dead-url=no|access-date=August 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show's concept was not fully realized until Sherman-Palladino introduced the idea of a third, older generation of Gilmores to the storyline: Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's wealthy, [[Conservatism|conservative]] parents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/22/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-tragedy/|title=Gilmore Girls creator: Show is almost a tragedy|last=Highfill|first=Samantha|date=November 22, 2016|website=Entertainment Weekly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818220400/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/22/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-tragedy/|archive-date=2017-08-18|dead-url=no|access-date=August 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creator explained that "Lorelai is made because of her experience with her family, and Emily is Emily because Lorelai left", believing Emily's relationship with Lorelai "added a layer of conflict that allows you to do the comedy, but at the base of it, it’s almost a [[tragedy]].”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the show's [[Conflict (narrative)|central conflicts]] is drawn from the fact that Emily is a "confused" character in several ways, particularly in regards to her complicated relationship with Lorelai.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; ''Gilmore Girls''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' original main source conflict revolves around "the generational battle between" the domineering Emily and Lorelai, her free-spirited daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-130149434.html|title=Family Matters: 'Gilmore Girls' Returns to Its Original Source of Conflict|last=Cox|first=Ted|date=February 8, 2005|work=Daily Herald|access-date=September 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142437/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-130149434.html|archive-date=2017-09-09|dead-url=no|via=HighBeam Research|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character spends many early episodes behaving as though not much time has passed since Lorelai ran away.&lt;ref name=":66" /&gt; Although initially created to resemble a "complex" villain,&lt;ref name=":68"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/21/emily-gilmore-is-the-only-reason-to-watch-the-gilmore-girls-revival/|title=Emily Gilmore is the only reason to watch the ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival|last=Rogers|first=Jenny|date=October 21, 2015|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220710/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/21/emily-gilmore-is-the-only-reason-to-watch-the-gilmore-girls-revival/|archive-date=2017-09-14|dead-url=no|access-date=September 11, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; fans believe that Emily appears to grow "softer" towards the second and third seasons, when in fact the writers only "explained [her] a little better" by evolving the character into a "more complex" version of herself.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; As "emotionally guarded" individuals, both mother and daughter channel their feelings towards each other in different ways. While Emily typically avoids the topic of Lorelai's upbringing, Lorelai refuses to acknowledge how abandoned she felt by her mother, "hid[ing] her feelings behind a rapidfire series of jokes."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The character continues to evolve into a more complicated character as the series progresses.&lt;ref name=":61" /&gt; The first season episode "[[Emily in Wonderland]]", in which Emily visits Stars Hollow for the first time and wears a pair of sneakers at Rory's behest, offers an early example of the character's willingness to change in order to spend more time with and please Rory.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; However, her relationship with Lorelai remains strained well into the fifth season; the creator explained that she retained this dynamic because "In life, you never solve your family issues ... You take a few steps forward and feel like 'We're communicating better!' Then something happens and you're like, 'Why didn't I see that coming?"&lt;ref name=":67"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/gilmore-girls-100-40204/|title=Gilmore Girls Turns 100|last=|first=|date=February 8, 2005|website=TV Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911120405/http://www.tvguide.com/news/gilmore-girls-100-40204/|archive-date=2017-09-11|dead-url=no|access-date=September 10, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they remain "firmly ... in their estranged battleground."&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt; At one point Sherman-Palladino had deliberated introducing a woman slightly older than Lorelai – a widow who approaches Emily for help on being "more than just beautiful" in the wake of her wealthy husband's death – who becomes something of a surrogate daughter to Emily.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt; This character and related storyline about Emily "finally ha[ving] a daughter figure who wants to be like her" would have augmented the conflict in Emily's relationship with Lorelai.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt; Sherman-Palladino identified Emily as one of her favorite characters to write for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/10/29/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-dan-palladino-favorite-characters/|title=Gilmore Girls: Amy Sherman-Palladino, Dan Palladino reveal favorite character to write for|last=Derschowitz|first=Jessica|date=October 29, 2016|website=Entertainment Weekly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818215303/http://ew.com/article/2016/10/29/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-dan-palladino-favorite-characters/|archive-date=2017-08-18|dead-url=no|access-date=August 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the sessions do not appear to be very fruitful, it is the first time they mutually acknowledge that there is a problem in their relationship. Just recognizing that there is a problem is a great first step.&lt;ref name=":69" /&gt; Bishop believes "there’s a little bit more of a womanly connection between the two of them than a mother-daughter thing, but certainly the conflicts and the problems between mother and daughter arise, and very dramatically in one scene."&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; The characters are marginally closer friends than they ever were on ''Gilmore Girls'' by the end of the revival.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Since ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'' was to be released on the streaming service Netflix, the writers debated whether or not the characters should be allowed to swear for the first time, particularly Emily.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Sherman-Palladino ultimately decided that Emily would be the only character who swears in the series,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; using profanity against the fellow members of the DAR; she describes organization as "bullshit" three times after growing restless as they interview a potential new member,&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; before she quits the group.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; Uttering "This whole thing died with Richard anyway", Bishop explained that Emily "doesn't see any point in it [anymore]. Obviously, these women were not her friends, they were her [[Social group|social circle]] ... so she didn't really have any reason to hang around with them anymore and she was seeing through the whole thing. She had, actually, the whole time. She saw the hypocrisy in their behavior. I don't know that she disagreed with it back in her other days – that was just the way it is. Now she's just looking at all of life and calling it out in a way."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Emily ultimately relinquishes control of the organization to Toni, portrayed by actress [[Carolyn Hennesy]], with whom Bishop had enjoyed arguing "back and forth as to who's running the show."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Although Emily's life keeps changing, Sherman-Palladino felt it important that she end the revival "calm and settled", at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2016/12/01/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-amy-sherman-palladino-interview-final-four-words/|title=Gilmore Girls' Amy Sherman-Palladino: The Revival Post Mortem Interview You've Been Waiting For|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=December 1, 2016|website=TVLine|pages=1–2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820120253/https://tvline.com/2016/12/01/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-amy-sherman-palladino-interview-final-four-words/|archive-date=2017-08-20|dead-url=no|access-date=August 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop agreed that Emily finds "serenity" by the end of the series,&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; resolving that "After sharing her life for half a century, it's finally her own, to do with as she pleases."&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; She believes that the character sells her mansion because she felt "it was closing in on her", and there was little left for her there beyond her fond memories of Richard.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The actress defends her decision to relocate to her vacation home in Nantucket because "she had fond memories of being relaxed and comfortable" there.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Just like the pilot, the series ends with Emily blackmailing Lorelai, offering to loan her the money to expand the Dragonfly Inn – only this time Lorelai agrees to her terms willingly.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;

==== Portrayal ====
Having been expressing interest in a ''Gilmore Girls'' film for several years, Bishop was "delighted" to learn that a revival was being developed.&lt;ref name=":75" /&gt; Bishop was initially hesitant to commit to ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'' because her husband had been unwell at the time, and reprising the role would limit her ability to care for him.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; However, her family encouraged Bishop to return, agreeing "it’s something that I just have to do ... I’d be heartbroken if the show went on without me."&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The week before filming began, Bishop attended the first few [[Table-read|table reads]] remotely via [[Skype]] in order to continue tending to her husband before joining the rest of the cast on location.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/gilmore-girls-revival-kelly-bishop-interview/|title=Kelly Bishop opens up about ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival: ‘This show is so deeply important to me’|last=Lovely|first=Brittany|date=February 2, 2016|website=Hypable|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820034652/https://www.hypable.com/gilmore-girls-revival-kelly-bishop-interview/|archive-date=2017-08-20|dead-url=no|access-date=August 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop was thoroughly "delighted" with the new material that had been written for Emily, enjoying "seeing her really evolve and grow and try to find herself and all of the different [[stages of grief]]".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The way in which Emily initially deals with Richard's passing reminded Bishop of how she first responded to the death of her own mother, incorporating elements of the grief she had experienced into her performance:&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; "I was [[Mania|manic]] and aggressive and pushing, pushing, pushing — because, if you stop, you’re going to cry. So you don’t stop. And I see that in Emily."&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; She also based her performance on widows she had met in real life.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; Bishop learned approximately 5,295 lines for ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life''.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; Although she found resuming the role as easy as "putting on a favorite coat that still fits and feels amazing", she found filming all four episodes at once to be challenging at times because they were rarely shot in order.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Because of how close Bishop was to Herrmann in real life, Star invited Bishop to bid farewell to the ailing actor when his family decided to take the actor off [[life support]] – the only non-family member to have been invited.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Bishop herself found it very difficult to do the revival without Herrmann because "he and I were buds on the show.

=== Racism allegations ===
The way Emily treats her maids has been widely criticized, a common complaint made against an otherwise well-received character.&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt; Several critics have accused the running gag of being racist due to the fact that the majority of Emily's maids are non-English-speaking women of color, who she often fires.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/10-gilmore-girls-moments-that-will-totally-make-you-cringe-now|title=10 Gilmore Girls Moments That Will Totally Make You Cringe Now|last=Rosa|first=Christopher|date=February 17, 2017|website=Glamour|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217205858/http://www.glamour.com/story/10-gilmore-girls-moments-that-will-totally-make-you-cringe-now|archive-date=2017-02-17|dead-url=no|access-date=February 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Rosa of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' felt that "there isn't anything funny about a spoiled white person disposing of women working in her home like they aren't human beings."&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; ''[[The Frisky]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Divya Amladi dismissed the running gag as ''Gilmore Girls''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' "most condescending storyline".&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-12-01/was-gilmore-girls-always-as-racist-homophobic-and-fat-shaming-as-the-revival-is/|title=Was ‘Gilmore Girls’ always as racist, homophobic, and fat-shaming as the revival is?|last=Amladi|first=Divya|date=December 1, 2016|website=The Frisky|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821130219/http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-12-01/was-gilmore-girls-always-as-racist-homophobic-and-fat-shaming-as-the-revival-is/|archive-date=2017-08-21|dead-url=no|access-date=August 21, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amladi admitted that she struggles to determine if the writers intended for the running joke to be taken humorously or seriously.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; Critics have been slightly more tolerant of Emily's relationship with Berta, a maid she retains throughout the entire duration of ''Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'', some of whom have reviewed their dynamic as "generous" and "sweet" due to the fact that Berta appears to be a "more humanized" character than Emily's previous maids.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

Despite agreeing that Emily's relationship with her maids has always seemed racist, calling it ''Gilmore Girls''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' "weirdest vice", [[VH1]]'s Anna Cincera appreciated the fact that Emily acquired Berta as a friend, receiving it as a method of "apologiz[ing] for all that aforementioned casual racism" but would have preferred if "Emily learns Spanish to talk to her friend like humans do".&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/292450/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-plot-points/|title=23 Very Important Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life Plot Points We Are Still Obsessing Over|last=Anderson|first=Kelly|last2=Read|first2=Ali|date=December 1, 2016|website=VH1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823073440/http://www.vh1.com/news/292450/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-plot-points/|archive-date=2017-08-23|dead-url=no|access-date=August 22, 2017|last3=Cincera|first3=Anna|last4=Bellino|first4=Damian|last5=Black|first5=Liz|last6=Jacobs|first6=Rebeccah|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali of VH1 welcomed their relationship, believing that Berta "bring[s Emily] joy" after Richard's death.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; Writing for the same publication, Damian Bellino praised Emily's growth overall but dismissed the Berta subplot seemed "false", while Kelly Anderson lamented the loss of "Emily firing people in every episode."&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;

Stronger criticisms have endured; Amladi dismissed Emily's relationship with Berta and her family as "a weaksauce commentary on immigrants moving in and taking over", additionally criticizing the fact that she sells her large home in which they could have all lived comfortably in favor of moving them to a smaller beach house, accusing the character of treating them like objects.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; Despite having mostly praise for the character, ''Vanity Fair''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Laura Bradley dubbed Emily's treatment of Berta and her family "racist", referring to it as one of the character's "more frustrating habits" that were retained for the revival.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; However, Bradley acknowledged that some of Emily's "coldness melts away" as the character agrees to care for Berta.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; Anne Cohen of ''Refinery29'', who also had very positive opinions to share about Emily otherwise, called the subplot "tired — and a bit racist", but admitted that it allows Emily to exhibit compassion that she's rarely shown before.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; ''The Washington Post''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Emily Yahr wrote that the subplot "seems out of place for a TV show in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-gilmore-girls-revival-is-far-from-perfect-luckily-for-netflix-fans-wont-care/2016/11/15/1ccb02cc-ab01-11e6-8b45-f8e493f06fcd_story.html|title=The ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival is far from perfect.

'''''Eulogy''''' is a 2004 [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by Michael Clancy. An [[international co-production]] between companies from [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], the film follows a dysfunctional family as secrets come to light at the funeral of the family's patriarch.

==Plot==
The film opens with Kate Collins walking up to a house. She knocks and a woman answers the door. Kate explains that although she doesn't know her she has a long story to explain.

The story begins with the death of her grandfather, Edmund Collins. The movie then goes on to show how all the family members found out about the death, and how they came together for the funeral. As the Collins family joins their widowed mother/grandmother, Charlotte Collins, the family's dysfunctions and idiosyncrasies come to light. Kate's father, Daniel Collins, is an "[[Pornographic film|obscure foreign film]]" actor whose career peaked at age 8 when he appeared in a peanut butter commercial. Kate's uncle, Skip Collins, is an overly hormonal father of overly hormonal twin sons (Fred and Ted) who managed to run their mother out of their family. Kate's aunt, Lucy Collins, and her girlfriend Judy Arnolds are both criticised throughout the movie because of their relationship. Most of this criticism comes from Kate's other aunt, Alice Collins. The bossy, intimidating Alice has managed to both raise her three children and drive her husband into submissive silence, because of her persistent talking and badgering. Once they all arrive at the only family home  Kate is told by Charlotte that her grandfather wished for her to give the [[eulogy]] at the funeral.

After a family dinner that goes south when Lucy and Judy announce that they are getting married, tired of the family feuding, Charlotte tries to commit suicide by overdosing on a medication. While the family sits in the waiting room they run into Samantha, a nurse at the hospital who is also an old friend of Alice's. After having her stomach pumped and after rejoining the family, she tries again by jumping out of a moving van on a bridge and although she does not die, she is seriously injured and spends the remainder of the movie in a wheelchair.

During the film, Kate continually tries to come up with a eulogy while dealing with a previous romance with Ryan, from whom she ran away after being caught by Ryan's mother who came home while Ryan and Kate were having sex. Kate gets reacquainted with Ryan (after trying to dodge him several times around town) and their relationship reignites.

At Edmund's [[Will (law)|will reading]], it is revealed that Edmund has three families that don't know about each other. This explains Edmund's inability to keep names and number of children straight over the years before also dropping the bomb that he was up to his "prostate in debt". Kate is tasked with finding and telling the other two families of Edmund's demise.

Ultimately, per Edmund's will, he is placed in a casket and floated out on a local lake in a boat. Ted and Fred, having previously filled the casket with [[gasoline]], start shooting fiery arrows from a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] at the casket. During this time Kate finally gives her eulogy. One of the arrows eventually hits the casket and a moment later the casket, completely unexpectedly, explodes in a fiery explosion and completely demolishes the boat, body, and casket in a splintery mess.

The movie ends with Kate talking to the woman from the beginning of the film. The woman explains she is not actually the person she was looking for but rather her neighbor.

| source = A common example of '''Faxlore''' is the [[mock German]] variation of the "[[Blinkenlights]]" poster
}}

'''Faxlore''' is a sort of [[folklore]]: [[humor]]ous texts, [[folk poetry]], [[folk art]], and  [[urban legend]]s that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by [[fax machine]].  '''Xeroxlore''' or '''photocopylore''' is similar material circulated by [[photocopying]]; compare [[samizdat]] in [[Soviet-bloc]] countries.

The first use of the term '''xeroxlore''' was in [[Michael J. Preston (professor of English)|Michael J. Preston]]'s essay ''Xerox-lore'', 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last         = Preston
| first        = Michael J.
| year         = 1974
| title        = Xerox-lore

| doi          = 
| accessdate   = 2013-11-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Photocopylore" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of [[trademark]] concerns involving the [[Xerox]] Corporation.  The first use of this term came in ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'' by [[Jacqueline Simpson]] and [[Steve Roud]].&lt;ref&gt;(Oxford University Press: 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-860766-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material circulated in faxlore==
Some faxlore is relatively harmless.  [[Cartoon]]s and [[joke]]s often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of [[technology]] owned by the employer, much [[humour|humorous]] faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values.  Like [[email]] and [[chain letters]], office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, [[urban legends]], and folklore.  The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on.  Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 1995; Dundes, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-traditional lists of reasons "why a cucumber is better than a man" or "why a beer is better than a woman" often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known [[mock German]] variations of the "[[Blinkenlights]]" poster.  Another commonly circulated text contains [[ethnic humor]]; a typical version goes:

:Heaven is where the police are British, the lovers French, the mechanics German, the chefs Italian, and it is all organized by the Swiss.

:Hell is where the police are German, the lovers Swiss, the mechanics French, the chefs British, and it is all organized by the Italians.

Materials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies.  [[World War II]] era [[blueprint]]s exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base.  Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of [[business management|managerial]] restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of [[copyright]] law.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"&gt;Preston, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely.  The use of a fax machine  to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines.  This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by [[email]] as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as [[email hoax]]es.  Specific computer related alarms are the subject of [[virus hoax]]es; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"/&gt;

==Faxlore and urban legends==
[[File:Mickey mouse acid warning.png|thumb|An early example of a distributed warning about tattoo stickers allegedly laced with drugs, collected by [[Jan Brunvand]] in his book ''The Choking Doberman'']]
Other sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences.  A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious "[[Blue star tattoo legend|Blue Star]] [[LSD|Acid]]" [[hoax]] is one well known example.

The "lights out" hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for [[murder]] as part of a [[gang]] initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant [[city]], only made these hoaxes seem more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
In the [[United States]], collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among [[school]] administrators and [[police department]]s; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be "[[Satanism|Satanic]] symbols", and in the 1990s they were alleged to be "gang symbols".  [[politics|Political]] or [[religion|religious]] symbols, like the [[peace symbol]], the [[Star of David]], the [[Rosary]], the [[ankh]], or the [[pentagram]] were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On the authority of these anonymous, hard to trace, and impossible to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their "secret meaning."  A number of [[civil liberties]] [[lawsuit]]s were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.&lt;ref&gt;''Chalifoux'', 1997; ''Jeglin'', 1993; ''Jewish News Weekly'', 1999; ''Free Republic'', 2005; Bunch, 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar claim that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] logo was a "[[Satanism|satanic symbol]]" was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several [[Amway]] distributors, Amway being one of Procter &amp; Gamble's competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by [[voice mail]] and email.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various [[university|universities]] or [[sports]] teams are "gang symbols".&lt;ref&gt;''Jeglin'', 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing obsolescence ==
With the rise of the [[Internet]], media such as [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking sites]] are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible [[computer virus]]es that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus [[cautionary tale]] that used to circulate as faxlore.

'''FlatWorld'''  is a [[publisher]] of college-level [[textbooks]] and educational supplements&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Ronald S. [http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/279963/the-world-flat-even-publishing "The World is Flat – Even in Publishing."] ''[[Manila Bulletin]].'' October 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2007 as Flat World Knowledge by Eric Frank and Jeff Shelstad.&lt;ref&gt;Lener, Edward and Cy Dillon. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n1/pdf/v56n1.pdf "Building a Better Model: Eric Frank on Flat World Knowledge."] ''Virginia Libraries.'' Jan–Feb–Mar 2010, pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired at the end of 2016 by Alastair Adam and John Eielson and its company headquarters was moved from Washington, DC to Boston, MA.  The company originally offered every textbook published free using online delivery under the [[open content]] paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;Flat World Knowledge [http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/ Homepage] with company story.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Chin. [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2010/september/28/chinwong.isx&amp;d=2010/september/28 "Textbooks for free."] ''[[Manila Standard Today]].'' September 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but in November 2012, the company announced that it will no longer offer a free version citing financial concerns as the reason for the change.&lt;ref name=Chron_drop&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Jennifer |title=Flat World Knowledge to Drop Free Access to Textbooks |url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/flat-world-knowledge-to-drop-free-access-to-textbooks/40780 |work=Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2016 acquisition, the company rebranded as FlatWorld.  FlatWorld publishes more than 100 peer-reviewed textbooks.

==Company history==

===2007===
Flat World Knowledge was founded in 2007 by Jeff Shelstad and Eric Frank in [[Nyack, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Mason A.

Case abstract available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1588144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
Flat World Knowledge began [[alpha testing]] of their platform and business model spring of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Haiken, Melanie. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/smallbusiness/online_textbooks.fsb/index.htm "Save Cash – Download Your Textbooks An Online Startup Plans to Disrupt the Staid World of Textbook Publishing."] ''Fortune Small Business.'' December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Two alpha phases involved faculty and one alpha phase involved students. The company then moved to small-scale private [[beta testing]] in 27 classes.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chris. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/09/open-source-tex/ "Open Source Textbooks Challenge a Paradigm."] Wired.com. September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on results from these studies, the business model was determined viable and the company moved toward preparing for a public beta launch in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, John Levi III, and David A. Wiley. [http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2800/2578 "A Sustainable Future for Open Textbooks?"] The Flat World Knowledge Story. ''First Monday.'' Vol 15, No 8. August 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
During spring of 2009, 30 colleges adopted Flat World open textbooks in public beta bringing the company their first 1,000 users. Eight textbooks were published at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, John C. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/open-source-textbook-company-now-bmoc-at-400-colleges/ "Open Source Textbook Company Now BMOC at 400 Colleges."] Wired.com. August 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2009, Flat World textbooks had been adopted at 400 colleges for use by 40,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;Oshiro, Dana.

The company also published a graphic novel, ''[[Atlas Black: Managing to Succeed]]'' in August.

===2010===
Flat World Knowledge moved from Nyack, New York to [[Irvington, New York]] to accommodate company growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Marc. [http://rivertowns.patch.com/articles/irvington-publishers-shaking-up-the-textbook-industry "Irvington Publishers Shaking Up the Textbook Industry."] ''Rivertowns Patch.'' October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat World Knowledge entered into a unique licensing agreement with Virginia State University in 2010. For eight core business courses, students gained access to all electronic formats of select textbooks including study aids. Unlike traditional licensing models, students retain access to course materials and study aids indefinitely through their Flat World student account. Audio textbook versions and [[ePub]] files similarly do not expire. The price for this universal digital access license is cited as $20 per student by the ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''.&lt;ref&gt;Llovio, Luis. [http://www2.timesdispatch.com/business/business/2010/aug/31/b-text31-ar-480382/ "Students in Eight Core Business Classes at VSU get Free Digital Access to Texts."] ''Richmond Times-Dispatch.'' August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia State University program is featured in the ''BizEd'' article "Digital at the Core." Virginia State University is using the agreement as part of a university effort to "save money, save the environment, improve student retention, and prepare business graduates for the complex working world."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Mirta M. [http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/40-43%20F-Digital%20at%20Core.pdf "Digital at the Core."] ''BizEd'' 9, no. 6 November 2010 pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2010, the number of colleges and universities using Flat World open textbooks doubled to 800 higher education institutions. Student users more than tripled with 150,000 students using 24 published titles.

During fall semester 2010, 50 additional titles were announced as in the publication pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Biba, Paul.

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 also marked crossing the threshold of having 100 authors signed to write open textbooks for publication by Flat World Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Mary. [http://assett.colorado.edu/post/1284 "Open Textbooks Offer Instructors More Control, Customizability."] ''ASSETT.'' September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Outsell Inc. named Flat World Knowledge as one of "30 to Watch" for 2011 among innovators and disruptors who were selected for "shaking up their respective marketplaces."&lt;ref&gt;Stratigos, Anthea, Leigh Watson Healy, and Marc Strohlein.

Flat World Knowledge. January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 - 2015===

In November 2012, FlatWorld  announced that it will no longer provide free access to their textbook content citing financial concerns as the reason for this change.&lt;ref name="Chron_drop" /&gt; Unable to continue to operate without a way to generate greater revenue, it instituted a paywall and moved away from the open model.   Over the next three years, the company pivoted focus, investing in developing a new, competency-based learning platform and line of business.

===2016===
In late 2016, the core textbook publishing business, Flat World Knowledge, was spun off and acquired by Alastair Adam and John Eielson and rebranded as FlatWorld. The remaining competency-based learning business was rebranded as Sagence Learning.  Adam and Eielson saw an opportunity to disrupt the higher-education publishing market, where fewer and fewer students were able to afford a new textbook and were increasingly reliant on used, rented or outdated editions of titles. They wanted to refocus FlatWorld on low-cost, high-quality textbooks, available in whatever format the student preferred. They believed that by offering high-quality textbooks at affordable prices, they could put a new, current edition textbook in every student’s hands on the first day of class.

===Investments===
Flat World Knowledge secured $11.5 million in investments through 2010, including an initial $700k angel investment.&lt;ref&gt;Business Headlines.

===International===
A [[Canada|Canadian]] representation agreement was announced in March 2011 with Northrose Associates of [[Whitby, Ontario]], Canada. The Canadian higher education system faces challenges similar to U.S. higher education providers from the ever escalating costs of traditional college textbooks. [[Open textbooks]] from Flat World Knowledge will be actively marketed by the firm to educators and higher education administrators across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;CARL ABRC.

Flat World Knowledge was identified in a 2010 report by [[Nicole Allen]] of [[The Student PIRGs]] ''A Cover to Cover Solution: How Open Textbooks are the Path to Textbook Affordability''&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Nicole.

In December 2010, the [[American Library Association]]'s Business Reference Sources Committee of RUSA's Business Reference and Services Section (BRASS) selected Flat World Knowledge's Business and Economics [[open textbooks]] for their 2010 list of "outstanding business reference sources."&lt;ref&gt;BRASS Business Reference Sources Committee, [[American Library Association]]. [http://www.rusq.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Committees-Business-Reference.pdf "Outstanding Business Reference Sources: The 2010 Selection of Recent Titles."] ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly,'' a publication of the American Library Association's [[Reference and User Services Association]]. Vol. 50:2, Winter 2010. December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific criteria used by the American Library Association BRASS when evaluating texts for selection were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A resource compiled specifically to supply information on a certain subject or group of subjects in a form that will facilitate its ease of use. The works are examined for authority and reputation of the publisher, author, or editor; accuracy; appropriate bibliography; organization, comprehensiveness, and value of the content; currency and unique addition to the field; ease of use for intended purpose; quality and accuracy of indexing; and quality and usefulness of graphics and illustrations. Each year more electronic reference titles are published, and additional criteria by which these resources are evaluated include search features, stability of content, graphic design quality, and accuracy of links. Works selected are intended to be suitable for medium to large academic and public libraries."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accessibility and regulatory issues==

===Accessibility===
Flat World Knowledge textbooks are developed for [[accessible publishing]] natively to facilitate compliance with expectations placed on educators for assuring student accessibility to course materials set forth in [[Section 504]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] and Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA). For students with text, vision, vision and hearing, or physical disabilities, Flat World Knowledge has partnered with Bookshare to provide no-charge accessible digital books including an electronic [[Braille]] format. Bookshare members with qualifying disabilities have immediate access to course and reference materials online as opposed to having to request materials direct from the publisher by mail or through another intermediary. According to [[Jim Fruchterman]], CEO of [[Benetech]], the non-profit organization that operates Bookshare, "Without the cooperation of a publisher such as Flat World, students often wait for weeks to get textbooks in accessible formats and, in some cases, are forced to drop courses&lt;ref&gt;Kerscher, George, and Jim Fruchterman. [http://data.daisy.org/publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html?q=publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html "The Soundproof Book:] Exploration of Rights conflict and Access to Commercial EBooks for People with Disabilities." [[DAISY]] Consortium. Accessed January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of accessible books. Flat World is the first postsecondary textbook publisher to recognize and alleviate this problem."&lt;ref&gt;Bookshare. [http://www.bookshare.org/_/aboutUs/2009/12/flatWorldPressRelease "Flat World Knowledge Partners with Bookshare: Breakthrough Agreement Reduces Costs for Postsecondary Institutions; Improves Timely Access to Core Textbooks in Accessible Formats."] Joint Press Release. December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price disclosure and edition availability===
Flat World Knowledge claims to make compliance with the recent Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) simple as the basic price for their textbooks is free and once published, any edition number remains available online at no charge or available for order in print by students, educators, and bookstores on-demand; educators change versions only when they wish and book versions are never "out of print."&lt;ref&gt;Edu1world.org. [http://www.edu1world.org/index/pages/page/?pgid=85 "Flat World Knowledge Makes HEOA Compliance Quick and Easy."] ''The Week in Review.'' May 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinshteyn, Mikhail.

September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Digital textbook and course material formats offer [[sustainability]] advantages over traditional paper textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Bryce. [http://earth911.com/news/2007/08/31/dead-trees-in-a-backpack/ "Textbooks: Dead Trees in a Backpack."] Earth911.com. August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury, Gobinda. "Carbon Footprint of the Knowledge Sector: What's the Future?." ''Journal of Documentation'' 66, no. 6 December 2010 pp. 934-946.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a publishing industry study, an estimated "net [carbon] emission of 8.85 pounds per book [is created for each paper book] sold to consumers."&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;Milliot, Jim [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080310/15955-toward-a-greener-future-.html "Toward a Greener Future. (Cover story)."] Publishers Weekly 255, no. 10 March 10, 2008 pp. 26–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The net carbon emission for textbooks is much higher as the industry average includes high volume small paperbacks, children's books, and many other small form factors popular with consumers.

In 2010-2011, approximately 57.5% of students using Flat World texts opted for entirely digital delivery. As of fall 2011, 70% of students opt for digital formats,&lt;ref&gt;Outsell, Inc.

July 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for free internet, [[ePub]], .MOBI ([[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]]), and [[PDF]] format books and materials is growing rapidly. Flat World Knowledge is "far ahead of the industry curve" for digital format use.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Carole.

For the approximately 30% of students who choose a print version over a digital one, Flat World Knowledge uses just-in-time centralized and local [[print on demand]] in their [[business model]].&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jane. [https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21634 "Flat World Knowledge partners with Barnes &amp; Noble and NACS Media Solutions."] ''Creative Commons News.'' April 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local [[print on demand]] of licensed content offers environmental benefits by saving the need to produce, store, and ship books from a central location — saving energy, natural resources, and cost. Eliminating the need for shipping alone eliminates at least 12.7% of the carbon footprint for paper books.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

Flat World Knowledge offers local booksellers the opportunity to license [[open textbook]] content for [[on-demand printing]] by the [[Espresso Book Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;Xerox.

Local [[print on demand]] is an emerging trend that will help reduce environmental and financial costs of textbooks as the technology is adopted to serve educators and learners who desire print format books.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jane.

Some students use accessible and audio formats. Though [[Braille embosser]]s print on paper, it is essential to provide access to educational materials in the format of choice to students regardless of disability. The same electronic file that is provided for a Braille embosser by Bookshare for Flat World Knowledge open textbooks is also compatible with many [[refreshable Braille display]]s.

Other accessible and audio mp3 formats are very [[sustainable]] as they are electronic.

==Formats==

===Free===
Until November 2012,&lt;ref name="Chron_drop"/&gt; Flat World open textbooks were available to read for free through the Flat World Knowledge website in an e-reader like format. Any user with access to the Internet was able to read the entire textbook catalog for free. This option has since been eliminated because too many students were taking advantage of this option and the FWK business model was becoming unsustainable without increased revenue from the other options.

[[Accessible]] formats of published works for people with qualifying disabilities are available at no charge through [[Bookshare]].

===Paid===
Textbooks in formats including print, individual PDF chapters, ePub, .MOBI (Kindle), audio mp3, abridged audio study mp3, and optional study tools are available for purchase by students direct, through bookstores,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Calvin. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/book-news/deals/article/42674-flat-world-knowledge-reaches-out-to-college-bookstores.html "Flat World Knowledge Reaches Out to College Bookstores."] ''Publishers Weekly.'' April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and via select online providers.

For users that desire note taking, highlighting, flash cards, or access to a condensed study view of textbooks through their online account, a paid study pass purchase is required.

==Derivative works==
Derivative works created through the Flat World publishing engine are available online at no charge in the two formats described earlier or for purchase in print format direct or through bookstores by [[ISBN]]. An ISBN is generated for all derivative work publications developed through the Flat World Knowledge publishing engine as is a [[Creative Commons]] license compatible with the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Florez, Dean, Charles Cook, Eric Frank, and Dennis Passovoy.

No [[Internet browser]] preference is stated for general access to free online reading over the Internet. Flat World Knowledge textbooks can be viewed on all major browsers and platforms.

==Content management systems==
Flat World Knowledge textbook content can be integrated directly into a [[learning management system]] such as [[Blackboard Learning System]], ANGEL, [[Moodle]], [[WebCT]], or [[Desire2Learn]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chris. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/02/flat-world-know/ "Flat World Knowledge to Bring Free Textbooks into Blackboard."] Wired.com. February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct linking is available to Flat World textbooks, sections, and individual pages so other means of accumulating content in containers for group access to course learning materials are also supported. This addresses a controversy over time limitations placed on access to course content held by academic period based learning management systems.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Jon, and David A. Wiley.

The '''Fuller Brooch''' is an [[Anglo-Saxon]] silver and [[niello]] [[brooch]] dated to the late 9th century, which is now in the [[British Museum]], where it is normally on display in Room 41.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 |quote=The brooch's history (as recounted by [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford|Bruce-Mitford]]) is that it was bought from a London bric-à-brac dealer by an unnamed man who did not know its history, he passed it to Sir Charles Robinson who published it in 'The Antiquary'. A few years later Mr. E. Hockliffe, the son-in-law of Sir Charles Robinson, offered the brooch as a loan to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. [[Edward Thurlow Leeds|E. T. Leeds]], then an assistant at the museum, persuaded the then keeper [[D. G. Hogarth]] to accept the loan. On the advice of the then Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities at the British Museum (Sir Hercules Read, P.S.A.) and his assistant keeper (R. A. Smith) the brooch was pronounced a fake and withdrawn from exhibition with the approval of the Ashmolean Museum's technical specialist, W. H. Young. The brooch was eventually purchased by Capt. A. W. F. Fuller and, apart from occasional mentions (e.g. by Sir [[Alfred Clapham]]), was not thought of seriously until the Strickland brooch (registration no. 1949,0702.1) was brought to the British Museum. On the advice of Sir [[Thomas Kendrick]] the Fuller brooch was traced by Mr. Bruce-Mitford and after laboratory examination it was acquired by the British Museum.
 |oclc=610435306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elegance of the engraved decoration depicting the Five Senses, highlighted by being filled with [[niello]], makes it one of the most highly regarded pieces of [[Anglo-Saxon art]].

==Description==
The brooch is a large disc made of hammered sheet [[silver]] inlaid with black [[niello]] and with a diameter of {{convert|114|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Its centre roundel is decorated with personifications of the [[sense|five senses]]. In the centre is Sight with large staring oval [[Human eye|eyes]], surrounded by the other four senses, each in his own compartment. [[Taste]] has a hand in his mouth. [[olfaction|Smell]]'s hands are behind his back, and he stands between two tall plants. [[Tactition|Touch]] rubs his hands together. [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] holds his hand to his ear. This is the earliest known representation of the five senses. The outer border consists of 16 small medallions decorated with human, bird, animal and plant motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Janina Ramirez]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009c4wr |title=Treasures of the Anglo Saxons, Decoding the Fuller Brooch |publisher=BBC |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2011-02-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wGYS1ThP?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009c4wr |archivedate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and materials==
Stylistically it is "in a very late version of the [[Trewhiddle style]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Webster, Leslie]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art'', p. 154, 2012, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|9780714128092}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of the [[Strickland Brooch]], one of the closest parallels to the Fuller Brooch, also 9th century and in the British Museum, additional research determined that the niello used in the Fuller Brooch was mainly [[silver sulphide]], a type that went out of use later in the [[medieval]] period, in itself an argument against it being a modern forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, A.A., ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. ii, 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ownership==
The brooch has survived in excellent condition, although the pin and its attachments have been removed, and the top of the brooch has been perforated for suspension, and it may be the only surviving piece of secular Anglo-Saxon metalwork to remain unburied since its creation. It was thought to be a [[forgery|fake]] by Sir [[Charles Hercules Read]], Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities of the British Museum, because of its excellent condition. He advised the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford which had been lent the brooch, to take it off display. It was then bought by Captain A. W. F. Fuller for the price of the silver.  In 1952 Capt. Fuller donated the brooch to the British Museum on the condition that it henceforth be called the Fuller Brooch.&lt;ref name=Trustees1952&gt;{{citation | last=Trustees | first=British Museum. | year=1952 | title=The British museum quarterly, Volume 17 | publisher=Trustees of the British Museum | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harden1956&gt;{{citation | last=Harden | first=Donald Benjamin | year=1956 | title=Dark-age Britain | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=87155&amp;partId=1&amp;people=124426&amp;peoA=124426-3-9&amp;page=3 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fulton [[Opera]] House''', also known as the '''Fulton Theatre''' or simply '''The Fulton''', is a League of Regional Theatres class B regional theater located in historic downtown [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. It is reportedly the oldest working theatre in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0K1dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fl0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1243%2C1139567 | title=Exploring the quaint towns and villages of Lancaster County | work=Observer-Reporter | date=Jun 5, 1988 | accessdate=28 October 2015 | pages=F8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.

==Building==
Fulton Hall is named after [[Robert Fulton]] (1765-1815), Lancaster County's steam engine pioneer, and it is his likeness that is portrayed in the statue on the front facade. This statue is a replica of the original wooden statue, which has since been restored and now resides on display inside the interior lobby. The building itself was built on the foundation of Lancaster's pre-Revolutionary jail. In 1763, a vigilante gang known as the [[Paxton Boys]] massacred the [[Susquehannock|Conestoga Indian]]s being held there for their protection. This was a monumental event throughout the colonies and became the subject matter for the first plays ever written on American soil - "A Dialogue Between Andrew Trueman and Thomas Zealot About the Killing the Indians at Cannestogoe and Lancaster" and "The Paxton Boys, a Farce".{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The exterior wall of the jail courtyard is now the back wall of the theatre.
Christopher Hager, a Lancaster merchant and civic leader, commissioned the renowned Philadelphia architect [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]]  (who later designed the Lancaster County Courthouse) to create a building that would serve as a community center for meetings, lectures, concerts, and theatrical performances. The building was erected in 1852.

The Fulton Theatre was later modified by noted theatrical architect [[Edwin Forrest Durang]], is one of only three theatres recognized as [[National Historic Landmark]]s (the others are the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Goldenrod (showboat)|Goldenrod Showboat]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]). 
The 1959 production of ''[[Our Town]]'', starring [[Jeanne Clemson]], marked that first time that a live theater production had been performed at the Fulton Opera House in thirty years.&lt;ref name=lancnews&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Holahan|title=Jeanne Clemson dies at 87|url=http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|work=[[Intelligencer Journal]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2009-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030130/http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|archivedate=2009-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A founding member of the [http://www.lhat.org/ League of Historic American Theatres] (LHAT), the Fulton is operated by the Fulton Theatre Company, a non-profit organization.

As the Fulton is run on a non-profit basis, it depends on a variety of grants, corporate sponsorship, and private donations to accomplish its mission. The Fulton is an [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] House, operating under agreement with the Actor's Equity Association and the Union for Professional Actors and Stage Managers (which essentially means that its actors and production team are paid per collective bargaining agreements, as opposed to non-equity actors who are not paid per collective bargaining agreements or volunteers) and employs members of the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] and the United Scenic Artists.  The Fulton is also a member of [[ASSITEJ]], the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People.

The Fulton Theatre is home to six mainstage productions per year including previous productions of Disney's ''Newsies'', ''In The Heights'', Agatha Christie's ''The Mousetrap, some of which are world premier originals (critically acclaimed ''Lightning Rod'', 2005); four family series productions, including the Fulton's own 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,'' ''Aladdin'', J''ack and the Beanstalk, the Musical'', and other theatre for young audiences productions; and four studio series productions, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ''Disgraced'', along with other riveting productions like ''Venus in Fur'', ''Veronica's Room'' and ''Other Desert Cities''. Although most casting takes place in New York City, regional auditions are also held.  While many of The Fulton's regulars are [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] natives who are delighted at the chance to return home to perform, nearly all quickly fall in love with the "Grand Old Lady" and her charm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In addition to providing a place of employment for professional actors, the Fulton Theatre Company is a complete production facility which employs full-time carpenters, electricians, scenic artists, painters, composers, lighting and sound technicians.  Most set pieces and costumes are created in-house or at an adjacent workshop, and makeup, hair, and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] are created by a full-time designer.  The Fulton also maintains a costume shop which provides access to professional quality costumes and props to schools, community theatre companies, and other organizations throughout the region.  Its marketing department maintains a website that allows users to browse theatre history, check audition times, and purchase tickets. All posters and print materials, including production programs, are cataloged and archived by the Lancaster Historical Society.

Many famous actors have appeared at the Fulton.  In December 1930 [[Basil Rathbone]] appeared as Christian St. Obin in ''A Kiss of Importance''.  Peter Weir's film, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090329/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Witness]," starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis, much of which represents the lifestyle of the Amish, [http://lancasteronline.com/features/throwback-thursday-witness-premiered-at-fulton-years-ago/article_50e9324c-b2d6-11e4-ae0c-17a87103bccf.html premiered here in February, 1985.]

'''''Gukjeong chumyo''''' is an 18th-century [[Korean painting]] depicting a crouching cat under wild chrysanthemum on an autumn day. It was drawn by [[Byeon Sang-byeok]], a representative animal painter during the late period of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). ''Gukjeong chumyo'' literally means "An autumn cat in a garden with chrysanthemum" and is of the ''yeongmohwa'', or  [[animal painting]], genre. It is painted on paper with light coloring over the [[ink and wash painting]] (''sumukhwa''). The size of the painting is {{convert|29.5|cm|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|23.4|cm|abbr=on}} in width. It is currently stored at [[Gansong Art Museum]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Daum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://culturedic.daum.net/dictionary_content.asp?Dictionary_Id=10021596&amp;mode=content&amp;query=%B1%B9%C1%A4%C3%DF%B9%A6&amp;dircode=0 |script-title=ko:국정추묘 菊庭秋猫 |trans-title=Gukjeong chumyo |publisher=[[Daum Communications|Daum]]/ National Culture Archetype |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to by the nicknames "Byeon goyangi" (literally "Byeon cat") and "Byeon dak" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. His representative paintings include ''[[Myojakdo]]'' (Painting of Cats and Sparrows), and ''[[Hwajomyogudo]]'' (Painting of Flowers, Birds, and Puppies). The cat in the picture is crouching and gazing at something, and seems ready to swiftly run off.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

'''Henry Condell''' (5 September 1576 ([[Baptism|baptised]]) – December 1627) was an actor in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the playing company for which [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. With [[John Heminges]], he was instrumental in preparing and editing the [[First Folio]], the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, Kate. ''Shakespeare's Friends''. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) {{ISBN|9780275989569}} pp. 129-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from [[East Anglia]], as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of [[New Buckenham|newe Buckenham]]’.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|993|p=159}} According to Edmond:{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, he is associated with the "Harry" who appears in the cast list for [[Richard Tarlton]]'s [[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|''The Seven Deadly Sins'']], but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in [[Lord Strange's Men]] alongside [[John Heminges]] and [[Augustine Phillips]]. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at [[St Laurence Pountney]], Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the [[Strand, London|Strand]], gentleman.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} They settled in [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as [[churchwarden]] in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=158}}

Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lord Chamberlain's]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's]] companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; [[Nicholas Tooley]] and [[Alexander Cooke]] named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at [[Fulham]] in [[Middlesex]] and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in [[Snowshill]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.{{sfn|Barnard|1930|p=1}}

In addition to ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] plays: ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' (1603), ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (1611). He was the original Cardinal in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1679 in literature|1679]]:

Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627.{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=160}} He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] and [[Blackfriars Theatre]]s.

'''Hillel Roman''' (הלל רומן) is a visual artist living and working in Tel Aviv, Israel.

==Biography==

Roman was born on April 16, 1975 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. At age 24 he joined [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|Hamidrasha Art School]], [[Beit Berl College]], [[Israel]]. In 2004 Roman graduated from [[Tel-Aviv University]], the Department for [[Poetics]] and [[Comparative Literature]] ([[magna cum laude]]), and in 2007 he received his [[Masters of Fine Arts]] from [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].

Roman employs a wide range of techniques, from [[drawing]], [[painting]] and [[conceptual art]], through [[sculpting]] and [[etching]], to building fully functional astronomical observatories. 

After his graduation from Beit Berl college, he assumed a teaching position there, and in the years 2004-2006 he lectured at [[Avni Institute of Art and Design]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. After having returned from his studies in London, he resumed his position at Beit Berl, and also accepted a teaching role at '''Thelma Yellin''' school of Fine Arts.

In 2007, Roman received a residency grant at [[Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris|Cite Internationale des Arts]], [[Paris]], [[France]]. In 2009, he won the Young Artist Prize from the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of culture]], Israel. The judging committee said about him: "Roman's paintings, drawings and etchings, always beautiful and saturated... more than intending to delegate a (renewed) birth of beauty out of the banal, replicated and ordinary, they wish to confront the postmodern spectator with the question 'what is modern painting'..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcs.gov.il/Units/Culture/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8+%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1+%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A8+%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99+%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/youngOman+2009.htm Israel Ministry of culture], Announcing winners of 2009 Young Artists prize&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with curator Orit Bulgaro in the catalog of '''Idiolect''', an exhibition at the Bat Yam Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009, Roman discussed "...the significance of the concrete versus the metaphorical, the human desire to get through the metaphor and to touch, the vain struggle to bridge the distance between the eye and the hand. Maybe that is the privilege of the painter/sculptor, and the source of his relevance, despite it all. In any case, I try to create objects or paintings that exist in that chasm between the concrete and the metaphorical; perhaps that is my way of trying to avoid filling any role."&lt;ref&gt;'''Idiolect''' catalog, Bat Yam Museum of Contemporary Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.''''', 581 U.S. ___ (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.|link=|volume=581|year=2017|docket=15-1189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] in [[patent]] law in which the Court held that after the sale of a patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by [[Lexmark]] against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used [[ink cartridge]]s, refilled them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a [[digital rights management]] scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the [[Federal Circuit]], held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or resale of its contracts with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Background==

===Factual setting===

[[File:Lexmark_toner_cartridge_drawing_from_U.S._Pat._No._5,802,431.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Drawing of toner cartridge from one of Lexmark's patents]]

Lexmark International, Inc. makes and sells printers and toner cartridges for its printers. Lexmark owns a number of patents that cover its cartridges and their use. Lexmark sold the cartridges at issue in this case—some in the United States and some abroad.

==== Domestic sales ====

Lexmark's domestic sales were in two categories. A "Regular Cartridge" is sold at "list price" and confers an absolute title and property right on the buyer.{{efn|This litigation does not involve these domestically sold cartridges.}} A "Return Program Cartridge” is sold at a discount of about 20 percent, and is subject to post-sale restrictions: The buyer may not reuse the cartridge after the toner runs out and may not transfer it to anybody else. The first branch of the case turns on the legal status of these post-sale restrictions.

Lexmark manufactured the toner cartridges with microchips in them, which send signals to the printers indicating toner level. When the amount of toner in a cartridge falls below a certain level, the printer will not operate with that cartridge. Also, the printer will not operate with a Return Program Cartridge that has been refilled by a third party. Thus, Lexmark's technology prevented violation of the post-sale restriction against refilling the Return Program Cartridges. The Regular Cartridges do not have this anti-refill feature and can therefore be refilled and reused (but they cost 20 percent more).{{efn|It was stipulated that the 20% price difference "reflects the value of the property interest and use rights conveyed to the purchaser under the express terms of the conditional sale contract and conditional single-use license conferred by Lexmark."}}

“To circumvent this technological measure,” however, “third parties have ‘hacked’ the Lexmark microchips. They created their own "unauthorized replacement" microchips that, when installed in a Return Program cartridge, fool the printer into allowing reuse of that cartridge. Various companies{{efn|For example, Static Control Components, Inc., which became involved in related litigation with Lexmark. See, e.g., ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.|Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]'', 487 F. Supp. 2d 830 (E.D. Ky. 2007).}} purchase used Return Program Cartridges from the customers who bought them from Lexmark. They replace the microchips with "unauthorized replacement" microchips, refill the cartridges with toner, and sell the "re-manufactured" cartridges to resellers such as Impression Products for marketing to consumers for use with Lexmark printers. Lexmark had previously argued in ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.]]'' that replacing these microchips violated copyright law and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), but both federal and the Supreme Court have ruled against Lexmark, affirming that replacing the microchips is not in violation of copyright.

====Imported cartridges====

The second branch of the case involves cartridges that Lexmark sold outside the US. While some of the foreign-sold cartridges were Regular Cartridges and some were Return Program Cartridges, this branch of the case does not involve any distinction among the two types of imported cartridges.

===Trial court decision===

The district court granted Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the single-use cartridges Lexmark had first sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 2014 WL 1276133 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court concluded that the Supreme Court in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  found exhaustion where “the Supreme Court determined that the agreements [at issue] broadly authorized Intel [the seller] to sell the licensed products without restrictions or conditions."&lt;ref&gt;2014 WL 1276133, at *5.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court said “that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'' ''sub silentio'',” and therefore "those post-sale use restrictions do not prevent patent rights from being exhausted given that the initial sales were authorized and unrestricted." &lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court held, however, that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply to the cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad. It said that international exhaustion did not apply to patents because ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 568 U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;, which established international exhaustion in at least some cases, applied only to copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 9 F. Supp. 3d 830, 833-34 (S.D. Ohio 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The court therefore denied Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the cartridges Lexmark had sold abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ''amicus curiae'' position===

In its ''amicus curiae'' brief, the US Government argued that ''Mallinckrodt'' had been wrongly decided in 1992 and in any case it had been overruled ''sub silentio'' in ''Quanta''. It stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the view of the United States, the first authorized sale of a patented article in the United States wholly exhausts the patentee’s exclusive rights in that article, notwithstanding any post-sale restriction imposed by the patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The government also argued that the decision of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission]]'' (2001) should be partially overruled in light of ''Kirtsaeng'' insofar as it held that foreign sales can ''never'' exhaust US patent rights. When the patentee neither makes nor authorizes a foreign sale, as occurred in ''[[Boesch v. Graff]]'',&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; it is proper to say no exhaustion occurred. But when the patentee makes or authorizes a foreign sale, and fails expressly to reserve its US rights, then exhaustion should be found. In the present case, Lexmark made the foreign sales and failed to expressly reserve its US rights; therefore, the sale exhausted the patent rights.

==Federal Circuit decision==
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc.ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit oral argument on March 6, 2015.]]
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc. (Re-argument en-banc).ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit re-argument en banc on October 15, 2015.]]
The parties each appealed.  After a three judge panel had heard oral argument the Federal Circuit ''[[sua sponte]]'' set the case for argument ''en banc'' in the first instance and invited the filing of ''amicus curiae'' briefs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc.'', 785 F.3d 565 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority opinion===

Judge Taranto, writing for a 10-2 majority, reaffirmed both of the prior Federal Circuit rulings. In summary, the court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; that a patentee, when selling a patented article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser, does not by that sale give the buyer, or downstream buyers, the resale/reuse authority that has been expressly denied. Such resale or reuse, when contrary to the known, lawful limits on the authority conferred at the time of the original sale, remains unauthorized and therefore remains infringing conduct under the terms of §&amp;nbsp;271. Under Supreme Court precedent, a patentee may preserve its §&amp;nbsp;271 rights through such restrictions when licensing others to make and sell patented articles; ''Mallinckrodt'' held that there is no sound legal basis for denying the same ability to the patentee that makes and sells the articles itself. We find ''Mallinckrodt''’s principle to remain sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Second, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission|Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Comm’n]]'',&lt;ref&gt;264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; that a U.S. patentee, merely by selling or authorizing the sale of a U.S.-patented article abroad, does not authorize the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States, which are infringing acts in the absence of patentee-conferred authority. ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion ruling recognizes that foreign markets under foreign sovereign control are not equivalent to the U.S. markets under U.S. control in which a U.S. patentee’s sale presumptively exhausts its rights in the article sold. A buyer may still rely on a foreign sale as a defense to infringement, but only by establishing an express or implied license—a defense separate from exhaustion, as ''Quanta'' holds—based on patentee communications or other circumstances of the sale. We conclude that ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion principle remains sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;– U.S. –, 133 S.Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court did not address patent law or whether a foreign sale should be viewed as conferring authority to engage in otherwise-infringing domestic acts. ''Kirtsaeng'' is a copyright case holding that 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) entitles owners of copyrighted articles to take certain acts “without the authority” of the copyright holder. There is no counterpart to that provision in the Patent Act, under which a foreign sale is properly treated as neither conclusively nor even presumptively exhausting the U.S. patentee’s rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;- F.3d at -.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its ''Mallincrodt'' decision and rejected contentions that ''Quanta'' had silently overruled it.

=====§&amp;nbsp;271 abrogates common-law rule=====

The court began by distinguishing the Patent Act's and Copyright Act's respective approaches to infringement. in 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) the Copyright Act says, "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3)," defining infringement by selling, a purchaser "is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" of a purchased copy of a work. In contrast, the Patent Act contains no exhaustion provision. Therefore, the Patent Act requires a "conferral of 'authority' by the patentee .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. in order for the actions listed in §&amp;nbsp;271(a) not to constitute infringement." This means there must be "permission from the patentee" to avoid infringement. The court does not accept exhaustion as a form of "constructive" permission. Hence, if the patentee places explicit limits or conditions on its permission, they qualify the scope of the permission. This has the effect of limiting the common law.

=====''General Talking Pictures'' rule applies to "conditional" sale=====

The court turned to the ''General Talking Pictures'' decision,{{efn|''General Talking Pictures Corp v Western Electric Co.'', 304 U.S. 175, 182 (1938) (upholding as legitimate field-of-use limitations on scope of patent licenses to make and sell amplifiers only in “non-commercial” field), aff’d on reh’g, 305 U.S. 124 (1938).}} which holds "that Lexmark would not have exhausted its patent rights in those cartridges, upon the manufacturing licensee’s sale (the first sale), if a buyer with knowledge of the restrictions resold or reused them in violation of the restrictions." Although the government in its ''amicus curiae'' brief and defendant Impression argue "that a different result is required—that Lexmark automatically lost its patent rights—simply because Lexmark sold the Return Program cartridges itself, subject to the same communicated restriction, rather than having left the manufacture and sale to others under license," the court does not accept that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude otherwise, as we did in ''Mallinckrodt'' and subsequent decisions. A sale made under a clearly communicated, otherwise-lawful restriction as to post-sale use or resale does not confer on the buyer and a subsequent purchaser the "authority" to engage in the use or resale that the restriction precludes. And there is no sound reason, and no Supreme Court precedent, requiring a distinction that gives less control to a practicing-entity patentee that makes and sells its own product than to a non-practicing-entity patentee that licenses others to make and sell the product.{{efn|But see ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]'', in which the Court stated that it was well settled that “where a patentee makes the patented article and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee's rights.” On the other hand, the Court said, “the question is a different one ... when we consider what a patentee who grants a license to one to make and vend the patented article may do in limiting the licensee in the exercise of the right to sell.”}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====''Quanta'' distinguishable and inapplicable=====

The court turned to the ''Quanta'' decision and found it inapplicable to the present issues. "'Quanta did not involve a patentee’s sale at all, let alone one subject to a restriction or, more particularly, a single-use/no-resale restriction." Rather, ''Quanta'' involved a patentee's (LGE's) license to a manufacturer (Intel) that sold to the accused infringer (Quanta). LGE had not limited Intel's license to manufacture the patented product, although it imposed contractual obligations on Intel. "No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents." The Federal Circuit emphasized: "There were no patentee sales, and there were no restrictions on the sales made by the licensee." Those facts were removed from the case at bar. Thus the ''Quanta'' "Court’s discussion of that issue does not undermine ''Mallinckrodt''&amp;#8202;’s ruling that a patentee can preserve its patent rights through restrictions on its sales." The Federal Circuit also emphasized as significant the failure of the ''Quanta'' Court to explicitly repudiate ''Mallinckrodt'' despite the fact that in its ''amicus'' brief "the government prominently featured an argument that ''Mallinckrodt'' was incorrect and should be repudiated."

=====Prior cases=====

The court then turned to the prior Supreme Court cases. Reviewing them, it found that although they used sweeping language that a patentee's sale of the patented product placed it beyond the reach of the patent, so that no post-sale restriction could be enforced under the patent laws, that language went beyond the actual facts of the cases. First, the sales were in most cases without any condition or restriction on what the buyer might do with the product. Second, in the cases where an explicit condition or restriction was imposed, the case involved a tie-in or a price-fix.

The Court conceded that in the ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.|General Electric]]'' case, the Supreme Court had said: “It is well settled, as already said, that where a patentee makes the patented article, and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee’s rights.” But that case involved an antitrust challenge to GE's distribution of lamps that did not meet that description. The case involved price restrictions on a licensed manufacturer. The Federal Circuit then explained that the word "settled" in the Supreme Court's statement had a special, narrow meaning:
"We read that language to deem 'settled' only what was settled in the cited precedents—a patentee’s sales ''without restrictions'' exhaust patent rights in the item sold." Thus, the Supreme Court's sweeping exhaustion language applies precedentially only to cases in which either the sale was without condition or restriction or else the sale was made with a tie-in or price-fixing condition. "But the Court did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights."

Similarly, in ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', the Supreme Court's sweeping language must now be limited to the factual context of the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, although some language in ''Univis'',  like language in other decisions in the area, can be taken out of context and read as going beyond the specific restrictions involved, the most the Court ruled, even as to patent law all by itself, was that a vertical price-control restriction was ineffective to preserve patent rights after sales of articles embodying the patents. While ''Univis'' is controlling on what it decided on the issues before it, we do not think it appropriate to give broad effect to language in ''Univis'', taken out of context, to support an otherwise-unjustified conclusion here on a question not faced there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal Circuit therefore drew this conclusion from the past series of Supreme Court cases on exhaustion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the foregoing reasons, we think that the best lesson to draw from the Supreme Court’s precedents, as applied to the question before us, is that a patentee may preserve its patent rights by otherwise-proper restrictions when it makes and sells patented articles itself and not only when it contracts out manufacturing and sales.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Patent law trumps common law=====

The Federal Circuit returned to the common law and Lord Coke's commentary on it. Again, the court insisted that Congress had overridden the common law's prohibitions on post-sale restraints, in order to promote technological progress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hatever considerations might go into a jurisdiction’s choice as to the background rule for personal property in general, lawmaking authorities may reasonably make different choices for particular kinds of property. Notably, as to intellectual property in its various forms, Congress, implementing the Constitution, has long deemed it important to incentivize creation and disclosure through grants to the creator of rights to exclude others for a time.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. That overriding legislative prescription removes the patented-article sale from the scope of Lord Coke’s 1628 description of his country’s general judicially fashioned property law.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. In short, notwithstanding Lord Coke’s description of English general personal-property judge-made law, the patent-specific statutory analysis must govern here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Likely effects on public=====

The court then turned to what it called "the likely real-world consequences of one answer or another to the exhaustion question presented here." The court noted that in ''Kirtsaeng'' the Supreme Court had envisioned serious adverse effects on competition unless Coke's 1628 property law rules were followed. The Federal Circuit said that did not apply to patents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e see no basis for predicting the extreme, lop-sided impacts the Court found plausible in ''Kirtsaeng'' in different circumstances. ''Mallinckrodt'' has been the governing case law since 1992 and has been reiterated in subsequent precedent. And yet we have been given no reliable demonstration of widespread problems not being solved in the marketplace. Given ''General Talking Pictures'', the only question is about patentees’ ability to do for their own sales what they already can do by contracting out their manufacturing and sales. Regarding the specific scenario we are addressing today—in which the patentee has sought to preserve its patent rights by conditioning its first sale on a single-use/no-resale restriction of which the accused infringer had adequate notice at the time of purchase—we have been given no proof of a significant problem with enforcing patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Federal Circuit maintained, the conduct challenged here can have benefits. Under Lexmark's program, customers who agree to the restriction pay a lower price than those who do not. It could be that the companies that refill the cartridges use inferior products that could harm the Lexmark machines, which "could harm Lexmark’s reputation." To assume that the restrictions are illegitimate would run counter to the trends "over the last four decades, that have displaced the strict condemnation of various vertical restrictions that characterized" earlier antitrust and patent-misuse law in the first part of the twentieth century. “Field-of-use, territorial, and other limitations on intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as possible.” Therefore, the court concluded it is appropriate to apply to post-sale restrictions the same tolerance that the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine accords limitations in manufacturing licenses.

====International exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed it ''Jazz Photo'' opinion and rejected contentions that ''Kirtsaeng'' had undermined the basis for ''Jazz Photo''. The Federal Circuit insisted that "''Kirtsaeng'' says nothing about patent law."

The court emphasized the differences between patent law and copyright law. For example, patent law gives patentees an exclusive right to use of the invention but copyright law gives no general exclusionary right as to use (it gives exclusive public performance and display "use" rights, but not others). Also, it is much more costly and time-consuming to obtain a patent than a copyright. The court did not explain, however, the way that or other differences between copyrights and patents called for contrary results as to international exhaustion.

The court did say that the US patent statute gives patentees the reward available from "sales in American markets, not from sales in foreign markets." A sale in a foreign market therefore does not furnish a proper basis for finding exhaustion. "American markets differ substantially from markets in many other countries, and not just because of disparities in wealth that can lead to dramatically different prices" in this country and abroad (as was the case in ''Kirtsaeng''). "Government policies differ dramatically, including policies on price regulation and, most particularly, policies on the availability and scope of patent protection." The court did not explain further, however, whether and how such dramatic differences in policy applied to the toner cartridges at issue in the present case.

The court then turned to the only Supreme Court case on foreign exhaustion, ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Graff was the assignee of a US patent. Boesch bought the product from a German supplier who had a prior-user right under German law to make and sell the product, because the supplier had begun activity before the application for the German counterpart patent was filed. The US assignee and the inventor had no connection with Boesch. When Graff imported the product into the US, Boesch sued for infringement. The US courts found Boesch liable. The rights that Boesch had under German law did not entitle him to import the product into the US. That is governed by US law. The US patentee had never "received any royalty or given any license to use the patented article in any part of the United States."
Accordingly, the court held, a foreign sale does not of its own force authorize importation into the US.

This does not mean, however, that a patentee by its conduct cannot waive its US rights, be estopped from asserting them, or be found to have granted an implied license.

The court expressed concern that overruling ''Jazz Photo'' would harm the US drug industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the court rejected a proposal that exhaustion should be presumed unless the patentee express states that it reserves its US rights. Foreign governments might "prohibit sellers from stating reservations of rights that would make importation into and sale in the United States more difficult." Also: "Intermediary companies between the foreign purchase and the importation into the United States may be created that make it difficult for the U.S. patentee to carry an affirmative burden of proving adequate notice of reservations attached to a foreign-sold article."

===Dissenting opinion===

Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented from both branches of the court's exhaustion analysis. Judge Dyk summarized his dissent in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would overrule our decision in ''Mallinckrodt'' as inconsistent with governing Supreme Court authority and overrule ''Jazz Photo'' to the extent that it imposes a blanket ban on foreign exhaustion. I would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued that the majority had misunderstood the Supreme Court's exhaustion jurisprudence in order to substitute its own ideas of the proper balance between patent rights and public rights. He began by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, I agree with the government that ''Mallinckrodt'' was wrong when decided, and in any event cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that since 1850 the Supreme Court has held that a sale by the patentee or its licensee exhausts all patent rights. In such cases, "The question of whether the seller has 'authorized' the buyer to use or resell the item is simply irrelevant." Post-sale restrictions could not be enforced under federal patent law. The only Supreme Court case to depart from that principle was ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 1 (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; and it was explicitly overruled five years later by ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. 502, 518 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the overruled ''Dick'' case that a patentee could impost a post-sale restriction by giving a buyer notice of it was "the same as the panel’s holding in ''Mallinckrodt'' and the majority’s holding in this case."

He insisted that the majority opinion misread the ''Motion Picture Patents'' decision by asserting "that it only 'held particular restrictions improper' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. but 'did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights.'" He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is not accurate. ''Motion Picture Patents'' did not leave behind the remnants of ''A.B. Dick''—minus tie-ins and resale price maintenance. To the contrary, the Court in ''Motion Picture Patents'' found that “[t]he patent law furnishes no warrant for” the restrictions imposed by the patent owner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later cases, such as ''Quanta'', confirmed this "broad patent exhaustion rule [in ''Motion Picture Patents''] and left no room for a resurrection of ''A.B. Dick''."

He next turned to the majority's referenced to "conditional sales" and "unconditional sales," and said that the majority misconstrued the terms. "Conditional sales," he said, as used in pre-''Mallinckrodt'' case law referred only to the retention of title for a security interest in installment purchases. "In other words, a sale with restrictions could nonetheless be an 'unconditional' sale in which title passes, with the restrictions invalid under the patent laws because of exhaustion."

He then criticized the majority for making up special rules for patent cases that differed from the common law and general legal principles, citing Supreme Court admonitions not to do that--"The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed us not to ignore traditional legal principles to fashion rules 'unique to patent disputes.'"{{efn|He cited as examples: ''eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.'', 547 U.S. 388, 393 (2006); ''Global–Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.'', 563 U.S. 754 (2011); ''MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.'', 549 U.S. 118, 132 n. 11 (2007).}}

Finally, Judge Dyk took issue on multiple grounds with the majority's efforts to distinguish and limit the Supreme Court's rulings. "The majority’s justifications for refusing to follow Supreme Court authority establishing the exhaustion rule misconceive our role as a subordinate court." Each justification in the majority decision was unsupportable, he said.

* "First, the majority characterizes the statement of the exhaustion rule in the Supreme Court cases as mere dictum because in those cases there was either no restriction imposed or the restriction would otherwise violate the antitrust laws. But the cases impose no such qualification on the rule announced. The Supreme Court has repeatedly advised the courts of appeals that our task is to follow the rules proclaimed by the Court, and not to attempt to distinguish Supreme Court cases on their facts."
* "Second, the majority relies on 35 U.S.C. §§&amp;nbsp;271(a) and 154(a)(1) to suggest that a broad reading of the exhaustion doctrine is inconsistent with statutory language making an act of infringement .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. any use or sale of a patented invention 'without authority' of the patent owner, and providing the patent owner with a 'right to exclude.'" But the patent exhaustion doctrine is a limitation on the operation of those sections, and applies notwithstanding them.
* "Third, the majority claims that giving full sweep to the articulation of the exhaustion doctrine in Quanta and other cases would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The majority suggests it would be incongruous if 'a patentee cannot preserve its patent rights against uses of a patented article .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. if, instead of licensing someone else to make and sell the article, it chooses to make and sell the article itself.'&amp;#8239;”

:But ''General Talking Pictures'' was a case of a license to manufacture in a limited field,  not a sale with a post-sale restriction. The cases recognize that distinction. Thus, in ''Quanta'' the Supreme Court stated that ''General Talking Pictures'' "held that exhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no authority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use.”&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. at 636.&lt;/ref&gt; And where the manufacturer in that case (Intel) did have a general authority to make and sell, the Supreme Court held that exhaustion applied to the sale.

:The majority found "tension" between "the Supreme Court’s broad statement of the exhaustion rule and ''General Talking Pictures''" and sought to resolve it by extending the rule of ''General Talking Pictures'' and contracting the exhaustion doctrine in the area of possible conflict. But, Dyk maintained:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is not our task to ignore Supreme Court rulings as "unjustifi[ed]" or "unsound" because they are purportedly inconsistent with other Supreme Court cases. The distinction between restrictions on sales (impermissible) and restrictions on licensees (permissible) exists in the Court’s precedent, and it is not for us to decide if it is a sound distinction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* "Finally, the majority proposes that we should somehow sustain the restriction here because it may be pro-competitive. Exhaustion does not turn on whether a particular post-sale restriction is desirable or undesirable, pro-competitive or anti-competitive, but whether the sale was authorized and the item has passed beyond the scope of the patent monopoly." Furthermore, the Supreme Court said in ''Kirtsaeng'' that a prohibition on resale is "manifestly anti-competitive."&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng'', 133 S.Ct. at 1363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyk concluded his discussion of domestic exhaustion with the statement: "There is, in sum, no colorable basis for the majority’s failure to follow the exhaustion rule for domestic sales as articulated by the Court in ''Quanta'' and numerous other cases."

====International exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued for a nuanced balance that called for different results depending on whether the patentee was responsible for the sale abroad that was alleged to trigger exhaustion.

He began by pointing out that because Lexmark's foreign sales were made without any restrictions or reservations, "even under the majority’s cramped view of exhaustion, there is no question that the sales would have exhausted Lexmark’s domestic patent rights. The issue is whether the foreign location of the sale should lead to a different result, as we previously held in ''Jazz Photo''."

He then turned to "the centerpiece of the majority’s holding that there is a doctrinal blanket ban on foreign exhaustion, namely the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; But "''Boesch'' announced no such blanket ban," he said. "It did not even involve an authorized sale by the holder of U.S. patent rights but rather a sale by a third party under a foreign law’s prior use exception."{{efn|Under German law, the defendant had a ''prior user right'' to use the invention because it had begun to do so before the patentee filed its patent application.}} But "''Boesch'' does not apply here because the foreign sales were made by Lexmark."

In every US lower court decision before ''Jazz Photo'': "When the sale was made by an entity not holding U.S. patent rights, as in ''Boesch'', or when the authorized foreign seller clearly reserved U.S. rights, there was no exhaustion." In contrast, "where the foreign sale was made by a seller holding U.S. patent rights without a contractual reservation of U.S. rights, exhaustion occurred as a result of an authorized foreign sale."

Dyk maintained that "''Kirtsaeng'' provides significant guidance and cannot be dismissed as simply a copyright case, or as limited to the 'first sale' provision of the Copyright Act." Rather, the policies that animated ''Kirtsaeng'' typically apply to patent exhaustion. But because in some cases a difference may be significant, there should be abalanced approach. Dyk argued for "put[ting] the burden on the U.S. rights holder to provide notice of a reservation of U.S. rights to the purchaser." Thus, he "would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights."

==Supreme Court==
In March 2016, Impression filed a petition for ''[[certiorari]]'' in the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Impression-Products-v.-Lexmark-cert-petition-no-appendix.pdf Petition for a Writ of Certiorari], ''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1189.htm No. 15-1189].&lt;/ref&gt; Impression presented these questions in its petition:&lt;ref&gt;Br. Pet. at ''i''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Whether a "conditional sale" that transfers title to the patented item while specifying post-sale restrictions on the article’s use or resale avoids application of the patent exhaustion doctrine and therefore permits the enforcement of such post-sale restrictions through the patent law’s infringement remedy.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Whether, in light of this Court’s holding in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1363 (2013), that the common law doctrine barring restraints on alienation that is the basis of exhaustion doctrine "makes no geographical distinctions," a sale of a patented article—authorized by the U.S. patentee—that takes place outside of the United States exhausts the U.S. patent rights in that article.

[[File:SCOTUS Oral Argument. 15-1189. Impressions Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.ogg|thumb|Supreme Court oral argument 03/21/17]]
On June 20, 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file briefs in this case expressing the views of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', No. 15-1189, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 3982, at *1 (June 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, the government filed the requested ''amicus curiae'' brief. It recommended grant of ''certiorari'' on both questions. The brief argues that the "Federal Circuit's decision misreads" the Supreme Court's precedents and "would substantially erode the exhaustion doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/15-1189-US-Amicus.pdf ''Brief For The United States As Amicus Curiae''] on petition for certiorari at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court granted ''certiorari'' on December 2, 2016&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', 2016 U.S. LEXIS 7275.&lt;/ref&gt; and heard oral argument in the case on March 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Mann. ''[http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/argument-analysis-justices-skeptical-categorical-exhaustion-patent-rights/ Argument analysis: Justices skeptical of categorical “exhaustion” of patent rights]'', [[SCOTUSblog]] (March 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court published its decisions on May 30, 2017.

===Majority===
A unanimous Court{{efn|Justice Gorsuch joined the Court after oral arguments were heard and took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}} found that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights upon first sale domestically, even with the single-use/no-resale restrictions imposed by Lexmark in contracts with its customers, although such restrictions could be enforced under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the exhaustion doctrine has a long history&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and that any change would have significant effects on commerce in the modern world, noting that "extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain,"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that complex modern [[supply chain]]s can involve large numbers of patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8 (citing [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15-1189-tsac-Costco-et-al.pdf Brief for Costco Wholesalers, Corp. et al.] as ''[[Amicus curiae|Amicus Curiae]]'' at 7-9; [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Intel-Vizio-Amicus-Brief-as-Filed.pdf Brief for Intel, Corp. et al.] as ''Amicus Curiae'' at 17, n. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Citing, ''inter alia'', an [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] filed by [[Intel]] that a generic smartphone could practice an estimated 250,000 patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, compared the situation to automobile repair shops: "The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/supreme-court-patent-rights-lexmark.html | title = Supreme Court Rules Patent Laws Can’t Be Used to Prevent Reselling | first1=  Adam | last1 = Liptak | first2=Vindu | last2=Goel | date = May 30, 2017 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven justices joined the Court's opinion extending that reasoning to items imported from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lexmark had argued, and the Federal Circuit agreed, that sale abroad "does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee 'expressly or implicitly transfers or licenses' its rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13 (quoting [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15-1189-respondent-merits.pdf Brief for Respondent] 36-37)(some internal punctuation marks removed).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, however, ruled that "[a]n authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court relied on its 2013 decision in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' on a nearly identical issue under copyright law. Because the underlying statute was not clear as to its geographical scope, the Court in ''Kirtsaeng'' decided that, because the statute was based in the common law exhaustion doctrine, which is not limited in geographic extent, the statute at issue was therefore not intended to be limited to only U.S. sales.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the same principle to patent law, which historically has a close connection with copyright law, was "straightforward"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bond between [copyright and patent law] leaves no room for a rift on the question of international exhaustion".&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial dissent===
Justice Ginsburg dissented from the Court's holding with respect to imported items. Adhering to substantially the same reasoning of her dissent in ''Kirtsaeng'', Justice Ginsburg argued that because patent law is territorial and the sale of an item abroad is "independent[] of the U.S. patent system, it makes little sense to say that such a sale exhausts an inventor's U.S. patent rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt; She would have upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
{{Update|section|date=May 2017|inaccurate=yes|reason=The content of this section pertains to the Federal Circuit decision, which was reversed by SCOTUS and therefore the reactions do not reflect the actual law after the SCOTUS decision was released.}}
===Gerstein===

Robert M. Gerstein concluded that further review in the Supreme Court was likely:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the Supreme Court’s interest in patent cases, a vigorous dissent in ''Lexmark'' that relies on a number of Supreme Court precedents, including ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', and the position of the Justice Department that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'', it would not be surprising to see the Supreme Court take up Lexmark in its next term.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Gerstein, [http://www.marshallip.com/publications/federal-circuit-sidesteps-supreme-court-twice-in-exhaustion-ruling/ ''Federal Circuit Sidesteps Supreme Court Twice in Exhaustion Ruling''] (Feb. 15, 2016).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dodd and Dowd===

Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd viewed the decision as an affirmation of strong patent rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' embraces a very strong view of patent rights and a narrow view of the scope of exhaustion. It affirms that patent holders have wide latitude to segment and control distribution in the market channels for products covered by patents. This latitude is particularly wide with respect to limiting the import into the United States of patented goods sold in authorized sales in foreign markets even where restrictions on resale were not proven to have been communicated to foreign buyers. Even so, the court left open the possibility that foreign sales, under the right circumstances, may incorporate an implied license to import and use the product within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd, [https://www.andrewskurth.com/insights-1307.html ''The En Banc Federal Circuit Holds That Patent Rights Are Not Exhausted by Prior Restricted Sales or by Foreign Sales''] (Feb. 19, 2016).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cukierski and Masia===

Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia see the decision as "pro-patent owner" but warn again premature celebration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But take caution—it is likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to hear the case. Given the tension between this case and the Supreme Court’s language in ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', along with the discord at the district court level and among commentators before the Federal Circuit’s decision, there’s a good chance the Supreme Court will do so. Until the Supreme Court has its say, you should take precautions in case the Supreme Court takes an expansive view of patent exhaustion and decides to remove these exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia, [http://www.ngelaw.com/Patent-Exhaustion/ ''Federal Circuit Affirms Pro-Patent Owner Limits on Patent Exhaustion''] (Feb. 16, 2015),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Without Precedent"===

Another commentator (unsigned comment) indicated a skeptical view of the Federal Circuit's tendency to march to a different drummer. After quoting Judge Dyk's admonition, “We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court,” he (or she) observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For present purposes, it is simply worth noting that the Federal Circuit appears to be inching closer again to the concept that patent law is simply a unique beast, with unique rules and requirements. The Supreme Court has taken a skeptical view of that approach in the past. And may well again.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brannlaw.com/ip-wise/without-precedent/ ''Without Precedent''] (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jahn, Pichler, and Lo===

Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler and Lincoln Lo raise many questions (mostly about "clear communication") about what the ''Lexmark'' majority opinion left unresolved:

* Conflict or tension with Quanta: "''Quanta'' expressly distinguished implied licenses and exhaustion, holding that disclaimers of license rights are 'irrelevant' where 'the right to practice the patents is based not on implied license but on exhaustion.'&amp;#8239;" But "the Federal Circuit appears to treat exhaustion like an implied license—one that the patentee can disclaim by 'clearly communicate[d]' restrictions." ''Quanta'' appears to hold that the patentee's attempt to impose a post-sale restriction on a manufacturing licensee is ineffective if the license does not conform to the ''General Talking Pictures'' case.
* "[W]hat arrangement between a seller and buyer is sufficient to deny 'authority.'? It was undisputed in ''Lexmark'' that there was 'an express and enforceable contractual agreement' between Lexmark and each end-user, and that the no-resale and no-reuse restrictions were binding on end users.  Yet throughout the ''Lexmark'' opinion, the majority suggests that restrictions may be sufficient if 'clearly communicated'—even if well short of a contractual meeting of the minds."
* Another way to put this is what is a "clear communication"? In ''Jazz Photo'', the Federal Circuit noted that the “package instructions [were] not in the form of a contractual agreement by the purchaser to limit reuse of the cameras.”  Accordingly, “There was no showing of a ‘meeting of the minds’ whereby the purchaser, and those obtaining the purchaser's discarded camera, may be deemed to have breached a contract or violated a license limited to a single use of the camera.”&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz Photo'', 264 F.3d at 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; The writers conclude, therefore, "It is unclear if the Federal Circuit intended an expansion of the patentee-seller’s ability to avoid exhaustion."
* Also, how clear must a "clear communication" be? "The Federal Circuit appears to limit infringement claims against subsequent downstream buyers to those 'having knowledge of the restrictions.' The appellate court did not elaborate on what defenses a subsequent downstream purchaser ''without knowledge'' may have, assuming no exhaustion. The court only mentions in passing that 'we do not have before us the questions that would arise, whether under principles governing ''bona fide'' purchasers or otherwise, if a downstream re-purchaser acquired a patented article with less than actual knowledge of the restriction.'&amp;#8239;"
* Finally, does the court's focus on “clear communication” have a negative impact on post-sale restrictions that a limited licensee under ''General Talking Pictures'' is required to impose? "The Federal Circuit suggested repeatedly that buyers’ knowledge of the licensee's field of use limitation may be required for a licensee's sale to be non-exhaustive. While ''General Talking Pictures'' did not clearly resolve this question, many licensors have assumed that sales by a licensee outside of its licensed field are unauthorized altogether and are therefore non-exhaustive regardless of the purchaser's knowledge of the field of use limitation." Therefore, does the emphasis, here "on the buyer’s knowledge, even if ''dicta'', add to the uncertainty concerning this issue"?&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler, and Lincoln Lo. [http://www.mofo.com/resources/publications/2016/02/160222restrictedsales ''Federal Circuit Holds that Restricted Sales and Foreign Sales Do Not Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castanias, Nix, and Kazhdan===

Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan also point to unresolved issues over which patent owners "must still be cautious":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' explicitly left open several fact-specific questions, including (i) what happens if someone acquires a patented article with "less than actual knowledge" of the restrictions placed on the original sale by the patent owner and (ii) when would a foreign buyer have an "implied license" to sell in the United States, independent of patent exhaustion. These issues will surely be raised in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan, [http://www.jonesday.com/ien-banci-federal-circuit-reaffirms-that-foreign-sales-and-restricted-domestic-sales-dont-exhaust-patent-rights-02-17-2016/ '' En Banc Federal Circuit Reaffirms that Foreign Sales and Restricted Domestic Sales Don't Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crouch===

Dennis Crouch, in ''Patently-O'' commented on the issues and provided a summary of the merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind subsequent purchasers. Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the potential of gumming up the marketplace.  The Federal Circuit in this case went all the way to the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted.  I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market – and have also repaired them several times.  Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights.  Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods.  I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Crouch, [http://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/01/resale-prevent-arbitrage.html ''Can Your Patent Block Repair and Resale and Prevent Arbitrage?''], {{smallcaps|Patently-O}} (Jan. 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'''Jewish American literature''' holds an essential place in the [[American literature|literary history of the United States]]. It encompasses traditions of writing in [[American English|English]], primarily, as well as in other languages, the most important of which has been [[Yiddish literature|Yiddish]]. While critics and authors generally acknowledge the notion of a distinctive corpus and practice of writing about [[American Jews|Jewishness in America]], many writers resist being pigeonholed as "Jewish voices." Also, many nominally Jewish writers cannot be considered representative of Jewish American literature, one example being [[Isaac Asimov]].

==Beginnings==
Beginning with the [[memoir]]s and [[petition]]s composed by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] immigrants who arrived in America during the mid 17th century, Jewish American writing grew over the subsequent centuries to flourish in other genres as well, including [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[drama]].The first notable voice in Jewish- American literature was Emma Lazarus whose poem "The New Colossus" on the Statue of Liberty became the great hymnal of American immigration. [[Gertrude Stein]] became one of the most influential prose-stylists of the early 20th century.

The early twentieth century saw the appearance of two pioneering American Jewish novels: Abraham Cahan's "The Rise of David Levinsky" and Henry Roth's "Call it Sleep." It reached some of its most mature expression in the 20th century "Jewish American [[novel]]s"  by [[Saul Bellow]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Chaim Potok]], and [[Philip Roth]]. Their work explored the conflicting pulls between [[secularism|secular society]] and [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] which were acutely felt by the immigrants who passed through [[Ellis Island]] and by their children and grandchildren.

==Present day==
More recent authors like [[Nicole Krauss]], [[Paul Auster]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], [[Alan Kaufman (writer)|Alan Kaufman]], [[Lev Raphael]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] have continued to examine dilemmas of identity in their work, turning their attention especially to [[the Holocaust]] and the trends of both ongoing [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and cultural rediscovery exhibited by younger generations of American Jews. Arguably the most influential of all American Jewish novels was [[Leon Uris]]' ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.{{Fact|date=May 2018}} Its story of the struggle to create the modern state of Israel translated into Russian became the inspiration for hundreds of thousands of Russian immigrants to Israel. Modern Jewish American novels often contain (a few or many) Jewish characters and address issues and themes of importance to Jewish American society such as [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], [[Zionism]]/[[Israel]], and [[antisemitism]], along with the recent phenomenon known as "[[New antisemitism]]."

Three Jewish-American writers have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], [[Saul Bellow]], and [[Joseph Brodsky]]. Magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have proved to be instrumental in exposing many Jewish American writers to a wider reading public.

==Stereotypes of Jews==
{{main|Stereotypes of Jews in literature}}

Although Jewish stereotypes first appeared in works by non-Jewish writers, after [[World War II]], it was often Jewish American writers themselves who evoked such fixed images. The prevalence of antisemitic stereotypes in the works of such authors has sometimes been interpreted an expression of self-hatred; however, Jewish American authors have also used these negative stereotypes in order to refute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature: I - M |first=Emmanuel Sampath|last=Nelson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Company |year=2005 |page=1175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Xk28_4NBoC&amp;pg=PA1175&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3ADaTYq5J4i6sQOLkISGDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, American-Jewish literature has also strongly celebrated American life. It has been primarily more an American than a Jewish literature. Perhaps the preeminent example of this is the great breakthrough novel of Saul Bellow  ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]]''.

According to Sanford V. Sternlicht, the first generation of Jewish-American authors presented "realistic portrayals - warts and all" of Jewish immigrants. In contrast, some second or third-generation Jewish-American authors deliberately "reinforced negative stereotypes with satire and a selective realism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sternlicht |first1=Sanford |title=Masterpieces of Jewish American literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-YII_WikhAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hgvaTZLuFZDQsAOL3M2MDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 22, 2011 |year=2007 |page=8 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Westport, CT, USA |isbn=978-0-313-33857-1 |oclc=76183866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48266">[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Pierre de Coubertin|Under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] won a gold medal in the literature category at the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]].]]

There were '''146 medalists''' in [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|the art competitions]] that were part of the [[Olympic Games]] from [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] until [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]]. These art competitions were considered an integral part of the movement by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and necessary to recapture the complete essence of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Their absence before the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], according to journalism professor Richard Stanton, stems from Coubertin "not wanting to fragment the focus of his new and fragile movement".&lt;ref name="Stanton3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Stanton|first = Richard|title = The Forgotten Olympic Art Competitions|publisher = [[Trafford Publishing]]|edition = 1st|date = 2000|location = [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]|page = 3|isbn = 1552126064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art competitions were originally planned for inclusion in the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] but were delayed after that edition's change in venue from Rome to London following the 1906 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref name="Stanton18"&gt;Stanton, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] they had grown to be considered internationally relevant and potentially "a milestone in advancing public awareness of art as a whole".&lt;ref name="Stanton69"&gt;Stanton, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their first three appearances, the art competitions were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] split these into subcategories in the hopes of increasing participation.&lt;ref name="Stanton95"&gt;Stanton, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was a successful strategy, the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories.&lt;ref name="Stanton146"&gt;Stanton, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.&lt;ref name="Stanton158"&gt;Stanton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a final appearance at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], art competitions were removed from the Olympic program. Planners of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee.&lt;ref name="Stanton210"&gt;Stanton, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments,&lt;ref name="Stanton211"&gt;Stanton, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions during the course of the Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer [[Olympic games|Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Stanton213"&gt;Stanton, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC does not track medalists in Olympic art competitions in its database and thus the prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges were not required to distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as [[Alex Diggelmann]] of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition.&lt;ref name="1948 Report"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948|page = 536|publisher = The Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad|location = [[London]]|date = 1951|url = http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948part2.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's [[Josef Petersen]], who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's [[Jean Jacoby]] is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author [[Aale Tynni]] was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals,&lt;ref name="SRArt"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|author2 = Jeroen Heijmans|author3 = Bill Mallon|author4 = Hilary Evans|title = Art Competitions|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|accessdate = 2012-03-07|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66VSjSXMP?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|archivedate = 2012-03-28|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem ''Ode to Sport'' under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, as if it were a joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany.&lt;ref name="Coubertin"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|author2 = Jeroen Heijmans|author3 = Bill Mallon|author4 = Hilary Evans|title = Pierre, Baron de Coubertin Biography and Olympic Results|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/pierre-baron-de-coubertin-1.html|accessdate = 2012-03-07|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66VT2aWgB?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/pierre-baron-de-coubertin-1.html|archivedate = 2012-03-28|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two individuals, [[Walter W.

A '''literary cycle''' is a group of stories focused on common figures, often (though not necessarily) based on mythical figures or loosely on historical ones. Cycles which deal with an entire country are sometimes referred to as '''matters'''. A fictional cycle is often referred to as a [[mythos]].

==Examples from folk and classical literature==
*The [[Anansi]] tales, which center on the Ashanti  of Ghana trickster spider-spirit Anansi, and its variations in the Americas as [[Ti Malice and Bouki]] in Haiti, [[Br'er Rabbit]] or John and Old Master in the Southern US.
*The tales of the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian nights]], brought together by the [[frame story]] of the tale of [[Scheherazade]] and [[Shahryār]].
*The four [[troubadour]]s [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Pere Salvatge]], [[Roger Bernard III of Foix]], and [[Peter III of Aragon]] composed a cycle of four ''[[sirventes]]'' in the summer of 1285 concerning the [[Aragonese Crusade]].
*The [[Matter of Britain]] (or the "Arthurian cycle"), which centers on [[King Arthur]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]
*The [[Matter of France]] (or the "Carolingian cycle"), which centers on [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Paladin|Twelve Peers]]
*The [[Henriad]], the four plays of Shakespeare centered on Henry V.
* Two examples of Japanese cycles are: the [[Matter of Japan]] (''[[Kojiki]]'', ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', etc.) and the Genji-Heike Cycle (''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'', ''[[Gikeiki]]'' about [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]], etc.). Also popular are the [[Soga Monogatari|Soga Brothers]] and [[Forty-seven rōnin|Forty-Seven Ronin]] cycles.
*The [[Matter of Rome]] (or the "cycle of Rome"), which centers on [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Alexander the Great]]
*The [[Mythological Cycle]], which centers on the [[Celtic pantheon]]
*The [[Fenian Cycle]], which centers on [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] and the [[Fianna]]
*The [[Cycle of the Kings]], which centers on the [[monarchy of Ireland]]
*The [[Reynard cycle]], which centers on the fabular fox [[Reynard]]
*[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (or the "Ring cycle"), which centers on the Ring and the [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse pantheon]]
*The voyages of [[Sinbad the sailor]], the hero of a cycle of tales of monsters, magical places, and supernatural phenomena met on his successive voyages.
*The [[epic cycle]] centering on the [[Trojan War]]
*The [[Ulster Cycle]], which centers on [[Cú Chulainn]] and the [[Ulster|Kingdom of Ulster]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8550">'''Misorientation''' is the difference in [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] orientation between two [[Crystallite|crystallites]] in a polycrystalline material.

In crystalline materials, the orientation of a crystallite is defined by a transformation from a sample reference frame (i.e. defined by the direction of a rolling or extrusion process and two orthogonal directions) to the local reference frame of the crystalline lattice, as defined by the basis of the [[unit cell]].  In the same way, misorientation is the transformation necessary to move from one local crystal frame to some other crystal frame.  That is, it is the distance in orientation space between two distinct orientations.  If the orientations are specified in terms of matrices of direction cosines g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the misorientation operator ∆g&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; going from A to B can be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{B}=\Delta g_{AB} g_{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{B}g_{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where the term g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the reverse operation of g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, transformation from crystal frame A back to the sample frame.  This provides an alternate description of misorientation as the successive operation of transforming from the first crystal frame (A) back to the sample frame and subsequently to the new crystal frame (B).

Various methods can be used to represent this transformation operation, such as: [[Euler angles]], Rodrigues vectors, [[axis angle|axis/angle]] (where the axis is specified as a crystallographic direction), or [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternions]].

== Symmetry and misorientation ==
The effect of [[crystal symmetry]] on misorientations is to reduce the fraction of the full orientation space necessary to uniquely represent all possible misorientation relationships.  For example, cubic crystals (i.e. FCC) have 24 symmetrically related orientations.  Each of these orientations is physically indistinguishable, though mathematically distinct.  Therefore, the size of orientation space is reduced by a factor of 24.  This defines the '''fundamental zone''' (FZ) for cubic symmetries.  For the misorientation between two cubic crystallites, each possesses its 24 inherent symmetries.  In addition, there exists a switching symmetry, defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=\Delta g_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;
which recognizes the invariance of misorientation to direction; A→B or B→A.  The fraction of the total orientation space in the cubic-cubic fundamental zone for misorientation is then given by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{24\cdot24\cdot2}=\frac{1}{1152}&lt;/math&gt;
or 1/48 the volume of the cubic fundamental zone.  This also has the effect of limiting the maximum unique misorientation angle to 62.8°&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Disorientation''' describes the misorientation with the smallest possible rotation angle out of all symmetrically equivalent misorientations that fall within the FZ (usually specified as having an axis in the standard stereographic triangle for cubics).  Calculation of these variants involves application of crystal symmetry operators to each of the orientations during the calculation of misorientation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=O_{B}^{crys}g_{B}(O_{A}^{crys}g_{A})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
where O&lt;sup&gt;crys&lt;/sup&gt; denotes one of the symmetry operators for the material.

== Misorientation distribution ==
[[Image:MDF rodrigues AA5083.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Example MDF shown in Rodrigues space for a sample of AA5083 plate]]

The misorientation distribution (MD) is analogous to the [[Orientation distribution function|ODF]] used in characterizing texture.  The MD describes the probability of the misorientation between any two grains falling into a range &lt;math&gt;d \Delta g&lt;/math&gt; around a given misorientation &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;.  While similar to a probability density, the MD is not mathematically the same due to the normalization.  The intensity in a MD is given as "multiples of random density" (MRD) with respect to the distribution expected in a material with uniformly distributed misorientations.  The MD can be calculated by either series expansion, typically using generalized [[spherical harmonics]], or by a discrete binning scheme, where each data point is assigned to a bin and accumulated.

== Graphical representation ==
[[Image:Mackenzie plot.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Distribution of misorientation angles for a randomly texture polycrystal, from Mackenzie(1958)]]

Discrete misorientations or the misorientation distribution can be fully described as plots in the Euler angle, axis/angle, or Rodrigues vector space.  Unit quaternions, while computationally convenient, do not lend themselves to graphical representation because of their four-dimensional nature.  For any of the representations, plots are usually constructed as sections through the fundamental zone; along φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Euler angles, at increments of rotation angle for axis/angle, and at constant ρ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (parallel to &lt;001&gt;) for Rodrigues.   Due to the irregular shape of the cubic-cubic FZ, the plots are typically given as sections through the cubic FZ with the more restrictive boundaries overlaid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mackenzie plots are a one-dimensional representation of the MD plotting the relative frequency of the misorientation angle, irrespective of the axis.  Mackenzie determined the misorientation distribution for a cubic sample with a random texture.

== Example of calculating misorientation ==
The following is an example of the algorithm for determining the axis/angle representation of misorientation between two texture components given as Euler angles:
:Copper [90,35,45]
:S3 [59,37,63]
The first step is converting the Euler angle representation to an orientation matrix ''g'' by:
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi  &amp; s\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
-c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; -s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; c\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
s\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; -c\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; c\Phi 
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''c''''' and '''''s''''' represent ''cosine'' and ''sine'', respectively.  This yields the following orientation matrices:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{copper}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.579 &amp; 0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
-0.579 &amp; -0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
0.574 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.819 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{S3}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.376 &amp; 0.756 &amp; 0.536 \\
-0.770 &amp; -0.577 &amp; 0.273 \\
0.516 &amp; -0.310 &amp; 0.799 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The misorientation is then:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{copper}g_{S3}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
0.970 &amp; 0.149 &amp; -0.194 \\
-0.099 &amp; 0.965 &amp; 0.244 \\
0.224 &amp; -0.218 &amp; 0.950 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The axis/angle description (with the axis as a unit vector) is related to the misorientation matrix by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;cos\Theta=(g_{11}+g_{22}+g_{33}-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{1}=(g_{23}-g_{32})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{2}=(g_{31}-g_{13})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{3}=(g_{12}-g_{21})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
(There are errors in the similar formulae for the components of 'r' given in the book by Randle and Engler (see refs.), which will be corrected in the next edition of their book. The above are the correct versions, note a different form for these equations has to be used if Theta = 180 degrees.)

For the copper—S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; misorientation given by Δg&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, the axis/angle description is 19.5° about [0.689,0.623,0.369], which is only 2.3° from &lt;221&gt;.  This result is only one of the 1152 symmetrically related possibilities but does specify the disorientation.  This can be verified by considering all possible combinations of orientation symmetry (including switching symmetry).

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to classical architecture:

'''[[Classical architecture]]''' &amp;ndash; architecture of [[classical antiquity]], that is, [[ancient Greek architecture]] and the [[ancient Roman architecture|architecture of ancient Rome]]. It also refers to the style or styles of architecture influenced by those.  For example, most of the styles originating in post-renaissance Europe can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir John Summerson in ''The Classical Language of Architecture''.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== What ''type'' of thing is classical architecture? ==
Classical architecture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Architecture]] &amp;ndash; both the process and product of planning, designing and construction. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
** [[Architectural style]] &amp;ndash; classification of architecture in terms of the use of form, techniques, materials, time period, region and other stylistic influences.
* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "classical architecture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, classical architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Classical architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
* Form of [[classicism]] &amp;ndash; high regard in the arts for classical antiquity, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate.
** [[Classicism#In architecture|Classicism in architecture]] &amp;ndash; places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.

== Classical architectural styles ==
* [[Byzantine architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Gothic architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Renaissance architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Baroque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Palladian architecture]] &amp;ndash; European style of architecture derived from the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.
* [[Georgian architecture]] &amp;ndash; set of architectural styles current between 1720 and 1840.  In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world's equivalent of European Rococo.
* [[Neoclassical architecture]] &amp;ndash; architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century, manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulas as an outgrowth of some classicizing features of Late Baroque. In its purest form it is a style principally derived from the architecture of Classical Greece and the architecture of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.
** [[Empire style]] &amp;ndash; sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts followed in Europe and America until around 1830, although in the U. S. it continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-19th century.
** [[Biedermeier#Architecture during the Biedermeier era|Biedermeier architecture]] &amp;ndash; neoclassical architecture in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848.
** [[Resort architecture]] (''Bäderarchitektur'') &amp;ndash; a specific neoclassical style that came up at the end of the 18th century in German [[seaside resort]]s and is widely used in the region until today.
** [[Federal architecture]] &amp;ndash; classicizing architecture built in the United States between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period.
** [[Regency architecture]] &amp;ndash; buildings built in Britain during the period in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent, and also to later buildings following the same style. The style corresponds to the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States and to the French Empire style.
** [[Greek Revival architecture]] &amp;ndash; architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States. A product of Hellenism, it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture.
** [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland]]
* [[Nordic Classicism]] &amp;ndash; style of architecture that briefly blossomed in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) between 1910 and 1930.
* [[New Classical Architecture]] &amp;ndash; Architectural movement to revive, and embrace classical architecture as a legitimate form of architecture for the 20th and 21st Centuries.  Beginning first with [[Postmodern architecture]]'s criticism of modernist architectural movements like [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], New Classical architecture seeks to be an alternative to the ongoing dominance of [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]].

'''Patrick Shea''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (27 April 1908 &amp;ndash; 1986) was a [[Northern Irish]] [[civil servant]] and the first [[Roman Catholic]] since [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte-Wyse]] in the 1920s to achieve the rank of [[Permanent Secretary]] of a Government Department in [[Northern Ireland]].

==Career==
Shea was born in [[Delvin]], [[County Westmeath]], where his father, a native [[Irish language|Irish]] speaker from [[County Kerry|West Kerry]], was a member of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]. His father had various postings until the RIC was disbanded in 1922 upon the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] via the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]/[[Partition of Ireland]]. Shea's father joined the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], attaining the rank of Head Constable and later Clerk of Petty Sessions in [[Newry]], [[County Down]], where the family later lived. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Patrick Shea attended the [[Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] in Newry. Upon leaving, he joined the [[Northern Ireland Civil Service]] in June 1926. His postings included:
* Ministry of Labour, Clerical Officer 1926–1935 Belfast, Outdoor Officer [[Enniskillen]] 1935–1938, Senior Clerk, Headquarters 1938–1939
* Ministry of Finance, Assistant Principal 1939–1941, Deputy Principal 1941. His initial appointment to this office was blocked because he was a [[Roman Catholic]] by the Minister of Labour [[John F. Gordon]] who was later overruled by John M. Andrews the Minister of Finance.
* Secretary Civil Service Committee for Northern Ireland 1941
* Ministry of Education, Principal December 1947 – 1959, Establishment Officer and Accountant
* Ministry of Finance, Public Buildings and Works, 1959–1963, Assistant Secretary 1963–1969
* Ministry of Education, Permanent Secretary, December 1969–1973

After retirement he chaired [[Enterprise Ulster]] from 1973–1979. Shea commented on his own career by recalling that it ''"was my experience that some Catholics, and especially those in Belfast, where I had been told, the Bishop advised them against seeking Government employment, looked with suspicion on Catholic civil servants. We had joined the enemy, we were lost souls"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott, Marianne]]. ''Catholics of Ulster'', Basic Books (19 February 2002); {{ISBN|0465019048}}; {{ISBN|978-0465019045}}; p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCagZOubDWUC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=Patrick+Shea+we+had+joined+the+enemy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pD8qUcjlZD&amp;sig=hCI19atq-y8EgedryVAsXmd3WsQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RrwmUYnJN8-y0QGtr4DgDw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick%20Shea%20we%20had%20joined%20the%20enemy&amp;f=false ''A New History of Ireland, Volume II''], edited by Art Cosgrove, p. 217; {{ISBN|978-0-19-821755-8}} (hc); {{ISBN|978-0-19-953970-3}} (p)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Shea was given an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1961 and [[Order of the Bath|CB]] 1972. He was made an Honorary member of the [[Royal Society of Ulster Architects]] in  1971 and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1977. He was a long-time member of the Ulster Arts Club.

==Personal life==
He married Eithne McHugh (d. 2000) in September 1941 and they had a daughter and two sons.

[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the [[Pitsa panels]], 6th century BCE, paint on wood, showing an animal sacrifice in [[Corinth]]]]
[[File:Pinax prothesis Louvre CA255.jpg|350px|thumb|Terracotta funerary pinax, Athens, 560-550 BC]] 
In the modern study of the culture of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Magna Graecia]], a '''''pinax''''' (πίναξ) (plural '''''pinakes''''' - πίνακες), meaning "board",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%2Fnac πίναξ],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a '''votive tablet''' of painted [[wood]], or [[terracotta]], [[marble]] or [[bronze]] [[relief]] that served as a [[votive deposit|votive object]] deposited in a [[sanctuary]] or as a memorial affixed within a [[burial chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such ''pinakes'' feature in the classical collections of most comprehensive museums.

==Other uses==
[[File:Pinax with Persephone and Hades Enthroned, 500-450 BC, Greek, Locri Epizephirii, Mannella district, Sanctuary of Persephone, terracotta - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08242.JPG|thumb|left|Terracotta pinax of [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] from [[Locri]] (Museo Nazionale di [[Reggio di Calabria]])]]

To the ancient Greeks ''pinax'' seems also to have been a general term for a plate, but this is generally not followed in modern archaeological usage.  In daily life ''pinax'' might equally denote a wax-covered [[Wax tablet|writing tablet]]. In Christian contexts,  painted [[icon]]s ("images") are ''pinakes''. In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], they were images probably usually painted on cloth, but also carved either in stone or wood, that were hung behind, and sometimes below, the stage area as scenery, or as permanent decoration.  The term [[pinacotheca]] for a picture gallery derives from such usages.

==Materials and use==
When they are recovered by archaeologists, painted wooden ''pinakes'' have usually lost all but faint traces of their painted images - the [[Pitsa panels]] being the outstanding exception.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; Moulded terracotta ''pinakes'' were also brightly painted.  Marble ''pinakes'' were individually carved, but terracotta ones were impressed in molds, and bronze ones might be repeatedly cast from a model from which wax and resin impressions were made, in the technique called [[lost wax casting]]. 

A few elaborate gold plaques have survived from the 7th century BC, many made in [[Rhodes]], with deity figures, especially [[Artemis]], shown in an orientalizing [[Daedalic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

They often have two holes for a suspension cord, and are shown in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]] both hanging on temple walls, and also suspended from trees in the sanctuary area.  The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]  mentions the ''pinakes'' in the [[cella]]s of temples, and even in the possession of private persons. Such a collection was a ''pinakothek'',&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''bibliothek'', a library, which provides the designation in several modern European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a modern German term for an [[art museum]], such as the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich.

[[Callimachus]], the Alexandrian poet and scholar at the [[Library of Alexandria]], formed a kind of index, or "map picture" of the library's contents, which he named ''[[Pinakes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu/conference/2002/documents/christian_jacob.html Christian Jacob, "From Alexandria to Alexandria: Scholarly Interfaces of a Universal Library" 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; a term that continued in use in bibliographic catalogs.

==Large finds==
[[File:Plaque Penteskouphia MNB2858.jpg|thumb|Pottery kiln, Penteskouphia]] 
At [[Locri]] in southern Italy, thousands of carefully buried ''pinakes'' have been recovered, most of them from the sanctuary of [[Persephone]] or that of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127; [http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm The Pinakes of Locri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033135/http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm |date=2016-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large group of over 1,000 pottery pinakes was found at the site of [[Penteskouphia]], just outside [[Corinth]].  These are mostly in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], with some in Corinth and the [[Louvre]].  As well as the usual religious scenes, some of these show depictions of potters at work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/votive-tablet Louvre, "Votive tablet"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Berlin also has a smaller group of fragments from the [[Kerameikos]] cemetery in [[Athens]], many by the painter [[Exekias]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pinakes_by_Exekias_at_the_Antikensammlung_Berlin Commons category "Pinakes by Exekias at the Antikensammlung Berlin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan art==
In [[Etruscan art]], rather larger terracotta plaques than are typical in Greek art have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  Wealthy Etruscan families often had tombs with painted walls, which the Greeks did not.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postdigital,''' in artistic practice, is an attitude that is more concerned with being human, than with being digital. Postdigital is concerned with our rapidly changed and changing relationships with digital technologies and art forms. If one examines the textual paradigm of consensus, one is faced with a choice: either the "postdigital" society has intrinsic meaning, or it is contextualised into a paradigm of consensus that includes art as a totality. 

== Theory ==


[[Giorgio Agamben]] (2002) describes paradigms as things what we think with, rather than things we think about. Like the computer age, the postdigital is also a paradigm, but as with post-humanism for example, an understanding of postdigital does not aim to describe a life ''after'' digital, but rather attempts to describe the present-day opportunity to explore the consequences of the digital and of the computer age. While the computer age has enhanced human capacity with inviting and uncanny prosthetics, the postdigital may provide a paradigm with which it is possible to examine and understand this enhancement.

In ''The Future of Art in a Postdigital Age'' [[Mel Alexenberg]] defines "postdigital art" as artworks that address the humanization of digital technologies through interplay between digital, biological, cultural, and spiritual systems, between cyberspace and real space, between embodied media and mixed reality in social and physical communication, between high tech and high touch experiences, between visual, haptic, auditory, and kinesthetic media experiences, between virtual and augmented reality, between roots and globalization, between autoethnography and community narrative, and between web-enabled peer-produced wikiart and artworks created with alternative media through participation, interaction, and collaboration in which the role of the artist is redefined.

In addition to the wide scope of artistic discourse, the notion of postdigital is emerging as a term that describes the exploration of our relationship to the computer age as a dominant paradigm in a time of global mixing, intertwined economies, population certainty and planetary limits, for example in the work of Berry (2014).

[[Roy Ascott]] has  demonstrated that the distinction between the digital and the "postdigital" is part of the economy of reality.

== Music ==

[[Kim Cascone]] uses the term in his article ''The Aesthetics of Failure: "Post-digital" Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music.''&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begins the article with a quotation from MIT Media Lab cyberpundit [[Nicholas Negroponte]]: "The [[digital revolution]] is over." Cascone goes on to describe what he sees as a 'post-digital' line of flight in the music also commonly known as glitch or microsound music, observing that 'with [[electronic commerce]] now a natural part of the business fabric of the Western world and Hollywood cranking out digital fluff by the gigabyte, the medium of digital technology holds less fascination for composers in and of itself.'

In ''Art after Technology'' [[Maurice Benayoun]] lists possible tracks for "postdigital" art considering that the digital flooding has altered the entire social, economical, artistic landscape and the artist posture will move in ways that try to escape the technological realm without being able to completely discard it. From lowtech to biotech and ''critical fusion'' - critical intrusion of fiction inside reality – new forms of art emerge from the digital era.

'''San Francisco Ballet''' is a [[ballet company]], founded in 1933 as the '''San Francisco Opera Ballet''' under the leadership of ballet master [[Adolph Bolm]]. The company is currently based in the [[War Memorial Opera House (San Francisco)|War Memorial Opera House]], San Francisco, under the direction of [[Helgi Tómasson (dancer)|Helgi Tomasson]]. San Francisco Ballet was the first professional ballet company in the United States. It is among the world's leading dance companies, presenting more than 100 performances annually, with a [[repertoire]] that spans both [[classical ballet|classical]] and [[contemporary ballet]]. Along with [[American Ballet Theatre]] and the [[New York City Ballet]], San Francisco Ballet has been described as part of the "triumvirate of great classical companies defining the American style on the world stage today".&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/feb/18/dance | title=One Step Closer to Perfection | date=February 18, 2007 |work=The Observer |location=UK | author=Jennings, Luke | accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding: Christensen brothers===
[[Willam Christensen]], [[Harold Christensen]], and [[Lew Christensen]] made up the famed trio of brothers considered by many to have done more than anyone else to establish ballet in the United States. Born into an artistic and musical family, the three brothers studied [[folk dance]] and ballet from early ages and went on to tour the famous vaudeville [[Orpheum Circuit]] during the 1920s and 1930s, exposing many Americans to ballet for the first time with their act "The Christ Brothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ballet-pioneer-Willam-F-Christensen-2867680.php%20-F-Christensen-2867680.php | title=Ballet pioneer Willam F. Christensen | date=October 16, 2013 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Roca, Octavio | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As vaudeville faded from American popular culture, Harold and Lew joined [[George Balanchine]]'s new company, [[American Ballet]], in 1935. In 1932, Willam formed a ballet school in Portland, Oregon; in 1937, he was engaged as principal male soloist by San Francisco Opera Ballet.&lt;ref name="Flatrow"&gt;{{Citation | last = Flatow | first = Sheryl | title = Christensen Brothers | url = http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/christensenbros_essay_flatow.pdf | publisher = Dance Heritage Collection | accessdate = October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the company's ballet master and choreographer in 1938. With his brother Harold, he purchased the company from the Opera in 1942, renaming it San Francisco Ballet.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Dictionary of Dance"&gt;Craine, Debra; Mackrell, Judith (2010).

Oxford University Press, USA. {{ISBN|0199563446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Willam retired as director of SF Ballet and moved to Utah, where he started teaching ballet in the country’s first university ballet department at the [[University of Utah]]. With a group of his students, he founded the Utah Civic Ballet (now known as [[Ballet West]]) in 1963; the company remained under Christensen's directorship until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/arts/willam-christensen-99-dies-helped-ballet-flourish-in-us.html | title=Willam Christensen, 99, Dies; Helped Ballet Flourish in U.S. | date=October 17, 2001 |work=The New York Times |author=Anderson, Jack | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Balanchine's tutelage at American Ballet, Lew Christensen became the first American-born ''[[danseur noble]]''.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Dictionary of Dance"/&gt; The [[United States Army]] drafted Christensen to fight in [[World War II]]. After the war ended, he joined Balanchine's and [[Lincoln Kirstein]]'s [[Ballet Society]] (soon to become [[New York City Ballet]]), eventually becoming [[ballet master]]; he served in the role from 1946 until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/obituaries/lew-christensen-dies-at-75-lead-dancer-for-balanchine.html | title=Lew Christensen Dies at 75; Lead Dancer for Balanchine | date=October 10, 1984 |work=The New York Times |author=Dunning, Jennifer | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he joined his brother Willam as co-director of San Francisco Ballet. When Willam moved to Salt Lake City later that year, Lew took over as full director of SF Ballet; he held the position until 1976, when [[Michael Smuin]] joined him as co-director. Lew Christensen remained SF Ballet co-director until 1984, the year of his death.&lt;ref name="Flatrow"/&gt;

After leaving the vaudeville circuit in 1935, Harold Christensen danced with American Ballet, San Francisco Opera Ballet, Kirstein's [[Ballet Caravan]], and San Francisco Ballet until his retirement from the stage in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/22/obituaries/harold-christensen-84-a-dancer-and-ballet-school-director-dies.html | title=Harold Christensen, 84, a Dancer and Ballet School Director | date=February 22, 1989 |work=The New York Times |author=Dunning, Jennifer | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, his brother Willam invited him to become director of the [[San Francisco Ballet School]], and in 1942 he and Willam purchased the SF Ballet. Harold continued to serve as the school's director until his retirement in 1975.

===1938–1950===
{{redirect|Harold Christensen|the American attorney|Harold G. Christensen}}
In 1938, the company's first major production was ''[[Coppélia]]'', choreographed by Willam Christensen.&lt;ref name="sfbmag"&gt;{{cite magazine | author=McCarthy, Terrence | title=History of San Francisco Ballet | magazine=San Francisco Ballet Magazine| volume=71 | issue=6 |year=2004 | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, it staged ''[[Swan Lake]]'', the first time that the ballet was produced in its entirety by an American company. On Christmas Eve 1944, the company staged ''[[Nutcracker]]''—the first complete production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s most popular piece ever danced in the United States.

In 1942, San Francisco Opera Ballet split into two independent companies, ballet and opera. The ballet half was sold to Willam and Harold Christensen. Willam became artistic director, while Harold took on the job of director of the San Francisco Ballet School.&lt;ref name="sfbmag"/&gt; The San Francisco Ballet Guild was also formed as a support organization for San Francisco Ballet.&lt;ref name="renouf"&gt;{{cite news | author=Renee Renouf | title=San Francisco Ballet history | url=http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_99/oct99/rr_san_francisco_ballet_history.htm | work=Ballet.co Magazine | year=2001 | accessdate=August 13, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922145438/http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_99/oct99/rr_san_francisco_ballet_history.htm | archivedate=September 22, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1951–1972===
The year 1951 marked a significant shift in administration of San Francisco Ballet. Lew Christensen—''[[premier danseur]]'' at the time—partnered with his brother Willam Christensen as co-directors. Then in 1952, Lew Christensen took over as sole director. Under his guidance, San Francisco Ballet began to travel and establish itself as a significant American ballet company. Until 1956, San Francisco Ballet had remained on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], but Christensen took the company to the [[Jacob's Pillow]] Dance Festival in [[Massachusetts]]. In 1957, it was the first American ballet company to tour the Far East, performing in 11 Asian nations.&lt;ref name="sfbmag" /&gt; On New Year's Day 1965, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] televised a one-hour abridgement of the Lew Christensen-choreographed production of ''Nutcracker'' featuring San Francisco Ballet.

In 1972, San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House was named the official residence of San Francisco Ballet.

===1973–1985===
In 1973, Michael Smuin became co-artistic director of San Francisco Ballet with Lew Christensen; Smuin had danced with the Company from 1953 to 1961.&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-dance-pioneer-Michael-Smuin-collapses-dies-2600518.php#photo-2089331 | title=SF dance pioneer Michael Smuin collapses, dies | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=April 23, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Winn, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction, the national and international profile of SF Ballet was raised significantly by the broad success of productions such as 1977's ''Romeo and Juliet'', which aired on the [[PBS]] series ''[[Great Performances]]: Dance in America'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/MICHAEL-SMUIN-1938-2007-Prolific-dance-2575617.php | title=Michael Smuin: 1938-2007/Prolific dance director had showy career | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=April 24, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Winn, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; This televised performance marked the first time that a West Coast ballet company, and a full-length ballet, was shown on the PBS TV series.&lt;ref name="Dancers in Career Transition"&gt;Upper, Nancy (2004).

Smuin led the company until 1985.

===1985–present===
Helgi Tomasson's 1985 arrival as artistic director marked the beginning of a new era for San Francisco Ballet. Under Tomasson's direction,&lt;ref name=Tomassonbio&gt;{{cite press release

Following the initial tour, ''The New York Times'' proclaimed, "Mr. Tomasson has accomplished the unprecedented: He has pulled a so-called regional company into the national ranks, and he has done so by honing the dancers into a classical style of astonishing verve and purity. San Francisco Ballet under Helgi Tomasson's leadership is one of the spectacular success stories of the arts in America."&lt;ref name="Kisselgoff"/&gt;

In May 1995, San Francisco Ballet hosted 12 ballet companies from around the world for UNited We Dance: An International Festival.

==Official school==
[[San Francisco Ballet School]], San Francisco Ballet's official school, is America's oldest ballet school. The program includes classes in technique, [[pointe work]], [[pas de deux]], men's technique, contemporary dance, floor [[barre (ballet)|barre]]/conditioning, and character dance. Male and female students are placed in divisions according to age, experience, and ability. More than 50 percent of current San Francisco Ballet dancers received some training at San Francisco Ballet School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ballet School | url = http://school.sfballet.org/history | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and directors===
The school was founded in 1933 as part of the San Francisco Operatic and Ballet School when [[Gaetano Merola]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Opera]], perceived a need for an institution where dancers could be trained to perform in opera productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gereben|first=Janos|title=From Merola to S.F. Ballet School Showcase|url=https://www.sfcv.org/article/from-merola-to-sf-ballet-school-showcase|work=San Francisco Classical Voice|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was under the direction of ballet director Adolph Bolm from 1933 to 1938. Willam Christensen became director from 1938 to 1940, followed by his brother Harold Christensen from 1942 until 1975.&lt;ref name="50&amp;nbsp;years"/&gt; Richard L. Cammack directed the school from 1975 to 1985; he oversaw the move to its current state-of-the-art facilities on Franklin Street in 1983. In 1985, new SF Ballet artistic director Helgi Tomasson appointed Nancy Johnson as school head. Lola de Avila joined as associate director from 1993 to 1999, followed by Gloria Govrin beginning in 1999. In 2006, de Avila returned to serve as associate director until 2012, when Patrick Armand stepped into the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Patrick Armand | url = http://school.sfballet.org/staff/patrick-armand | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School programs===
Admission into the school is by audition only. Students may apply for financial aid and merit-based scholarships. Advanced students may be invited to join the SFBS Trainee Program, a one- to two-year pre-professional program established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trainee Program | url = http://school.sfballet.org/trainee | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 150 students are chosen by audition to dance in the yearly SF Ballet production of ''Nutcracker''. The most advanced students may also dance with SF Ballet in the repertory season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stage Experience | url = http://school.sfballet.org/school/stage-experience | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also runs a pre-ballet program for children ages 4–7; after completing the program, students of age who wish to continue study must audition in order to continue at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pre-ballet | url = http://school.sfballet.org/pre-ballet | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty===
The faculty of the San Francisco Ballet School has long been known for its excellence and diversity of background. As of January 2017, it is led by the Artistic Director [[Helgi Tómasson (dancer)|Helgi Tómasson]] and Associate Director Patrick Armand. The illustrious faculty includes Patrick Armand, Kristi DeCaminada, Karen Gabay, Yuko Katsumi, Tina LeBlanc, Jeffrey Lyons, Rubén Martín Cintas, Ilona McHugh, Pascal Molat, Wendy Van Dyck (Trainee Program Assistant), Jaime Diaz (Strengthening), Brian Fisher (Contemporary), Dana Genshaft (Contemporary dance and conditioning), Henry Berg (Conditioning), Leonid Shagalov (Character), Jamie Narushchen (Music), and Daniel Sullivan (Music). The guest faculty for 2017 includes Sofiane Sylve (Principal Guest).&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web |title = School Staff|url = http://school.sfballet.org/staff|accessdate = April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Francisco Ballet Orchestra==
Founded in 1975 to serve as San Francisco Ballet's official permanent orchestra, San Francisco Ballet Orchestra (SFBO) holds the rare position of being one of three major orchestras in a single city. The orchestra debuted at the end of 1975 with ''Nutcracker'' and has met with both audience and critical acclaim ever since, becoming known by the 1990s as one of the world's finest ballet orchestras.

SFBO toured with the SF Ballet's touring company from 1978 until 1984. It has accompanied many prestigious international ballet companies that have toured to the San Francisco Bay Area, including [[The Royal Ballet]], the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[Stuttgart Ballet]], [[Hamburg Ballet]],the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]], [[American Ballet Theatre]], and the [[Paris Opéra Ballet]]. In 1995, the orchestra took on the remarkable task of accompanying 13 international dance companies over the space of a single week in the UNited We Dance Festival.

The 49-member orchestra accompanies SF Ballet throughout its winter and spring repertory seasons. It also performs apart from the Company; it debuted solely as an orchestra in 1979 at the [[Herbst Theatre]] in San Francisco's War Memorial Veterans Building, playing a program that included works by [[Haydn]], [[Ives]], and [[Vivaldi]].

===San Francisco Ballet Orchestra music directors===
The orchestra was led by Denis de Coteau from 1975 until 1998, when de Coteau's battle with terminal cancer forced him to step down from the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Denis-de-Coteau-s-legacy-at-Ballet-lives-on-3230008.php | title=Denis de Coteau's legacy at Ballet lives on | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=February 1, 2008 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Kosman, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil de Cou]], who had been serving as conductor since 1995, then assumed the role of music director, leading the Orchestra until 2001, when he left to join Washington D.C.'s [[National Symphony Orchestra]]. He was replaced by first associate conductor Jean-Louis LeRoux, who then left the interim position in 2003 and was succeeded by [[Andrew Mogrelia]]. In 2005, Mogrelia left in order to focus on his duties as music director at [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]]. That same year, Martin West, frequent guest conductor for the Orchestra, stepped into the position of music director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Music Director | url = http://www.sfballet.org/company/music_director | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Situationists|image=|caption=Situationists [[Michèle Bernstein]], [[Guy Debord]], and [[Asger Jorn]] in 1957. In this year, the Situationist International was founded, and its manifesto, [[Report on the Construction of Situations]], was published. |all}}

The '''Situationist International''' ('''SI''') was an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] organization of social revolutionaries made up of [[avant-garde]] [[artist]]s, [[intellectual]]s, and [[Political philosophy|political theorists]], prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"&gt;{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from [[Libertarian Marxism|anti-authoritarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde [[art movement]]s of the early 20th century, particularly [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century [[advanced capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The situationists recognized that [[capitalism]] had changed since [[Marx]]'s formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] concepts, such as his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; In their expanded interpretation of [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], the situationists asserted that the misery of [[Marx's theory of alienation|social alienation]] and [[commodity fetishism]] were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; They rejected the idea that advanced capitalism's apparent successes—such as technological advancement, increased income, and increased leisure—could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;

Essential to situationist theory was the concept of [[Spectacle (critical theory)|the spectacle]], a unified critique of [[advanced capitalism]] of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of [[social relation]]s through [[Commodity (Marxism)|objects]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]] of [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]], or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The Situationist International reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]] and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 insurrections in France]]; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "situationist" refers to the construction of situations, one of the early central concepts of the Situationist International; the term also refers to any individuals engaged in the construction of situations, or, more narrowly, to members of the Situationist International.&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Situationist theory sees the situation as a tool for the liberation of everyday life, a method of negating the pervasive [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] that accompanied the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]. The founding manifesto of the Situationist International, ''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957), defined the construction of situations as "the concrete construction of momentary ambiances of life and their transformation into a superior [[wikt:passional#Adjective|passional]] quality."&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; ''Internationale Situationniste'' #1 (June 1958) defined the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a [[wikt:unitary#Adjective|unitary]] [[wikt:ambiance#Noun|ambiance]] and a game of events".&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The situationists argued that [[advanced capitalism]] manufactured false desires; literally in the sense of [[Mass media|ubiquitous advertising]] and the glorification of [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]], and more broadly in the abstraction and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of the more ephemeral experiences of authentic life into [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]]. The experimental direction of situationist activity consisted of setting up temporary environments favorable to the fulfillment of true and authentic human desires in response.&lt;ref name="PreliminarySituations"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/problems.html Preliminary Problems in Constructing a Situation]''.

The Situationist International strongly resisted use of the term "situationism", which Debord called a "meaningless term", adding "[t]here is no such thing as situationism, which would mean a doctrine for interpreting existing conditions".&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The situationists maintained a philosophical opposition to all [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideologies]], conceiving of them as abstract [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] ultimately serving only to justify the [[Base and superstructure|economic base]] of a given society; accordingly, they rejected "situationism" as an absurd and self-contradictory concept.&lt;ref name="Vaneigem1967Revolution1"&gt;Raoul Vaneigem (1967) ''[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/35 Traité du savoir-vivre à l’usage des jeunes générations]''.

==History==

===Origins (1945–1955)===
The situationist movement had its origins as a left wing tendency within [[Lettrism]],&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |title=Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958) |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; an artistic and literary movement led by the Romanian-born French poet and visual artist [[Isidore Isou]], originating in 1940s Paris. The group was heavily influenced by the preceding [[avant-garde]] movements of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]], seeking to apply critical theories based on these concepts to all areas of art and culture, most notably in [[poetry]], [[film]], [[painting]] and [[political theory]].&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; Among some of the concepts and artistic innovations developed by the Lettrists were the ''lettrie'', a [[poetry|poem]] reflecting pure form yet devoid of all semantic content, new syntheses of writing and visual art identified as [[metagraphics]] and [[hypergraphics]], as well as new creative techniques in [[filmmaking]]. Future situationist [[Guy Debord]], who was at that time a significant figure in the Lettrist movement, helped develop these new film techniques, using them in his Lettrist film ''[[Howls for Sade]]'' (1952) as well as later in his situationist film ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1972).

By 1950, a much younger and more [[left-wing]] part of the Lettrist movement began to emerge. This group kept very active in perpetrating public outrages such as the [[Notre-Dame Affair]], where at the [[Easter]] High Mass at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], in front of ten thousand people and broadcast on national TV, their member and former Dominican Michel Mourre posed as a [[monk]], "stood in front of the altar and read a pamphlet proclaiming that God was dead".&lt;ref name="Horn07p8"&gt;Horn (2007), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcus89p279-86"&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] (1989) ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C preview] at Google books, pp. 279–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=To have done with the judgment of God |author= |url=http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-11-13 |publisher=Snarkout |date=2002-11-24 |accessdate=2008-06-23 |df= }}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=COSTRUIRE L'UNITA' D'AREA/2 | author=Adriano Scianca | url=http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 | publisher=miro renzaglia | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2008-06-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928042757/http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 | archivedate=2007-09-28 | df= }}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton]] prominently came out in solidarity with the action in a letter that spawned a large debate in the newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''.&lt;ref name="Boucharenc05"&gt;Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKf2PLK1BgC ''L'universel reportage''], pp. 94–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breton50NotreDame"&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (1950) [http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-le-scandale-de-notre-dame-41681161.html ''Lettre a Louis Pauwels" sur le «"scandale" de Notre Dame»''], in ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', April 12, 1950, ''OC III'', pp. 1024–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, this left wing of the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] movement, which included Debord, broke off from Isou's group and formed the [[Letterist International]], a new Paris-based collective of avant-garde artists and political theorists. The schism finally erupted when the future members of the radical{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Lettrists disrupted a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference for ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]]. They distributed a [[polemic]] entitled "No More Flat Feet!", which concluded: "The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin."&lt;ref name="Berna1952No"&gt;Serge Berna, Jean-Louis Brau, Guy Debord &amp; Gil J. Wolman (1952) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/flatfeet.html No More Flat Feet!]''. Internationale Lettriste #1 (Paris, November 1952). Translated by Ken Knabb. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Isou was upset with this, his own attitude being that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that his work was no longer relevant, while having appreciated it "in its own time," and asserted their belief "that the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they claim to represent freedom," in this case, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.&lt;ref name="1952Position"&gt;(1952) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/position.html Position of the Lettrist International]''. Internationale Lettriste #1 (Paris, November 1952). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of the [[Letterist International]], many of the important concepts and ideas that would later be integral in situationist theory were developed. Individuals in the group collaboratively constructed the new field of [[psychogeography]], which they defined as "the study of the specific effects of the [[geography|geographical environment]] (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1955Introduction"&gt;Guy Debord (1955) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography]''. Les Lèvres Nues #6 (Paris, September 1955). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Debord further expanded this concept of psychogeography with his theory of the [[dérive]], an unplanned tour through an [[city|urban]] landscape directed entirely by the feelings evoked in the individual by their surroundings, serving as the primary means for mapping and investigating the psychogeography of these different areas.&lt;ref name="Debord1956Theory"&gt;Guy Debord (1956) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Theory of the Dérive]''. Les Lèvres Nues #9 (Paris, November 1956). Reprinted in Internationale Situationniste #2 (Paris, December 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Letterist International also developed the situationist tactic of [[détournement]], which by reworking or re-contextualizing an existing work of art or literature sought to radically shift its meaning to one with revolutionary significance.

===Formation (1956–1957)===

In 1956, Guy Debord, a member of the [[Lettrist International]], and [[Asger Jorn]] of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], brought together a group of artistic collectives for the ''First World Congress of Free Artists'' in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Horn07p5-7"&gt;Horn (2007), pp. 5–7, 42&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting established the foundation for the development of the Situationist International, which was officially formed in July 1957 at a meeting in Cosio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beach Beneath the Street: The Everyday Life and Glorious Times of the Situationist International|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|date=2011-06-20|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=9781844677207|edition=1|location=|pages=67|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting International was a fusion of these extremely small [[avant-garde]] collectives: the [[Lettrist International]], the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (an offshoot of [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]), and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] (though, Anselm Jappe has argued that the group pivoted around Jorn and Debord for the first four years).&lt;ref name="Jappe99DebordJorn"&gt;[[Anselm Jappe]], 1999, p. 65 quotation: :''For the first four years of the SI's existence, the pivot of the group was the collaboration between Debord and Asger Jorn, who complemented each other well precisely because they were so different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the Situationist International drew ideas from other groups such as ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The most prominent member of the group, [[Guy Debord]], generally became considered the organization's [[de facto]] leader and most distinguished theorist. Other members included theorist [[Raoul Vaneigem]], the Dutch painter [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]], the Italo-Scottish writer [[Alexander Trocchi]], the English artist [[Ralph Rumney]] (sole member of the London Psychogeographical Association, Rumney suffered expulsion relatively soon after the formation), the Danish artist [[Asger Jorn]] (who after parting with the SI also founded the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]]), the architect and veteran of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] [[Attila Kotanyi]], and the French writer [[Michele Bernstein]]. Debord and Bernstein later married.

In June 1957, Debord wrote the [[manifesto]] of the Situationist International, titled ''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]''. This manifesto plans a systematic{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} rereading of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and advocates a cultural revolution in [[western countries]].&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"&gt;Guy Debord (1957) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/report.html Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's Conditions of Organization and Action]''. (Paris, June 1957). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic period (1958–1962)===
[[File:Asger Jorn (1963) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danes|Danish]] painter, sculptor, [[ceramic art]]ist, and author [[Asger Jorn]], founding member of the Situationist International.]]

During the first few years of the SI's founding, [[avant-garde]] artistic groups began collaborating with the SI and joining the organization. [[Gruppe SPUR]], a [[Germans|German]] artistic collective, collaborated with the Situationist International on projects beginning in 1959, continuing until the group officially joined the SI in 1961. The role of the artists in the SI was of great significance, particularly [[Asger Jorn]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Pinot Gallizio]].&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"/&gt;

Asger Jorn, who invented [[Situgraphy]] and [[Situlogy]], had the social role of catalyst and team leader among the members of the SI between 1957 and 1961. Jorn's role in the situationist movement (as in [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]) was that of a catalyst and team leader. [[Guy Debord]] on his own lacked the personal warmth and persuasiveness to draw people of different nationalities and talents into an active working partnership. As a prototype [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[intellectual]] Debord needed an ally who could patch up the petty egoisms and squabbles of the members. When Jorn's leadership was withdrawn in 1961, many simmering quarrels among different sections of the SI flared up, leading to multiple exclusions.
[[File:Internationale situationniste nº1.jpg|thumb|left|''Internationale situationniste'']]
The first major split was the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR, the German section, from the SI on February 10, 1962.&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"&gt;(1963) ''[http://www.notbored.org/spur-exclusion.html The Exclusion of the Spurists]''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Many different disagreements led to the fracture, for example; while at the Fourth SI Conference in London in December, 1960, in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, the Gruppe SPUR members disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a [[revolutionary proletariat]];&lt;ref name="SI5Conf4"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/london.html The Fourth SI Conference in London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905181622/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/london.html |date=2008-09-05 }}'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/5.conf4.htm] Internationale Situationniste #5 (December 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; the accusation that their activities were based on a "systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses";&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"/&gt; the understanding that at least one Gruppe SPUR member, [[sculptor]] [[Lothar Fischer]], and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to achieve success in the [[Economics of the arts and literature|art market]].&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunzelmann"&gt;''[http://www.kurr.org/t_nothing.php Nothing to talk about] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105221228/http://www.kurr.org/t_nothing.php |date=2009-01-05 }} key, Halil Altindere and Sezgin Boynik (editors)&lt;/ref&gt; the betrayal, in the ''Spur #7'' issue, of a common agreement on the Gruppe SPUR and SI publications.{{fragment|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref name="SI7Conf5"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/goteborg.html The Fifth SI Conference in Göteborg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073104/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/goteborg.html |date=2010-10-29 }}'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/7.conf5.htm] Internationale Situationniste #7 (April 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DebordVernissage150362"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-15March1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord and [[Uwe Lausen]] to the journal ''Vernissage'', 15 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusion was a recognition that [[Gruppe SPUR]]'s "principles, methods and goals" were significantly in contrast with those of the SI.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord180662"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-18June1962.html Letter] from [[Guy Debord]] to [[Rodolphe Gasche]] (member of the Gruppe SPUR), 18 June 1962&lt;/ref&gt; This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to Gruppe SPUR, calling it the only significant artist group in [[Germany]] since [[World War II]], and regarding it at the level of the [[avant-garde]]s in other countries.&lt;ref name="DebordSpur280462"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-28April1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord To the Spur group, 28 April 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant split was in 1962, wherein the "Nashists," the [[Scandinavia]]n section of the SI led by [[Jørgen Nash]], were excluded from the organization for lacking the theoretical rigor demanded by the [[France|Franco]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] section of SI led by Guy Debord. This excluded group would later declare themselves the [[2nd Situationist International]], basing their organization out of [[Sweden]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Journalist [[Stewart Home]], who favored the "Nashists" and considered Debord a "mystic, an idealist, a dogmatist and a liar"&lt;ref name="Jappe1999"&gt;[[Anselm Jappe]] (1999) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rfguCi3qQasC Guy Debord]'', p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that while the 2nd Situationist International sought to challenge the separation of [[art and politics]] from everyday life, Debord and the so-called 'specto-situationists'&lt;ref name="AssaultOnCultureCh8"&gt;Stewart Home (1987) ''[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/sithree.htm The Assault on Culture Chapter 8 – The Decline and Fall of the Specto-Situationist Critique]''.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to concentrate solely on theoretical political aims.&lt;ref name="Kurczynski2005Beyond"&gt;[[Karen Kurczynski]] (2005) ''[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/situationist/bib_jorn.html#criticism Beyond Expressionism: Asger Jorn and the European Avant-Garde, 1941–1961]'' (New York University: New York 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political period (1963–1968)===

By this point the Situationist International consisted almost exclusively of the Franco-Belgian section, led by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. These members possessed much more of a tendency towards political theory over the more artistic aspects of the SI. The shift in the intellectual priorities within the SI resulted in more focus on the theoretical, such as the [[Spectacle (Situationism)|theory of the spectacle]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] critical analysis, spending much less time on the more artistic and tangible concepts like [[unitary urbanism]], [[détournement]], and [[situgraphy]].&lt;ref name="Blissett2002Guy"&gt;Luther Blissett (2002) ''[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/pub_contents/9 Guy Debord Is Really Dead]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the SI began having more and more influence on local university students in [[France]]. Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", situationist-influenced students, infiltrated the [[University of Strasbourg]]'s [[Student activity center|student union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"&gt;{{cite book | last=Vague | first=Tom | title=Anarchy in the Uk: the Angry Brigade | publisher=AK Press | location=Stirling | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-873176-98-6 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first action was to form an "[[social anarchism|anarchist]] appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for [[Karl Marx]] and [[Ravachol]]; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of [[the Durruti Column]]", [[Andre Bertrand]]'s ''[[détournement|détourned]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt; They then invited the situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]'', written by [[Tunisia]]n situationist [[Mustapha/Omar Khayati]] was the result.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt; The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the [[academic year]]. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt;

===May events (1968)===

Quotations from two key situationist books, Debord's ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) and Khayati's ''On the Poverty of Student Life'' (1966), were written on the walls of Paris and several provincial cities.&lt;ref name="Viénet68sec1" /&gt; This was documented in the collection of photographs published in 1968 by [[Walter Lewino]], ''L'imagination au pouvoir''.&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"&gt;''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who followed the "artistic" view of the SI might view the evolution of the SI as producing a more boring or dogmatic organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Those following the political view would see the May 1968 uprisings as a logical outcome of the SI's [[dialectic]]al approach: while savaging present day society, they sought a revolutionary society which would embody the positive tendencies of capitalist development. The "realization and suppression of art" is simply the most developed of the many dialectical supersessions which the SI sought over the years. For the Situationist International of 1968, the world triumph of [[workers councils]] would bring about all these supersessions.

Though the SI were a very small group, they were expert self-propagandists, and their slogans appeared daubed on walls throughout Paris at the time of the revolt. SI member [[René Viénet]]'s 1968 book ''Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement, France, May '68'' gives an account of the involvement of the SI with the student group of [[Enragés]] and the occupation of the [[Sorbonne]].

The occupations of 1968 started at the [[University of Nanterre]] and spread to the Sorbonne. The police tried to take back the Sorbonne and a riot ensued. Following this a general strike was declared with up to 10 million workers participating. The SI originally participated in the Sorbonne occupations and defended barricades in the riots. The SI distributed calls for the [[occupation of factories]] and the formation of [[workers' councils]],&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; but, disillusioned with the students, left the university to set up [[The Council For The Maintenance Of The Occupations]] (CMDO) which distributed the SI's demands on a much wider scale. After the end of the movement, the CMDO disbanded.

===Aftermath (1968–1972)===
By 1972, [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]] and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ({{lang-en|The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=u2r2h |url=http://tangibleinfo.blogspot.com/2010/08/gianfranco-sanguinetti-full-text-of.html |title=Complete (translated) texts |publisher=Tangibleinfo.blogspot.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (inspired by [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet argued that the ruling class of Italy supported the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist influence. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalists praised its content. After reprinting the tract as a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. In the outcry that ensued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/report.html |title=Gianfranco Sanguinetti |publisher=Notbored.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under pressure from Italian authorities Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts, and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; the SI was dissolved in 1972.&lt;ref name="Karen2001"&gt;{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=2001-06-01 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main concepts==

===The spectacle and its society===
{{main|Spectacle (critical theory)}}

The ''Spectacle'' is a central notion in situationist theory, developed by [[Guy Debord]] in his 1967 book, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''. In its limited sense, ''spectacle'' means the [[mass media]], which are "its most glaring superficial manifestation."&lt;ref name="Debord1977t24"&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 24&lt;/ref&gt; Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="Brush2005p377"&gt;Brush (2005) pp. 377–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1988cII"&gt;Debord (1988) ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'', II&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of the ''spectacle'' is a development and application of Karl Marx's concept of [[fetishism of commodities]], [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]],&lt;ref name="Debord1967SocietyI"&gt;Guy Debord (1967) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/tsots01.html Society of the Spectacle''. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter I: Separation Perfected.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it was reprised by [[György Lukács]] in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the [[Consumerism|consumers]] instead of being ruled by them. The consumers are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.

As early as 1958, in the [[Report on the Construction of Situations|situationist manifesto]], Debord described [[official culture]] as a "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the [[public discourse]]. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely [[Social integration|incorporated]] back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1957) pp. 2, 10&lt;/ref&gt; This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called ''[[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]]'', and its counter-technique is the ''[[détournement]]''.&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"&gt;Robert Chasse, Bruce Elwell, Jonathon Horelick, Tony Verlaan. (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/faces.html Faces of Recuperation]''. In the American section of the Situationist International, issue #1 (New York, June 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Détournement===
{{main|détournement}}
A ''détournement'' is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |title=Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958) |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consist in "turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself,"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Holt (2010) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; like turning slogans and logos against the advertisers or the political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaste [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Détournement'' was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p. 45, quote:
{{quote|[...] gioco al coplotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement''—inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk—che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, Malcom McClaren, a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scateno', con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece è stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p. 40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

===Anti-capitalism===
The Situationist International, in the 15 years from its formation in 1957 and its dissolution in 1972, is characterized by a [[Marxist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics,&lt;ref name="PoliOnArtAndPolitics"&gt;[[Francesco Poli]] (1991) p. 63. Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt; Nel 1972, quindici anni dopo la sua fondazione [[...]] l'Internazionale Situazionista si scioglie in quanto organizzazione. Durante questi anni, il movimento, caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista, produce una quantita' consistente di scritti teorici, opuscoli, libri, film e lavori artistici nel campo della pittura e della progettazione di interventi nella dimensione urbana. Di grande rilievo è il ruolo degli artisti, tra cui in particolare Asger Jorn, Constant e Pinot Gallizio;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; without separation between the two: [[art]] and politics are faced together and in [[revolutionary]] terms.&lt;ref name="BandiniArtAndPolitics"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bandini|1977}}, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari. [[...]] L'idea chiave è quella della 'costruzione di situazioni' [[...]] L'urbanesimo unitario [[...]] Fondamentale è la 'ricerca psicogeografica': studio delle leggi esatte e degli effetti precisi che l'ambiente geografico, coscientemente disposto o no, attua direttamente sul comportamento affettivo degli individui.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The SI analyzed the modern world from the point of view of [[everyday life]].&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIEverydayLife"&gt;[[Richard Gombin]] (1971), chap. 3, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;the IS was to attempt an analysis of the modern world from the point of view of everyday life.&amp;nbsp;... The critique of everyday life is not intended to be purely an analysis; it is supposed to lead on to a revolutionary praxis.&amp;nbsp;... [[On SI analysis of consumerism:]] This process causes an accelerating degradation of everyday life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The core arguments of the Situationist International were an [[anti-capitalism|attack on the capitalist]] degradation of the life of people&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1967QualityOfLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BandiniCapitaslismDegrade"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandini|1998|Preface to second edition}}, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] reagire all'avvilita condizione dell'uomo nel sistema capitalista.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and the fake models advertised by the [[mass media]],&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; to which the Situationist responded with alternative life experiences.&lt;ref name="Luttazzi2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttazzi|2008}} &lt;blockquote&gt;'''Question''': "Le profezie di Guy Debord a proposito della Società dello spettacolo si avverano sotto i nostri occhi: il governo si occupa della «percezione» delle cose da parte dei cittadini più che della sostanza materiale, dei bisogni, dei fatti. L'invenzione dell'«emergenza sicurezza» è un caso lampante. Come pensi ci si debba muovere in questo scenario?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Answer''': "Come suggeriva Debord: con pratiche di vita alternative.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The alternative life experiences explored by the Situationists were the construction of situations, [[unitary urbanism]], [[psychogeography]], and the union of play, freedom and [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"&gt;Debord harshly denounced the degradation in the [[quality of life]] under capitalism, also in his 1957 ''Report''. {{Harvnb|Poli|1991}} said on Debord's Report: &lt;blockquote&gt;Con il suo ''Rapporto...'' del 1957, Debord definisce programmaticamente le basi teoriche del situazionismo. [[...]]
&lt;br /&gt;Nel Rapporto di Debord si legge inoltre una durissima critica allo sfruttamento capitalistico delle masse anche nel tempo libero attraverso l'industria del divertimento che abbrutisce la gente con sottoprodotti dell'ideologia mistificata della borghesia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A major stance of the SI was to count on the force of a [[revolutionary proletariat]]. This stance was reaffirmed very clearly in a discussion on "To what extent is the SI a political movement?", during the Fourth SI Conference in London.&lt;ref name="SI5Conf4"/&gt; The SI remarked that this is a core Situationist principle, and that those that don't understand it and agree with it, are not Situationist.

===Art and politics===
{{main|Art and politics}}
The SI rejected all art that separated itself from politics, the concept of [[20th-century art]] that is separated from topical political events.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"&gt;(1963) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/counter.html The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821121236/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/counter.html |date=2008-08-21 }}''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; The SI believed that the notion of artistic expression being separated from politics and current events is one proliferated by reactionary considerations to render artwork that expresses comprehensive critiques of society impotent.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; They recognized there was a precise mechanism followed by reactionaries to defuse the role of subversive artists and intellectuals, that is, to [[reframing|reframe]] them as separated from the most topical events, and divert from them the taste for the new that may dangerously appeal the masses; after such separation, such artworks are sterilized, banalized, degraded, and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavors to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;

According to this theory, artists and intellectuals that accept such compromises are rewarded by the [[art dealer]]s and praised by the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt; The SI received many offers to sponsor "creations" that would just have a "situationist" label but a diluted political content, that would have brought things back to order and the SI back into the old fold of artistic praxis. The majority of SI continued to refuse such offers and any involvement on the conventional avant-garde artistic plane.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt; This principle was affirmed since the founding of the SI in 1957, but the qualitative step of resolving all the contradictions of having situationists that make concessions to the cultural market, was made with the exclusion of [[Gruppe SPUR]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt;

The SI noted how reactionary forces forbid subversive ideas from artists and intellectuals to reach the [[public discourse]], and how they attack the artworks that express comprehensive critique of society, by saying that art should not involve itself into politics.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;

===The construction of situations===
The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defines the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events."

As the SI embraced dialectical Marxism, the situation came to refer less to a specific avant-garde practice than to the dialectical unification of art and life more generally. Beyond this theoretical definition, the situation as a practical manifestation thus slipped between a series of proposals. The SI thus were first led to distinguish the situation from the mere artistic practice of the [[happening]], and later identified it in historical events such as the [[Paris Commune]] in which it exhibited itself as the revolutionary moment. The SI's interest in the Paris Commune was expressed in 1962 in their fourteen [[Situationist Theses on the Paris Commune|"Theses on the Paris Commune"]].

===Psychogeography===
{{Main|Psychogeography}}
The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defined [[psychogeography]] as "the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The term was first recognized in 1955 by Guy Debord while still with the Letterist International:

{{quote|The word psychogeography, suggested by an illiterate Kabyle as a general term for the phenomena a few of us were investigating around the summer of 1953, is not too inappropriate. It does not contradict the materialist perspective of the conditioning of life and thought by objective nature. Geography, for example, deals with the determinant action of general natural forces, such as soil composition or climatic conditions, on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world. Psychogeography could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals. The charmingly vague adjective psychogeographical can be applied to the findings arrived at by this type of investigation, to their influence on human feelings, and more generally to any situation or conduct that seems to reflect the same spirit of discovery.|Guy Debord, ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography''&lt;ref name="Debord1955Introduction"/&gt;}}

====Dérive====
{{Main|Dérive}}
By definition, psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies. Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of [[dérive]] ("drift").

{{quote|In a [[dérive]] one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there... But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.|Ken Knabb&lt;ref name="Knabb, Ken 1995. pg 50"&gt;Knabb, Ken, ed. ''Situationist International Anthology'', Berkley: Bureau of Public Secrets, 1995. pg 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

SI engaged in a play-form that was also
practiced by its predecessor organization, the [[Letterist International|Lettrist International]], the art of wandering through urban space, which they termed [[dérive]], whose unique mood is conveyed in Debord's darkly romantic meaning of palindrome. Two excursions organized by Andre Breton serve as the closest cultural precedents to the [[dérive]]. The first in 1921, was an excursion to the [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre|Church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]] with the Parisian [[Dadaists]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dada in Paris|last=Sanouillet|first=Michel|last2=Ganguly|first2=Sharmila|date=2012-10-02|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262518215|edition=Revised, Expanded|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=178|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second excursion was on May 1, 1923, when a small group of [[Surrealists]] walked toward the countryside outside of [[Blois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boredom and Art: Passions of the Will To Boredom|last=Haladyn|first=Julian Jason|date=2015-10-30|publisher=Zero Books|isbn=9781782799986|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord was cautious however to differentiate between the derive and such precedents. He emphasized its active character as "a mode of experimental behavior" that reached to [[Romanticism]], the Baroque, and the age of chivalry, with its tradition of long adventures voyages. Such urban roaming was characteristic of Left Bank bohemianism in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti, Libero. "Play-Tactics of the "Internationale Situationniste""''&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.orgPlay-tactics{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the Internationale Situationniste*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(n.d.): 36-58. ''Jstor''. The MIT Press, 2000. Web. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops—the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, editor, ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel P, 1998. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, Tom, ed. ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International: Texts and Documents'', Boston: October Press, 2004. pg 259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation. The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the situationist city.

===Work, leisure, and play===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

The situationists observed that the worker of advanced capitalism still only functions with the goal of survival. In a world where technological efficiency has increased production exponentially, by tenfold, the workers of society still dedicate the whole of their lives to survival, by way of production. The purpose for which advanced capitalism is organized isn't luxury, happiness, or freedom, but production. The production of commodities is an end to itself; and production by way of survival.

The theorists of the Situationist International regarded the current paradigm of work in advanced capitalist society as increasingly absurd. As technology progresses, and work becomes exponentially efficient, the work itself becomes exponentially more trivial. The spectacle's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production. The "growth" generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was at its origin.

===Major works===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
Twelve issues of the main French edition of journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' were published, each issue edited by a different individual or group, including: [[Guy Debord]], [[Mohamed Dahoiu]], [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]], [[Maurice Wyckaert]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Helmut Sturm]], [[Attila Kotanyi]], [[Jørgen Nash]], [[Uwe Lausen]], [[Raoul Vaneigem]], [[Michèle Bernstein]], [[Jeppesen Victor Martin]], [[Jan Stijbosch]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Théo Frey]], [[Mustapha Khayati]], [[Donald Nicholson-Smith]], [[René Riesel]], and [[René Viénet]].

Classic Situationist texts include: ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]'', ''[[Society of the Spectacle]]'' by Guy Debord, and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by Raoul Vaneigem.

The first English-language collection of SI writings, although poorly and freely translated, was ''Leaving The 20th century'' edited by Christopher Gray. ''[[The Situationist International Anthology]]'' edited and translated by [[Ken Knabb]], collected numerous SI documents which had previously never been seen in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/index.htm|title=Situationist International Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Marxism===
Rooted firmly in the [[Marxist]] tradition, the Situationist International criticized [[Trotskyism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]] from a position they believed to be further left and more properly Marxist. The situationists possessed a strong anti-authoritarian current, commonly deriding the centralized bureaucracies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the same breath as capitalism.

Debord's work ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) established situationist analysis as [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] critical theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ''The Society of the Spectacle'' is widely recognized as the main and most influential Situationist essay.&lt;ref name="Agamben1990"&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]] (1990), "''Glosse in margine ai Commentari sulla societa dello spettacolo''" in {{Harvnb|Debord|1990|pp=233–250}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt; On book ''Society of Spectacle'': "l'analisi più lucida e severa delle miserie e della servitù di una società—quella dello spettacolo, in cui noi viviamo—che ha esteso oggi il suo dominio su tutto il pianeta&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was [[anti-capitalist]],&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIAntiCapitalism"&gt;[[Richard Gombin]] (1971), chap. 3, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International is that of total contestation of modern capitalism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI6DebordTapeRecord1961"&gt;Guy Debord (1961) ''[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/6.everyday.htm Perspectives for Conscious Changes in Everyday Life]''. This work was originally presented by tape recording 17 May 1961 at a conference of the [[Group for Research on Everyday Life]] convened in Paris by [[Henri Lefebvre]]. Its first print appearance was in Internationale Situationniste #6 (Paris, August 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI8EditorialNotes"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/is8.html Editorial Notes]'', Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist]], [[Young Hegelian]],&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"&gt;Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Winter 1997), quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;In particular the key issue, of how and why the situationists came to have a preponderant role in May 1968—that is, how and why their brand of politics participated in, and to an extent fueled, a crisis of the late-capitalist State—is still wide open to interpretation.&lt;/blockquote&gt; A description of the portion of the Left at clash with the situationists is found in note #4: &lt;blockquote&gt;The word "Left" [[...]] much of the time is used descriptively, and therefore pessimistically, to indicate a set of interlocking ideological directorships stretching roughly from the statist and workerist fringes of social democracy and laborism to the para-academic journals and [[think tank]]s of latter-day [[Trotskyism]], taking in the [[Stalinist]] and lightly post-Stalinist center along the way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and from the very beginning in the 50s, remarkably differently from the established Left, [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] and against all repressive regimes.&lt;ref name="BandiniAntiStalisnism"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandini|1998|Preface to second edition}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Non a caso l'I.S. sorge ed e' coeva alla denuncia dello Stalinismo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;ref name="DasKapitalEntrySentence"&gt;''[[Das Kapital]]'', entry sentence, p. 125: "The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an 'immense collection of commodities'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DebordThesis1st"&gt;''"The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles."'' Debord G.E. (1967), thesis 1st.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx's work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the ''[[wealth]]'' is degraded to an immense accumulation of [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]], Debord argues that in [[advanced capitalism]], life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where "all that once was directly lived has become mere representation".&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 17, 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies,&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 34&lt;/ref&gt; has its "most glaring superficial manifestation" in the [[advertising]]-[[mass media]]-[[marketing]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on Marx's argument that under capitalism our lives and our environment are continually depleted, Debord adds that the Spectacle is the system by which capitalism tries to hide such depletion. Debord added that, further than the impoverishment in the [[quality of life]],&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1967QualityOfLife"&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 37, 60, 68, 114, 134&lt;/ref&gt; our psychic functions are altered, we get a degradation of mind and also a degradation of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 25, 192&lt;/ref&gt; In the spectacular society, knowledge is not used anymore to question, analyze, or resolve [[contradiction]]s, but to assuage reality. Such argument on the Spectacle as a mask&lt;ref name="DebordOnSpectacleRealUnity"&gt;''"The real unity the spectacle proclaims masks the class division on which the real unity of the capitalist mode of production is based."'' Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 72.&lt;/ref&gt; of a degrading reality has been elaborated by many Situationist artists, producing [[détournement]]s of advertising where instead of a shiny life the crude reality was represented. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Situationist theorists advocated methods of operation that included [[worker's council|democratic workers' councils]] and [[workers' self-management]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-12March1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Italian section of the SI in Milan and to Mario Perniola in Rome,
12 March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-9December1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Paolo Salvadori 9 December [19]69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-17March1970.html Guy Debord letter] To all the sections of the SI, [17 March 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-30July1969.html#_edn4 Guy Debord letter] To Rene Vienet, Wednesday 30 July [19]69&lt;/ref&gt; interested in empowering the individual, in contrast to the perceived corrupt bureaucratic states of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Their anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marxist theory can be identified with the broader [[council communism|council communist]] and [[libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]] movements, themselves more broadly termed as [[left communism]].

The last issue (1972) of the ''Situationist International'' journal, featured an editorial analyzing the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]. The editorial, written by [[Guy Debord]], was titled ''The Beginning of an Era'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Situationist International |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm |title=''The Beginning of an Era'' |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1966-12-09 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably as a [[detournement]] reference of ''[[Nachalo]]'' (''The Beginning''), a Russian Marxist monthly magazine.

According to [[Greil Marcus]], some found similarities between the Situationists and the [[Yippies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] ''The long walk of the Situationist International'' in McDonough (2004), ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Former situationists Clark and Nicholson-Smith (British section), argued that the portion of the moderate Left that is the "established Left", and its "Left opinion-makers", usually addressed contemptuously the SI as "hopelessly [[young-Hegelian]]".&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt;

===Relationship with anarchism===
The Situationist International was differentiated from both [[anarchist]]s and [[Marxist]]s. In spite of this, they have frequently been associated with anarchism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Debord did a critical assessment of the anarchists in his 1967 ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) ''The Society of the Spectacle'', chap. 4 ''The Proletariat as Subject and as Representation'', theses 92-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the final, 12th issue of the journal, the situationists rejected [[spontaneism]] and the "mystics of nonorganization," labeling them as a form of "sub-anarchism":&lt;ref name="Riesel969"&gt;Riesel, René [http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/councils.html ''Preliminaries on Councils and Councilist Organization''], International Situationniste #12 (September 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The only people who will be excluded from this debate are... those who in the name of some sub-anarchist spontaneism proclaim their opposition to any form of organization, and who only reproduce the defects and confusion of the old movement—mystics of nonorganization, workers discouraged by having been mixed up with Trotskyist sects too long, students imprisoned in their impoverishment who are incapable of escaping from bolshevik organizational schemas. The situationists are obviously partisans of organization—the existence of the situationist organization testifies to that. Those who announce their agreement with our theses while crediting the SI with a vague spontaneism simply don't know how to read.}}

According to situationist [[Ken Knabb]], Debord pointed out the flaws and merits of both Marxism and anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Knabb |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/joyrev2.htm#N_3_ |title=The Joy of Revolution (chap. 2) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1980-10-28 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "the split between Marxism and anarchism crippled both sides. The anarchists rightly criticized the authoritarian and narrowly economistic tendencies in Marxism, but they generally did so in an undialectical, moralistic, ahistorical manner... and leaving Marx and a few of the more radical Marxists with a virtual monopoly on coherent dialectical analysis—until the situationists finally brought the libertarian and dialectical aspects back together again."

===Relationship with the established left===
The SI poses a challenge to the model of political action of a portion of the left,&lt;ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97"&gt;Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Spring 1997), response to [[Peter Wollen]] (March–April 1989). Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;So far as Wollen is concerned, the anger was provoked by his essay on the history of the SI, and specifically his three-sentence treatment of the organization in its last decade. We think he should look again at these sentences (which conclude some thirty pages of discussion of the SI's place in modern art), and ask himself whether they are not lofty, contemptuous, and dismissive. That's how they read to us. They seem to epitomize—and, in view of their publication history, to enshrine—a certain effort to turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties. Like Wollen, presumably, we think that those up-heavals are of much more than historical interest, and every day they are traduced and trivialized by the [[culture industry]]. Much is at stake, therefore. We wanted to denounce a loose conspirancy of silence and misrepresentation which has been the response of a portion of the Left to the challenge that the SI poses to their model of political action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the "established Left" and "Left opinion-makers".&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt; The first challenging aspect is the fueling role that the SI had in the upheavals of the political and social movements of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt; upheavals for which much is still at stake and which many foresee as recurring in the 21st century. The second challenging aspect,&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt; is the comparison between the Situationist Marxist theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle]], which is still very topical 30 years later,&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luttazzi2008"/&gt; and the current status of the theories supported by leftist establishments in the same period, like [[Althusserianism]], [[Maoism]], [[workerism]], [[Freudo-Marxism]] and others.&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt;

The response to this challenge has been an attempt to silence and misinterpret, to "turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties".&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97"/&gt;

The core aspect of the revolutionary perspectives, and the political theory, of the Situationist International, has been neglected by some commentators,&lt;ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics"&gt;Ken Knabb (2006) ''SI Anthology'', Bibliography – Books about the SI – In English, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; which either limited themselves to an apolitical reading of the situationist [[avant-garde]] art works, or dismissed the Situationist political theory. Examples of this are [[Simon Sadler]]'s ''The Situationist City'',&lt;ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics"/&gt; and the accounts on the SI published by the ''[[New Left Review]]''.&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt;

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was [[anti-capitalist]],&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIAntiCapitalism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI6DebordTapeRecord1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI8EditorialNotes"/&gt; [[Marxist]], [[Young Hegelian]],&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt; and from the very beginning in the 1950s, remarkably differently from the established Left, [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] and against all repressive regimes.&lt;ref name="BandiniAntiStalisnism"/&gt; The SI called in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] for the formation of [[Workers councils]],&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; and someone has argued that they were aligned with [[council communism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There was no separation between the artistic and the political perspectives.&lt;ref name="BandiniArtAndPolitics"/&gt; For instance, [[Asger Jorn]] never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Lippolis]] (2000) ''Notizie su Asger Jorn, situazionista iperpolitico'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Lippolis (2000) ''Un dialogo tra vandali civilizzatori nello sfacelo dell'impero della merce'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Criticism===
Critics of the Situationists frequently assert that their ideas are not in fact complex and difficult to understand, but are at best simple ideas expressed in deliberately difficult language, and at worst actually nonsensical. For example, anarchist [[Chaz Bufe]] asserts in [[Listen Anarchist!]] that "obscure situationist jargon" is a major problem in the anarchist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Listen Anarchist! | author=Chaz Bufe | url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html | publisher=See Sharp Press | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Gibbons argues that the Parisian situationists failed to take on board practically or theoretically the experience of their African embers, such as is shown by [[Abdelhafid Khattib]]'s experience of police harassment while conducting psychogeographic research on [[les Halles]] in 1958. She remarks how little the suppression of Algerians in Paris had on their activity and thinking – Bernstein and Debord co-signed the ''Declaration on the Right to Insubordination in the Algerian War'' in 1961, which led to them being questioned by the police. She cites a letter written by Jacqueline de Jong, Jorgen Nash, and Ansgar Elde protesting the expulsion of the ''Spur'' group in 1962 which highlights the political repression in Paris at that time. Gibbons also criticises the lack of mention of the Algerian situationists in either Debord's or Vaneigem's memoirs.&lt;ref name="Gibbons"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbons|first1=Andrea|title=Salvaging Situationism: Race and Space {{!}} Salvage|url=http://salvage.zone/in-print/salvaging-situationism-race-and-space/|website=salvage.zone|publisher=Salvage|accessdate=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
[[File:Liberatelondon.GIF|thumb|left|evoL PsychogeogrAphix 2003]]

Debord's analysis of the spectacle has been influential among people working on television, particularly in France and Italy;&lt;ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida02Q&amp;A"&gt;Derrida (2002) Q&amp;A session at Film Forum pp. 116–7 quote: {{quote|I think you probably know that his work [Debord's] is read now more than when he was alive. At least that's the case in France. I don't know if he's read in the States, but in France he's read as presenting a precise critique and political analysis of the media, of the becoming-spectacle, the exploitation of the 'show' in politics and in the media, and television.

What's interesting is that in France people, especially the writers or the intellectuals who are often asked to appear on TV—sometimes almost every day—they [reflexively] mention Guy Debord as their master, and I hate this! So I never quote Debord when I'm on TV, and I'm almost never on TV—so I guess that's how, in my way, I'm true to Debord.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy, TV programs produced by situationist intellectuals, like Antonio Ricci's ''[[Striscia la notizia]]'', or Carlo Freccero's programming schedule for ''[[Italia 1]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95"&gt;[[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] (2002) [1995] ''Guy Debord Is Really Dead'', Sabotage Editions, {{ISBN|978-0-9514417-3-2}} English edition of ''[http://www.scienzepostmoderne.org/DiversiAutori/Debord/DebordMortoDavvero.html Guy Debord è morto davvero]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives. Examples of these groups include: in Amsterdam, the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]; in the UK, [[King Mob]], the producers of ''Heatwave'' magazine (including [[Charles Radcliffe]] who later briefly joined the [[Members of the Situationist International#English Section (5)|English Section of the Situationist International]]), and the [[Angry Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Situationist-International-in-Britain-Modernism-Surrealism-and-the/Cooper/p/book/9781138680456|title=The Situationist International in Britain: modernism, surrealism, and the avant-gardes|last=Cooper|first=Sam|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138680456|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, groups like [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] (later [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]), [[Weatherman (organization)|The Weathermen]], and the [[Chicago Surrealist Group|Rebel Worker]] group also explicitly employed their ideas.&lt;ref name="Lang 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lang | first=Daniel | title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade | journal=Cultural Recycling | volume=3 | issue=1 |date=May 2007 | url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist theorists such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]], and [[John Zerzan]], have developed the SI's ideas in various directions away from Marxism. These theorists were predominantly associated with the magazines ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', and ''[[Green Anarchy]]''. During the early 1980s, English anarchist Larry Law produced the ''Spectacular Times'' pocket-books series, which aimed to make Situationist ideas more easily assimilated into the anarchist movement. Later anarchist theorists such as the [[CrimethInc.]] collective also claim Situationist influence.&lt;ref name="Lang 2007"/&gt;

Situationist urban theory, defined initially by the members of the [[Lettrist International]] as "Unitary Urbanism," was extensively developed through the behavioural and performance structures of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]] during the 1990s. The re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] also inspired many new psychogeographical groups including Manchester Area Psychogeographic. The LPA and the [[Neoist Alliance]] along with the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] Project came together to form a New [[Lettrist International]] with a specifically [[Communist]] perspective. Around this time, [[Unpopular Books]] and the LPA released some key texts including new translations of [[Asger Jorn]]'s work.

Around this time also, groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]] and [[Adbusters]] have, respectively, seen themselves as "creating situations" or practicing detournement on advertisements.

In cultural terms, the SI's influence has arguably been greater, if more diffuse. The list of cultural practices which claim a debt to the SI is extensive, but there are some prominent examples:
* Situationist ideas exerted a strong influence on the design language of the [[punk rock]] phenomenon of the 1970s. To a significant extent this came about due to the adoption of the style and aesthetics and sometimes slogans employed by the SI. These were often second hand, via English pro-Situ groups such as [[King Mob]] whose associates included [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[Jamie Reid]]. [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]] was influenced by Situationist [[The Haçienda|urbanism]] and Factory Records band [[The Durutti Column]] took its name from Andre Bertrand's collage ''Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti | author=| url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/durutti_le_retour_66.html | publisher=Cerysmatic Factory | accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bertrand, in turn, took his title from the eponymous [[Durruti Column|anarchist army]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]). U.S. punk group The [[Feederz]] have been acclaimed as exhibiting a more direct and conscious influence. Formed in the late 1970s, they became known for extensive use of detournement and their intention to provoke their audience through the exposition of Situationist themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Situationist International in American Hardcore Punk, 1982–2002 | author=Neil Nehring | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/911505403-40919005/content~content=a758328513~tab=send | publisher=Popular Music &amp; Society | date=December 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other musical artists whose lyrics and artwork have referenced Situationist concepts include: [[David Bowie]], [[Seahorse Liberation Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Really Free Culture: Anarchist Communities, Radical Movements, and Public Practices | author=Lee Tusman| url=https://books.google.com/?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=seahorse+liberation+army+situationist#v=onepage&amp;q=seahorse%20liberation%20army%20situationist&amp;f=false | publisher=Pedia Press | date= 2009 | accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Love Kills Theory]], [[Chumbawamba]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]], [[The Spectacle]], [[International Noise Conspiracy]] and [[Refused]]. Situationist theory experienced a vogue in the late '90s [[hardcore punk]] scene, being referenced by [[Orchid (screamo band)|Orchid]], [[His Hero Is Gone]], and [[CrimethInc.]]
* One can also trace situationist ideas within the development of other avant-garde threads such as [[Neoism]], as well as artists such as [[Mark Divo]].
* Some hacker related e-zines, which, like [[samizdat]], were distributed via email and [[FTP]] over early [[Internet]] links and [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] quoted and developed ideas coming from SI. A few of them were N0 Way, N0 Route, UHF, in France; and early [[Phrack]], [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]] in the US. More recently, writers such as [[Thomas de Zengotita]] have echoed Situationist theories regarding the [[Mediated: How the Media Shapes your World and the Way you Live in it|spectacle]] of contemporary society.

{{Nihongo|'''''Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi bridge and Atake'''''|大はしあたけの夕立|''Ōhashi atake no yūdachi''}} is a woodblock print in the [[ukiyo-e]] genre by the Japanese artist [[Hiroshige]].  It was published in 1857 as part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' and is one of the best known of Hiroshige's prints.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'&gt;{{cite book |last=Bicknell |first=Julian |date=1994 |title=Hiroshige in Tokyo: The Floating World of Edo |location=London |publisher=New England Editions Limited |page=118 |isbn=1-56640-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known variant state of this print, the variant owned by [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], is in fact a later state. The first state depicted an additional two boats, a different background, less angular rain, and a carving error in the pylons that was corrected by handpainting.

==''One Hundred Famous Views of Edo''==
The picture is part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' which actually features 119 views of 'named places' or 'celebrated spots' in the area that is today [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Brooklyn Museum - Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt; The series was unique in being the first to feature this many separate landscape views.&lt;ref name="brooklyn2"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was produced between 1856 and 1859 with [[Hiroshige II]] finishing the series after the death of Hiroshige in 1858. This print was published in the [[Japanese calendar|ninth month]] of 1857.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; The series was commissioned shortly after the [[1855 Edo earthquake]] and subsequent fires and featured many of the newly rebuilt or repaired buildings. The prints may have commemorated or helped draw Edo's citizens attention to the progress of the rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulumuseum.org/art/exhibitions/11559-good_news_hiroshige_new_interpretation_series_one_hundred_famous_views_edo/ Good News from Hiroshige: A New Interpretation of the Series “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Shinohashi bridge Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|The modern Shinohashi bridge in Tokyo in a very similar location to the old bridge.]]
The print shows a small part of the wooden ''Ōhashi'' (Great) bridge diagonally across the foreground of the image as the bridge crosses the [[Sumida River]]. In the background is a boatman punting his log raft towards the Fukagawa timber yards, looking for shelter.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/121666/Sudden_Shower_Over_Shin-Ohashi_Bridge_and_Atake_Ohashi_Atake_no_Yudachi_No._58_from_One_Hundred_Famous_Views_of_Edo Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake (Ohashi Atake no Yudachi), No. 58 from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt;&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt; Also seen is the far bank of the river in a part of Edo known as ''Atake'' after the government ship, the ''Atakemaru'' that was moored there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08533/artifact_aspx_id_1074.html Ohashi bridge, evening shower in Atake]&lt;/ref&gt; Two women and four or five men are shown crossing the bridge sheltering under hats, umbrellas or straw capes from a sudden shower of rain.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; Sudden showers are a recurring theme in ukiyo-e works and here in what Hiroshige calls "white rain"&lt;ref name="artwolf"&gt;[http://www.theartwolf.com/masterworks/hiroshige.htm 'Oshashi Bridge &amp; Atake in a suden shower']&lt;/ref&gt; are depicted using a large number of thin dark parallel lines in 2 directions - a difficult skill in woodblock printing.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/55433?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=hiroshige&amp;pos=24 Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge and Atake (Ōhashi Atake no yūdachi), from the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.transparent.com/japanese/hiroshige/ Japanese Language Blog - Hiroshige]&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the print are dark clouds from which the rain emanates, these are produced using a [[Bokashi (printing)|
bokashi]] technique, another difficult printing technique, and vary significantly between prints. Other bokashi areas seen in some prints are the water around the bridge and the bridge's roadway.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; The rain, sheltering people and log raft at the centre of the image give the image a sense of movement.&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terimakasih.cc/gallery/ukiyoe.html Ukiyoe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges have been sited at that same location since 1694. The wooden bridge depicted in the print was replaced by another bridge in 1885, completed in 1912 and later moved to a new site elsewhere. The current bridge at the site was erected in 1973.

Hiroshige's most popular prints were produced in the tens of thousands at a low individual cost and due to the [[Bakumatsu|opening up of Japan]] after 1853 were popular both in Japan and Europe where they had a [[Japonism|huge influence]] on the future [[Impressionist]] artists.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3669308/Hiroshige-Master-printmaker-still-making-waves.html Hiroshige: Master printmaker still making waves]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japonisme"&gt;{{cite book |author1=G.P.

He used for example non-Western [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] in the siting of the bridges, sometimes using no detailed foreground or background objects, scurrying undetailed people on the bridges, large area of [[negative space]] and the odd boat on the river.&lt;ref name="Japonisme"/&gt; The theme of scurrying people sheltering from the weather under umbrellas that is typical of ''One Hundred Views of Edo'' was an influence on [[Félix Buhot]]'s ''Le Petit Enterrement'' and Hiroshige's high horizons, areas of blue wash and strong foreground imagery with lack of middle ground influenced [[Auguste-Louis Lepère]]'s prints such as ''La Convalescente: Madame Lepère''.&lt;ref name="Japonisme"/&gt;

[[File:Hiroshige Van Gogh 2.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Hiroshige's original woodblock print and Van Gogh's copy in oil]]
[[Vincent van Gogh]] was a major collector of Japanese prints,&lt;ref name="VGG"&gt;[http://blog.vangoghgallery.com/index.php/2013/01/08/van-gogh-and-japanese-art-part-1/ Van Gogh and Japanese Art, Part 1 - The Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige) &amp; Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)]&lt;/ref&gt; decorating his studio with them. [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|He was heavily influenced by these prints]], particularly Hiroshige, and made copies of two of the ''One Hundred Famous Views of Edo'', ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' and this one. He made these copies in order to try out for himself elements he admired such as the cropped composition, blocks of colour with strong outlines and diagonal elements.&lt;ref name="VGM"/&gt;
Van Gogh's painting used brighter colours with greater contrast than the original, conspicuous brushstrokes rather than areas of flat colour, and was also framed with a selection of Van Gogh's approximations to Japanese characters.&lt;ref name="VGG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGM"&gt;[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0114V1962 Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiroshige's print was listed by ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s art critic Laura Cumming as one of the 10 best skies in art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/11/10-best-skies-art-in-pictures The 10 best... skies in art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer [[Geoffrey Poole]] produced the work ''Crossing Ohashi Bridge'' for the [[Goldberg Ensemble]] and named after Hiroshige's print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/recording/goldberg-ensemble-crossing-ohashi-bridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swedish art''' refers to the visual arts produced in [[Sweden]] or by Swedish artists.  Sweden has existed as country for over 1,000 years, and for times before this, as well as many subsequent periods, Swedish art is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Swedish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Sweden has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Swedish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Sweden has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation greatly disrupted Swedish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requiremnents of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the late 17th or 18th centuries that large numbers of Swedes were trained in contemporary styles.  The political success of the [[Vasa dynasty]] led to a considerable revival, expressed in the "Gustavan style", which again had some influence over neighbouring countries.    

Among famous Swedish artists are [[Johan Tobias Sergel]], [[Carl Milles]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Carl Eldh]]. 
==History==
=== Prehistoric art ===
[[File:Aspberget rock carving Sweden 4.jpg|thumb|Pre-historic petroglyphs in [[Tanum Municipality|Tanum]]]]
When the ice age ended, the Scandinavian peninsula was populated from the south by hunters and gatherers. Art surviving from that period are [[Stone Age]] expressions and is simple and reflects the available material. Only the truly persistent art forms have survived the ravages of time: [[petroglyph]]s, are such an expression. The earliest rock carvings in the form of symbols, characters and images are carved in rock outcrops and boulders. They began to be produced about 7000 BC. Sweden has one of the largest concentrations of petroglyphs with a local center in [[Tanum Municipality]] in [[Bohuslän]] province.
  
During the [[Bronze Age]], a spiral ornamentation was produced in the style that existed in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"&gt;{{cite web |author=Östby, Leif &amp; Frode Ernst Haverkamp |year=2009 |url=http://www.snl.no/Sverige/kunst |title=Sverige - kunst |publisher= Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 400 AD, the development of the Nordic animal ornamentation, an unusually rich and imaginative style that reached its peak during the 7th century with the so-called Vendel style. Animal ornamentation experienced a renewed flourishing of the [[rune stones]]. Rune stones - some of which are quite illustrative and are therefore called “image blocks” - were added between about  200 AD and 1130 with a flourishing between the period 980-1100. As an art form, the rune stone is specific to the Nordic culture. Sweden leads the way with the highest amount of rune stones with a total of 2,800 inscriptions. Approximately 85% of all the identified blocks have been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm nordiska.uu.se]&lt;/ref&gt; The stones were originally painted and combined text with ornamentation and stylized characters. They can be divided into seven different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gräslund, Anne-Sofie (2006). ''Dating the Swedish Viking-Age rune stones on stylistic grounds'', Runes and their secrets: studies in runology. {{ISBN|978-87-635-0627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first known image-makers in Sweden were, in fact, rune carvers.

Sweden, especially the south of the country, also participated in [[Viking Age art]], along with the rest of Scandinavia.

=== Medieval and Gothic art ===
[[File:Harkeberga 0844.jpg|thumb|left|This painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] can be seen in [[Härkeberga Church]] (c. 1480).]]
With the advent of Christianity came a new iconography, originally established in the churches, particularly in the form of altar screens, crucifixes, and stones. According to the [[Swedish History Museum]], no other country has such a rich and comprehensive collection of medieval liturgical art.&lt;ref name=hmus&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historiska.se/historia/medeltiden/livochsamhalle/kyrkanlivetscentrum/|title= Kyrkan - livets centrum - Historiska|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 31 January 2007|website= www.historiska.se|publisher= [[Swedish History Museum]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity was shown in [[Romanesque art]] products fabrics and gold works. From the 13th century, Gotland was a center for sculptors, such as the anonymous [[Master Majestatis]]. The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style came to Sweden during the second half of the 13th century. [[Linköping]] Cathedral is mostly conducted in English Gothic style and contains richly decorated sculptures. Several works from this period exhibit a French influence, for example the [[triumphal cross]] from [[Öja Church]], Gotland and St. Erik's statue in [[Roslags-Bro Church]] in Uppland. There are also Gothic monumental paintings on wood in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Visual narratives gained momentum in the churches in central Sweden in the late 15th century by masters such as [[Nils Håkansson]], Master Petrus. Håkansson's student, [[Albertus Pictor|Albert the painter]], however, was to become far more famous for his religious paintings in Uppland. Motives during this period were often religious or mythical. Albert the painter, motivated by a chess playing Grim Reaper in [[Täby Church]], was the inspiration for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' almost 600 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Contemporary with Albertus the Painter is the famous sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] in the [[Storkyrkan|Great Church]] of Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;Hillman, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by the German-born painter and sculptor [[Bernt Notke]], one of the late Middle Ages the most important northern European artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/kort/berntnotke Nationalencyklopedin: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt; Notke, who periodically lived in Sweden, was very productive and had great influence with an intense and expressionistic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/420621/Bernt-Notke Encyklopedia Britannica: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance and Baroque art ===
[[File:Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|17th century copy of [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]]'s ''Vädersoltavlan'', the oldest known image of Stockholm. The painting can be seen in Storkyrkan.]]
The Vasa period of art consisted largely of portraits of princes, which were painted by foreign artists who were active in Sweden. [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]] with his ''Vädersoltavla'' from 1535, in the Great Church in Stockholm, was an exception. He is one of the few well-known Swedish artists during the Vasa period and the Renaissance era.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

[[File:Georg Stiernhielm, 1598-1672.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] painted this portrait of [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (1663)]]
[[File:Gustav III of Sweden 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Roslin]]'s magnificent portrait of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1777)]]

The pompous, happy and decorative made its entrance in the 17th century Great Power - during the 17th and 18th centuries the first few decades - was a grand time for architecture. A number of castles, mansions and churches built, like the Royal Palace, meant that artists were called from abroad. These foreign artists trained new generations of Swedish artists. More significant art collections were acquired through spoils of war. One famous artist was the court painter [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Ehrenstral was also a portraitist and animal painter, and worked with the [[Drottningholm Palace]], together with Johan Sylvius.  [[Erik Dahlbergh]] depicted the superpower era of Sweden in the great work ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]''. Other painters were [[David von Krafft]], [[Michael Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

===Rococo and the Gustavian style===
Liberty and the Gustavian period was a major cultural boom in Sweden. At this time, [[Rococo]] was the initial style.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Future portrait paintings made it internationally known in Swedish painting.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt; During the period, many Swedish artists moved to continental Europe. A representative of the rococo was [[Gustaf Lundberg]]. His technique was long dominant in the Swedish portrait arts, and he is represented at the Louvre and the National Museum and Art Academy. The French painter [[Guillaume Taraval]] was called upon to decorate the Royal Palace. Together with [[Carl Hårleman]] he advocated the new relaxed style. A leading style artist was [[Jean Eric Rehn]], a student of Hårleman, who worked as craftsmen, architect and artist.

[[Alexander Roslin]] took inspiration from France and conducted many highly sensitive portraits of the era's finest personalities. Some of Roslin's portraits are among the most reproduced from the period. Of major importance was also [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], who became a court painter in Denmark. Pilo was inspired both by Venetian artists and the Dutchman [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Pilo returned, however, to Sweden and then painted the great work Gustaf III's coronation in Stockholm Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Other prominent names were [[Johan Pasch]], [[Per Krafft the Elder]], [[Peter Adolf Hall]] and, perhaps most importantly, [[Johan Tobias Sergel]]. Over time, beginning around 1770, Rococo was succeeded in Sweden by the Gustavian period. Swedish neoclassicism is said to have begun around 1785. The Gustavian period was characterized by both French and English influence. 
  
After Gustav III's death, there was a period of stagnation in Swedish art. On the other hand, peasant painting flourished in particular, Dalarna and Hälsingland with painting and [[Dala horse]]s during this time.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Peasantry painting became a major inspiration for the 18th century artist [[Carl Larsson]].  [[Gothicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were the styles of art for several decades, including artists like the sculptor [[Bengt Fogelberg]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Fogelberg, who was inspired by the Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], created powerful statues of Nordic gudagestalter and historical figures.

=== Karl Johan style ===
From the mid-19th century and a few decades later, nature paintings dominated the scene, with Marcus Larsson in the lead. Artists that pointed to something new were Egron Lundgren and Carl Fredrik Hill. Hill became one of the foremost Swedish landscape-painters as he had views that reflected his personality and often express despair and darkness. Egron Lundberg developed watercolor art,  as he traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, and painted his findings. Even history painting was done extensively during the period, including artists such as Carl Gustav Hellquist Gustaf and Cederstrom.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Another painter was August Malmström who created historic and romantic nature works and illustrated many fairytales.

=== Romanticism and naturalism ===

From an international perspective Swedish-produced art languished in obscurity until the late 19th century, when a number of Swedish artists gained attention outside of Sweden. Especially the 1880s and the following two decades were periods of greatness in the Swedish art. Perhaps the best artist of them is the painter, sculptor, and printmaker [[Anders Zorn]]. Zorn was an extremely talented oil painter with a very precise but free style.[[File:Midsommardans av Anders Zorn 1897.jpg|thumb|180px|left| [[Anders Zorn]]'s ''Midsummer Dance'', 1897]] Anders Zorn painted landscapes and people and is known for his nude studies of the hillocks from [[Dalarna]].{{huh|date=February 2016}} Zorn was also concerned with depicting peasant life in his home province of Dalarna. Woman artist [[Amalia Lindegren]] also created glorified scenes of the Swedish peasant and folk. Zorn was counted as one of the foremost painters in Europe in the late 19th century and made many portraits of contemporary celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4aug/art0822.html#zorn Safran-Arts.com:Anders Leonard Zorn]&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous work is ''Love's Nymph'' (1883), ''A Prime'' (1888), ''Midsummer Dance'' (1897), ''President Grover Cleveland'' (1899) and ''Bathing hills'' (1906). Zorn's art is featured at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the [[White House]], and his works are among the most valued of all Swedish artists.

Another big name from this generation is [[Carl Larsson]]. Larsson, like Zorn, appeared in Dalarna and is one of the most beloved Swedish artists. Larsson painted primarily in watercolor and his motives were found in daily life: he often portrayed his own family and their home in Sundborn. His style is airy, very light and is characterized by a skillful interplay of surfaces and lines. Larsson created frescoes and wall paintings, like Midvinterblot and several other frescoes in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Larsson became very famous in Germany in connection with an art book, A Home, that was published there. Another painter who achieved great popular popularity was [[Bruno Liljefors]] with very precise paintings of nature and animals in motion.

Two painters with great stylistic ability were [[Eugène Jansson]] and [[Ernst Josephson]]. Jansson's paintings, which took stylistic inspiration from [[van Gogh]], are often simple geometric forms a large, quiet Stockholm Ground and powerful male figures. Josephsson is more varied and known for masterful oil portraits. He became an inspiration for the later modernism. Portrait painting was also developed by Richard Bergh as well as by [[Nils Kreuger]]. A significant development came in 1885 with the artist's group The Opponents, who wanted to renew the Swedish painting and collected many of those names. A few years later, in the 1890s, Bergh and Kreuger founded the Dorset School together with [[Karl Nordström]]. They reacted against the realistic landscape style and were inspired by Paul Gauguin. Especially Nordström was inspired by the French impressionists. A close friend of Nordström was the author and the universal genius of [[August Strindberg]]. Even Strindberg was an important Swedish painter from the period. The rise of women artists, such as [[Eva Bonnier]], and [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]], who, among other things, took inspiration from Rembrandt, also becomes prominent in this period.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

=== Modernism and expressionism ===

Modernism began to enter Swedish art with [[Axel Törneman]] and then the Men of 1909, which was a group of young male artists, mainly from the Artist League school. More abstract forms were represented by [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Nils von Dardel]] and [[Gösta Adrian Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

The mid-1920s and a couple of decades following were both characterized by surrealism, the [[Halmstad Group]], and of expressionism, which includes Gothenburg Schools realists, Sven Erixson and Bror Hjorth and a rigorous formalist, abstract minimalism of artists such as [[Olle Bærtling]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Among the sculptors of the period are Carl Eldh and [[Carl Milles]]. Both have had great influence and the latter is perhaps the most famous Swedish sculptor of all time. From the same generation of sculptors came the self-taught wood sculptor and realist people portrayer [[Axel Petersson Döderhultarn]].

After World War II,  Swedish art was something of a boom and a host of artists established themselves. With a new democratic idea that art was founded for everyone in 1947, popular movements promoting art and in the same period also launched a variety of arts organizations across the country. Among the 1930s radicals as painter [[Albin Amelin]] and graphic artist and monumental painter [[Torsten Billman]] the work continued to bring images to the working people. Torsten Billman could also through his literary illustrations reach new groups. In the 1950s expressionists emerged like Torsten Renqvist and more informal painter Rune Jansson and Eddie Figge.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

In the early 1960s, was revitalized by the Swedish graphic artists as Philip von Schantz and Nils G. Stenqvist.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

In film-making, a '''swing gang''' is one or more persons who make last-minute changes on a [[film set]]. This may include construction of new portions of a set the [[Director (film)|director]] requests or simply striking large [[furniture]] at a [[set decorator]]'s request. The swing gang is part of the [[Set dresser|set dressing]] department. Sets that are not part of the "permanent" sets are called swing set. They come and go as the scripts dictate. Thus the crew that handles the set dressing elements are called the swing gang. These sets may need to be struck during the late evening or the "swing shift".

The film was a box office success, raising $142 million from a budget of $15 million. The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits; but it was also criticized by some critics for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical." The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], without winning any; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Steven Spielberg didn't receive an Academy Award nomination for his directing, but did receive a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.

==Plot==
Celie Harris is an [[African Americans|African-American]] teenager in early 20th century rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who had had two children by her abusive stepfather, both of whom have been taken from her. She is given away as a wife to widower Albert Johnson, who already has three children, and is soon abused. Celie's sister Nettie, whom she has vowed to protect, escapes their abusive stepfather and seeks shelter at the Johnson estate. Albert immediately takes a romantic interest in Nettie and lets her stay, where she and Celie promise to write each other should they ever be separated. Nettie teaches Celie to read and the two are happy together, until Albert sexually assaults Nettie while on her way to school. She successfully fights him off, and is forcibly removed from the property.

Years later, Celie is now a meek adult who has avoided standing up to Johnson's continued abuse. His eldest son Harpo marries his girlfriend Sofia, a strong-willed, boisterous character, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. On Albert's advice, Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia in an attempt to better control her. After he fails, he asks Celie what to do. Confronted with her own inability to stand up to abuse, she also advises Harpo to start beating Sofia. Sofia forcefully retaliates, and confronts Celie about what she told Harpo, threatening to kill him if he beats her again and telling Celie to do likewise to Albert. Sofia eventually leaves Harpo, taking her children with her.

Johnson and Harpo bring home Shug Avery, a [[showgirl]] and the former's long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], as she suffers from an unknown illness. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Johnson, does not object to Shug's presence, and is in awe of Shug's strong-will and ability to stand up to Albert. She goes above and beyond in nursing Shug back to health, and Shug in turn takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly-opened bar. Obsessed with Shug, Celie follows her around and learns she is in ill standing with the reverend, who is angry about Shug’s wild lifestyle. Celie decides to follow Shug to Memphis, but gets caught by Albert while she’s frantically packing her things.

Sofia is imprisoned and separated from her children after being instigated into a violent confrontation that results in a riot. Years pass, and she is released from prison only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the Mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family, and Ms. Millie tries to drive her, but panics and turns around after encountering a group of Sofia's friends who are only trying to help her.

Shug returns to the Johnson household with her new husband Grady, expecting to receive a [[recording contract]]. Shug gives Celie a letter from Nettie, who tells her that she's working for a couple that has adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Johnson has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie; while he and Grady are out drinking, the two search the house and find a hidden compartment under the floorboards filled with dozens and dozens of letters. Engrossed in reading Nettie’s letters, Celie does not hear Albert’s calls to shave him and he beats her. Celie considers killing Albert with the straight-razor, but Shug intervenes and stops her. At a family gathering including the Johnsons, the Averys, and Sofia's family, Celie finally speaks up against Albert, to Shug and Sofia’s delight, who breaks her silence and finds her old fighting spirit, which prompts Harpo’s new wife to stand up for herself as well. Johnson continues to berate Celie, who then threatens  and curses him. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie with them.

Years later, Celie owns and operates a [[Tailor|tailor shop]], Johnson is old and alone, and Harpo has made amends with Sofia; the two now running the bar together. Celie's stepfather passes away, and she finally learns from Nettie’s letters that he wasn't their biological father, and that when their mother passed, the Harris property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie. After not having performed since her illness, Shug starts singing at Harpo’s bar again. Johnson receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash and helps Nettie, her husband, and Celie’s children return to the USA, where they finally reunite while Johnson watches from a distance.

The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits, but was criticized by some for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical." [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 85% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average score of 6.9/10.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film four stars, calling it "the year's best film." He also praised [[Whoopi Goldberg]], calling her role "one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history" and predicting she would win the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. (She was nominated but did not win.) Ebert wrote of ''The Color Purple'':
{{blockquote|The world of Celie and the others is created so forcibly in this movie that their corner of the South becomes one of those movie places — like [[Land of Oz|Oz]], like [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], like [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] — that lay claim to their own geography in our imaginations. The affirmation at the end of the film is so joyous that this is one of the few movies in a long time that inspires tears of happiness, and earns them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ebert, Roger|title= The Color Purple|date=Dec 20, 1985|work= Chicago Sun Times|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851220/REVIEWS/512200302 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ebert's long-time television collaborator, [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', praised the film as "triumphantly emotional and brave," calling it Spielberg's "successful attempt to enlarge his reputation as a director of youthful entertainments." Siskel wrote that ''The Color Purple'' was "a plea for respect for black women." Although acknowledging that the film was a period drama, he praised its "... incredibly strong stand against the way black men treat black women. Cruel is too kind a word to describe their behavior. The principal black men in ''The Color Purple'' use their women — both wives and daughters — as sexual chattel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Siskel, Gene|title= ''Color Purple'': Powerful, Daring, Sweetly Uplifting|date=Dec 20, 1985|work= Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-20/entertainment/8503280315_1_color-purple-black-men-film |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Janet Maslin]] noted the film's divergence from Walker's book, but made the case that this shift works:
{{blockquote|Mr. Spielberg has looked on the sunny side of Miss Walker's novel, fashioning a grand, multi-hanky entertainment that is as pretty and lavish as the book is plain. If the book is set in the harsh, impoverished atmosphere of rural Georgia, the movie unfolds in a cozy, comfortable, flower-filled wonderland. ... Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him. Although the combination of his sensibilities and Miss Walker's amounts to a colossal mismatch, Mr. Spielberg's ''Color Purple'' manages to have momentum, warmth and staying power all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maslin, Janet|title= Film: 'The Color Purple,' from Steven Spielberg |date=Dec 18, 1985|work=New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-color.html|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film over-sentimental, writing, "there are some great scenes and great performances in ''The Color Purple'', but it is not a great film. Steven Spielberg's turn at 'serious' film-making is marred in more than one place by overblown production that threatens to drown in its own emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Color Purple|date=Dec 31, 1984|work= Variety|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790003.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some critics alleged that the movie stereotyped black people in general&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clegg II, Legrand H.(Chairman, Coalition Against Black Exploitation, Compton)|title= Bad Black Roles In 'Purple' |date=Feb 16, 1986|work=The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-16/entertainment/ca-8496_1_black-family-black-youths-black-man|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and black men in particular,&lt;ref name="Friendly" /&gt; pointing to the fact that Spielberg, a Jew, had directed a predominantly African American story.&lt;ref name=Matthews2&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthews, Jack|title= 3 'Color Purple' Actresses Talk About Its Impact |date=Jan 31, 1986|work=The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-31/entertainment/ca-2876_1_color-purple|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Oliver Stone]] defended ''The Color Purple'' as "an excellent movie, and it was an attempt to deal with an issue that had been overlooked, and it wouldn't have been done if it hadn't been Spielberg. And it's not like everyone says, that he ruined the book. That's horseshit. Nobody was going to ''do'' the book. He made the book live again."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Marc.

In 2004, Ebert included ''The Color Purple'' in his list of "Great Movies". He stated that "I can see its flaws more easily than when I named it the best film of 1985, but I can also understand why it moved me so deeply, and why the greatness of some films depends not on their perfection or logic, but on their heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=The Color Purple Movie Review (1985)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-color-purple-1985|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Brueghel (I), Hendrick van Balen (I) and Gerard Seghers - Allegory of Sight and Smell.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Senses of Sight and Smell'', 1618; copy c.&amp;nbsp;1620]]
[[File:File-Bruegel d. Ä., Jan -The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste - 1618.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste'', 1618; copy c.&amp;nbsp;1620]]
'''''The Five Senses''''' are a pair of [[oil paintings]] made by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and others in 1617&amp;ndash;18, at the same time as he was working with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on a [[The Five Senses (series)|series of five paintings]] on the same topic. The originals were lost in a fire in 1731; faithful copies dated to c.&amp;nbsp;1620 were preserved and are in the [[Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]].

==Background==
Brueghel, like Rubens, was at this time working in [[Antwerp]] at the court of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and his wife [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], governors of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. [[Allegory|Allegorical]] paintings representing the [[five senses]] as female nudes had become fashionable in the previous century, but Brueghel introduced the illustration of the theme by means of assemblages of works of art, musical instruments, scientific instruments and military equipment, accompanied by flowers, [[hunting|game]] and fish,&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90&gt;Ariane van Suchtelen, "8. Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens, ''Allegory of Taste'', in: Anne T. Woollett, Ariane van Suchtelen, ''et al.'', ''Rubens &amp; Brueghel: A Working Friendship'', Exhibition catalogue, Los Angeles: [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], 2006, {{ISBN|9780892368471}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;90&amp;ndash;99, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=series%20depicting%20the%20Five%20Senses%20in%20the%20Museo%20Nacional%20del%20Prado&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;90].&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely adopted by Flemish artists.

==History==
The two paintings were commissioned by the City of Antwerp to be presented to the archducal couple, and were executed by "twelve of the best masters of [the] city". They were paid for in October 1618.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619 they were in the audience chamber at [[Tervuren]] Castle. In 1731 they were destroyed in the fire at [[Coudenberg]] Palace. The surviving pair are close copies by Brueghel, [[Gerard Seghers]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Joost de Momper]];&lt;ref name=Prado1403&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/sight-and-smell/ ''Sight and Smell''], online gallery, [[Prado Museum]], retrieved 9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prado1404&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/taste-hearing-and-touch/ ''Taste, Hearing and Touch''], online gallery, Prado Museum, retrieved 9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Ertz]], "La dinastia dei Brueghel / The Brueghel Dynasty", in: Sergio Gaddi and Doron J.

==Description==
The pair of paintings are unique in including copies of their own works by a group of masters of the Antwerp school.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, pp. 94, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=entire%20Antwerp%20school%20&amp;f=false 96].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sight and Smell'', the paintings in the background include ''The Healing of the Blind'', representing spiritual sight, in contrast with physical sight, represented by a magnifying glass. A telescope in the foreground and a hallway in the rear, lined with art works, leading to an open door into nature and lit from above by shafts of sunlight, also refer to aspects of this sense. The female figure epitomising sight is looking at her reflection in a mirror which is held up for her by a [[putto]], while the other female figure, representing smell, receives a bouquet of flowers from another putto. The dog represents an acute sense of smell, and the [[civet]], stenches.&lt;ref name=Prado1403/&gt;

In ''Taste, Hearing and Touch'', the central scene is a meal; a [[lute]]nist is playing and children singing, epitomising hearing, while one young woman strokes a [[mink]] in her arms, representing touch, and another is about to eat [[oyster]]s, representing taste. Details such as the [[clavichord]] and other musical instruments on the left relate to hearing, and a monkey is pulling the hair of a [[Cupid]], a form of touch. The room and the hall visible in the right rear display pictures which are also related to the three senses: ''The Annunciation'' and ''Minerva's Visit to Parnassus'' (hearing), ''The Dentist'' (touch), and ''The Punishment of Rich Epulon'' and ''The Wedding at Cana'' (taste).&lt;ref name=Prado1404/&gt;

'''Uli figures''' are wooden statues from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Like their neighbors to the north and south, the artistic traditions of the peoples of central New Ireland formerly focused largely around [[burial rites|mortuary rites]]. In contrast to the intricate ''[[malagan]]'' carvings of the north, artists in central New Ireland produced less ornate but more permanent figures known as ''uli'', which were kept and reused many times. No longer made today, uli were displayed as part of lengthy [[fertility rites]] involving the exhumation and reburial of human skulls, which accompanied the planting of [[Sacred herbs|sacred plants]]. 

When a newly carved uli was brought out, a [[shaman]] assisted in inducing the spirit of the deceased chief to enter the carving, and after the ceremony, the work was kept in the "men's house" where it would continue to aid the successor and his people.

Uli figures appear [[hermaphroditic]], having both a phallus and prominent breasts. This blending of male and female features possibly symbolized the fertile and nourishing powers of clan leaders, who were expected to provide for the other members of the clan. The Uli figures probably symbolized the connection between paternal and maternal life energy in initiation ceremonies.

'''vbeauté''' was founded by [[Julie Macklowe]] to provide women with Swiss made anti-age skincare products. vbeauté is a skin care line based on advanced botanical technology using [[plant stem cell]] complexes. Julie Macklow launched vbeauté on November 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belle of it All|url=https://vbeaute.com/index.php/profile/news/read/id/54/|work=Quest Magazine|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  vbeauté's range of products include: peptide-based anti-aging face and eye serums, moisturizers, eye cream, sunscreen, and a face cleanser and exfoliator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Sarah|title=Jet Setter|work=magazine article|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187B9D7ShGY|title=Skin Care: The "It" Kit For Traveling|date=10 January 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnoldy|first=Lindley|title=From finance to fashion|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/02-10-12-from-finance-to-fashion-julie-macklowe-uses-her-250-million-hedge-fund-wizardry-in-the-beauty-world/|work=Online article|publisher=Culture Map Houston|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
vbeauté’s key ingredient in all of their products is Swiss Alpine Rose, a cold-resistant plant from the [[Swiss Alps]]. The plant is known to provide anti-oxidant protection and protection against UV rays. vbeauté formulas also contain stem cells extracted from [[Nicotiana sylvestris]] plant. Together, along with several other botanical ingredients, these plant extracts combine to form a complex compound which has anti-aging and protective properties. All vbeauté products are formulated in Switzerland, free of fragrance and parabens, and dermatologist and allergy tested. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|title=Career Rejuvination|work=Magazine article|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
vbeauté was launched by investor and former hedge fund manager [[Julie Macklowe]] in 2011. During her travels, Macklowe could not find a suitable skincare product to meet her everyday needs. She then partnered with molecular scientists from the Centre de Recherches Biocosmétiques (CRB High Performance Care) of [[Geneva]] to formulate her products. By 2011, Macklowe had raised over $4,000,000 for lab work and testing.  The skin care line's main ingredient contains stem cells from the Alpine Rose flower.  The Alpine Rose is a small pink flower which is known for its resilient properties and  can only be found in the harsh climate of the Swiss alps, where it endures high altitudes, extreme temperatures, and dryness.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=Vbeaute|url=http://www.vbeaute.com/about|accessdate=8 March 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/after-hedge-funds-a-career-rejuvenation-02022012.html|title=After Hedge Funds, a Career Rejuvenation|author=Alexandra Wolfe|work=Businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, vbeauté was launched at Bergdorf Goodman's, a luxury goods department store based in New York City.  After two years at Bergdorf's, the company appeared on the Home Shopping Network.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Zachary|title=Why Julie Macklowe Is Society’s Breakout Star|url=http://observer.com/2015/04/why-julie-macklowe-is-societys-breakout-star/|website=observer.com|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; vbeauté is the first luxury skincare line that took exactly the same products, ingredients, and packaging offered at higher price points at [[Bergdorf Goodman]], and brought the same quality at more affordable pricing via HSN. At HSN, customers' describe vbeauté as an affordable skincare line, which is something Macklowe believes "no other brand has really done."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Macklowe says that she learned the company was spending a lot of money on advertising and selling expenses, however the company's vision was "that all women should have the best skincare."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Products==
Macklowe launched vbeauté at a charity event coinciding with her 35th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Macklowe celebrates 35th birthday, launch of vbeaute at the Box|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/double_duty_box_XTwvb40PlusUQtlnOqY3LO|newspaper=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ Facial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Swapping Finance for Facial Products|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204791104577110861024934148|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its launch in November 2011, the line was carried at 37 stores, some of which include: [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Fred Segal]], [[Nordstroms]], and [[Bergdorf Goodman]].&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt; The product was featured in ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]]'', which called it "a gorgeous way to keep jet lag at bay."&lt;ref name="O Vbeaute"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Only Way to Go|url=http://www.oprah.com/gift/The-Only-Way-to-Go?editors_pick_id=30174|work=Oprah Mazazine|publisher=O Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, vbeauté expanded to be sold at Look Boutiques in Duane Reade and Walgreens stores in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luxe Skin Care Line Vbeauté, Once Available Only at Bergdorf's, Now Coming to a Drugstore Near You|url=http://fashionista.com/2013/07/luxe-skin-care-line-vbeaute-once-available-only-at-bergdorfs-now-coming-to-a-duane-reade-near-you/vbeaute/|work=Fashionista|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Macklowe's goal for the company is to provide lightweight and affordable skin care products, saying that, “when I think about all of the luxury lines out there, they feel like they were almost made for my mother.

'''''Velificatio''''' is a stylistic device used in [[Roman art|ancient Roman art]] to frame a [[List of Roman deities|deity]] by means of a billowing garment. It represents "vigorous movement," an [[theophany|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; or "the vault of heaven," often appearing with celestial, weather, or sea deities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie dans la vallée du Rhône'' (Brill, 1972), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characteristic of the [[iconography]] of the [[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]], the Breezes [[personification|personified]], and one of the elements which distinguish representations of Luna, the Roman [[Moon goddess|goddess of the Moon]], alluding to her astral course.&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Sorrenti, "Les représentations figurées de Jupiter Dolichénien à Rome," in ''La terra sigillata tardo-italica decorata del Museo nazionale romano'', «L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure so framed is a '''''velificans''''' (plural '''''velificantes'''''). Not all deities are portrayed as ''velificantes'', but the device might be used to mark a member of the [[Roman Emperor|Imperial family]] who had been divinized (a [[Divus|''divus'' or ''diva'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Lise Vogel, ''The Column of Antoninus Pius'' (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Velificatio'' is a frequent device in Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Walter, ''La Porte Noire de Besançon'' (Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 1984), vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; including painting, [[mosaic]], [[relief]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], though it poses technical difficulties for freestanding sculpture. The Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]] was able to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.29; Davide Stimilli, ''The Face of Immortality: Physiognomy and Criticism'' (State University of New York Press, 2005), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe [[Hellenistic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture II: The Styles of ca. 200–100 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2000), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=velificatio+OR+velificantes+OR+velificans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c5ZJTYfmBIKClAez4ZXYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=velificatio%20OR%20velificantes%20OR%20velificans&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The device continued to be used in later [[Western art history|Western art]], in which it is sometimes described as an ''aura'', "a breeze that blows from either without or from within that lifts the veil to reveal the face of an otherwise invisible being."&lt;ref&gt;The term is so used in the art criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]]; Aleida Assmann and Jan Assmann, "Air From Other Planets Blowing: The Logic of Authenticity and the Prophet of the Aura," in ''Mapping Benjamin: The Work of Art in the Digital Age'' (Stanford University Press, 2003), pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and examples==
In [[classical Latin]], the [[abstract noun]] ''velificatio'' is uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;It occurs in [[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'' 1.9.21, and not again in Latin literature until Fronto, 267,4–5; Michel P.J. van den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'' (Brill, 1999), p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the act of setting sail, from ''velum'', "sail" (but also "cloth, garment, veil") and the ''-fic-'' combining element from ''-ficio, -ficere'' (= ''facio, facere'', "do, make"). The verbal form was the basis for modern scholarly usage. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes ''[[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]] velificantes sua veste'', the Breezes "making a sail with their own garment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 36.29.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Porticus Octaviae]] ("[[Portico]] of [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, "Plinius d. Ä. und die römische Religion," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.1 (1978), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions of the Aurae are known from extant Roman art, and have been used as comparative material to identify the pair of ''velificantes'' in a scene from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]]. On the basis of a passage from the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' of [[Horace]], composed and performed for [[Augustus]]'s staging of the [[Saecular Games]] in 17 BC, the central figure is often identified as Tellus (Earth):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fertile in produce and cattle, let Tellus grant Ceres a crown of grain; let the healthful waters and breezes of Jove nourish offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilis frugum pecorisque Tellus / spicea donet Cererem corona; / nutriant fetus et aquae salubres / et Iovis aurae''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all scholars agree on this analysis of the scene. The creatures on which the ''velificantes'' are seated also suggest [[Nereids]], and the reference may point to the [[Cult of the Nymphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Babette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres in the Ara Pacis Augustae and the Carthage Relief," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 98 (1994), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the veil is sometimes explained in terms of the [[initiation rite]]s of the [[mystery religions]]. Initiates wore drapery or a veil which was lifted by a priestess. The veil was a symbol of death, and its removal in the rite signified the initiate's rebirth. The ''velificatio'' thus appears in scenes on [[sarcophagi]] and in other [[funerary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Matelli, "Hieronymous in Athens and Rhodes", in ''Lyco of Troas and Hieronymous of Rhodes'' (Transaction Publishers, 2004), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Margetson''' (December 1861 &amp;ndash; 2 January 1940) was an English painter and illustrator, mainly known for his aesthetic portraits of women.

== Life and work ==
Margetson was born in London. He studied at [[Dulwich College]], and later at the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. In 1885 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy, and later also at the [[Royal Society of British Artists]], the [[Royal Institute of Oil Painters]] and the [[Grosvenor Gallery]].

Margetson painted in oils and watercolours. He made his name with portraits of beautiful women, often with modern hairstyles and hats. He also created religious and allegorical artworks. To begin with he worked in an academic, Victorian style. Later he would use a looser brushstyle inspired by the [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionists]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-raphaelites]], and in particular [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]. His most successful work was the classically decorative ''The Sea Hath its Pearls'' which he exhibited in 1897 at the Royal Academy, now in the possession of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], in Australia.

A portrait of [[Alfred Tennyson]] by Margetson is in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London.

Margetson also worked as an illustrator of books. He was married to the artist Helen Hatton, who he met when they worked on an illustration project together. He lived and worked first in London and later in [[Blewbury]] and Wallingford. He died in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], in 1940, at the age of 78.
