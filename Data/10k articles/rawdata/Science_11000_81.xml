'''Antonio Santucci''' (?&amp;ndash;1613) was an Italian astronomer, cosmographer, and scientific instrument maker.

He was a reader in [[Mathematics]] at the [[University of Pisa]] during 1599&amp;ndash;1612. Santucci was an astronomer and cosmographer to Grand Duke [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand I]] (1549&amp;ndash;1609) and later [[Cosimo II]] (1590&amp;ndash;1621). An attentive observer of [[comet]]s, most notably that of 1582, he published in 1611 the first edition of ''Trattato delle comete'', in which he argued that, contrary to the prevailing scientific opinion, comets were not atmospheric phenomena. The following year, he wrote ''Breve discorso sopra il trattato galileiano sulle galleggianti'' (which survives in manuscript at the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]]). He also authored a treatise in 1593, commissioned by Ferdinand I, on the mathematical and surveying instruments in the Guardaroba Medicea collection.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} His monumental [[armillary sphere]]s are famous. One sphere, made in 1582 for King [[Philip II of Spain]], is now at the [[Escorial]] in [[Madrid]]; the other, the most famous [[Santucci's Armillary Sphere]], built in 1588&amp;ndash;1593 for the [[Sala delle Matematiche]] in the [[Uffizi]], is now at the [[Museo Galileo]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Meucci, Ferdinando.

'''Applied physics''' is intended for a particular technological or [[applied science|practical use]]. It is usually considered as a bridge or connection between [[physics]] and [[engineering]].

"Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors, such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the [[technology]] or [[science]] that may be affected by the work. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the [[physical science]]s, but is concerned with the utilization of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Information on Applied Physics |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |publisher=Stanford Department of Applied Physics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307121331/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |archive-date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It usually differs from engineering in that an applied [[physicist]] may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving an engineering problem. This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. 

In other words, applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences but is concerned with the utilization of these scientific principles in practical devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Applied Physics |url=http://www.sci.waseda.ac.jp/research/BELONG/E/02802.html|publisher=Waseda University|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied [[physicists]] can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, the field of [[accelerator physics]] can contribute to research in theoretical physics by working with engineers enabling design and construction of high-energy [[collider]]s.

'''Armenag K. Bedevian''', [[Effendi]], from [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent, author of ''[[Illustrated Polyglottic Dictionary of Plant Names]]'', in [[Latin]], [[Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] Languages, 1936 (with 1711 [[illustration]]s), was Director of [[Gizeh]] Research Farm, [[Egypt]].

According to [[William Lawrence Balls|W. Lawrence Balls]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Sc.D.]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], in the book's preface, "Mr. Bedevian joined me as agricultural assistant at the old [[Cotton Field Laboratory]] in 1913 and when I returned to Egypt in 1927 I found him fairly established in the Ministry of Agriculture as Manager of the Giza Experimental Farm, and also Superintendent of the [[Cotton Seed Control (Egypt)|Cotton Seed Control]] operations, I found that he was not only in possession of masses of data about the farm, about the ginneries, merchants, and the like, but that he could produce summaries, abstracts, and graphs of that information at short notice in reply to any question I might ask about such things. Thus it was evident that he had a flair for order and system".

[[File:Bahtinov mask principle.svg|thumb|150px|Operation of a Bahtinov mask for refracting optics, showing that rotating it 180&amp;deg; reverses the direction of the pattern]]

The '''Bahtinov mask''' is a device used to focus small astronomical telescopes accurately.
Although masks have long been used as focusing aids, the distinctive pattern was invented by Russian amateur astrophotographer [[Pavel Bahtinov]] ({{lang-ru|Павел Бахтинов}}) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ru/forum/index.php/topic,10421.0.html|title=Optional Focusing Mask|author=Pavel Bahtinov|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HggxlRV5lQEC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=Pavel+bahtinov&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OHuEVcGpNYOi7AbunoKoDQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pavel%20bahtinov&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Precise focusing of [[telescope]]s and [[astrograph]]s is critical to performing [[astrophotography]].

The telescope is pointed at a bright [[star]], and a mask is placed in front of the telescope's [[objective (optics)|objective]] (e.g. primary mirror).

The mask consists of three separate grids, positioned in such a way that the grids produce three angled [[diffraction]] spikes at the [[focal plane]] of the instrument for each bright image element. As the instrument's focus is changed, the central spike appears to move from one side of the star to the other. In reality, all three spikes move, but the central spike moves in the opposite direction to the two spikes forming the "X". Optimal focus is achieved when the middle spike is centered between the other two spikes.

Small deviations from optimal focus are easily visible.  For astrophotography, a digital image can be analyzed by software to locate the alignment of the spikes to sub-pixel resolution.

The direction of this displacement indicates the direction of the necessary focus correction.  Rotating the mask through 180&amp;deg; will reverse the direction of spike movement, so it is easier to use if placed on the telescope with consistent orientation.  The mask must be removed after accurate focus is achieved.

The mask works by replacing the [[aperture stop]] of the optical system (normally the circular shape of the objective itself) with a stop which is asymmetric and periodic.  Viewing a point source (such as a star) yields a diffraction pattern at the focal plane representing the [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] transform of the aperture shape.  This pattern normally would be an [[Airy disk]] resulting from a circular aperture, but with the mask in place, the pattern exhibits asymmetric spikes representing the transform of the mask pattern's spatial frequency and orientation.  A very bright star and very dark sky are required to produce highly contrasted spikes that are clearly visible.  The diffraction effect is similar to producing sunstar patterns in landscape photography with ordinary camera lenses, where the mechanical iris of the lens is adjusted to a small polygonal shape with sharp corners.

In the example below, the central pattern shows good focus. The central spike is noticeably displaced from the central position in the left and right images.

[[File:Anders Zorn - Brödbaket.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Anders Zorn]] - ''Bread baking'' (1889)]]
'''Baking''' is a method of [[cooking]] food that uses prolonged dry heat, normally in an [[oven]], but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is [[bread]] but many other types of foods are baked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/grandma-s-best-baking-recipes/view-all/|title=60 Baking Recipes We Stole From Grandma|work=Taste of Home|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their centre. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods with a firm dry crust and a softer centre".&lt;ref name=Figoni&gt;{{cite book|last=Figoni|first=Paula I.|title=How Baking Works: Exploring the Fundamentals of Baking Science|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-39813-5|edition=3rd|ref=harv}}p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid [[barbecue]] variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other.  Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the [[masonry oven]] is similar to that of a [[smoking (cooking)|smoke pit]].

Because of historical social and familial roles, baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption. When production was industrialized, baking was automated by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, especially breads, are a common and important food, both from an economic and cultural point of view.  A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a [[baker]].

==Foods and techniques==
[[File:Woman Baking Bread on Saj Oven in Artas, West Bank, Palestine.JPG|thumb|left|upright| A [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] woman baking ''[[Shrek (Saj bread)|markook]]'' bread on [[tava]] or Saj oven in [[Artas (village)|Artas]], [[Bethlehem]]]]

All types of food can be baked, but some require special care and protection from direct heat. Various techniques have been developed to provide this protection.

In addition to bread, baking is used to prepare [[cake]]s, [[pastry|pastries]], [[pie]]s, [[tart]]s, [[quiche]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[scone]]s, [[Cracker (food)|crackers]], [[pretzel]]s, and more. These popular items are known collectively as "baked goods," and are often sold at a [[bakery]], which is a store that carries only baked goods, or at markets, grocery stores, farmers markets or through other venues.

Meat, including [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meats, such as [[ham]] can also be baked, but baking is usually reserved for [[meatloaf]], smaller cuts of whole meats, or whole meats that contain [[stuffing]] or coating such as [[bread crumbs]] or [[buttermilk]] [[batter (cooking)|batter]]. Some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid (such as [[water]] or [[broth]]) in the bottom of a closed pan, and letting it steam up around the food, a method commonly known as [[braising]] or slow baking. Larger cuts prepared without stuffing or coating are more often [[roasting|roasted]], which is a similar process, using higher temperatures and shorter cooking times. Roasting, however, is only suitable for finer cuts of meat, so other methods have been developed to make tougher meat cuts palatable after baking. One of these is the method known as ''[[en croûte]]'' (French for "in a pastry crust"), which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside. Meat, [[poultry]], [[Game (food)|game]], fish or [[vegetable]]s can be prepared by baking ''en croûte''. Well-known examples include [[Beef Wellington]], where the beef is encased in [[pastry]] before baking; [[pâté|pâté en croûte]], where the [[Terrine (food)|terrine]] is encased in pastry before baking; and the Vietnamese variant, a meat-filled pastry called [[pâté chaud]]. The ''en croûte'' method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire – a favorite method of cooking [[venison]]. In this case, the protective casing (or crust) is made from a paste of flour and water which is thrown out before eating. Salt can also be used to make a protective crust that is not eaten. Another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking, is to cook it ''[[en papillote]]'' (French for "in parchment"). In this method, the food is covered by [[Parchment paper (baking)|baking paper]] (or [[aluminium foil]]) to protect it while it is being baked. The cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened, allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise.

[[File:Baking mold Mari Louvre AO18902.jpg|thumb|A [[terracotta]] [[baking mould]] for [[pastry]] or [[bread]], representing goats and a lion attacking a cow. Early 2nd millennium BC, Royal palace at [[Mari, Syria]]]]

[[Egg (food)|Eggs]] can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes. In combination with [[dairy products]] especially [[cheese]], they are often prepared as a [[dessert]]. For example, although a baked [[custard]] can be made using starch (in the form of [[flour]], [[Corn starch|cornflour]], [[arrowroot]], or [[potato flour]]), the flavor of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent. Baked custards, such as [[crème caramel]], are among the items that need protection from an oven's direct heat, and the ''[[bain-marie]]'' method serves this purpose. The cooking container is half submerged in water in another, larger one, so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process. Baking a successful [[soufflé]] requires that the baking process be carefully controlled.  The oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish. These factors, along with the theatrical effect of an air-filled dessert, have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement. Similarly, a good baking technique (and a good oven) are also needed to create a [[baked Alaska]] because of the difficulty of baking hot [[meringue]] and cold [[ice cream]] at the same time.

Baking can also be used to prepare various other foods such as [[pizzas]], [[baked potato]]es, baked apples, [[baked beans]], some [[casserole]]s and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[lasagne]].

==Baking in ancient times==
[[File:FuneraryModel-BakeryAndBrewery MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|upright|left|An Egyptian funerary Model of a bakery and brewery (11th dynasty, circa 2009–1998 B.C.)]]

The first evidence of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains, soaked them in water, and mixed everything together, mashing it into a kind of broth-like paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pfister |first=Fred |title=Pfister Consulting: History of Baking – How Did It All Start?

Later, when humans mastered fire, the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, as it could now be made any time fire was created. The world's oldest oven  was discovered in Croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago.

Baking flourished during the [[Roman Empire]]. Beginning around 300 B.C., the pastry cook became an occupation for Romans (known as the pastillarium) and became a respected profession because pastries were considered decadent, and Romans loved festivity and celebration. Thus, pastries were often cooked especially for large banquets, and any pastry cook who could invent new types of tasty treats was highly prized. Around 1 AD, there were more than three hundred pastry chefs in Rome, and Cato wrote about how they created all sorts of diverse foods and flourished professionally and socially because of their creations. Cato speaks of an enormous number of breads including; libum (sacrificial cakes made with flour), placenta (groats and cress), spira (modern day flour pretzels), scibilata ([[torte]]s), savaillum (sweet cake), and globus apherica ([[fritter]]s). A great selection of these, with many different variations, different ingredients, and varied patterns, were often found at [[banquet]]s and dining halls. The Romans baked bread in an oven with its own chimney, and had mills to grind grain into flour. A bakers' [[guild]] was established in 168 B.C. in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Morgan2012/&gt;

Eventually, the Roman art of baking became known throughout Europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of Asia. 
By the 13th century in [[London]], commercial trading, including baking, had many regulations attached. In the case of food, they were designed to create a system "so there was little possibility of false measures, adulterated food or shoddy manufactures." There were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone, including that every baker had to have "the impression of his seal" upon each loaf of bread.&lt;ref name=Ackroyd&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Peter Ackroyd]]|title=London: the biography|date=2003|publisher=Anchor books|location=New York|isbn=0385497717|pages=59|edition=1st Anchor Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 19th century, alternative leavening agents became more common, such as [[baking soda]].&lt;ref name=Morgan2012/&gt; Bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets. This scene was so common that [[Rembrandt]], among others, painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of Germany, with children clamoring for a sample. In London, pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts. This developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result.  In Paris, the first open-air café of baked goods was developed, and baking became an established art throughout the entire world.

Baking eventually developed into a commercial industry using automated machinery which enabled more goods to be produced for widespread distribution. In the United States, the baking industry "was built on marketing methods used during feudal times and production techniques developed by the Romans."&lt;ref name=Whitten&gt;{{cite book|title= Handbook of American Business History: Manufacturing|year=1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Connecticut|isbn=0-313-25198-3|author=Bessie Emrick Whitten|editor=David O. Whitten}}p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Some makers of [[snacks]] such as [[potato chips#Similar foods|potato chips]] or crisps have produced baked versions of their snack products as an alternative to the usual cooking method of [[deep-frying]] in an attempt to reduce their calorie or fat content. Baking has opened up doors to businesses such as cake shops and factories where the baking process is done with larger amounts in large, open furnaces.

The aroma and texture of baked goods as they come out of the oven are strongly appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost. Since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness, commercial producers have to compensate by using [[food additive]]s as well as imaginative labeling. As more and more baked goods are purchased from commercial suppliers, producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label "home-baked." Such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of "home" to the bought product. Freshness is such an important quality that restaurants, although they are commercial (and not domestic) preparers of food, bake their own products. For example, scones at [[The Ritz London Hotel]] "are not baked until early afternoon on the day they are to be served, to make sure they are as fresh as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Helen|title=The London Ritz Book of Afternoon Tea - The Art &amp; Pleasures of Taking Tea|year=1986|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson, Publishers|location=London, UK|isbn=0-207-15415-5|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

Baking needs an enclosed space for heating – typically in an [[oven]]. The fuel can be supplied by wood, coal, gas, or electricity. Adding and removing items from an oven may be done by hand with an oven mitt or by a [[Peel (tool)|peel]], a long handled tool specifically used for that purpose.

Many commercial ovens are equipped with two heating elements: one for baking, using [[convection oven|convection]] and [[thermal conduction]] to heat the food, and one for broiling or grilling, heating mainly by radiation. Another piece of equipment still used for baking is the [[Dutch oven]]. "Also called a bake kettle, bastable, bread oven, fire pan, bake oven kail pot, tin kitchen, roasting kitchen, ''doufeu'' (French: "gentle fire") or ''feu de compagne'' (French: "country oven") [it] originally replaced the cooking jack as the latest fireside cooking technology," combining "the convenience of pot-oven and hangover oven."&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;{{cite book|last=Snodgrass|first=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of Kitchen History,|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Books|isbn=0-203-31917-6|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian cultures have adopted steam baskets to produce the effect of baking while reducing the amount of fat needed.&lt;ref name=Chinese&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese steamed sponge cake (ji dan gao)|url=http://chinesegrandma.com/2013/02/chinese-steamed-sponge-cake/|website=Chinese Grandma|accessdate=14 October 2015|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Rhof-brotBacken.ogv|thumb|Baking bread at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]
[[File:Baked goods.jpg|thumb|upright|Baked goods]]

Eleven events occur concurrently during baking, some of which (such as [[starch]] gelatinization) would not occur at room temperature.{{sfn|Figoni|2011|p=38}}

# [[Fat]]s melt; 
# [[Gas]]es form and [[Thermal expansion#Expansion in gases|expand]] 
# [[Microorganism]]s die 
# [[Sugar]] [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolves]] 
# [[Egg]], [[milk]], and [[gluten]] [[protein]]s coagulate 
# [[Starch gelatinization|Starches gelatinize]] or solidify
# Liquids [[Evaporation|evaporate]] 
# [[Caramelization]] and [[Maillard reaction|Maillard browning]] occur on crust
# [[Enzyme]]s are denatured
# Changes occur to [[nutrient]]s
# [[Pectin]] breaks down.{{sfn|Figoni|2011|loc=ch.3 pp.38 ''ff''}}

The dry heat of baking changes the form of starches in the food and causes its outer surfaces to brown, giving it an attractive appearance and taste. The browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the Maillard reaction. Maillard browning occurs when "sugars break down in the presence of proteins. Because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins, Maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods, including nuts, roast beef and baked bread."{{sfn|Figoni|2011|p=42}}  The moisture is never entirely "sealed in"; over time, an item being baked will become dry. This is often an advantage, especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome, like drying [[herb]]s or roasting certain types of vegetables.

The baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven. When baking, consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item. Higher levels of fat such as [[margarine]], [[butter]], lard, or vegetable [[shortening]] will cause an item to spread out during the baking process.

With the passage of time, breads harden and become [[staling|stale]]. This is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products, but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time. This process is similar to [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures, such as in a domestic refrigerator or freezer.

==Cultural and religious significance==

Baking, especially of bread, holds special significance for many cultures. It is such a fundamental part of everyday food consumption that the children's [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man]]'' takes baking as its subject. Baked goods are normally served at all kinds of [[party|parties]] and special attention is given to their quality at formal events. They are also one of the main components of a [[tea party]], including at nursery teas and high teas, a tradition which started in Victorian Britain, reportedly when [[Anna Russell, Duchess of Bedford]] "grew tired of the sinking feeling which afflicted her every afternoon round 4 o'clock&amp;nbsp;... In 1840, she plucked up courage and asked for a tray of tea, bread and butter, and cake to be brought to her room. Once she had formed the habit she found she could not break it, so spread it among her friends instead. As the century progressed, afternoon tea became increasingly elaborate."&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Helen|title=The London Ritz Book of Afternoon Tea: The Art &amp; Pleasures of Making Tea|year=1986|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers|location=London|isbn=0-207-15415-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedictine Sisters of the Benedectine Monastery of [[Caltanissetta]] producing the crocette, they used to be prepared for the Holy Crucifix festivity. This was situated next to the Church of the Holy Cross, from which the sweets take the name.

For Jews, [[Matzo]] is a baked product of considerable religious and ritual significance. Baked matzah bread can be ground up and used in other dishes, such as [[Gefilte fish]], and baked again. For Christians, bread has to be baked to be used as an essential component of the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]]. In the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] tradition, baked bread in the form of birds is given to children to carry to the fields in a spring ceremony that celebrates the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]].

The dark blue line is a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|timeline]]: a line of [[:en:fluid parcel|fluid parcels]] followed in time and deformed by the passage of the sphere. The timeline passes through the symmetry axis of the flow. The orange dots are drifters connected by a [[:en:Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|pathline]], i.e. the path that individual fluid parcels follow when the sphere passes by.&lt;br&gt;Note that fluid parcels may also move upward during the passage of the body.&lt;br&gt;A larger version of this animation can be found [[:File:Darwin_drift_large.gif|here]] (15&amp;nbsp;MB), showing e.g. [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]].]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], '''Darwin drift''' refers to the phenomenon that a [[fluid parcel]] is permanently displaced after the passage of a body through a fluid – the fluid being at rest far away from the body.

Consider a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of fluid parcels perpendicular to the direction of the body's constant [[velocity vector]], far before the passage of the body. During the passage of the body the fluid parcels move, according to their [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian motion]]. Far after the passage of the body, the fluid parcels are permanently displaced. The volume between the initial plane of the fluid parcels and the surface consisting of the parcel positions long after the body's passage is called the '''Darwin drift volume'''.

The phenomenon is named after Sir [[Charles Galton Darwin]], who proved in 1953 that the drift volume multiplied with the fluid [[density]] equals the [[added mass]] of the body,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Darwin|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; – known as '''Darwin's theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|last=Yih|year=1985|year2=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Camassa|McLaughlin|Moore|Vaidya|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown by Eames and McIntyre in 1999, Darwin drift (by the passage of a body through a fluid otherwise at rest) and [[Stokes drift]] (in the fluid motion associated with [[surface wave]]s) are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eames|McIntyre|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25882">'''Decision Theory''' (or the '''theory of choice''') is the study of the reasoning underlying an [[agent (economics)|agent's]] choices.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Katie and Stefánsson, H. Orri, "Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the [[optimal decision|best decisions]], given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]; and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions.

Closely related to the field of [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision theory is concerned with the choices of individual agents whereas game theory is concerned with interactions of agents whose decisions affect each other. Decision theory is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists,
statisticians, psychologists, biologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Cheong|first2=Raymond|last3=Lipniacki|first3=Tomasz|last4=Levchenko|first4=Andre|last5=Emamian|first5=Effat S.|last6=Abdi|first6=Ali|date=2017-04-05|title=Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e1005436|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and other social scientists, philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, Sven Ove. "Decision theory: A brief introduction." (2005) Section 1.2: A truly interdisciplinary subject.&lt;/ref&gt; and computer scientists.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods, especially via the so-called choice models, such as [[probit]] and [[logit]] models. Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric [[maximum likelihood]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative and Descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identifying the best decisions by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to compute with perfect accuracy and is fully [[Rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to''make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]], and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies and software ([[Decision support system|decision support systems]]) to help people make better decisions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;MacCrimmon, Kenneth R. "Descriptive and normative implications of the decision-theory postulates." ''Risk and uncertainty''. Palgrave Macmillan, London, 1968. 3-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Slovic, Paul, Baruch Fischhoff, and Sarah Lichtenstein. "Behavioral decision theory." ''Annual review of psychology''28.1 (1977): 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[Axiom|axiomatic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;framework, reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[Time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]][[Utility function|utility functions]](e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The prescriptions or predictions about behaviour that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. There is a thriving dialogue with [[experimental economics]], which uses laboratory and field experiments to evaluate and inform theory. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in what is sometimes called "behavioral decision theory" and this has contributed to a re-evaluation of what rational decision-making requires.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see: Anand, Paul (1993). Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keren, Gideon B., and Willem A. Wagenaar. “On the Psychology of Playing Blackjack: Normative and Descriptive Considerations with Implications for Decision Theory.” ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'', vol. 114, no. 2, June 1985, pp. 133–158. ''EBSCOhost'', doi:10.1037/0096-3445.114.2.133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Decisions==

===Choice under uncertainty=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] --&gt;
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value (see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=P. J. H.|title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|pages=529–563}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses
 |last=Wald |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Wald
 |journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]
 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=299–326 |year=1939
 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177732144
 |mr=932
}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=E. L.|authorlink=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory of [[expected utility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Third ed.)|last=Neumann|first=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |origyear=1944|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization. The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different points in time.  If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. &amp; Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. &amp; Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions may be limited in resources or are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] (have finite time or intelligence); in such cases the issue, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, is the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].  In 2011, Dwayne Rosenburgh explored and showed how decision theory can be applied to complex decisions that arise in areas such as [[wireless communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburgh, D. 2011. "Decision Theory with its Applications in Wireless Communication" in Zhang, Y. (Ed.), GUIZANI, M. (Ed.). (2011). Game Theory for Wireless Communications and Networking. Boca Raton: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristic}}

[[Heuristic|Heuristics]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in decision-making is the ability of making decisions based on unjustified or routine thinking. While quicker than step-by-step processing, heuristic thinking is also more likely to experience fallacies or inaccuracies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Johnson, Eric J, and Payne, John W. “Effort and Accuracy in Choice.” ''Management science'' 31.4 (1985): 395–414. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;The main use for heuristics in our daily routines is to decrease the amount of evaluative thinking we perform when making simple decisions, and instead make them based on unconscious rules and focusing on some aspects of the decision, while ignoring others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bobadilla-Suarez, Sebastian et al. “Fast or Frugal, but Not Both: Decision Heuristics Under Time Pressure.” ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition'' 44.1 (2018): 24–33. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;One example of common and erroneous thought process that arrises through heuristic thinking is the [[Gambler's fallacy|Gambler's Fallacy]]. Believing that a isolated random event is affected by previous isolated random events, for example if a coin is flipped to tails for a couple of turns it still carries the same probability of doing so, however intuitively it sounds more likely for it to roll heads soon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Roe, Robert M, Busemeyer, Jermone R, and Townsend, James T. “Multialternative Decision Field Theory: A Dynamic Connectionst Model of Decision Making.” ''The psychological review.'' 108.2 (2001): 370–392. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;This happens because, due to routine thinking, one disregards the probability and concentrate on the ratio of the outcome, meaning, in the long run the ratio of flips should be half for each outcome.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Xu, Juemin, and Harvey, Nigel. “Carry on Winning: The Gamblers’ Fallacy Creates Hot Hand Effects in Online Gambling.” ''Cognition'' 131.2 (2014): 173–180. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the "Compromise Effect" operates under a mindset that the most moderate option carries the most benefit. In an incomplete information scenario, like in most daily decisions, the moderate option will look more appealing than either extreme independent of the context, based only on the fact that it gathers characteristics that can be found in either extremes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Chuang, Shih-Chieh et al. “The Effect of Incomplete Information on the Compromise Effect.” ''Judgment and Decision Making'' 7.2 (2012): 196. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue (as in [[black swan theory]]) have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

'''Die Stadtkrone''' or '''City Crown''' is a concept of [[Urban planning]] put forward by [[Expressionist architecture|German expressionist]] architects, and particularly championed by [[Bruno Taut]] in the early part of the 20th century. It was often conceived as an inspirational, crystalline form or something with a homogenous formal vocabulary in the centre of a town, with huge impressive scale, analogous to, but not necessarily [[Skyscrapers]]. The physical form were notions of social restructuring with subordination of individuals to the collective good and sometimes ideas of a return to an [[agrarianism|agrarian]] existence.

'''Édouard Joseph Louis Marie Van Beneden''' (5 March 1846 in Leuven – 28 April 1910 in Liège), son of [[Pierre-Joseph Van Beneden]], was a Belgian [[Embryology|embryologist]], [[Cell biology|cytologist]] and [[Marine biology|marine biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Biography  Page 141 Houghton Mifflin Company - 2003 "Beneden, Edouard Joseph Louis-Marie van 1846-1910 * Belgian cytologist and embryologist Born in Liege,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, 1920. Professor Van Beneden of Liége. Science, New Series, Vol. 52, No. 1333 (Jul. 16, 1920), pp. 55-56 [Free PDF https://www.jstor.org/stable/1645676]&lt;/ref&gt; He was professor of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Liège]]. He contributed to [[cytogenetics]] by his works on the [[roundworm]] ''[[Ascaris]]''. In this work he discovered how [[chromosome]]s organized [[meiosis]] (the production of [[gametes]]).

Van Beneden elucidated, together with [[Walther Flemming]] and [[Eduard Strasburger]], the essential facts of [[mitosis]], where, in contrast to meiosis, there is a qualitative and quantitative equality of chromosome distribution to daughter cells. (See [[karyotype]]).{{cn|date=January 2016}}

'''Edvard Rusjan''' (6 June 1886 – 9 January 1911)&lt;ref name="Rusjan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sitar" /&gt; was a [[Slovenes|Slovenian]]  flight pioneer and airplane constructor. He died in an airplane crash in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="Rusjan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://nl.ijs.si/fedora/get/sbl:2704/VIEW/ |title=Rusjan Edvard |encyclopedia=Slovenski biografski leksikon |editors=Vide Ogrin, Petra (electronic ed.).

== Biography ==
Rusjan was born in [[Trieste]],&lt;ref name="Rusjan" /&gt; then the major port of [[Austria-Hungary]] (now in [[Italy]]). His parents were both natives of the [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] region: his father, Franc Rusjan, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]], and his mother, Grazia Cabas, was [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Friulan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brata Edvard in Josip Rusjan iz Gorice: začetkí motornega letenja med Slovenci |first=Srečko |last=Gombač |year=2004 |publisher=Puhek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rusjan spent his childhood and adolescence in [[Gorizia]], in the suburb of [[Pristava, Nova Gorica|Rafut]].

In his youth, he became a professional bicyclist, and designed his own bicycle models, together with his brother Josip Rusjan. He was also member of the [[Sokol]] gymnastic association.

He made his first flight on 25 November 1909, near Gorizia, in [[Eda I]], a biplane of his own design. Eda was Edvard's nickname, given from his mother.&lt;ref name="Rusjan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RS-Rusjan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/science_and_technology/edvard_rusjan_pioneer_of_slovene_aviation/|last=|first=|title=Edvard Rusjan, Pioneer of Slovene Aviation|date=|publisher=Republic of Slovenia – Government Communication Office|accessdate=11 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423044448/http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/science_and_technology/edvard_rusjan_pioneer_of_slovene_aviation/|archivedate=23 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight was covered {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} and reached a height of {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. On 29 November 1909, he flew {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}} at an altitude of {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}}. The original design was followed by several improved versions. He moved to a hangar near [[Miren]] south of Gorizia.

Rusjan first attended a public flight event with the model EDA V on 6 December 1909, when his aircraft broke apart at landing.&lt;ref name="Rusjan" /&gt; In June 1910, he tried the model EDA V, which enabled him to fly 40 meters above the ground and overfly the whole [[Miren]] Field.
[[File:Rusjanovo letalo Eda.JPG|thumb|Replica of Rusjan airplane [[Eda V]]]]
The brothers Rusjan ran out of finance for the construction of EDA VII. In 1910 Edvard Rusjan met the businessman of Serbian origin [[Mihailo Merćep|Mihajlo Merćep]], who offered him financial help for his endeavors. The same year, the brothers moved to [[Zagreb]], Croatia, when they started a project of airplane construction on larger scale. In November 1910, they constructed a new model.&lt;ref name="Rusjan" /&gt;

In January 1911, Edvard and Josip Rusjan went on a promotional tour through the [[Balkan]] cities.  During a flight in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] on 9 January 1911 a strong wind broke a wing of Edvard's aeroplane and it dived into a railway embankment near the [[Belgrade Fortress]] in a fatal crash.&lt;ref name="Sitar"&gt;{{cite book |title=Edvard Rusjan |first=Sandi |last=Sitar |year=1989 |page=72 |publisher=Partizanska knjiga |id={{COBISS|ID=7780352}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS-Rusjan"/&gt; His funeral was attended by a large crowd of about 14,000 people.

He is interred at [[Belgrade's New Cemetery]], lot 15, grave 343.

== Legacy ==
The [[Maribor Edvard Rusjan Airport]] and asteroid [[19633 Rusjan]] are named after him. The commercial and business center ''Eda Center'' in [[Nova Gorica]] is dedicated to Rusjan's memory.

One of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] in the [[Jugoslovenski Aerotransport|JAT]] fleet was named after Edvard Rusjan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxiways.de/DC-10/46988_278.html|title=MC DONNELL - DOUGLAS  DC - 10|website=www.taxiways.de|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She qualified on 5 February 1869 by taking the ‘modified exam’ and was placed on the first compulsory Register of Chemists and Druggists and Pharmaceutical Chemists in 1870. It was not realised until she appeared to sit the exam that she was a woman. From 1875 until the early 1900s, using her married name of Deacon, she owned a pharmacy in Fleckney, near [[Market Harborough]].  She was not, however, able to become a member of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] as women were not admitted until 1879.

She was not the first woman to be registered, as there were 223 women (of the 11638 registered chemists and druggists) who were already operating pharmacies, typically because they had inherited the business from a father or husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=Marlene|last2=Rayner-Canham|first2=Geoffrey|title=Chemistry Was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880-1949|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1860949878|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53428">In [[genetics]], a '''genome-wide association study''' ('''GWA study''', or '''GWAS'''), also known as '''whole genome association study''' ('''WGA study''', or '''WGAS'''), is an [[observational study]] of a genome-wide set of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying [[phenotype]]s for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]]. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] are read using [[SNP array]]s. If one type of the variant (one [[allele]]) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be ''associated'' with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.

GWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a ''non-candidate-driven'' approach, in contrast to ''[[candidate gene|gene-specific candidate-driven studies]]''. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.&lt;ref name="pmid20647212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manolio TA | title = Genomewide association studies and assessment of the risk of disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–76 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20647212 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0905980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18349094"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson TA, Manolio TA | title = How to interpret a genome-wide association study | journal = JAMA | volume = 299 | issue = 11 | pages = 1335–44 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18349094 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.11.1335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genome.gov/20019523 |title=Genome-Wide Association Studies |publisher = [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:GWAS Disease allele effects.png|thumb|340px|GWA studies typically identify common variants with small effect sizes (''lower right'').&lt;ref name="pmid23300413" /&gt;]]
Any two [[human genome]]s differ in millions of different ways.  There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]) as well as many larger variations, such as [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[copy number variation]]s. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual's traits, or [[phenotype]], which can be anything from disease risk to physical properties such as height.&lt;ref name="Strachan"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Strachan T, Read  A | title = Human Molecular Genetics | edition = 4th | publisher = Garland Science | pages = 467–495 | isbn = 978-0-8153-4149-9| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of [[genetic linkage]] in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single gene disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omim.org |title=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205231931/http://www.omim.org/ |archivedate=5 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}} However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Strachan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11565063"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altmüller J, Palmer LJ, Fischer G, Scherb H, Wjst M | title = Genomewide scans of complex human diseases: true linkage is hard to find | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 936–50 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11565063 | pmc = 1274370 | doi = 10.1086/324069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the [[genetic association]] study. This study type asks if the [[allele]] of a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variant]] is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied). Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid8801636"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Risch N, Merikangas K | title = The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5281 | pages = 1516–7 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8801636 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5281.1516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of [[biobanks]], which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study.&lt;ref name="pmid17550341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greely HT | title = The uneasy ethical and legal underpinnings of large-scale genomic biobanks | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 8 | pages = 343–64 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17550341 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the [[International HapMap Project]], which, from 2003 identified a majority of the common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study.&lt;ref name="pmid14685227"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((The International HapMap Project)), Gibbs RA, Belmont JW,  Hardenbol P, Willis TD, Yu F, Yang H, Ch'Ang LY, Huang W | title = The International HapMap Project | journal = Nature | volume = 426 | issue = 6968 | pages = 789–96 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14685227 | doi = 10.1038/nature02168 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62838/1/nature02168.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haplotype|haploblock structure]] identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using [[SNP array|genotyping arrays]] was an important prerequisite.&lt;ref name="pmid7569999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schena M, Shalon D, Davis RW, Brown PO | title = Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5235 | pages = 467–70 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7569999 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5235.467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Method example for GWA study designs.png|thumb|300px|Example calculation illustrating the methodology of a case-control GWA study. The [[allele]] count of each measured SNP is evaluated—in this case with a [[chi-squared test]]—to identify variants [[Genetic association|associated]] with the trait in question. The numbers in this example are taken from a 2007 study of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) that showed that the individuals with the G-allele of SNP1 (''rs1333049'') were overrepresented amongst CAD-patients.&lt;ref name="WTCCC" /&gt;]]

The most common approach of GWA studies is the [[Case-control study|case-control]] setup, which compares two large groups of individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped for the majority of common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more.&lt;ref name="pmid23300413"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bush WS, Moore JH | title = Chapter 11: Genome-wide association studies | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = e1002822 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23300413 | pmc = 3531285 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002822 | editor2-last = Kann | editor1-last = Lewitter | editor2-first = Maricel | editor1-first = Fran }}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the [[allele frequency]] is significantly altered between the case and the control group.&lt;ref name="pmid21293453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke GM, Anderson CA, Pettersson FH, Cardon LR, Morris AP, Zondervan KT | title = Basic statistical analysis in genetic case-control studies | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–33 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21293453 | pmc = 3154648 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the [[odds ratio]]. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a [[P-value]] for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple [[chi-squared test]]. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21293453" /&gt;

There are several variations to this case-control approach.  A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is the analysis of quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] concentrations or even [[Expression quantitative trait loci|gene expression]]. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]] or [[recessive]] penetrance patterns can be used.&lt;ref name="pmid21293453" /&gt; Calculations are typically done using [[bioinformatics]] software such as SNPTEST and PLINK, which also include support for many of these alternative statistics.&lt;ref name="WTCCC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17701901"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Purcell S, Neale B, Todd-Brown K, Thomas L, Ferreira MA, Bender D, Maller J, Sklar P, de Bakker PI, Daly MJ, Sham PC | title = PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 559–75 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17701901 | pmc = 1950838 | doi = 10.1086/519795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier GWAS focused on the effect of individual SNPs. However, the empirical evidence shows that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, [[epistasis]], might contribute to complex diseases. Moreover, the researchers try to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as [[Protein–protein interaction|protein protein interaction network]]  to extract more informative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayati M, Erten S, Chance MR, Koyutürk M | title = MOBAS: identification of disease-associated protein subnetworks using modularity-based scoring | language = en | journal = EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology | volume = 2015 | issue = 1 | pages = 7 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 28194175 | pmc = 5270451 | doi = 10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessing the Collective Disease Association of Multiple Genomic Loci|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 6th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics|date = 2015-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-3853-0|pages = 376–385|series = BCB '15|doi = 10.1145/2808719.2808758|first = Marzieh|last = Ayati|first2 = Mehmet|last2 = Koyutürk | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key step in the majority of GWA studies is the [[Imputation (genetics)|imputation]] of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchini J, Howie B | title = Genotype imputation for genome-wide association studies | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 499–511 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20517342 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howie B, Marchini J, Stephens M | title = Genotype imputation with thousands of genomes | journal = G3 | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–70 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22384356 | pmc = 3276165 | doi = 10.1534/g3.111.001198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MaCH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Y, Willer CJ, Ding J, Scheet P, Abecasis GR | title = MaCH: using sequence and genotype data to estimate haplotypes and unobserved genotypes | journal = Genetic Epidemiology | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 816–34 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21058334 | pmc = 3175618 | doi = 10.1002/gepi.20533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the calculation of association, it is common to take into account any variables that could potentially [[confounding|confound]] the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose.&lt;ref name="pmid18758442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novembre J, Johnson T, Bryc K, Kutalik Z, Boyko AR, Auton A, Indap A, King KS, Bergmann S, Nelson MR, Stephens M, Bustamante CD | title = Genes mirror geography within Europe | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 98–101 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18758442 | pmc = 2735096 | doi = 10.1038/nature07331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographic and ethnic background of participants by controlling for what is called [[population stratification]]. If they fail to do so, these studies can produce false positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |date=2016-12-01 |title=Genes, behavior, and behavior genetics |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1–2 |pages=e1405 |doi=10.1002/wcs.1405 |pmid=27906529 |issn=1939-5078|hdl=10161/13337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After odds ratios and [[P-value]]s have been calculated for all SNPs, a common approach is to create a [[Manhattan plot]]. In the context of GWA studies, this plot shows the negative logarithm of the [[P-value]] as a function of genomic location. Thus the SNPs with the most significant association stand out on the plot, usually as stacks of points because of haploblock structure. Importantly, the P-value threshold for significance is corrected for [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] issues. The exact threshold varies by study,&lt;ref name="pmid24473445"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wittkowski KM, Sonakya V, Bigio B, Tonn MK, Shic F, Ascano M, Nasca C, Gold-Von Simson G | title = A novel computational biostatistics approach implies impaired dephosphorylation of growth factor receptors as associated with severity of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e354 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473445 | pmc = 3905234 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the conventional threshold is {{val|5|e=-8}} to be significant in the face of hundreds of thousands to millions of tested SNPs.&lt;ref name="pmid23300413" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21293453"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barsh GS, Copenhaver GP, Gibson G, Williams SM | title = Guidelines for genome-wide association studies | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e1002812 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22792080 | pmc = 3390399 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002812 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 21 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; GWA studies typically perform the first analysis in a discovery cohort, followed by validation of the most significant SNPs in an independent validation cohort.

This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (''GWAX'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu JZ, Erlich Y, Pickrell JK | title = Case-control association mapping by proxy using family history of disease | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–331 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28092683 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central point of debate on GWA studies has been that most of the SNP variations found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0.&lt;ref name="pmid20647212" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20300123"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku CS, Loy EY, Pawitan Y, Chia KS | title = The pursuit of genome-wide association studies: where are we now? | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–206 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20300123 | doi = 10.1038/jhg.2010.19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This [[heritability|heritable]] variation is known from heritability studies based on [[monozygotic]] twins.&lt;ref name="pmid18987709"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maher B | title = Personal genomes: The case of the missing heritability | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 18–21 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987709 | doi = 10.1038/456018a }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.&lt;ref name="pmid18987709"/&gt;

==Clinical applications==
A challenge for future successful GWA study is to apply the findings in a way that accelerates [[drug development|drug]] and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] and [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]].&lt;ref name="pmid19759611"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iadonato SP, Katze MG | title = Genomics: Hepatitis C virus gets personal | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7262 | pages = 357–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19759611 | doi = 10.1038/461357a }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of [[prognosis]]. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves,&lt;ref name="pmid20837927"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muehlschlegel JD, Liu KY, Perry TE, Fox AA, Collard CD, Shernan SK, Body SC | title = Chromosome 9p21 variant predicts mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 11 Suppl | pages = S60–5 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20837927 | pmc = 2943860 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others report only minor benefits from this use.&lt;ref name="pmid20159871"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paynter NP, Chasman DI, Paré G, Buring JE, Cook NR, Miletich JP, Ridker PM | title = Association between a literature-based genetic risk score and cardiovascular events in women | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 7 | pages = 631–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20159871 | pmc = 2845522 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate [[pathophysiology]].&lt;ref name="pmid20522751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Couzin-Frankel J | title = Major heart disease genes prove elusive | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5983 | pages = 1220–1 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20522751 | doi = 10.1126/science.328.5983.1220 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such success is related to identifying the genetic variant associated with response to anti-[[hepatitis C]] virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] combined with [[ribavirin]], a GWA study&lt;ref name="pmid19684573"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ge D, Fellay J, Thompson AJ, Simon JS, Shianna KV, Urban TJ, Heinzen EL, Qiu P, Bertelsen AH, Muir AJ, Sulkowski M, McHutchison JG, Goldstein DB | title = Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7262 | pages = 399–401 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19684573 | doi = 10.1038/nature08309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that SNPs near the human [[Interleukin 28B|IL28B]] gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.&lt;ref name="pmid19759533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas DL, Thio CL, Martin MP, Qi Y, Ge D, O'Huigin C, Kidd J, Kidd K, Khakoo SI, Alexander G, Goedert JJ, Kirk GD, Donfield SM, Rosen HR, Tobler LH, Busch MP, McHutchison JG, Goldstein DB, Carrington M | title = Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7265 | pages = 798–801 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19759533 | pmc = 3172006 | doi = 10.1038/nature08463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu YF, Goldstein DB, Angrist M, Cavalleri G | title = Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = a008581 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25059740 | pmc = 4143101 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a008581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of elucidating pathophysiology has also led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the [[gene expression]] of nearby genes, the so-called [[expression quantitative trait loci]] (eQTL) studies.&lt;ref name="pmid20562444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folkersen L, van't Hooft F, Chernogubova E, Agardh HE, Hansson GK, Hedin U, Liska J, Syvänen AC, Paulsson-Berne G, Paulssson-Berne G, Franco-Cereceda A, Hamsten A, Gabrielsen A, Eriksson P | title = Association of genetic risk variants with expression of proximal genes identifies novel susceptibility genes for cardiovascular disease | journal = Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–73 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20562444 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.948935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable [[Biological target#Drug targets|drug targets]]. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis.&lt;ref name="Bown_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21378988"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A genome-wide association study in Europeans and South Asians identifies five new loci for coronary artery disease | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–44 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21378988 | doi = 10.1038/ng.782 | pmc = 3190399 | author1 = Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics Consortium }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson_2011" /&gt; One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus.&lt;ref name="Kathiresan_2009"/&gt; Functional follow up studies of this locus using [[small interfering RNA]] and [[Knockout mouse|gene knock-out mice]] have shed light on the metabolism of [[low-density lipoprotein]]s, which have important clinical implications for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Kathiresan_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21462369"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubé JB, Johansen CT, Hegele RA | title = Sortilin: an unusual suspect in cholesterol metabolism: from GWAS identification to in vivo biochemical analyses, sortilin has been identified as a novel mediator of human lipoprotein metabolism | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–7 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21462369 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100003 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21311327"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauer RC, Stylianou IM, Rader DJ | title = Functional validation of new pathways in lipoprotein metabolism identified by human genetics | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–8 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21311327 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32834469b3 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
GWA studies have several issues and limitations that can be taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, insufficient sample size, control for [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] and control for [[population stratification]] are common problems.&lt;ref name="pmid18349094" /&gt;  Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that "the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for [[false-positive]] results".&lt;ref name="pmid18349094"/&gt; Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Pickrell J, Barrett J, MacArthur D, Jostins L | work = Genomes Unzipped | date = 23 November 2011 | url = http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php | title = Size matters, and other lessons from medical genetics | accessdate = 2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high-profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this.&lt;ref name="pmid20595579"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sebastiani P, Solovieff N, Puca A, Hartley SW, Melista E, Andersen S, Dworkis DA, Wilk JB, Myers RH, Steinberg MH, Montano M, Baldwin CT, Perls TT | title = Genetic signatures of exceptional longevity in humans | journal = Science | volume = 2010 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20595579 | doi = 10.1126/science.1190532 }}{{Retracted|intentional=yes}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of [[SNP array|genotyping array]] in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity.&lt;ref name=MacArthur&gt;{{Cite journal | title =   Serious flaws revealed in "longevity genes" study | url = https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/serious-flaws-revealed-in-longevity-genes-study/ | last = MacArthur | first = Daniel | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Wired | accessdate = 2011-12-07 | date = 2010-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was subsequently [[Retraction|retracted]],&lt;ref name="pmid21778381"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sebastiani P, Solovieff N, Puca A, Hartley SW, Melista E, Andersen S, Dworkis DA, Wilk JB, Myers RH, Steinberg MH, Montano M, Baldwin CT, Perls TT | title = Retraction | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6041 | pages = 404 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21778381 | doi = 10.1126/science.333.6041.404-a }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a modified manuscript was later published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sebastiani P, Solovieff N, Dewan AT, Walsh KM, Puca A, Hartley SW, Melista E, Andersen S, Dworkis DA, Wilk JB, Myers RH, Steinberg MH, Montano M, Baldwin CT, Hoh J, Perls TT | title = Genetic signatures of exceptional longevity in humans | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = e29848 | date = 2012-01-18 | pmid = 22279548 | pmc = 3261167 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0029848 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays a large role in explaining the heritable variation of common disease.&lt;ref name="pmid22243964"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Visscher PM, Brown MA, McCarthy MI, Yang J | title = Five years of GWAS discovery | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–24 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22243964 | pmc = 3257326 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure.&lt;ref name="pmid20522751"/&gt; Alternative strategies suggested involve [[linkage analysis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome [[sequencing]] have also provided a realistic alternative to [[SNP array|genotyping array]]-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.&lt;ref name="pmid21670730"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Visscher PM, Goddard ME, Derks EM, Wray NR | title = Evidence-based psychiatric genetics, AKA the false dichotomy between common and rare variant hypotheses | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 474–85 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21670730 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2011.65 | authorlink2 = Michael E. Goddard }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine-mapping==

Genotyping arrays designed for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide coverage of the entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants are unlikely to be the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.

Fine-mapping requires all variants in the associated region to have been genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.

The '''Institute for Science and Society (ISS)''' was an international centre of excellence{{clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is a centre of excellence}} in [[Science and Technology Studies]] located at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[UK]].

== History ==

It was founded in 1998 as the Genetics and Society Unit (GSU) and was later (2001) renamed the Institute for the Study of Genetics, Biorisks and Society (IGBiS) before its remit was expanded in 2006 to cover the social, legal, ethical and cultural implications of any field of science, medicine or technology, at which point it became ISS. The Institute was restructured in 2010 and mostly merged into the School of Sociology and Social Policy.

== About ISS ==

The Institute for Science and Society was a multidisciplinary centre drawing on a wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines to conduct research into cutting edge aspects of the mutual relationship between science and society.{{clarify|date=May 2013}} Historically{{clarify|date=May 2013}}, the Institute's agenda was dominated by topics in the bio-sciences, broadly conceived, but it became increasingly involved in partnerships around physical science issues like nanotechnology, sustainable energy use and climate change.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} 

The Institute is now physically part of the School of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Nottingham, but works virtually across the University under the University's Priority Group scheme as the Science and Technology Studies Priority Group.

Since its foundation, the Institute has been variously supported by grants and contracts from the [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] and [[Wellcome Trust]]s, the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC), the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC), the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), the [[European Union]] and the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Dr. Sujatha Raman and Professor Brigitte Nerlich are the current co-directors of the Institute.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

'''John Scherer Hougham''' (28 May 1821 – 31 March 1894), was [[Purdue University|Purdue University’s]] first appointed professor, first (unofficial) acting President (March 11, 1874 – June 11, 1874) after Purdue's first President [[Richard Dale Owen]] resigned on March 1, 1874, and later an official acting President (November 6, 1875 – April 30, 1876) between the administrations of [[Abraham C. Shortridge]] and Emerson E. White.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, Robert W. (10-1-1988) A Century and Beyond: The History of Purdue University. West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press. p63, p383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hougham first graduated from [[Wabash College]], Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1846, where he was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wabash.edu/alumni/docs/Class%20of%201995%20Late%20Dec%202005%20ltr.pdf Wabash College Archives, John S. Hougham Manuscript Collection]. Retrieved September 27, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; He then rose to Professor of [[Mathematics]] and [[Natural Philosophy]] at [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]] in Franklin, Indiana (1848 – 1867).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=788BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=john+s+hougham&amp;source=web&amp;ots=EQjKOQuvj9&amp;sig=EGbnYXX6kJjtGdJZztz0ws00dRA Indiana School Journal, April 1860 V(4):147]. Retrieved September 26, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time he was also a well regarded maker of scientific instruments (see images, right) for educational and professional use in medicine, chemistry, astronomy, and other related fields (e.g., [[Solar Compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/john_s__hougham1.htm Virtual Museum of Surveying].

&lt;/ref&gt; "Hougham Street" in Franklin, IN, adjacent to the Franklin College campus, was named to honor one of the city's most illustrious residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://goo.gl/maps/GD8dNZHhWcn Google Maps Street View image]. Retrieved August 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After those appointments, he was Chairman of Philosophy and Agriculture at [[Kansas State University]] (1868 – 1872).  He then took an appointment as Professor of [[Physics]] and Industrial Mechanics, and Chairman of [[Agricultural Chemistry]] at [[Purdue University]] (1872 – 1876),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about_us/history/early_years.shtml A History of Physics at Purdue]. Retrieved September 26, 2007. 
&lt;/ref&gt; serving in those early years of Purdue’s history as an academic "handyman" — and for a time acting President for parts of 1874 and 1876 — to [[John Purdue]] and the founding Trustees, visiting other universities around the country in search of new ideas and faculty to bring back to his native Indiana.  Around 1876, he returned to Kansas State where he spent the remaining years of his academic career.

'''Language and Communication Technologies''' ('''LCT'''; also known as '''''human language technologies''''' or '''''[[language technology]]''''' for short) is the scientific study of technologies that explore language and communication.  It is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the fields of [[computer science]], [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive science]].

==History==
One of the first problems to be studied in the 1950s, shortly after the invention of computers, was an LCT problem, namely the translation of human languages.  The large amounts of funding poured into [[machine translation]] testifies to the perceived importance of the field, right from the beginning.  It was also in this period that scholars started to develop theories of language and communication based on scientific methods. In the case of language, it was [[Noam Chomsky]] who refines the goal of linguistics as a quest for a formal description of language,&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, ''Syntactic Structures'', London: Mouton, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] provided a mathematical theory that linked communication with information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html A Mathematical Theory of Communication]. Cm.bell-labs.com (1998-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980131083455/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html|date=1998-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers and related technologies have provided a physical and conceptual framework within which scientific studies concerning the notion of communication within a computational framework could be pursued. Indeed, this framework has been fruitful on a number of levels. For a start, it has given birth to a new discipline, known as [[natural language processing]] (NLP), or [[computational linguistics]] (CL). This discipline studies, from a computational perspective, all levels of language from the production of speech to the meanings of texts and dialogues. And over the past 40 years, NLP has produced an impressive computational infrastructure of resources, techniques, and tools for analyzing sound structure ([[phonology]]), word structure ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), grammatical structure ([[syntax]]) and meaning structure ([[semantics]]). As well as being important for language-based applications, this computational infrastructure makes it possible to investigate the structure of human language and communication at a deeper scientific level than was ever previously possible.

Moreover, NLP fits in naturally with other branches of computer science, and in particular, with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage AITopics / NaturalLanguage]. Aaai.org. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731224551/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage|date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an AI perspective, language use is regarded as a manifestation of intelligent behaviour by an active agent. The emphasis in AI-based approaches to language and communication is on the computational infrastructure required to integrate linguistic performance into a general theory of intelligent agents that includes, for example, learning generalizations on the basis of particular experience, the ability to plan and reason about intentionally produced utterances, the design of utterances that will fulfill a particular set of goals. Such work tends to be highly interdisciplinary in nature, as it needs to draw on ideas from such fields as [[linguistics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[sociology]]. LCT draws on and incorporates knowledge and research from all these fields.

==Today==
Language and communication are so fundamental to human activity that it is not at all surprising to find that Language and Communication Technologies affect all major areas of society, including health, education, finance, commerce, and travel. Modern LCT is based on a dual tradition of symbols and statistics. This means that nowadays research on language requires access to large databases of information about words and their properties, to large scale computational grammars, to computational tools for working with all levels of language, and to efficient inference systems for performing reasoning. By working computationally it is possible to get to grips with the deeper structure of natural languages, and in particular, to model the crucial interactions between the various levels of language and other cognitive faculties.

Relevant areas of research in LCT include:

*[[Machine translation]]
*[[Information retrieval]]
*[[Ontologies]]
*[[Formal semantics (linguistics)|Formal semantics]]
*[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Information and knowledge representation]]
*[[Question answering]]
*[[Speech recognition]] and [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]]
*Models of human language processing and understanding
*[[Psycholinguistics]]

==Educational programs==
The increasing interest in the field is proved by the existence of several European Masters in this dynamic research area:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/selected_projects_action_1_master_courses_en.php Erasmus Mundus – Action 1 – Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses (EMMCs) | EACEA].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35989">[[Ace Books]] published 221 '''[[science fiction]] Ace doubles''' between 1952 and 1973 in [[dos-à-dos binding|tête-bêche]] format, and a further 40 between 1974 and 1978 in a more traditional format in which the two books are both the same way up.

==Genres and Collectability==
Ace published [[science fiction]], [[mystery fiction|mysteries]], and [[western (genre)|westerns]], as well as books not in any of these [[literary genre|genres]]. Collectors of these genres have found the Ace doubles an attractive set of books to collect, because of the unusual appearance of the [[dos-à-dos binding|tête-bêche]] format. This is particularly true for the science fiction books, for which several bibliographic references have been written (see the [[List of Ace Double Novels#References|References]] section). The format inspired a further series of sf doubles published by [[Tor Books]] between 1988 and 1991, the [[Tor Double Novels]].

Because the [[dos-à-dos binding|tête-bêche]] format is part of the attraction for collectors, titles published between 1974 and 1978, which contained two titles by one or two authors but which are not [[dos-à-dos binding|tête-bêche]] are not regarded by some collectors as true Ace Doubles. The distinction is up to each collector; the books are included in the list given below, with the difference in format noted.

The list given here gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels. The list is complete for science fiction titles. However, D-13, listed in [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Miscellaneous Ace Doubles]], contains one novel, ''Cry Plague!'' by [[Theodore S. Drachman]], which can be regarded as sf, and some science fiction collectors treat this as the first sf Ace Double, even though the novel on the other side is not sf in any way.

For more information about the history of these titles, see [[Ace Books]], which includes a discussion of the serial numbering conventions used and an explanation of the letter-code system.

Serial number 48245, above, was the last Ace Double published in the [[dos-à-dos binding|tête-bêche]] format. The remainder of the books listed in this section contain two novels, but are published in the traditional way with a single cover and the text the same way up throughout the book. Another Ace SF double(G-723-Andre Norton-Star Hunter/Voodoo Planet)was published in 1968 as a traditional reprint in the second G series(begun in 1964).  G-723 was the only traditionally printed SF double included in that series and thus does not fit under any of the categories listed here.

This is a '''list of Unix [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]''' that are found on various [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Unix daemons typically have a name ending with a ''d''.

{| class="wikitable"
!Process
!Description
|-
![[init]]&lt;ref name=verma2006/&gt;
|The Unix program which spawns all other processes. As of 2016, for major Linux distributions, it has been replaced by [[systemd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linuxvoice.com/linux-101-get-the-most-out-of-systemd/|title=Linux 101: Get the most out of systemd|first=Mike|last=Saunders|publisher=Linux Voice|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!biod&lt;ref name=rosen_host_klee2006/&gt;
|Works in cooperation with the remote nfsd to handle client [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] requests.
|-
![[cron]]d&lt;ref name=verma2006/&gt;
|Time-based [[job scheduler]], runs jobs in the background.
|-
![[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|dhcpd]]
|Dynamically configure TCP/IP information for clients.
|-
![[Finger protocol|finger]]d
|Provides a network interface for the [[finger protocol]], as used by the ''finger'' command.
|-
![[File Transfer Protocol|ftp]]d&lt;ref name=verma2006/&gt;
|Services [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] requests from a remote system.
|-
![[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|httpd]]
|[[Web server]] daemon.
|-
![[inetd]]&lt;ref name=stevens_fenner_rudocc2004/&gt;
|Listens for network connection requests. If a request is accepted, it can launch a background daemon to handle the request, was known as the super server for this reason. Some systems use the replacement command '''[[xinetd]]'''.
|-
![[Line Printer Daemon protocol|lpd]]
|The [[Line Printer Daemon protocol|line printer daemon]] that manages printer spooling.
|-
![[Network File System (protocol)|nfsd]]&lt;ref name=rosen_host_klee2006/&gt;
|Processes [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] operation requests from client systems. Historically each nfsd daemon handled one request at a time, so it was normal to start multiple copies.
|-
!ntpd
|[[Network Time Protocol]] daemon that manages clock synchronization across the network. '''xntpd''' implements the version 3 standard of NTP.
|-
![[portmap]]/rpcbind
|Provides information to allow [[ONC RPC]] clients to contact ONC RPC servers
|-
!sshd
|Listens for [[secure shell]] requests from clients.
|-
![[sendmail]]
|[[SMTP]] daemon.
|-
!swapper
|Copies process regions to [[Virtual memory|swap]] space in order to reclaim physical [[Paging|page]]s of [[computer storage|memory]] for the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. Also called '''sched'''.
|-
![[syslog]]d
|System logger process that collects various system messages.
|-
!syncd
|Periodically keeps the [[file system]]s synchronized with system memory.
|-
![[systemd]]
|Replacement of [[init]], the Unix program which spawns all other processes.
|-
|-
![[X Font Server|xfsd]]
|Serve [[X Window System|X11]] [[font]]s to remote clients.
|-
!vhand
|Releases pages of memory for use by other processes. Also known as the "page stealing daemon"
|-
!ypbind
|Find the server for an [[Network Information Service|NIS]] domain and store the information in a file.

==Third-party platforms==
Third-party platforms are software distribution platforms which are used as alternatives for operating system native distribution platforms. Independent operating systems are software collections which use their own software distribution, customized user interface, SDK and API (except billing API which is related only to application store).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">The '''MAGIC criteria''' are a set of guidelines put forth by [[Robert Abelson]] in his book ''Statistics as Principled Argument''. In this book he posits that the goal of statistical analysis should be to make compelling claims about the world &lt;ref name = "jsvine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drafts.jsvine.com/the-magic-criteria/|title=The MAGIC Criteria|work=jsvine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he presents the MAGIC criteria as a way to do that. 

== What are the MAGIC criteria? ==

MAGIC is an acronym for:
# Magnitude - How big is the effect? Large effects are more compelling than small ones.
# Articulation - How specific is it?&lt;ref name="sfu.ca"&gt; http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/376/ted/376-08-1/MAGIC-criteria.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Precise statements are more compelling than imprecise ones. 
# Generality - How generally does it apply?&lt;ref name = "jsvine"/&gt; More general effects are more compelling than less general ones. Claims that would interest a more general audience are more compelling.&lt;ref name="sfu.ca"/&gt;
# Interestingness - interesting effects are those that "have the potential, through empirical analysis, to change what people believe about an important issue".&lt;ref name = "jsvine"/&gt;  More interesting effects are more compelling than less interesting ones. In addition, more surprising effects are more compelling than ones that merely confirm what is already known.&lt;ref name="sfu.ca" /&gt;
# Credibility - Credible claims are more compelling than incredible ones. The researcher must show that the claims made are credible.&lt;ref name = "jsvine"/&gt; Results that contradict previously established ones are less credible.&lt;ref name="sfu.ca" /&gt;

The '''Mars effect''' is a purported statistical correlation between [[Sportsperson|athletic]] eminence and the position of the planet [[Mars]] relative to the horizon at time and place of birth. This controversial finding was first reported by the [[France|French]] [[psychologist]] and "neo-astrologer"&lt;ref name=Pont&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pont|first=Graham|title=Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece|journal=Nexus Network Journal|date=2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0003-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Gauquelin published in his book ''L'influence des astres'' ("The Influence of the Stars", 1955).&lt;ref&gt;I.W.Kelly, ''The Concepts of Modern Astrology: A Critique'' (University of Saskatchewan, online at http://www.astrosurf.com/nitschelm/Modern_criticism.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauquelin suggested that a statistically significant number of sports champions were born just after the planet Mars rises or [[Culmination|culminates]]. Gauquelin divided the [[plane of the ecliptic]] into twelve [[Circular sector|sectors]], identifying two "key" sectors of [[statistical significance]].

Gauquelin's work was accepted by the notable psychologist and statistician [[Hans Eysenck]] among others&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Eysenck &amp; D.K.B. Nias, Astrology: Science or Superstition? Penguin Books (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; but later attempts to validate the data and replicate the effect have produced uneven results, chiefly owing to disagreements over the selection and analysis of the [[data set]]. Since the phenomenon in question depends upon the daily [[Rotation of Earth|rotation of the Earth]], the availability and accuracy of time and place of birth data is crucial to such studies, as is the criterion of "eminence". Later research claims to explain the Mars effect by [[selection bias]], favouring champions who were born in a ''key sector'' of Mars and rejecting those who were not from the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Willem Nienhuys (1997). The Mars Effect in Retrospect, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', vol 21 #6, Nov 1997, 24–29.

''Journal of Scientific Exploration'', Vol. 11 , No. 1, pp. 19–39. [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_1_kurtz.pdf available online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124055709/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_1_kurtz.pdf |date=January 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and replication==
Gauquelin's work was not limited to the Mars effect: his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of [[natal astrology]] as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out "highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people." This claim concerned not only Mars but five planets, correlated with eminence in fields broadly compatible with the [[Planets in astrology|traditional "planetary rulerships"]] of astrology. However, partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable, later research, publicity and controversy has tended to single out the "Mars effect".

===Belgian athletes – the Comité Para===
In 1956 Gauquelin invited the Belgian [[Comité Para]] to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that Jean Dath corroborated the statistics Gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using Belgian athletes. By this time Gauquelin had published ''Les Hommes et Les Astres'' (Men and the Stars, 1960), offering further data. The Comité Para tested the Mars effect in 1967 and replicated it, though most of the data (473 of 535) were still collected by Gauquelin himself. The committee, suspecting that the results might have been an artifact, withheld its findings for a further eight years, then cited unspecified “[[Demography|demographic]] errors” in its findings. Unpublished internal analyses contradicted this and one committee member, Luc de Marré, resigned in protest. In 1983 Abell, Kurtz and Zelen (''see below'') published a reappraisal, rejecting the idea of demographic errors, saying, “Gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of Mars sectors for birth times in the general population.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptical Inquirer'', 7(3), 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Zelen test===
In 1975 [[Paul Kurtz]]'s journal ''The Humanist'' published an article on astrology criticizing Gauquelin, to which the latter and his wife Françoise responded. Then Professor [[Zelen's design|Marvin Zelen]], a statistician and associate of the recently founded Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP, now known as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI)), proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that, in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly, Gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a [[control group]], giving the base-rate (chance) expectation for comparison (The 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes).

In April 1977 CSICOP researcher [[George O. Abell]] wrote to Kurtz stating that Zelen's test had come out in the Gauquelins' favour. The Gauquelins also performed the test that Professor Zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance Mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population (i.e., non-champions) was about 17%, significantly less than the 22% observed for athletic champions. However the subsequent article by Zelen, Abell and Kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data. In a rebuttal of the Gauquelins' published conclusion, Marvin Zelen analysed the composition, not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group, but of the 303 champions, splitting this secondary subsample (which was already nearly too small to test 22% vs 17%) by eliminating female athletes, a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to Gauquelin, and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and [[Paris]]ian/non-Parisian sections.

Before and after publication of Zelen's results astronomer and charter CSICOP member [[Dennis Rawlins]], the CSICOP Council's only astronomer at the time, repeatedly objected to the procedure and to CSICOP's subsequent reportage of it. Rawlins privately urged that the Gauquelins' results were valid and the “Zelen test” could only uphold this and that Zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test, which was to check the base rate of births with Mars in the "key" sectors. It appeared to him that the test had minimised the significance of the Mars/key-sector correlations with athletes by splitting the sample of athletes and that the experimenters, who were supposed to be upholding scientific standards, were actually distorting and manipulating evidence to conceal the result of an ill-considered test.

The Kurtz-Zelen-Abell analysis had split the sample primarily to examine the randomness of the 303 selected champions, the non-randomness of which Rawlins demonstrated in 1975 and 1977. Zelen's 1976 "Challenge to Gauquelin" had stated: "We now have an objective way for unambiguous corroboration or disconfirmation ... to settle this question", whereas this aim was now disputed. Rawlins made procedural objections, stating; "... we find an inverse correlation between size and deviation in the Mars-athletes subsamples (that is, the smaller the subsample, the larger the success) – which is what one would expect if bias had infected the blocking off of the sizes of the subsamples".&lt;ref&gt;The Zetetic ([[Skeptical Inquirer]]) 2, no. 1, Fall/Winter 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt;

CSICOP also contended, after reviewing the results, that the Gauquelins had not chosen randomly. They had had difficulty finding sufficient same-week and same-village births to compare with champions born in rural areas and so had chosen only champions born in larger cities. The Gauquelins' original total list of about 2,088 champions had included 42 Parisians and their subsample of 303 athletes also included 42 Parisians. Further, Paris is divided into 20 ''[[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]]'', different economic classes and ethnic groups typically inhabiting different arrondissements. The Gauquelins had compared the 42 Parisian champions (who had been born throughout Paris) to non-champions of only one arrondissement. If the 22% correlation was an artifact partly based on factors such as rural recordkeeping, economic, class or ethnic differences in birth patterns, this fact would be blurred by this non-random selection.

===U.S. athletes – CSICOP===
At the same time CSICOP began a study of U.S. athletes in consultation with Zelen, Abell and Rawlins. The results, published in 1979&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]], [[Marvin Zelen]], and [[George O. Abell]] (1979). Results of the U.S. Test of the "Mars Effect" Are Negative, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Vol 4 #2, Winter 1979/80, 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; showed a negative result. Gauquelin contended the KZA group demonstrated an overall preference for mediocre athletes and ignored his criteria of eminence and that they included basketball players and people born after 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gauquelin and [[Françoise Gauquelin]] (1979). Star U.S. Sportsmen Display the Mars Effect, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Vol 4 #2, Winter 1979/80, 31–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CFEPP test ===
In 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the [[Committee for the Study of Paranormal Phenomena]] (''Comité pour l’Étude des Phénomènes Paranormaux'', or CFEPP) in France found no evidence whatsoever of a "Mars Effect" in the births of athletes.&lt;ref name="Frenchbook"&gt;Benski, et al. 1993, as published in ''The "Mars Effect": A French Test of Over 1,000 Sports Champions'', [[Prometheus Books]] (1996). {{ISBN|0-87975-988-7}}. page ref:13, 15&lt;/ref&gt; The study had been proposed in 1982 and the Committee had agreed in advance to use the protocol upon which Gauquelin insisted. The CFEPP report was “leaked” to the Dutch newspaper ''Trouw''.

In 1990 the CFEPP had issued a preliminary report on the study, which used 1,066 French sports champions, giving full data for the 1,066 as well as the names of 373 who fit the criteria but for whom birth times were unavailable, discussing methodology and listing data-selection criteria. In 1996 the report, with a commentary by J. W. Nienhuys and several letters from Gauquelin to the Committee, was published in book form as ''The Mars Effect – A French Test of Over 1,000 Sports Champions''. The CFEPP stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in Gauquelin’s data selection, pointing to the suggestions made by Gauquelin to the Committee for changes in their list of athletes.&lt;ref name="Frenchbook" /&gt;

=== Statistical explanation ===

Some researchers argued that Gauquelin did not adjust the statistical significance of the Mars Effect for [[multiple comparisons]] and did not address the issue in his publications. Simplified and illustrative showcase argument is explained here: There are 10 celestial bodies and 12 sectors for them to be in. Furthermore, there are 132 combinations of sector pairs and thus 1320 different combinations of a planet with two sectors. There is about a 25% chance to find at least one such combination (of one planet and two sectors) for a random dataset of the same size as Gauquelin’s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by Gauquelin.&lt;ref name=Panchin&gt;Alexander Y. Panchin. The Saturn-Mars Effect. ''Skeptic Magazine'' Vol 16 #1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the Mars effect is no longer statistically significant even at the modest [[significance level]] of 0.05 and is probably a false positive.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in populations after 1950. Dean has put forward the idea that this may be due to increases in doctors reporting the time of birth rather than parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jonathan C.|title=Pseudoscience and extraordinary claims of the paranormal : a critical thinker's toolkit|date=2010|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781405181235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about misreporting was unavailable to Gauquelin at the time. Dean had said that misreporting by 3% of the sample would explain the result.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite web|last=Dean|first=Geoffrey|title=The Mars Effect &amp; True Disbelievers|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-04-06/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membrane bioelectrical impulses are described by the [[Hodgkin cycle]].

== Biophysics ==
Membrane [[biophysics]] is the study of [[biological membrane]] structure and function using  [[Physics|physical]], [[Computation|computational]], [[Mathematics|mathematical]], and [[Biophysical techniques|biophysical methods]]. A combination of these methods can be used to create [[phase diagrams]] of different types of membranes, which yields information on [[thermodynamic]] behavior of a membrane and its components. As opposed to membrane biology, membrane biophysics focuses on quantitative information and modeling of various membrane phenomena, such as [[lipid raft]] formation, rates of lipid and cholesterol flip-flop, protein-lipid coupling, and the effect of bending and elasticity functions of membranes on inter-cell connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Membrane biophysics|first1=Joshua|last1=Zimmerberg|journal=Current Biology |volume=16|issue=8|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7413">'''Models of consciousness''' are used to illustrate and aid in understanding and explaining distinctive aspects [[consciousness]]. Sometimes the models are labeled '''theories of consciousness'''. [[Anil Seth]] defines such models as those that relate brain phenomena such as fast irregular electrical activity and widespread brain activation to properties of consciousness such as qualia. Seth allows for different types of models including mathematical, logical, verbal and conceptual models.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Seth, A. K. &amp; Baars, B. J. 2005 Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'' 14, 140-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural correlates of consciousness ==
{{Main|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[Neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCC) formalism is used as a major step towards explaining consciousness. The NCC are defined to constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, and consequently sufficient for consciousness. In this formalism, consciousness is viewed as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system. &lt;ref&gt; Crick F. and Koch C. (1990) Towards a neurobiological theory of consciousness. ''Seminars in Neuroscience'' Vol2, 263–275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Koch, Christof (2004). The quest for consciousness: a neurobiological approach. Englewood, US-CO: Roberts &amp; Company Publishers. {{ISBN|0-9747077-0-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Squire, Larry R. (2008). ''Fundamental neuroscience'' (3rd ed.). Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-374019-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness ==
{{Main|Eight-circuit model of consciousness}}

[[Timothy Leary]] introduced&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology''. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]] elaborated  the [[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]] as hypothesis that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".

== Multiple drafts model ==
{{Main|Multiple drafts model}}
[[Daniel Dennett]] proposed a physicalist, information processing based [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness described more fully in his 1991 book, [[Consciousness Explained]].

== Dehaene–Changeux model ==
{{Main|Dehaene–Changeux model}}

The [[Dehaene–Changeux model]] (DCM), also known as the global neuronal workspace or the global cognitive workspace model is a computer model of the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlates of consciousness]]  programmed as a neural network.  [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] introduced this model in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. ''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing''. Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with [[Bernard Baars]]'s [[Global workspace theory]] for consciousness. 

== Clouding of consciousness ==
{{Main|Clouding of consciousness}}
[[Clouding of consciousness]], also known as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in medicine denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium&lt;ref&gt;Plum and Posner's diagnosis of stupor and coma. Oxford University Press. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. It is part of an overall model where there's regulation of the "overall level" of the consciousness of the brain and aspects responsible for "arousal" or "wakefulness" and awareness of oneself and of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Caraceni; Luigi Grassi (2011). ''Delirium: Acute Confusional States in Palliative Medicine''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Electromagnetic theories of consciousness ==
{{Main|Electromagnetic theories of consciousness}}
 
[[Electromagnetic theories of consciousness]] propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan. ''The Nature of Consciousness''. {{ISBN|0-595-12215-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan (2012). "The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness: a testable hypothesis about the characteristics of conscious as opposed to non-conscious fields". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies''. 19 (11-12): 191–223.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some electromagnetic theories are also quantum mind theories of consciousness; examples include [[quantum brain dynamics]] (QBD).&lt;ref&gt;Mari Jibu; Kunio Yasue. ''Quantum brain dynamics and consciousness''. {{ISBN|1-55619-183-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orchestrated objective reduction ==
{{Main|Orchestrated objective reduction}}
 
Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model is based on the hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from quantum processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be associated with molecular structures called [[microtubules]]. The hypothesis was advanced by [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]] and has been the subject of extensive debate&lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Consciousness in the universe: A review of the 'Orch OR' theory". Physics of Life Reviews. Elsevier. 11 (1): 39–78. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.08.002. {{PMID|24070914}}. &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Reply to seven commentaries on "Consciousness in the universe: Review of the 'Orch OR' theory"". ''Physics of Life Reviews''. Elsevier. 11 (1): 104–112. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness ==

Min proposed in a 2010 paper a Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Min, B. K. (2010). A thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness. ''Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling'', 7(1), 10. https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1742-4682-7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests consciousness as a "mental state embodied through TRN-modulated synchronization of thalamocortical networks". In this model the [[thalamic reticular nucleus]] (TRN) is suggested as ideally suited for controlling the entire cerebral network, and responsible (via [[GABAergic]] networking) for synchronization of neural activity.

== Functionalism (philosophy of mind) ==
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}

Functionalism is a view in the theory of the mind. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.

== Sociology of human consciousness ==
{{Main|Sociology of human consciousness}} 

[[Sociology of human consciousness]] uses the theories and methodology of sociology to explain human consciousness. The theory and its models emphasize the importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. It argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social.

'''PCR food testing''' is the engagement of [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) technologies for the testing of [[food]] for the presence or absence of [[human pathogen]]s, such as [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], [[Salmonella]], [[Listeria]], etc.

PCR test results offers faster, more accurate test result data than traditional microbiological culture methods, which typically require 24 to 48 hours of growth time and often report less than 100% specificity and sensitivity.  PCR results can be reported from 30 to 55 minutes after the initiation of the amplification run.  PCR test results report very close to 100% specificity and sensitivity.
Four sample collection sites for PCR food testing can be:
# The food irrigation water.
# The food wash water.
# Environmental samples collected in the food processing facility.
# The finished food product, whether fresh or processed.
Each of these sample types can be collected, prepared and PCR tested within a short time for many sample types.  Some sample types may require sample enrichment via shortened culture growth periods prior to PCR testing.

'''Phytotelma''' (plural '''phytotelmata''') is a small water-filled cavity in a terrestrial plant. The water accumulated within these plants may serve as the habitat for associated [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. Often the faunae associated with phytotelmata are unique. Some species also are of great practical significance; for example, immature stages of some [[mosquito]]es, such as some ''[[Anopheles]]'' and ''[[Aedes]]'' species that are important disease vectors, develop in phytotelmata.&lt;ref name="Frank and Lounibos 1983"&gt;Frank, J.H. and Lounibos, L.P. (1983) ''Phytotelmata: Terrestrial plants as hosts for aquatic insect communities'', Plexus Press. {{ISBN|0-937548-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rich literature in German summarised by Thienemann (1954)&lt;ref&gt;Thienemann, A. (1954). ''Chironomus'': Leben, Verbreitung und wirtschaftliche Bedeutung der Chironomiden. ''Binnengewässer'' '''20''': 1-834. &lt;/ref&gt; developed many aspects of phytotelm biology. Reviews of the subject by Kitching (1971) and Maguire (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, B. (1971) ''Phytotelmata: Biota and community structure''. ''Annual review of Ecology and Systematics.'' '''2''': 439-464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, R. L. (1971) An ecological study of water-filled treeholes and their position in the woodland ecosystem. ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' '''40''': 281-302.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of phytotelmata to English-speaking readers.    A multi-authored book edited by Frank and Lounibos (1983)&lt;ref name="Frank and Lounibos 1983" /&gt; dealt in 11 chapters with classification of phytotelmata, and with phytotelmata provided by bamboo internodes, banana leaf axils, [[bromeliad]] [[leaf axil]]s, ''[[Nepenthes]]'' pitchers, ''[[Sarracenia]]'' pitchers, [[Tree hollow|tree holes]], and ''[[Heliconia]]'' flower [[bract]]s.

A classification of phytotelmata by Kitching (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, R.L. (2000). ''Food webs and container habitats: The natural history and ecology of phytotelmata''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77316-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes five principal types: bromeliad tanks, certain [[carnivorous plant]]s such as [[pitcher plant]]s, water-filled [[tree hollow]]s, [[bamboo]] internodes, and axil water (collected at the base of leaves, petals or [[bract]]s); it concentrated on food webs. A review by Greeney (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Greeney, H.F. (2001). The insects of plant-held waters: a brief review and bibliography. ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' '''17'''(2): 241–260. {{DOI|10.1017/S026646740100116X}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified seven forms: tree holes, leaf [[axil]]s, flowers, modified leaves, fallen vegetative parts (e.g. leaves or bracts), fallen fruit [[husk]]s, and [[stem rot]]s.

==Etymology==
The word "phytotelma" derives from the [[ancient Greek]] roots ''phyto-'', meaning 'plant', and ''[[wikt:τέλμα|telma]]'', meaning 'pond'. Thus, the correct [[Grammatical number|singular]] is ''phytotelma''.

The term was coined by L. Varga in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Varga, L. (1928). Ein interessanter Biotop der Biocönose von Wasserorganism. ''Biologische Zentralblatt'' '''48''': 143–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct pronunciation is "phytotēlma" and "phytotēlmata" because of the Greek origin (the stressed vowels are here written as ''ē'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42637">[[Grammar theory]] to model symbol strings originated from work in [[computational linguistics]] aiming to understand the structure of [[natural language]]s.&lt;ref name="Chomsky_1956" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky_1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky_1957" /&gt; '''Probabilistic context free grammars''' ('''PCFGs''') have been applied in '''probabilistic modeling''' of [[RNA structure]]s almost 40 years after they were introduced in [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grat 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre 1996" /&gt;

PCFGs extend [[context-free grammar]]s similar to how [[hidden Markov model]]s extend [[regular grammar]]s. Each [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production]] is assigned a probability. The probability of a derivation (parse) is the product of the probabilities of the productions used in that derivation. These probabilities can be viewed as parameters of the model, and for large problems it is convenient to learn these parameters via [[machine learning]]. A probabilistic grammar's validity is constrained by context of its training dataset.

PCFGs have application in areas as diverse as [[natural language processing]] to the study the structure of [[RNA]] molecules and design of [[programming language]]s. Designing efficient PCFGs has to weigh factors of scalability and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity must be resolved. The grammar design affects results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements.

==Definitions==
'''Derivation:'''  The process of recursive generation of strings from a grammar.
                                           
'''[[Parsing]]:''' Finding a valid derivation using an automaton.

'''[[Parse tree|Parse Tree:]]''' The alignment of the grammar to a sequence.

An example of a parser for PCFG grammars is the [[pushdown automaton]]. The algorithm parses grammar nonterminals from left to right in a [[Stack (abstract data type)#Applications|stack-like]] manner. This [[Brute-force search|brute-force]] approach is not very efficient. In RNA secondary structure prediction variants of the '''[[CYK algorithm|Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm]]''' provide more efficient alternatives to grammar parsing than pushdown automata.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; Another example of a  PCFG parser is the Stanford Statistical Parser which has been trained using Treebank,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Daniel|author2=Manning, Christopher |title=Accurate Unlexicalized Parsing|journal=Proceedings of the 41st Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics|year=2003|pages=423–430|url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/unlexicalized-parsing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==
Similar to a [[Context-free grammar|CFG]], a probabilistic context-free grammar {{mvar|G}}  can be defined by a quintuple:

:&lt;math&gt;G = (M, T, R, S, P)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* {{mvar|M}}  is the set of non-terminal symbols
* {{mvar|T}}  is the set of terminal symbols
* {{mvar|R}}  is the set of production rules
* {{mvar|S}}  is the start symbol
* {{mvar|P}}  is the set of probabilities on production rules

==Relation with hidden Markov models==
PCFGs models extend [[context-free grammar]]s the same way as [[hidden Markov model]]s extend [[regular grammar]]s.

The [[Inside–outside algorithm|Inside-Outside algorithm]] is an analogue of the [[Forward-backward algorithm|Forward-Backward algorithm]]. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG.  This is equivalent to the probability of the PCFG generating the sequence, and is intuitively a measure of how consistent the sequence is with the given grammar. The Inside-Outside algorithm is used in model [[Parameterization|parametrization]] to estimate prior frequencies observed from training sequences in the case of RNAs.

[[Dynamic programming]] variants of the [[CYK algorithm]] find the [[Viterbi algorithm|Viterbi parse]] of a RNA sequence for a PCFG model.  This parse is the most likely derivation of the sequence by the given PCFG.

==Grammar construction==
Context-free grammars are represented as a set of rules inspired from attempts to model natural languages.&lt;ref name="Chomsky_1957" /&gt; The rules are absolute and have a typical syntax representation known as [[Backus–Naur form]]. The production rules consist of terminal '''&lt;math&gt;\left \{a, b \right\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and non-terminal '''{{mvar|S}}''' symbols and a blank '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;''' may also be used as an end point.  In the production rules of CFG and PCFG the left side has only one nonterminal whereas the right side can be any string of terminal or nonterminals. In PCFG nulls are excluded.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; An example of a grammar:
                                     
:                                     &lt;math&gt;
                                        S \to aS, S \to bS, S \to \epsilon
     &lt;/math&gt;                               
This grammar can be shortened using the '|' ('or') character into:

:                                     &lt;math&gt;    S\to aS | bS |\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Terminals in a grammar are words and through the grammar rules a non-terminal symbol is transformed into a string of either terminals and/or non-terminals. The above grammar is read as "beginning from a non-terminal {{mvar|S}} the emission can generate either {{mvar|a}} or {{mvar|b}} or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;".
Its derivation is: 
:                                      &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aS\Rightarrow abS\Rightarrow abbS \Rightarrow abb&lt;/math&gt;

[[Ambiguous grammar]] may result in ambiguous parsing if applied on [[homograph]]s since the same word sequence can have more than one interpretation. [[pun|Pun sentences]] such as the newspaper headline "Iraqi Head Seeks Arms" are an example of ambiguous parses.

One strategy of dealing with ambiguous parses (originating with grammarians as early as [[Pāṇini]]) is to add yet more rules, or prioritize them so that one rule takes precedence over others. This, however, has the drawback of proliferating the rules, often to the point where they become difficult to manage. Another difficulty is overgeneration, where unlicensed structures are also generated.

Probabilistic grammars circumvent these problems by ranking various productions on frequency weights, resulting in a "most likely" (winner-take-all) interpretation.  As usage patterns are altered in [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] shifts, these probabilistic rules can be re-learned, thus updating the grammar.

Assigning probability to production rules makes a PCFG. These probabilities are informed by observing distributions on a training set of similar composition to the language to be modeled. On most samples of broad language, probabilistic grammars where probabilities are estimated from data typically outperform hand-crafted grammars. CFGs when contrasted with PCFGs are not applicable to RNA structure prediction because while they incorporate sequence-structure relationship they lack the scoring metrics that reveal a sequence structural potential &lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

==Weighted context-free grammar==
A '''weighted context-free grammar''' ('''WCFG''') is a more general category of [[context-free grammar]], where each production has a numeric weight associated with it. The weight of a specific [[parse tree]] in a WCFG is the product&lt;ref name=PCFG_WCFG_same&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1162/coli.2007.33.4.477|title=Weighted and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars Are Equally Expressive|year=2007|last1=Smith|first1=Noah A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=33|issue=4|pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or sum&lt;ref name=sumWeightedCFG&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68155-7_31|chapter=The Weighted Cfg Constraint|title=Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2008|last1=Katsirelos|first1=George|last2=Narodytska|first2=Nina|last3=Walsh|first3=Toby|isbn=978-3-540-68154-0|volume=5015|pages=323|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=zKlk6bA3u3oC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=isbn:9783540681540|citeseerx=10.1.1.150.1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) of all rule weights in the tree.  Each rule weight is included as often as the rule is used in the tree.  A special case of WCFGs are PCFGs, where the weights are ([[logarithm]]s of &lt;ref name=logLinear&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/papers/ESSLLI05-wcfgs.pdf#page=10 |title=log linear or Gibbs models|first=Mark |last=Johnson|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statistical properties of probabilistic context-free grammars|first=Zhiyi|last=Chi|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=25|issue=1|date=March 1999|pages=131–160|url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J99/J99-1004.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232432/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J99/J99-1004.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) [[probability|probabilities]].

An extended version of the [[CYK algorithm]] can be used to find the "lightest" (least-weight) derivation of a string given some WCFG.

When the tree weight is the product of the rule weights, WCFGs and PCFGs can express the same set of [[probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=PCFG_WCFG_same/&gt;

==Applications==

===RNA structure prediction===
Energy minimization&lt;ref name="McCaskill 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juan 1999" /&gt; and PCFG provide ways of predicting RNA secondary structure with comparable performance.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; However structure prediction by PCFGs is scored probabilistically rather than by minimum free energy calculation. PCFG model parameters are directly derived from frequencies of different features observed in databases of RNA structures &lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt; rather than by experimental 
determination as is the case with energy minimization methods.&lt;ref name="Zuker 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews 1999" /&gt;

The types of various structure that can be modeled by a PCFG include long range interactions, pairwise structure and other nested structures. However, pseudoknots can not be modeled.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; PCFGs extend CFG by assigning probabilities to each production rule. A maximum probability parse tree from the grammar implies a maximum probability structure. Since RNAs preserve their structures over their primary sequence; RNA structure prediction can be guided by combining evolutionary information from comparative sequence analysis with biophysical knowledge about a structure plausibility based on such probabilities. Also search results for structural homologs using PCFG rules are scored according to PCFG derivations probabilities. Therefore, building grammar to model the behavior of base-pairs and single-stranded regions starts with exploring features of structural [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related RNAs.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; 
:                                            &lt;math&gt;S \to aSa | bSb | aa | bb&lt;/math&gt;

The above grammar generates a string in an outside-in fashion, that is the basepair on the furthest extremes of the terminal is derived first. So a string such as &lt;math&gt;aabaabaa&lt;/math&gt; is derived by first generating the distal {{mvar|a}}'s on both sides before moving inwards:
:                                           &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aSa \Rightarrow aaSaa \Rightarrow aabSbaa \Rightarrow aabaabaa&lt;/math&gt;

A PCFG model extendibility allows constraining structure prediction by incorporating expectations about different features of an RNA . Such expectation may reflect for example the propensity for assuming a certain structure by an RNA.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;  However incorporation of too much information may increase PCFG space and memory complexity and it is desirable that a PCFG-based model be as simple as possible.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

Every possible string {{mvar|x}} a grammar generates is assigned a probability weight &lt;math&gt;P(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; given the PCFG model &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the sum of all probabilities to all possible grammar productions is  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\text{x}}P(x|\theta)=1&lt;/math&gt;. The scores for each paired and unpaired residue explain likelihood for secondary structure formations. Production rules also allow scoring loop lengths as well as the order of base pair stacking hence it is possible to explore the range of all possible generations including suboptimal structures from the grammar and accept or reject structures based on score thresholds.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

====Implementations====
RNA secondary structure implementations based on PCFG approaches can be utilized in :
* Finding consensus structure by optimizing structure joint probabilities over MSA.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;
* Modeling base-pair covariation to detecting homology in database searches.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;
* pairwise simultaneous folding and alignment.&lt;ref name="Rivas 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2002" /&gt;

Different implementation of these approaches exist. For example, Pfold is used in secondary structure prediction from a group of related RNA sequences,&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; covariance models are used in searching databases for homologous sequences and RNA annotation and classification,&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner 2010" /&gt; RNApromo, CMFinder and TEISER are used in finding stable structural motifs in RNAs.&lt;ref name="Yao 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabani 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodarzi 2012" /&gt;

====Design considerations====
PCFG design impacts the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Any useful structure prediction probabilistic model based on PCFG has to maintain simplicity without much compromise to prediction accuracy. Too complex a model of excellent performance on a single sequence may not scale.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; A grammar based model should be able to:
* Find the optimal alignment between a sequence and the PCFG.
* Score the probability of the structures for the sequence and subsequences.
* Parameterize the model by training on sequences/structures.
* Find the optimal grammar parse tree (CYK algorithm).
* Check for ambiguous grammar (Conditional Inside algorithm).

The resulting of multiple parse trees per grammar denotes grammar ambiguity. This may be useful in revealing all possible base-pair structures for a grammar. However an optimal structure is the one where there is one and only one correspondence between the parse tree and the secondary structure.

Two types of ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree ambiguity and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity does not affect thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection is always on the basis of lowest free energy scores.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt; Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one.&lt;ref name="Sipser 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison 1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopcroft 1979" /&gt; In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique.&lt;ref name="Giegerich 2000" /&gt; Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

====Building a PCFG model====
A probabilistic context free grammar consists of terminal and nonterminal variables. Each feature to be modeled has a production rule that is assigned a probability estimated from a training set of RNA structures. Production rules are recursively applied until only terminal residues are left.

A starting non-terminal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{S}}&lt;/math&gt; produces loops. The rest of the grammar proceeds with parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{L}}&lt;/math&gt; that decide whether a loop is a start of a stem or a single stranded region {{mvar|s}} and parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{F}}&lt;/math&gt; that produces paired bases.

The formalism of this simple PCFG looks like:
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{S \to LS|L}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{L \to s | dFd}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{F \to dFd | LS}&lt;/math&gt;

The application of PCFGs in predicting structures is a multi-step process. In addition, the PCFG itself can be incorporated into probabilistic models that consider RNA evolutionary history or search homologous sequences in databases. In an evolutionary history context inclusion of prior distributions of RNA structures of a structural alignment in the production rules of the PCFG facilitates good prediction accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;

A summary of general steps for utilizing PCFGs in various scenarios:
 
* Generate production rules for the sequences.
* Check ambiguity.
* Recursively generate parse trees of the possible structures using the grammar. 
* Rank and score the parse trees for the most plausible sequence.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

====Algorithms====
Several algorithms dealing with aspects of PCFG based probabilistic models in RNA structure prediction exist. For instance the inside-outside algorithm and the CYK algorithm. The inside-outside algorithm is a recursive dynamic programming scoring algorithm that can follow [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]] paradigms. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. The inside part scores the subtrees from a parse tree and therefore subsequences probabilities given an PCFG. The outside part scores the probability of the complete parse tree for a full sequence.&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; CYK modifies the inside-outside scoring. Note that the term 'CYK algorithm' describes the CYK variant of the inside algorithm that finds an optimal parse tree for a sequence using a PCFG. It extends the actual [[CYK algorithm]] used in non-probabilistic CFGs.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

The inside algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\alpha(i,j,v)&lt;/math&gt; probabilities for all &lt;math&gt;i, j, v&lt;/math&gt;  of a parse subtree rooted at &lt;math&gt;W_v&lt;/math&gt; for subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_i,...,x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Outside algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\beta(i,j,v)&lt;/math&gt; probabilities of a complete parse tree for sequence {{mvar|x}} from root excluding the calculation of &lt;math&gt;x_i,...,x_j&lt;/math&gt;. The variables {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}} refine the estimation of probability parameters of an PCFG. It is possible to reestimate the PCFG algorithm by finding the expected number of times a state is used in a derivation through summing all the products of {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}} divided by the probability for a sequence {{mvar|x}} given the model &lt;math&gt;P(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. It is also possible to find the expected number of times a production rule is used by an expectation-maximization that utilizes the values of {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}}.&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; The CYK algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\gamma(i, j, v)&lt;/math&gt; to find the most probable parse tree &lt;math&gt;\hat{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; and yields &lt;math&gt;\log P(x, \hat{\pi}|\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

Memory and time complexity for general PCFG algorithms in RNA structure predictions are &lt;math&gt;O(L^2M)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(L^3M^3)&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Restricting a PCFG may alter this requirement as is the case with database searches methods.

====PCFG in homology search====
Covariance models (CMs) are a special type of PCFGs with applications in database searches for homologs, annotation and RNA classification. Through CMs it is possible to build PCFG-based RNA profiles where related RNAs can be represented by a consensus secondary structure.&lt;ref name ="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt; The RNA analysis package Infernal uses such profiles in inference of RNA alignments.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki 2013" /&gt; The Rfam database also uses CMs in classifying RNAs into families based on their structure and sequence information.&lt;ref name="Gardner 2010" /&gt;

CMs are designed from a consensus RNA structure. A CM allows [[indel]]s of unlimited length in the alignment. Terminals constitute states in the CM and the transition probabilities between the states is 1 if no indels are considered.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; Grammars in a CM are as follows:

:;         &lt;math&gt;P \to aWb&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of pairwise interactions between 16 possible pairs
:;         &lt;math&gt;L \to aW&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the left
:;         &lt;math&gt;R \to Wa&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the right
:;         &lt;math&gt;B \to SS&lt;/math&gt;:bifurcation with a probability of 1
:;         &lt;math&gt;S \to W&lt;/math&gt;:start with a probability of 1
:;         &lt;math&gt;E \to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;:end with a probability of 1

The model has 6 possible states and each state grammar includes different types of secondary structure probabilities of the non-terminals. The states are connected by transitions. Ideally current node states connect to all insert states and subsequent node states connect to non-insert states. In order to allow insertion of more than one base insert states connect to themselves.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

In order to score a CM model the inside-outside algorithms are used. CMs use a slightly different implementation of CYK. Log-odds emission scores for the optimum parse tree - &lt;math&gt;\log \hat{e}&lt;/math&gt; - are calculated out of the emitting states &lt;math&gt;P,~L,~R&lt;/math&gt;. Since these scores are a function of sequence length a more discriminative measure to recover an optimum parse tree probability score- &lt;math&gt;\log\text{P}(x, \hat{\pi}|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; - is reached by limiting the maximum length of the sequence to be aligned and calculating the log-odds relative to a null. The computation time of this step is linear to the database size and the algorithm has a memory complexity of &lt;math&gt;O(M_aD+M_bD^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

==== Example: Using evolutionary information to guide structure prediction ====
The KH-99 algorithm by Knudsen and Hein lays the basis of the Pfold approach to predicting RNA secondary structure.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; In this approach the parameterization requires evolutionary history information derived from an alignment tree in addition to probabilities of columns and mutations. The grammar probabilities are observed from a training dataset.

===== Estimate column probabilities for paired and unpaired bases =====
In a structural alignment the probabilities of the unpaired bases columns and the paired bases columns are independent of other columns. By counting bases in single base positions and paired positions one obtains the frequencies of  bases in loops and stems.
For basepair {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; is also counted as an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;YX&lt;/math&gt;. Identical basepairs such as &lt;math&gt;XX&lt;/math&gt; are counted twice.

===== Calculate mutation rates for paired and unpaired bases =====
By pairing sequences in all possible ways overall mutation rates are estimated. In order to recover plausible mutations a sequence identity threshold should be used so that the comparison is between similar sequences. This approach uses 85% identity threshold between pairing sequences. 
First single base positions differences -except for gapped columns- between sequence pairs are counted such that if the same position in two sequences had different bases {{mvar|X, Y}} the count of the difference is incremented for each sequence.

 {{nowrap|while &lt;math&gt;X\ne Y&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;        C_{\text{XY}} +1&lt;/math&gt; first sequence  pair}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;        C_{\text{YX}} +1&lt;/math&gt; second sequence pair}}

 {{nowrap|Calculate mutation rates.}}
                {{nowrap|Let  &lt;math&gt;r_{\text{XY}}= &lt;/math&gt; mutation of base X to base Y &lt;math&gt;= \frac {K~C_{\text{XY}}} {P_{x}P_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|Let  &lt;math&gt;r_{\text{XX}}= &lt;/math&gt; the negative of the rate of X mutation to other bases &lt;math&gt;= - \sum r_{\text{XY}}&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P_{s} =&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the base is not paired.}}

For unpaired bases a 4 X 4 mutation rate matrix is used that satisfies that the mutation flow from X to Y is reversible:&lt;ref name="Tavaré 1986" /&gt;
:                &lt;math&gt;PX^rXY = PY^rYX&lt;/math&gt; 
For basepairs a 16 X 16 rate distribution matrix is similarly generated.&lt;ref name="Muse 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schöniger  1994" /&gt;
The PCFG is used to predict the prior probability distribution of the structure whereas posterior probabilities are estimated by the inside-outside algorithm and the most likely structure is found by the CYK algorithm.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

===== Estimate alignment probabilities =====
After calculating the column prior probabilities the alignment probability is estimated by summing over all possible secondary structures. Any column {{mvar|C}}  in a secondary structure &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for a sequence {{mvar|D}} of length {{mvar|l}} such that &lt;math&gt;D=(C_1,~C_2, ...C_l )&lt;/math&gt; can be scored with respect to the alignment tree {{mvar|T}} and the mutational model {{mvar|M}}. The prior distribution given by the PCFG is &lt;math&gt;P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;. The phylogenetic tree, {{mvar|T}} can be calculated from the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Note that gaps are treated as unknown bases and the summation can be done through [[dynamic programming]].&lt;ref name="Baker 1979" /&gt; 
:       &lt;math&gt;P(D|T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P (D, \sigma |T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P(D|\sigma, T, M) P(\sigma|T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P(D|\sigma,T,M) P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Assign production probabilities to each rule in the grammar =====
Each structure in the grammar is assigned production probabilities devised from the structures of the training dataset. These prior probabilities give weight to predictions accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; The number of times each rule is used depends on the observations from the training dataset for that particular grammar feature. These probabilities are written in parenthesis in the grammar formalism and each rule will have a total of 100%.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; For instance:

:              &lt;math&gt; S \to LS (80\%) |L (20\%)&lt;/math&gt;
:              &lt;math&gt;L \to s (70\%) | dFd (30\%)&lt;/math&gt;
:              &lt;math&gt;F \to dFd (60.4\%)| LS (39.6\%)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Predict the structure likelihood =====
Given the prior alignment frequencies of the data the most likely structure from the ensemble predicted by the grammar can then be computed by maximizing &lt;math&gt;P(\sigma|D,T,M)&lt;/math&gt; through the CYK algorithm. The structure with the highest predicted number of correct predictions is reported as the consensus structure.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{MAP}= \arg\underset{\sigma}\max P(D| \sigma,T^ML, M) P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Pfold improvements on the KH-99 algorithm =====
PCFG based approaches are desired to be scalable and general enough. Compromising speed for accuracy needs to as minimal as possible. Pfold addresses the limitations of the KH-99 algorithm with respect to scalability, gaps, speed and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; 
*In Pfold gaps are treated as unknown. In this sense the probability of a gapped column equals that of an ungapped one. 
*In Pfold the tree {{mvar|T}} is calculated prior to structure prediction through neighbor joining and not by maximum likelihood through the PCFG grammar. Only the branch lengths are adjusted to maximum likelihood estimates. 
*An assumption of Pfold is that all sequences have the same structure. Sequence identity threshold and allowing a 1% probability that any nucleotide becomes another limit the performance deterioration due to alignment errors.

===Protein sequence analysis===
Whereas PCFGs have proved powerful tools for predicting RNA secondary structure, usage in the field of protein sequence analysis has been limited. Indeed, the size of the [[amino acid]] alphabet and the variety of interactions seen in proteins make grammar inference much more challenging.&lt;ref name="Searls D 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searls | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = Review: A primer in macromolecular linguistics | url = | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 99 | issue = 3| pages = 203–217 | doi=10.1002/bip.22101| pmid = 23034580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, most applications of [[formal language theory]] to protein analysis have been mainly restricted to the production of grammars of lower expressive power to model simple functional patterns based on local interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krogh | first1 = A | last2 = Brown | first2 = M | last3 = Mian | first3 = I | last4 = Sjolander | first4 = K | last5 = Haussler | first5 = D | year = 1994 | title = Hidden Markov models in computational biology: Applications to protein modeling | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 235 | issue = 5| pages = 1501–1531 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1994.1104 | pmid=8107089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sigrist | first1 = C | last2 = Cerutti | first2 = L | last3 = Hulo | first3 = N | last4 = Gattiker | first4 = A | last5 = Falquet | first5 = L | last6 = Pagni | first6 = M | last7 = Bairoch | first7 = A | last8 = Bucher | first8 = P | year = 2002 | title = PROSITE: a documented database using patterns and profiles as motif descriptors | url = | journal = Brief Bioinform | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 265–274 | doi=10.1093/bib/3.3.265 | pmid=12230035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since protein structures commonly display higher-order dependencies including nested and crossing relationships, they clearly exceed the capabilities of any CFG.&lt;ref name="Searls D 2013"/&gt; Still, development of PCFGs allows expressing some of those dependencies and providing the ability to model a wider range of protein patterns.

One of the main obstacles in inferring a protein grammar is the size of the alphabet that should encode the 20 different [[amino acids]]. It has been proposed to address this by using physico-chemical properties of [[amino acids]] to reduce significantly the number of possible combinations of right side symbols in production rules: 3 levels of a quantitative property are utilised instead of the 20 [[amino acid]] types, e.g. small, medium or large [[van der Waals volume]].&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyrka | first1 = W | last2 = Nebel | first2 = J-C | year = 2009 | title = A Stochastic Context Free Grammar based Framework for Analysis of Protein Sequences | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 323 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-10-323 | pmid=19814800 | pmc=2765975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on such a scheme, PCFGs have been produced to generate both [[binding site]] &lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"/&gt;  and helix-helix contact site descriptors.&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyrka | first1 = W | last2 = Nebel J-C | first2 = Kotulska M | year = 2013 | title = Probabilistic grammatical model of protein language and its application to helix-helix contact site classification | url = | journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 31 | doi=10.1186/1748-7188-8-31| pmid = 24350601 | pmc = 3892132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant feature of those grammars is that analysis of their rules and parse trees can provide biologically meaningful information.&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2013"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Rushworth was born in [[Madison, Maine|Madison]], [[Maine]] on October 9, 1924. He attended [[Madison Memorial High School]], where he was a class president for four years, graduating in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maineanencyclopedia.com/rushworth-robert-a/ Robert A. Rushworth background]&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[Hebron Academy]] (prep school) from which he graduated in June 1943, and joining the [[United States Army Air Forces]], he studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Maine]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] degree in 1951. He also received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[aeronautical engineering]] from the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] in 1954. In 1967, he graduated from the [[National War College]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalaviation.org/rushworth-robert/ Robert A. Rushworth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight experience===
In September 1944, Rushworth earned his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|pilot wings]] and a [[second lieutenant]] commission following his [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)#Aviation Cadet Program (USAAF), 1940–47|aviation cadet training program]] graduation. His first assignment was with the [[513th Air Control Group#Components|12th Combat Cargo Squadron]] in February 1945, in the [[China Burma India Theater|
China-Burma-India Theater of Operations]], where he flew [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] transport combat missions from [[India]] throughout the [[Burma]] Campaign and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando|C-46 Commandos]] over [[The Hump|the "Hump"]] in the [[Himalayas|Himalaya Mountains]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]]. After five years with the [[Military reserve force|Reserve]] and [[Air National Guard]], during which he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine, Rushworth was recalled to active duty in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/rushworth-robert-a/ Bio: Robert A. Rushworth]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Korean War]], Rushworth served as a [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80C Shooting Star]] pilot with the [[49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] at [[Dow Air Force Base]].

Following his graduation from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1954, Rushworth stayed at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. Among his duties was to serve at the Directorate of Flight and All-Weather Testing. There he specialized in the development and flight testing of experimental automatic flight control systems. He graduated from the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School]] (Class 56C) in 1957, flying [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101 Voodoo]]s, [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102 Delta Dagger]]s, [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]]s, [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]]s, [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106 Delta Dart]]s and other jet fighters. Rushworth was selected for the X-15 program in 1958. He made his first flight on November 4, 1960. Over the next six years, he made 34 flights in the [[North American X-15|X-15]], the most of any pilot. This included a flight to an altitude of 285,000 feet, made on June 27, 1963. This flight above 50 miles qualified Rushworth for [[Astronaut Badge#U.S. Air Force astronauts|Astronaut Wings]], though he would have attained that honor sooner had the USAF [[Man In Space Soonest]] project proceeded according to plan.

On a later X-15 flight, he was awarded a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for successfully landing a [[North American X-15]] after its nose wheel extended while flying at nearly [[Mach number|Mach]] 5. He made his final X-15 flight on July 1, 1966, then returned to regular Air Force duties. He attended [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] Combat Crew Training, and in March 1968 he was sent to [[Cam Ranh Bay Air Base]], [[Republic of Vietnam]], where he was Assistant Deputy Commander for Operations with the [[12th Tactical Fighter Wing]] and flew 189 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]].

Following his return from Vietnam, from April 1969 to January 1971, he was program director of the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] program and in February 1971 became Commander of the newly organized [[4950th Test Wing]], Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Rushworth then served as [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Inspector General]], Air Force Systems Command, [[Andrews Air Force Base]], [[Maryland]], from May 1973 to February 1974. He also served as the Commander of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], where his responsibilities included the major test programs, including the [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]], [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]] and [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]], and as the Commander of the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]].

At the time of his retirement as a [[Major General (United States)|Major General]], he was Vice Commander, Aeronautical Systems Division, [[Air Force Systems Command]], at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]], where he  dealt directly with senior deputies and managers and assisted the management of major acquisition programs such as the F-5, A-10, F-15, F-16 and B-1 as well as numerous modernization programs like the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] and [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5]].

'''Solid-state NMR''' ('''SSNMR''') spectroscopy is a kind of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy, characterized by the presence of anisotropic (directionally dependent) interactions.

==Introduction==

===Basic concepts===
A spin interacts with a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or an [[electric field]]. Spatial proximity and/or a [[chemical bond]] between two [[atom]]s can give rise to interactions between nuclei. In general, these interactions are orientation dependent. In media with no or little mobility (e.g. crystals, powders, large membrane vesicles, molecular aggregates), anisotropic interactions have a substantial influence on the behaviour of a system of nuclear spins. In contrast, in a classical liquid-state NMR experiment, [[Brownian motion]] leads to an averaging of anisotropic interactions. In such cases, these interactions can be neglected on the time-scale of the NMR experiment.

===Examples of anisotropic nuclear interactions===
Two directionally dependent interactions commonly found in solid-state NMR are the ''chemical shift anisotropy'' (CSA) and the internuclear ''dipolar coupling''. Many more such interactions exist, such as the anisotropic [[J-coupling]] in NMR, or in related fields, such as the ''g''-tensor in [[electron spin resonance]]. In mathematical terms, all these interactions can be described using the same formalism.

===Experimental background===
Anisotropic interactions modify the nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]] energy levels (and hence the resonance frequency) of all sites in a molecule, and often contribute to a line-broadening effect in NMR spectra. However, there is a range of situations when their presence can either not be avoided, or is even particularly desired, as they encode structural parameters, such as orientation information, on the molecule of interest.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Bruker MAS rotors.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bruker zirconia MAS rotors (left to right), 7 mm diameter for MAS up to 8 kHz, 4 mm for 18 kHz, 3.2 mm for 23 kHz, 2.5 mm for 35 kHz, 1.3 mm for 70 kHz. {{deletable image-caption|Friday, October 22, 2010|date=October 2010}}]] --&gt; 
High-resolution conditions in solids (in a wider sense) can be established using [[magic angle spinning|magic angle spinning (MAS)]], macroscopic sample orientation, combinations of both of these techniques, enhancement of mobility by highly viscous sample conditions, and a variety of [[radio frequency]] (RF) irradiation patterns. While the latter allows decoupling of interactions in spin space, the others facilitate averaging of interactions in real space. In addition, line-broadening effects from microscopic inhomogeneities can be reduced by appropriate methods of sample preparation.

Under decoupling conditions, isotropic interactions can report on the local structure, e.g. by the isotropic chemical shift. In addition, decoupled interactions can be selectively re-introduced ("recoupling"), and used, for example, for controlled de-phasing or transfer of polarization to derive a number of structural parameters.

===Solid-state NMR line widths===
The residual line width (full width at half max) of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei under MAS conditions at 5–15&amp;nbsp;kHz spinning rate is typically in the order of 0.5–2 ppm, and may be comparable to solution-state NMR conditions. Even at MAS rates of 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and above, however, non linear groups (not a straight line) of the same nuclei linked via the homonuclear dipolar interactions can only be suppressed partially, leading to line widths of 0.5 ppm and above, which is considerably more than in optimal [[solution state]] NMR conditions. Other interactions such as the quadrupolar interaction can lead to line widths of thousands of ppm due to the strength of the interaction. The first-order quadrupolar broadening is largely suppressed by sufficiently fast MAS, but the second-order quadrupolar broadening has a different angular dependence and cannot be removed by spinning at one angle alone. Ways to achieve isotropic lineshapes for quadrupolar nuclei include spinning at two angles simultaneously (DOR), sequentially ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109078070700198X DAS]), or through refocusing the second-order quadrupolar interaction with a two-dimensional experiment such as MQMAS or STMAS.

===Anisotropic interactions in solution-state NMR===
From the perspective of solution-state NMR, it can be desirable to reduce motional averaging of dipolar interactions by alignment media. The order of magnitude of these [[residual dipolar coupling]]s (RDCs) are typically of only a few rad/Hz, but do not destroy high-resolution conditions, and provide a pool of information, in particular on the orientation of molecular domains with respect to each other.

===Dipolar truncation===
The dipolar coupling between two nuclei is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance. This has the effect that the polarization transfer mediated by the dipolar interaction is cut off in the presence of a third nucleus (all of the same kind, e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) close to one of these nuclei. This effect is commonly referred to as dipolar truncation. It has been one of the major obstacles in efficient extraction of internuclear distances, which are crucial in the structural analysis of biomolecular structure. By means of labeling schemes or pulse sequences, however, it has become possible to circumvent this problem in a number of ways. Another way of circumventing dipolar truncation in case of rare nuclei like 13C is to study the systems at their natural isotopic abundance utilising DNP assisted solid-state NMR under magic-angle spinning, where the probability of finding a third spin is almost 100 times lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Märker|first=Katharina|last2=Pingret|first2=Morgane|last3=Mouesca|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Gasparutto|first4=Didier|last5=Hediger|first5=Sabine|last6=De Paëpe|first6=Gaël|date=2015-11-04|title=A New Tool for NMR Crystallography: Complete 13C/15N Assignment of Organic Molecules at Natural Isotopic Abundance Using DNP-Enhanced Solid-State NMR|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=137|issue=43|pages=13796–13799|doi=10.1021/jacs.5b09964|pmid=26485326|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear spin interactions in the solid phase==
&lt;!-- Magnitude of interaction... --&gt;

===Chemical shielding===
The chemical shielding is a local property of each nucleus, and depends on the external magnetic field.

Specifically, the external magnetic field induces currents of the electrons in molecular orbitals.  These induced currents create local magnetic fields that often vary across the entire molecular framework such that nuclei in distinct molecular environments usually experience unique local fields from this effect.

Under sufficiently fast [[magic angle spinning]], or in solution-state NMR, the directionally dependent character of the [[chemical shielding]] is removed, leaving the isotropic [[chemical shift]].

===J-coupling===
The [[J-coupling]] or [[indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling]] (sometimes also called "scalar" coupling despite the fact that '''J''' is a tensor quantity) describes the interaction of nuclear spins through [[chemical bonds]].

===Dipolar coupling===
''Main article:'' [[Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction|Dipolar coupling (NMR)]]
[[Image:SSNMR dip coupl vect.png|thumb|Dipolar coupling vectors|150px|right|Dipolar coupling vectors]]
Nuclear spins exhibit a [[Nuclear magnetic moment|dipole moment]], which interacts with the dipole moment of other nuclei ([[dipolar coupling]]). The magnitude of the interaction is dependent on the spin species, the internuclear distance, and the orientation of the vector connecting the two nuclear spins with respect to the external magnetic field ''B'' (see figure). The maximum dipolar coupling is given by the dipolar coupling constant ''d'',
: &lt;math&gt; d = \frac{\hbar \mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\gamma_1 \gamma_2}{r^3} &lt;/math&gt;,
where r is the distance between the nuclei, and γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[gyromagnetic ratio]]s of the nuclei. In a strong magnetic field, the dipolar coupling depends on the orientation of the internuclear vector with the external magnetic field by
: &lt;math&gt;D \propto 3\cos^2\theta - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
Consequently, two nuclei with a dipolar coupling vector at an angle of θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=54.7° to a strong external magnetic field, which is the angle where D becomes zero, have zero dipolar coupling. θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is called the [[magic angle]]. One technique for removing dipolar couplings, at least to some extent, is [[magic angle spinning]].

===Quadrupolar interaction===
Nuclei with a spin greater than one-half have a non spherical charge distribution.  This is known as a quadrupolar nucleus.  A non spherical charge distribution can interact with an electric field gradient caused by some form of non-symmetry (e.g. in a trigonal bonding atom there are electrons around it in a plane, but not above or below it) to produce a change in the energy level in addition to the [[Zeeman effect]].  The quadrupolar interaction is the largest interaction in NMR apart from the Zeeman interaction and they can even become comparable in size.
Due to the interaction being so large it can not be treated to just the first order, like most of the other interactions.  This means you have a first and second order interaction, which can be treated separately.  The first order interaction has an angular dependency with respect to the magnetic field of &lt;math&gt;(3\cos^2\theta - 1)&lt;/math&gt; (the P2 [[Legendre polynomial]]), this means that if you spin the sample at &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (~54.74°) you can average out the first order interaction over one rotor period (all other interactions apart from Zeeman, Chemical shift, paramagnetic and J coupling also have this angular dependency).  However, the second order interaction depends on the P4 Legendre polynomial, which has zero points at 30.6° and 70.1°.  These can be taken advantage of by either using DOR (DOuble angle Rotation) where you spin at two angles at the same time, or [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109078070700198X DAS (Double Angle Spinning)] where you switch quickly between the two angles. Specialized hardware (probe) has been developed for such experiments. A revolutionary advance is [[Lucio Frydman]]'s multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR in 1995 and it has become a routine method for obtaining high resolution solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Frydman Lucio |author2=Harwood John S | year = 1995 | title = Isotropic Spectra of Half-Integer Quadrupolar Spins from Bidimensional Magic-Angle Spinning NMR | url = | journal = J.

''See also:'' [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] or [[NMR spectroscopy]] articles for an account on discoveries in NMR and NMR spectroscopy in general.

''History of discoveries of NMR phenomena, and the development of solid-state NMR spectroscopy:''

Purcell, Torrey and Pound: "nuclear induction" on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H in paraffin 1945, at about the same time Bloch ''et al.'' on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H in water.

==Modern solid-state NMR spectroscopy==
''Methods and techniques''

===Basic example===
[[Image:Cross-polarization.png|thumb|Cross-polarization pulse sequence|200px|right|CP pulse sequence]]
A fundamental RF pulse sequence and building-block in most solid-state NMR experiments starts with cross-polarization (CP) [Waugh ''et al.'']. It can be used to enhance the signal of nuclei with a low gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) by magnetization transfer from nuclei with a high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H), or as spectral editing method (e.g. directed &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N→&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C CP in protein spectroscopy). To establish magnetization transfer, the RF pulses applied on the two frequency channels must fulfill the Hartmann–Hahn condition [Hartmann, 1962], that is, the Larmor frequencies in both rf fields must be identical.  Experimental optimization of such conditions is one of the routine tasks in performing a (solid-state) NMR experiment.

CP-MAS is a basic building block of most pulse sequences in solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Given its importance, a pulse sequence employing direct excitation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H spin polarization, followed by CP transfer to and signal detection of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N or similar nuclei, is itself often referred to as ''CP experiment'', or, in conjunction with MAS, as ''CP-MAS'' [Schaefer and Stejskal, 1976]. It is the typical starting point of an investigation using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

===Decoupling===
Spin interactions must be removed ([[Nuclear magnetic resonance decoupling|decoupled]]) to increase the resolution of NMR spectra and isolate spin systems.

A technique that can substantially reduce or remove the chemical shift anisotropy, the dipolar coupling is ''sample rotation'' (most commonly [[magic angle spinning]], but also [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109078070700198X off-magic angle spinning]).

''Homonuclear RF decoupling''  decouples spin interactions of nuclei that are the same as those being detected.  ''Heteronuclear RF decoupling'' decouples spin interactions of other nuclei.

===Recoupling===

Although the broadened lines are often not desired, dipolar couplings between atoms in the crystal lattice can also provide very useful information.  Dipolar coupling are distance dependent, and so they may be used to calculate interatomic distances in isotopically labeled molecules.

Because most dipolar interactions are removed by sample spinning, recoupling experiments are needed to re-introduce desired dipolar couplings so they can be measured.

An example of a recoupling experiment is the Rotational Echo DOuble Resonance (REDOR) experiment&lt;ref name=REDOR&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
which also can be the basis of an [[NMR crystallography|NMR crystallographic]] study of e.g. an amorphous solid.

===Protons in solid-state NMR===

In contrast to traditional approaches particular in protein NMR, in which the broad lines associated with protons effectively relegate this nucleus to mixing of magnetization, recent developments of hardware (very fast MAS) and reduction of dipolar interactions by deuteration have made protons as versatile as they are in solution NMR. This includes spectral dispersion in multi-dimensional experiments&lt;ref name=Protons&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==

===Biology===
[[Membrane protein]]s and [[amyloid]] fibrils, the latter related to [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are two examples of application where solid-state NMR spectroscopy complements [[Protein NMR|solution-state NMR spectroscopy]] and beam diffraction methods (e.g. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy). Solid-state NMR structure elucidation of proteins has traditionally been based on secondary chemical shifts and spatial contacts between heteronuclei. Currently, paramagnetic contact shifts&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite journal

===Chemistry===
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy serves as an analysis tool in organic and inorganic chemistry, where is used as a valuable tool to study local dynamics, kinetics, and thermodynamics of a variety of systems.

Objects of SSNMR studies in materials science are inorganic/organic aggregates in crystalline and amorphous states, composite materials, heterogeneous systems including liquid or gas components, suspensions, and molecular aggregates with dimensions on the nanoscale.

In many cases, NMR is the uniquely applicable method for measurement of porosity, particularly for porous systems containing partially filled pores or for dual-phase systems. SSNMR is one of the most effective technique for molecular-level investigation of interfaces.&lt;ref name=adma.201605895&gt;{{cite journal |title=Understanding Surface and Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Nanomaterials via Solid-State NMR|author1= A.

Studies of solids by NMR relaxation experiments are special issues based on the following general statements. The experimental decay of macroscopic transverse or longitudinal magnetization follows the exponential law for complete domination of the spin-diffusion mechanism and a single relaxation time characterizes all of the nuclei in rigid solids, even those that are not chemically or structurally equivalent. The spin-diffusion mechanism is typical of systems with nuclei experiencing strong dipolar interactions (protons, fluorine or phosphorus nuclei at relatively small concentrations of paramagnetic centers). For other nuclei with weak dipolar coupling and/or at high concentration of paramagnetic centers, relaxation can be non-exponential following a stretched exponential function, exp(–(τ/T1)&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;) or exp(–(τ/T2)&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;). For paramagnetic solids, the β value of 0.5 corresponds to relaxation via direct electron–nucleus dipolar interactions without spin diffusion, while intermediate values between 0.5 and 1.0 can be attributed to a diffusion-limited mechanism.

NMR can also be applied to art conservation. Different salts and moisture levels can be detected through the use of solid state NMR. However, sampling sizes retrieved from works of art in order to run through these large conducting magnets typically exceed levels deemed acceptable. Unilateral NMR techniques use portable magnets that are applied to the object of interest, bypassing the need for sampling. As such, unilateral NMR techniques prove to be useful in the art conservation world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s00216-009-3128-7|pmid = 19787343|title = Unilateral NMR applied to the conservation of works of art|journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume = 396|issue = 1|pages = 213–220|year = 2009|last1 = Del Federico|first1 = Eleonora|last2 = Centeno|first2 = Silvia A|last3 = Kehlet|first3 = Cindie|last4 = Currier|first4 = Penelope|last5 = Stockman|first5 = Denise|last6 = Jerschow|first6 = Alexej}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers''' ('''TWINS''') are a pair of [[NASA]] instruments aboard two [[United States]] [[National Reconnaissance Office]] [[satellite]]s in [[Molniya orbit]]s. TWINS was designed to provide stereo images of the Earth's [[ring current]]. The first instrument, '''TWINS-1''', was launched aboard [[USA-184]] on 28 June 2006. '''TWINS-2''' followed aboard [[USA-200]] on March 13, 2008.

Each instrument consists of an [[energetic neutral atom]] imager and a [[Lyman alpha]] detector. The ENA imager provides indirect remote sensing of the ring current ions, and the Lyman alpha detector gives a measure of the neutral hydrogen cloud about the Earth, known as the [[geocorona]]. The TWINS prime mission lasted two years, from 2008 to 2010, and has been followed by an extended mission which is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/twins-5years.html|title=Five Years of Stereo Imaging for NASA's TWINS|last=Zell|first=Holly|date=2013-06-24|work=NASA|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Launched as [[mission of opportunity|missions of opportunity]] aboard classified, non-NASA U.S. government spacecraft, TWINS conducts [[stereoscopic]] imaging of Earth's [[magnetosphere]].&lt;!--cleanup needed from here to end--&gt; By imaging the charge exchange neutral atoms over a broad energy range (~1-100 keV) using two identical instruments on two widely spaced high-altitude, high-inclination spacecraft, TWINS enables the 3-dimensional visualization and the resolution of large scale structures and dynamics within the magnetosphere for the first time. In contrast to traditional space experiments, which make measurements at only one point in space, imaging experiments provide simultaneous viewing of different regions of the magnetosphere. Stereo imaging, as done by TWINS, takes the next step of producing 3-D images, and provides a leap ahead in our understanding of the global aspects of the terrestrial magnetosphere.

The ENA imagers observe energetic neutrals produced from the global magnetospheric ion population, over an energy range of 1 to 100 keV with high angular (4-degree) and time (about 1-minute) resolution. A [[Lyman-alpha]] geocoronal imager is used  to monitor cold exospheric hydrogen atoms that produce ENAs from ions via [[charge exchange]]. Complementing these imagers are detectors that measure the local charged particle environment around the spacecraft.

The offset in the orbital phases (apogees at different times) of TWINS 1 and TWINS 2 means that in addition to stereo ENA imaging for several hours twice per day, the two TWINS instruments also obtain essentially continuous magnetospheric observations.

The TWINS instrumentation is essentially the same as the MENA instrument on the [[IMAGE]] spacecraft. This instrumentation consists of a neutral atom imager covering the ~1-100 keV energy range with 4°x4° angular resolution and 1-minute time resolution, and a simple Lyman-alpha imager to monitor the geocorona.

TWINS provides stereo imaging of the Earth's magnetosphere, the region surrounding the planet controlled by its magnetic field and containing the Van Allen radiation belts and other energetic charged particles. TWINS enables three-dimensional global visualization of this region, leading to greatly enhanced understanding of the connections between different regions of the magnetosphere and their relation to the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2008-03-13 |title=Missions - TWINS A &amp; B - NASA Science |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |url=https://science.nasa.gov/missions/twins/ |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and storm events==
[[Image:Twinssr FirstLight.jpg|thumb|right|alt=First Stereo ENA Image. This is a first-light stereo ENA image of the terrestrial ring current obtained by TWINS on 15 June 2008 for 10 keV energy. Visible in each image are both low-altitude emissions (LAE) from precipitating ions, and high-altitude ring current emissions (RCE). For reference, the Earth's limb is drawn in, along with dipole magnetic field lines at four cardinal local times (noon=red, dusk=lavender, midnight, and dawn) and two L-values (L=4 and L=8).]]
Routine stereo imaging by TWINS began on 15 June 2008, during an extremely weak geomagnetic storm whose [[Dst index]] never fell below -40 nT, as compared to a nominal Dst of -100 nT for classification as a storm.  During the TWINS prime mission (2008–2010), an extended and unprecedented solar minimum (from solar cycle 23) prevailed, bringing with it very calm magnetospheric conditions ranging from dead quiet to mildly disturbed.  During this time period TWINS observed numerous weak storms, roughly once every 27 days (corresponding to the solar rotation period and triggered by solar corotating interaction regions (CIRs).  The strongest storm (which was still very mild) observed by TWINS during its prime mission was on 22 July 2009, with Dst reaching a moderate -79 nT.  Throughout these extended quiet conditions TWINS images contained ENA signals from both high-altitude (ring current) and low-altitude emission (LAE) regions.

The TWINS Mission of Opportunity maintains a library of selected storm events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TWINS Geomagnetic Storm Catalog |url=http://auburn.edu/cosam/twins/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tropenhaus''' ({{lang-en|Tropic House}}) in [[Frutigen]], Switzerland, is a commercial project using [[geothermal energy]] from hot water flowing out of the [[Lötschberg Base Tunnel|Lötschberg base tunnel]] for the production of [[Introduced species|exotic]] fruit, [[sturgeon]] meat and [[caviar]] in a tropical [[greenhouse]] in the [[Swiss alps]].&lt;ref name="Swissinfo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/Alpine_caviar_and_papayas_come_to_Switzerland.html?siteSect=107&amp;sid=10149999|title=Alpine caviar and papayas come to Switzerland|last=Ochsenbein|first=Gaby|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=[[Swissinfo]]|accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the project received the ''Prix Evenir'', the Swiss petroleum industry's [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 50,000 award for sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Tagi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sc.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/schweiz/747010.html|title=Preis fürs Tropenhaus Frutigen|date=2 May 2007|publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''vaquita''' ({{IPA-es|baˈkita|lang}}; ''Phocoena sinus'') is a species of [[porpoise]] [[endemic]] to the northern part of the [[Gulf of California]] that is on the brink of extinction. Based on beached skulls found in 1950 and 1951, the scientific description of the species was published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://swfsc.noaa.gov/uploadedFiles/VaquitaFactSheet.Version3a.pdf|title=Vaquita Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=NOAA Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science Center|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2018 only about 12-15 individuals remain.

==Description==
Vaquitas are the smallest and most endangered species of the infraorder Cetacea and are endemic to the northern end of the Gulf of California. The vaquita is somewhat stocky and has a characteristic porpoise shape. The species is distinguishable by the dark rings surrounding their eyes, patches on their lips, and a line that extends from their dorsal fins to their mouths. Their backs are a dark grey that fades to white undersides. As vaquitas mature, the shades of grey lighten.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;{{cite web

The lifespan, pattern of growth, seasonal reproduction, and testes size of the vaquita are all similar to that of the [[harbour porpoise]].&lt;ref name="Hohn1996"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hohn | first1 = A.

The skull is smaller and the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] is shorter and broader than in other members of the genus.

==Behavior==
Vaquitas use high-pitched sounds to communicate with one another and for [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|echolocation]] to navigate through their habitats. They generally feed and swim at a leisurely pace. Vaquitas avoid boats and are very evasive. They rise to breathe with a slow, forward motion and then disappear quickly. This lack of activity at the surface makes them difficult to observe.&lt;ref name = NOAA_Vaquita/&gt; Vaquitas are usually alone unless they are accompanied by a calf,&lt;ref name=Vaquita2&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Vaquita| url= http://www.savethevaquita.org/|date=January 2014|publisher= Save The Vaquita Project|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning they are less social than other porpoise species.

===Schooling===
Like other ''[[Phocoena]]'', vaquitas are usually seen singly. If they are seen together, it is usually in small groups of two or three individuals.&lt;ref name=barlow /&gt; Less often, groups around ten have been observed, with the most ever seen at once being 40 individuals.{{citation needed|date= March 2016}}

===Diet===
Vaquitas tend to forage near lagoons.&lt;ref name= barlow /&gt; All of the 17 fish species found in vaquita stomachs can be classified as [[demersal]] and or [[benthic]] species inhabiting relatively shallow water in the upper [[Gulf of California]]. Vaquitas appear to be rather non-selective feeders on crustaceans, small fish, octopuses and [[squid]] in this area.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name = NOAA_Vaquita /&gt; Some of the most common prey are [[teleost]]s (fish with bony skeletons) such as [[Haemulidae|grunt]]s, [[Sciaenidae|croaker]]s, and [[sea trout]].&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rice | first = Danielle | title = About the Vaquita: An Endangered Animal | work = Vaquita: An Endangered Species | publisher = | date = 2 May 2011 | url = http://www.cgdsite.com/ricedanielle/cc_site/about.html | accessdate = 20 January 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192355/http://www.cgdsite.com/ricedanielle/cc_site/about.html | archivedate = 29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[cetacea]]ns, vaquitas may use echolocation to locate prey,&lt;ref name = "Silber1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Silber | first = G.

===Life cycle and reproduction===
[[File:Vaquita6 Olson NOAA.jpg|thumb|Vaquita pair]]
Little is known about the life cycle of vaquitas. Age at sexual maturity, longevity, reproductive cycle and population dynamics estimates have been made, but further research is needed. Most of these estimates come from vaquitas that have been stranded or caught in nets. Some are based on other porpoise species similar to vaquitas.

Vaquitas are estimated to live about 20 years in ideal conditions.&lt;ref name="Rojas1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rojas-Bracho|first1=L.|last2=Reeves|first2=R.

Reproduction occurs during late spring or early summer. Their gestation period is between 10 and 11 months. They have seasonal reproduction, and usually have one calf in March. The inter-birth period, or elapsed time between offspring birth, is between 1 and 2 years. The young are then nursed for about 6 to 8 months until they are capable of fending for themselves.&lt;ref name="JeffersonWebber2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Thomas A. |last1= Jefferson|first2= Marc A. |last2= Webber| first3= Robert L. |last3= Pitman|title=Marine Mammals of the World: A Comprehensive Guide to Their Identification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IY2n07t7QYC&amp;pg=PA288|date=29 August 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn= 978-0-08-055784-7|pages= 288–289|oclc= 326418543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The habitat of the vaquita is restricted to the northern area of the Gulf of California, or Sea of Cortez.&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; They live in shallow, murky [[lagoon]]s along [[shoreline]]s. They rarely swim deeper than {{convert|30|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} and are known to survive in lagoons so shallow that their backs protrude above the surface. The vaquita is most often sighted in water {{convert|11|to|50|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep, {{convert|11|to|25|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from the coast, over silt and clay bottoms. They tend to choose habitats with [[Turbidity|turbid]] waters, because they have high nutrient content,&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; which is important because it attracts the small fish, squid, and crustaceans on which they feed. They are able to withstand the significant temperature fluctuations characteristic of shallow, turbid waters and lagoons.

==Conservation==
The vaquita is considered the most endangered of 129 extant marine mammal species.&lt;ref name="Pompa2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pompa | first1 = S. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = P. R. | last3 = Ceballos | first3 = G. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101525108 | title = Global distribution and conservation of marine mammals | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]| volume = 108 | issue = 33 | pages = 13600–13605| date = 16 August 2011| pmid =  | pmc = 3158205}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been classified as one of the top 100 [[EDGE species|evolutionary distinct and globally endangered]] (EDGE) mammals in the world.&lt;ref name="barlow"/&gt; The vaquita is an evolutionarily distinct animal and has no close relatives. These animals represent more, proportionally, of the tree of life than other species, meaning they are top priority for conservation campaigns. The [[EDGE of Existence Programme]] is a conservation effort that attempts to help conserve endangered animals that represent large portions of their evolutionary trees. The U.S. government has listed the vaquita as endangered under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. It is also listed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] and the [[CITES]] in the category at most critical risk of extinction.

===Population decline===
[[File:Vaquita3 Olson NOAA.jpg|thumb|A vaquita swims in the foreground while fishing boats ply their trade in the distance.]]
Vaquitas have never been hunted directly, but their population is declining, largely because of animals becoming trapped in illegal [[gillnet]]s intended for capturing the [[totoaba]], a large critically endangered fish of the [[Sciaenidae|drum family]] endemic to the Gulf. A trade in totoaba swim bladders has arisen, driven by demand from China (where they are used in soup, being considered a delicacy and also erroneously thought to have medicinal value&lt;ref name="Morell2017" /&gt;), which is greatly exacerbating the problem.&lt;ref name="cirva2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "CIRVA-V" /&gt;

In early May 2016, the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|IUCN SSC]] – Cetacean Specialist Group reported that the vaquita population had dipped to around 60 remaining individuals in 2015. This represents a 92% decline from the 1997 population level. In March 2016 alone, at least three vaquitas drowned after being entangled in gillnets set for totoaba.&lt;ref name="may2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanders|first1=Natalie|title=Stronger protection needed to prevent imminent extinction of Mexican porpoise vaquita, new survey finds|url=http://www.iucn-csg.org/index.php/2016/05/14/stronger-protection-needed-to-prevent-imminent-extinction-of-mexican-porpoise-vaquita-new-survey-finds/|accessdate=16 May 2016|work=www.iucn-csg.org|publisher=[[IUCN Species Survival Commission]]|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that the gillnet ban would need to be extended indefinitely, with more effective enforcement, if the vaquita is to have any chance of long term survival. Otherwise, the species is likely to become extinct within 5 years.&lt;ref name="may2016" /&gt;

By November 2016, according to a report released in February 2017, the population had declined to about 30, and it was judged that capture of some of the remaining vaquitas and conducting a captive breeding program within a secure sanctuary was the only remaining hope for survival.&lt;ref name = "Braulik2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "CIRVA-8" /&gt; This is despite the fact that porpoises generally fare poorly in captivity.&lt;ref name = "Greenpeace2017-02-02" /&gt; However, the head of the Mexican environmental agency asserted in July 2017 that at least 100 individuals remain.&lt;ref&gt;The Mexico News Daily. 2017. [http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/more-vaquitas-remain-than-thought-profepa/ More vaquitas remain than thought: Profepa]. Retrieved on July 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2018, an interview with the watchdog group Elephant Action League revealed that based on recordings of vaquita calls from multiple sources, there were likely only a dozen remaining vaquita in the region. According to the interview, despite the recent efforts to curb poaching, dozens of poachers have still been seen fishing every night. It remains unlikely that the population will survive the next totoaba fishing season, which began around the same time the interview was released.&lt;ref name = "Monga2018.03" /&gt; In response to the endangerment of the vaquita, a federal judge ordered President [[Donald Trump]] to ban the import of gillnet-harvested seafood from the Gulf of California into the [[United States]] later in the year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/science/vaquitas-endangered-porpoise.html|title=Scientists Catch Rare Glimpses of the Endangered Vaquita|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey later in 2018 sighted 6-7 vaquita, possibly about half of the species' current population. However, renewing hopes for the species was the sighting of "Ana", a female vaquita previously seen with a newborn calf in 2017. "Ana" was also seen with another calf in the 2018 survey, indicating that the small population still has the ability to sustain itself, and that the reproduction rate of the species may be annual rather than biennial as thought before. However, acoustic studies have indicated that only about 15 individuals still exist in a very small rectangular area about 12 by 25 miles; a reduction of about 86% of the species' historic range.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/c444c22a4cb9490590f205fe6601e918|title=Experts urge gulf refuge for endangered vaquita porpoise|date=2018-10-17|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary threats ===
[[File:Vaquita2 Olson NOAA.jpg|thumb|Vaquitas have dark eye rings.]]
Accidental drowning in gillnets set by fishermen meant for catching totoaba is the primary cause of anthropogenic, incidental mortality for the vaquita. Three fishing villages in the northern Gulf of California are primarily involved in the totoaba fishery and, as a result, most directly involved in threats to the vaquita. San Felipe, in Baja California, and Golfo de Santa Clara and Puerto Peñasco, in Sonora, have a total population of approximately 61,000. Up to 80% of the economy in these towns is associated with the fishing industry. A total of 1771 vessels make up the artisanal fleet that have permits to fish with nets, with the total size of the commercial fishery unknown due to the extent of the black market for totoaba.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Program For the Conservation of the Species''. United Mexican States Federal Government, 2008, pp. 1–76, ''Action Program For the Conservation of the Species''.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3,000 individuals are involved in the totoaba industry overall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pitman, Robert L.; Rojas-Bracho, Lorenzo (July–August 2007). [http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/0707/0707_feature2.html "How Now, Little Cow?"]. ''Natural History''.&lt;/ref&gt; The total economic impact of the industry for the region is estimated to be approximately $5.4 million USD annually, or $78.5 million Pesos. Socioeconomic surveys of the northern Gulf have suggested that approximately $25 million, if invested in the region through education, equipment buyout, and job placement, could end the vaquita bycatch problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies performed in El Golfo de Santa Clara, one of the three major ports in which vaquitas live, indicated that gillnet fishing caused about 39 vaquita deaths a year in the late 1990s. This was close to 17% of the whole vaquita population within this port. While these results were not taken from the entire range of habitat in which vaquitas live, it is reasonable to assume that these results can be applied to the whole vaquita population, and in fact may even be a little low.&lt;ref name="D'agrosa2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = d'Agrosa | first1 = C. | last2 = Lennert-Cody | first2 = C.

As many as a third of the area's fishermen are thought to still be using gillnets despite the imposition of bans on their use.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Fourth Meeting of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA)''. CIRVA, 2011, pp. 1–47, ''Report of the Fourth Meeting of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trawl nets commonly used to catch shrimp in the area may also present threats due to their impacts on the Gulf's ecosystem, either directly through bycatch or by indirectly altering the seafloor and associated species (including vaquita prey).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Other potential threats to the vaquita population include habitat alterations and pollutants. The habitat of the vaquita is small and the food supply in marine environments is affected by water quality and nutrient levels. The damming of the [[Colorado River#Course|upper Colorado River]] has reduced the flow of fresh water into the gulf, though there is no empirical evidence that the reduced flow from the Upper Colorado River has posed an immediate short-term risk to the species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rojas-Bracho, Lorenzo; Reeves, Randall R.; Jaramillo-Legorreta, Armando (2006). "Conservation of the vaquita Phocoena sinus". ''Mammal Review''. 36, No. 3: 179–216 – via JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the use of chlorinated pesticides may also have a detrimental effect. Despite these possible problems, most of the recovered bodies of vaquitas show no signs of emaciation or environmental stressors,&lt;ref name="Rojas1" /&gt; implying that the decline is due almost solely to [[bycatch]]. However, these additional hazards may pose a long-term threat.

A 2018 interview indicated that the illegal fishermen may be waiting for the species to go extinct in order to fish with fewer restrictions.&lt;ref name = "Monga2018.03" /&gt;

=== Secondary impact of declining numbers ===
Though the major cause of vaquita porpoise mortality is bycatch in gillnets, as numbers continue to dwindle, new problems will arise that will tend to make recovery more difficult. One such problem is reduced breeding rates. With fewer individuals in the habitat, less contact will occur between the sexes and consequently less reproduction. This may be followed by increased inbreeding and reduced [[genetic variability]] in the [[gene pool]], following the [[population bottleneck|bottleneck effect]].

When [[inbreeding depression]] occurs, the population experiences reduced [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] because [[Mutation#By effect on fitness|deleterious]] [[recessive genes]] can manifest in the population. In small populations where genetic variability is low, individuals are more genetically similar. When the genomes of mating pairs are more similar, recessive traits appear more often in offspring. The more related two individuals are in the breeding pair, the more deleterious [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous genes]] the offspring will likely have which can greatly lower fitness in the offspring.&lt;ref name = "CIRVA"&gt;CIRVA committee, [http://www.iucn-csg.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Report-of-the-Fourth-Meeting-of-the-International-Committee-for-the-Recovery-of-Vaquita.pdf Report of the Fourth Meeting of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA)]. [[IUCN]]. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These secondary impacts of dwindling vaquita numbers are not necessarily a threat yet, but they will become problematic if the population continues to decline.&lt;ref name="Rojas-Bracho1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rojas-Bracho | first1 = L. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = B. L. | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00873.x | title = Risk factors affecting the vaquita (''Phocoena sinus'')| journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 974–989 | date = October 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because porpoise population growth rates are generally low, the vaquita population is unlikely to recover rapidly even after the removal of anthropogenic risk factors to their survival. By some estimates, the maximum potential growth rate for the species is under 4%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the sighting of a female with a newborn calf in 2017 and the same female with another newborn in 2018 indicates that the species may have a relatively faster annual growth rate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Ecological consequences===
Removal of the vaquita will have a significant ecological impact on the northern Gulf of California. The Gulf of California is considered a [[large marine ecosystem]], due to its high [[species diversity]] and large habitat size.&lt;ref name="DiazUribe2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Díaz-Uribe | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Arreguín-Sánchez | first2 = F. | last3 = Lercari-Bernier | first3 = D. | last4 = Cruz-Escalona | first4 = V. C. H. | last5 = Zetina-Rejón | first5 = M.

Sharks have been determined to be the only predators of vaquitas. Because of its limited number of predator species, the vaquita population is sensitive to small changes in predation from sharks.&lt;ref name="DiazUribe2012"/&gt; Although the vaquita accounts for only a small percentage of the diets of sharks in the region, extinction of the vaquita could potentially cause negative effects on shark population sizes. Extinction of the vaquita may also impact the vaquita prey populations in the northern Gulf ecosystem. The disappearance of the vaquita could lead to potential [[over-population]] of their prey species such as benthic fishes, squid, and crustaceans.&lt;ref name="Rojas1" /&gt;

Conservation efforts for the vaquita are mainly focused on fishing restrictions to prevent their bycatch. These fishing restrictions could prove beneficial for the fish in the upper Gulf, as well as the vaquita. As a result of increased restrictions on gillnet use, the populations of the targeted fish and shrimp species will receive protection from overfishing.&lt;ref name="Elton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elton|first=Catherine|title=Safety Net|journal=Audubon|date=November–December 2011|volume=113|issue=6|pages=74–80|url=http://www.audubonmagazine.org/articles/conservation/safety-net-0|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, numerous [[Commercial fishing|commercially fished]] species have experienced devastating impacts due to overfishing, and the vaquita conservation program may lessen the severity of such devastation in the future.&lt;ref name="Elton" /&gt; Another solution to prevent vaquita bycatch might be to redesign [[fishing nets]], which could be used to effectively catch fish, but leave the vaquita untouched.

=== Recovery efforts ===
Because vaquitas are endemic to the Gulf of California, [[Mexico]] is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat.&lt;ref name="barlow"/&gt; CIRVA has worked with the CITES, the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]], and the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] to make a plan to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves.&lt;ref name = NOAA_Vaquita&gt;{{cite web|title= Vaquita / Gulf of California Harbor Porpoise / Cochito (''Phocoena sinus'')|url= http://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/porpoises/vaquita.html|publisher=NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources|work= Species Information|date= 8 July 2013|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. To try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the [[Colorado River delta]]. CIRVA recommends that this reserve be extended southwards to cover the full known area of the vaquita's range and that trawlers be completely banned from the reserve area.

On 28 October 2008, Canada, Mexico, and the United States launched the North American Conservation Action Plan (NACAP) for the vaquita, under the jurisdiction of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a NAFTA environmental organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cec.org/our-work/projects/recovering-vaquita-and-promoting-sustainable-local-livelihoods|title=Recovering the Vaquita and Promoting Sustainable Local Livelihoods: Project Summary|publisher=Commission for Environmental Cooperation|year=2011|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NACAP is a strategy to support Mexico's efforts to recover the vaquita. Also in 2008, Mexico launched the program PACE-VAQUITA, another effort to help preserve the species. PACE-VAQUITA compensates fishermen who choose one of three alternatives: rent-out, switch-out, and buy-out.

In the rent-out option, fishermen acquire temporary contractual obligations to carry out conservation efforts. They are paid if they agree to terminate their fishing inside the vaquita refuge area. There is a penalty if fishermen breach the contract which includes getting their vessels taken by the government. The switch-out option provides fishermen with compensation for switching to vaquita-safe harvesting technology. Finally, the buy-back program compensates fisherman for permanently turning in their fishing permits, as well as their respective gear.&lt;ref name="Gerrodette2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gerrodette | first1 = T. | last2 = Rojas-Bracho | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00449.x | title = Estimating the success of protected areas for the vaquita, ''Phocoena sinus'' | journal = Marine Mammal Science| volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = E101–E125 | date = 7 February 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, because of how few fisherman were enrolling in the switch-out option, PACE Vaquita added a yearly, short-term option for fishermen, letting them simply rent the vaquita-safe fishing equipment yearly for compensation. Then, in 2010, this option was broken down even further, giving fishermen the option of buying the vaquita-safe net, or paying the yearly rent, but for less compensation.&lt;ref name="Avila-Forcada2011"/&gt; Despite these efforts, the probability that these attempts at conservation will work is slim. Only about a third of fishermen in the area have accepted these terms so far. Some fishermen continue to fish in the protected areas despite the economic alternatives. Even measuring the population size of the vaquita will be difficult as the rarity of the vaquita bycatch will make it difficult to demonstrate the difference these programs are making.&lt;ref name="Gerrodette2006"/&gt;

In November 2014, [[Greenpeace UK]] launched a campaign urging its members to write to President Peña Nieto to extend the vaquita reserve to the full range of the species, as well as commence dialogue with the Chinese and US over the commercial transport and consumption of products from species that threaten the vaquita's future, such as the similarly sized totoaba fish which is used in [[Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170115112807/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/last-chance-save-vaquita-20141124|archive-date= 2017-01-15|dead-url= yes|url= http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/last-chance-save-vaquita-20141124|title=Last Chance to Save the Vaquita?|publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk|year=2014|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 Mexico authorized an emergency partial gillnet ban (which did not extend to the legal fishery for the curvina,  ''[[Cynoscion]] othonopterus'') in the area of the vaquita's habitat, in an attempt to halt the decline in population. In December 2015, [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] launched [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operations#Operation Milagro|Operation Milagro]], a direct action campaign to patrol the gulf habitat to protect the endangered vaquita. Sea Shepherd partnered with the [[Mexican Navy]] in a joint effort to remove illegal nets, release trapped wildlife, obtain visual evidence of poaching in the area and conduct outreach with local communities and marine biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160416050019/https://seashepherd.org/milagro2/about-campaign/about-the-campaign.html |archive-date= 2016-04-16|dead-url= yes|url= http://www.seashepherd.org/milagro2/about-campaign/about-the-campaign.html|title= Operation Milagro III - Vaquita Porpoise Defense Campaign - About Campaign|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2016, a new international program to locate and remove illegal or abandoned fishing gear from the vaquita's range began work, finding 31 illegal gillnets in 15 days.&lt;ref name = "CIRVA-8" /&gt; On April 8, 2017, Sea Shepherd pulled its 200th gillnet from Mexican waters since the start of Operation Milagro III in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170507112522/http://www.seashepherd.org/milagro3 "Operation Milagro III - Home"]. ''www.seashepherd.org''. Retrieved 2017-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the gillnet ban seems to have disproportionately impacted legal fisheries, and had the unintended effect of pushing more local fishermen into the illegal totaoba fishery. This was exacerbated by problems with the program intended to compensate fishermen for the economic consequences of the ban; half of those funds were given to just a few individuals, while others received nothing.&lt;ref name = "film2016-07"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vaquitafilm.com/mexico-permanently-bans-gillnets-in-the-upper-gulf/ | title = Mexico Permanently Bans Gillnets in the Upper Gulf! | date = July 2016 | website = Souls of the Vermillion Sea (vaquitafilm.com) | publisher = Wild Lens Inc. | access-date = 2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the annual rate of population decline increasing from ~34% before the ban to ~50% in the first year afterwards.&lt;ref name = "film2017-02"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vaquitafilm.com/official-cirva-report-is-released/ | title = Official CIRVA Report is Released | date = February 2017 | website = Souls of the Vermillion Sea (vaquitafilm.com) | publisher = Wild Lens Inc. | access-date = 2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these measures failed to halt the decline, by February 2017 it was judged that a program placing a portion of the remaining population in protective captivity was needed to save the species. Additional measures considered necessary were extending a permanent gillnet ban to the legal curvina fishery (which can provide cover for the illegal totoaba fishery), improving the enforcement of fisheries regulations and increasing penalties for violations, and accelerated development of alternative, vaquita-friendly fishing gear for local fishermen.&lt;ref name = "CIRVA-8" /&gt; The gillnet ban was scheduled to expire at the end of May 2017; as that date approached, a campaign among conservationists to extend the ban gathered force on social media, with celebrities getting involved.&lt;ref name = "McGrath2017-05"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39923383 | title = Rare Mexican porpoise faces 'imminent extinction' | last = McGrath | first = Matt | date = 2017-05-16 | publisher = BBC | access-date = 2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2017, it was announced by President Peña Nieto that the gillnet ban would be extended and made permanent.&lt;ref name = "S.D.Union-Tribune2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "None listed 2017-07"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40466607 | title = Vaquita porpoise: Dolphins deployed to save rare species | last = | first = | date = 2017-07-01 | publisher = BBC | access-date = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will also be newly strengthened efforts to enforce the ban and prosecute violators. To discourage skirting the rules, fishing at night will be prohibited and monitored entry and exit points will be established for fishing vessels that operate in the protected zone. The agreement was signed by the president as well as the Mexican secretaries for the environment, agriculture and navy. The foundations of Mexican businessman [[Carlos Slim]] and American actor and environmental activist [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] also pledged to support implementation of the plan.&lt;ref name = "S.D.Union-Tribune2017"/&gt;

Vaquitas would be captured with a light salmon gillnet.&lt;ref name="Morell2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017-10-05_MT"&gt;[https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2017/10/06/experts-to-start-capturing-rare-vaquita-porpoises-in-mexico/ Experts to start capturing rare vaquita porpoises in Mexico],  Mark Stevenson, [[The Associated Press]] / MilitaryTimes.com, 2017-10-05&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these vaquitas might be satellite-tagged and released for research purposes, while others would be kept captive. The latter vaquitas would be transferred to sea pens along the shore of the gulf, with large pools on land also available for special care if needed. Once success was attained in the campaign to eliminate the threat of gillnets, captive vaquitas could then be released back into the wild.&lt;ref name = "CIRVA-8" /&gt;

This program, called VaquitaCPR (Vaquita Conservation, Protection, and Recovery), began capturing vaquitas from the Gulf in autumn of 2017. However, the initial two attempts resulted in the death of one vaquita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmmf.org/vaquitacpr.html "Vaquita Conservation, Protection and Recovery"].

Recovery efforts have been deemed very slow and inadequate, with large amounts of poaching still going on, reducing the population to one dozen. [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]] and [[Elephant Action League]] are apparently the only organizations to have a constant presence in monitoring the population.&lt;ref name = "Monga2018.03" /&gt; 

Based on the extremely small range the species has been reduced to as of 2018, it may actually become easier to conserve the remaining population, although this restricted range makes it more vulnerable to illegal fishing in the case of incursion into this area. Potential suggestions to conserve the species include stationing a permanent military vessel in the area or forming a floating barrier of above-water nets to prevent illegal fishing boats from such incursions. Experts have also called on Mexico's incoming president, [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador|Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador]], to put forth policies conserving the species. However, Obrador's plans for job-creation (likely including promotion of the fishing industry) may debase efforts to protect the species, and Josefa González, Obrador's pick for the Environment Department, has implied that she sees vaquita conservation as a lost cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''velocity potential''' is a [[scalar potential]] used in potential flow theory. It was introduced by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|title=A History of Aerodynamics|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521669559}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in [[continuum mechanics]], when a continuum occupies a [[simply-connected]] region and is [[irrotational]]. In such a case,
: &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{u} =0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''}} denotes the [[flow velocity]]. As a result, {{math|'''u'''}} can be represented as the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar field|scalar]] function {{mvar|Φ}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} = \nabla \Phi\ = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} +
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} +
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} \mathbf{k} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

{{mvar|Φ}} is known as a '''velocity potential''' for {{math|'''u'''}}.

A velocity potential is not unique. If {{mvar|a}} is a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable, then {{math|''Φ'' + ''a''(''t'')}} is also a velocity potential for {{math|'''u'''}}. Conversely, if {{mvar|Ψ}} is a velocity potential for {{math|'''u'''}} then {{math|''Ψ'' {{=}} ''Φ'' 
+ ''b''}} for some constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable {{math|''b''(''t'')}}. In other words, velocity potentials are unique up to a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable.

If a velocity potential satisfies [[Laplace equation]], the [[potential flow|flow]] is [[incompressible flow|incompressible]] ; one can check this statement by, for instance, developing {{math|∇ × (∇ × '''u''')}} and using, thanks to the [[Symmetry of second derivatives|Clairaut-Schwarz's theorem]], the commutation between the gradient and the laplacian operators.

Unlike a [[stream function]], a velocity potential can exist in three-dimensional flow.

==Usage in acoustics==

In theoretical [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce |first=A. D.|title=Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles and Applications|year=1994|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|isbn=978-0883186121}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often desirable to work with the [[acoustic wave equation]] of the velocity potential {{mvar|Φ}} instead of pressure {{mvar|p}} and/or [[particle velocity]] {{math|'''u'''}}. 
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla ^2 \Phi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{ \partial^2 \Phi }{ \partial t ^2 } = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
Solving the wave equation for either {{mvar|p}} field or {{math|'''u'''}} field does not necessarily provide a simple answer for the other field. On the other hand, when {{mvar|Φ}} is solved for, not only is {{math|'''u'''}} found as given above, but {{mvar|p}} is also easily found – from the (linearised) [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]] for [[irrotational flow|irrotational]] and [[unsteady flow]] – as
: &lt;math&gt; p = -\rho \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial t} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

'''William T. Summerlin''' (born 1938) is a [[dermatologist]] who, as a [[medical research]]er, perpetrated a notorious [[scientific fraud]].

== The case ==
In 1974, Summerlin was working under [[immunologist]] [[Robert A. Good]] at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York City, conducting research in [[organ transplant|transplant]]ation immunology. He claimed to have shown that success of skin transplants between genetically unrelated animals was enhanced by culturing the skin in special medium for several weeks. If so, the work had major implications as a means to suppress immunological rejection of transplanted tissues. However, his own and others' attempts to reproduce his original results failed.

The experimental method involved transplantation of skin from black mice (with black melanocyte pigment cells) to white mice (without melanocytes). Over time, the melanoctyes would naturally tend to migrate out of the transplanted tissue, so as to produce a grayish patch rather than a distinctly black patch.

In the incident that became notorious, Summerlin was called to a meeting with Good, and took with him the single experimental animal that was the best evidence of transplant success. Noting that the patch had "grayed", Summerlin by his own subsequent admission darkened it with a black [[permanent marker]]. The mouse was not produced at the meeting with Good. Summerlin's action was discovered when he returned the mouse to animal care technicians, who immediately noticed that the patch could be removed with alcohol. Senior staff and Dr. Good were notified within minutes.

In the subsequent investigation, it became apparent that the original transplantation experiments were poorly controlled, and that other experiments from Summerlin's lab at Sloan-Kettering were misrepresented in reports and to colleagues. The mouse at the center of the controversy involved transplantation between two genetically similar strains, and hence had a conventional explanation. All of Summerlin's transplant work was ultimately withdrawn as shoddy.

Summerlin later attributed his deceptive behavior to a combination of mental and physical exhaustion, a heavy clinical and experimental workload, and pressure to publicize positive results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebmonline.org/cgi/content/full/224/4/211 The Evolution of the "Scientific Misconduct" Issue: An Historical Overview] by Marcel C. LaFollette, ''Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine'' 224:211–215 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial Sloan-Kettering President [[Lewis Thomas|Dr. Lewis Thomas]] said that Dr. Summerlin was suffering from a "serious emotional disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911353-1,00.html The S.K.I. Affair (Contd.)], ''[[Time magazine]]'', June 3, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Summerlin reportedly moved to rural [[Louisiana]] to practice medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Where are they now?, by Paroma Basu. ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' 12, 492 – 493 (2006). Published online: April 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Summerlin incident, the term "painting the mice" has become a synonym for research fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlineethics.org/CMS/research/resessays/cw2.aspx Truth and Trustworthiness in Research], by Caroline Whitbeck, Online Ethics Center at the [[National Academy of Engineering]]&lt;/ref&gt; Author Joseph Hixson wrote a book about the scandal entitled ''The Patchwork Mouse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879645,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Skin Deep], review of ''The Patchwork Mouse'', ''[[Time magazine]]'', March 8, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">'''Women'sNet''' is a networking support programme designed to enable South African women to use the internet to find the people, issues, resources and tools needed for women's social action.

==Issues==

Some of the issues it has foccused on include [[HIV/AIDS]], [http://www.unicef.org/beijing5/main.htm Beijing+5] in Africa, Women and Human Rights, [[violence against women]], Gender in Parliament, Health,  Women and [[Information and communication technologies]] (ICTs), Women and Enterprise, and Women and Elections.

==Resources==

The [http://www.womensnet.org.za/ Women'sNet site] offers links to useful websites, a newsletter (launched in April 2006), links to relevant issues, and a directory of organisations.

==History==

In 1998, Women'sNet was established as a project of the [[Commission of Gender Equality]] and [[Sangonet|SANGONeT]]. In the following year, the first Women'sNet webpages went live, focusing on women and human rights issues in South Africa.

It also created the first online space for South African women to reflect on, and strategise, in the lead up to the 1999 national elections. In 1999 too, the [[African Sisters online]] workshop was held. Women'sNet collaborated with [[FEMNET]] to create an online platform for joining regional processes in the lead-up to the [[Beijing+5]] conference.

2001 saw the creation of the first women-run internet cafe for civil society organisations at the [World Conference Against Racism, Xenophobia and related Intolerances], among other activities.

In 2000, Women'sNet launched a project to combine radio and audio production with women's [[NGO]]s efforts, to promote a [[women's empowerment]] agenda. It also won the [[Highway Africa]] ward for "Innovative Use of the New Media".

Other landmarks include SANGONeT Board's confirming Women'sNet's independent status (April 2002), its joining of the international [[ICT4D]] network the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], being officially registered as a non-governmental organisation (January 2003), being a core partner in the first Africa-wide [[Women and Electronic Networking Training]] (WENT) in [[Cape Town]] (2003), launching an on-line up-datable database of South African organisations providing services targeted at girls (March 2003).

In 2004, it convened a stake-holders meet to consult South African women's NGOs on their information and technology needs; launched the [http://www.genderstats.org.za GenderStats] website, launching [http://womensnet.org.za/GirlsNet/ Girls'Net],  hosting the first African workshop on [[free software]] ([[Alternative terms for free software|or FLOSS]]) and implementing the [[Recording Women's Voices]] project.

==Training, technology planning==

Over the past two years (2005 and 2006), Women'sNet has also co-trained South African women to participate in the global cyber-dialogues on the [Beijing+10] review process, and women's [[NGO]]s on technology planning and FLOSS. [[Girl'sNet]] runs a visual literacy training project with young girls in the [[Eastern Cape]], and has held a photo exhibition in August 2005.  Women'sNet also launched the (s)hebytes project and website as a space "where women and men talk about gender and women's empowerment". It launched digital story telling workshops "to train women and girls in story telling -- combining images, audio and text into a short documentary about their lives".

==Honours==

In 2005, Women'sNet's executive director [Natasha Primo] become the first women Chair of the [Association of Progressive Communicators].

[[File:system2.gif|thumb|350px|Basic components of a [[monochromatic]] XPS system.]]

'''X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy''' ('''XPS''') is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition at the [[parts per thousand]] range, [[empirical formula]], [[chemical state]] and [[electronic state]] of the elements that exist within a material. Put more simply, XPS is a useful measurement technique because it not only shows what elements are within a film but also what other elements they are bounded to. This means if you have a metal oxide and you want to know if the metal is in a +1 or +2 state, using XPS will allow you to find that ratio. However at most the instrument will only probe 20nm into a sample.

XPS [[spectrum|spectra]] are obtained by irradiating a material with a beam of [[X-ray]]s while simultaneously measuring the [[kinetic energy]] and number of [[electron]]s that escape from the top 0 to 10 [[nanometre|nm]] of the material being analyzed. XPS requires high vacuum (''P'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; milli[[bar (unit)|bar]]) or [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV; ''P'' &lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; millibar) conditions, although a current area of development is ambient-pressure XPS, in which samples are analyzed at pressures of a few tens of millibar.

XPS can be used to analyze the [[Surface science#Surface chemistry|surface chemistry]] of a material in its as-received state, or after some treatment, for example: fracturing, cutting or scraping in air or UHV to expose the bulk chemistry, [[Ion beam#Ion beam etching or sputtering|ion beam etching]] to clean off some or all of the surface contamination (with mild ion etching) or to intentionally expose deeper layers of the sample (with more extensive ion etching) in depth-profiling XPS, exposure to heat to study the changes due to heating, exposure to reactive gases or solutions, exposure to [[ion implantation|ion beam implant]], exposure to [[ultraviolet light]].
*XPS is also known as ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis), an abbreviation introduced by [[Kai Siegbahn]]'s research group to emphasize the chemical (rather than merely elemental) information that the technique provides.
*In principle XPS detects all elements. In practice, using typical laboratory-scale X-ray sources, XPS detects all elements with an [[atomic number]] (''Z'') of 3 ([[lithium]]) and above. It cannot easily detect [[hydrogen]] (''Z'' = 1) or [[helium]] (''Z'' = 2).
*[[Detection limit]]s for most of the elements (on a modern instrument) are in the [[parts per thousand]] range. Detection limits of [[parts per million]] (ppm) are possible, but require special conditions: concentration at top surface or very long collection time (overnight).
*XPS is routinely used to analyze [[inorganic compound]]s, [[metal alloy]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[element (chemistry)|elements]], [[catalyst]]s, [[glass]]es, [[ceramic]]s, [[paint]]s, [[paper]]s, [[ink]]s, [[wood]]s, plant parts, [[cosmetics|make-up]], [[teeth]], [[bone]]s, [[implant (medicine)|medical implants]], bio-materials, viscous [[oil]]s, [[glue]]s, ion-modified materials and many others. XPS is less routinely used to analyze the [[hydrate]]d forms of some of the above materials by freezing the samples in their hydrated state in an ultra pure environment, and allowing or causing multilayers of ice to sublime away prior to analysis. Such hydrated XPS analysis allows hydrated sample structures, which may be different from vacuum-dehydrated sample structures, to be studied in their more relevant as-used hydrated structure. Many biomaterials such as [[hydrogel]]s are examples of such samples.

[[File:wide.jpg|thumb|350px|Wide-scan or survey spectrum of a somewhat dirty silicon wafer, showing all elements present. A survey spectrum is usually the starting point of most XPS analyses because it shows all elements present on the sample surface and allows one to set up subsequent high-resolution XPS spectra acquisition. The inset shows a quantification table indicating all elements observed, their binding energies, and their atomic percentages.]] [[File:hires.jpg|thumb|350px|High-resolution spectrum of an oxidized silicon wafer in the energy range of the Si 2p signal. The raw data spectrum (red) is fitted with five components or chemical states, A through E. The more oxidized forms of Si (SiO''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x'' = 1-2) appear at higher binding energies in the broad feature centered at 103.67 eV. The so-called metallic form of silicon, which resides below an upper layer of oxidized silicon, exhibits a set of doublet peaks at 100.30 eV (Si 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 99.69 eV (Si 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;). The fact that the metallic silicon signal can be seen "through" the overlayer of oxidized Si indicates that the silicon oxide layer is relatively thin (2-3 nm). Attenuation of XPS signals from deeper layers by overlayers is often used in XPS to estimate layer thicknesses and depths.]]

==Measurements==
[[Image:XPS PHYSICS.png|thumb|350px|Rough schematic of XPS physics - "Photoelectric Effect''.'']]

XPS is used to measure:
*elemental composition of the surface (top 0 –10&amp;nbsp;nm usually)
*[[empirical formula]] of pure materials
*elements that contaminate a surface
*chemical or electronic state of each element in the surface
*uniformity of elemental composition across the top surface (or line profiling or mapping)
*uniformity of elemental composition as a function of ion beam etching (or depth profiling)

XPS can be performed using a commercially built XPS system, a privately built XPS system, or a [[synchrotron]]-based light source combined with a custom-designed electron energy analyzer. Commercial XPS instruments in the year 2005 used either a focused 20- to 500-[[micrometre|micrometer]]-diameter beam of [[monochromatic]] Al K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; X-rays, or a broad 10- to 30-mm-diameter beam of non-monochromatic ([[polychromatic]]) Al K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; X-rays or Mg K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; X-rays. A few specially designed XPS instruments can analyze volatile liquids or gases, or materials at pressures of roughly 1 [[torr]] (1.00 torr = 1.33 millibar), but there are relatively few of these types of XPS systems. The ability to heat or cool the sample during or prior to analysis is relatively common.

Because the energy of an X-ray with particular wavelength is known (for Al K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; X-rays, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;photon&lt;/sub&gt; = 1486.7 eV), and because the emitted electrons' kinetic energies are measured, the [[electron binding energy]] of each of the emitted electrons can be determined by using an equation that is based on the work of [[Ernest Rutherford]] (1914):

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{binding} = E_\text{photon} - \left(E_\text{kinetic} + \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; is the binding energy (BE) of the electron, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;photon&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the X-ray photons being used, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;kinetic&lt;/sub&gt; is the kinetic energy of the electron as measured by the instrument and &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is the [[work function]] dependent on both the spectrometer and the material. This equation is essentially a [[conservation of energy]] equation. The work function term &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is an adjustable instrumental correction factor that accounts for the few eV of kinetic energy given up by the photoelectron as it becomes absorbed by the instrument's detector. It is a constant that rarely needs to be adjusted in practice.

==History==
In 1887, [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] discovered but could not explain the [[photoelectric effect]], which was later explained in 1905 by [[Albert Einstein]] ([[Nobel Prize in Physics]] 1921). Two years after Einstein's publication, in 1907, P.D. Innes experimented with a [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] tube, [[Helmholtz coils]], a magnetic field hemisphere (an electron kinetic energy analyzer), and photographic plates, to record broad bands of emitted electrons as a function of velocity, in effect recording the first XPS spectrum. Other researchers, including [[Henry Moseley]], Rawlinson and Robinson, independently performed various experiments to sort out the details in the broad bands.

After [[World War II|WWII]], [[Kai Siegbahn]] and his research group in [[Uppsala]] ([[Sweden]]) developed several significant improvements in the equipment, and in 1954 recorded the first high-energy-resolution XPS spectrum of cleaved [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), revealing the potential of XPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S0029-5582(56)80022-9|title=β-Ray spectroscopy in the precision range of 1 : 1e6|year=1956|last1=Siegbahn|first1=K.|last2=Edvarson|first2=K. I. Al|journal=Nuclear Physics|volume=1|pages=137–159|issue= 8|bibcode = 1956NucPh...1..137S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later in 1967, Siegbahn published a comprehensive study of XPS, bringing instant recognition of the utility of XPS, which he referred to as ''Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis'' (''ESCA''). In cooperation with Siegbahn, a small group of engineers (Mike Kelly, Charles Bryson, Lavier Faye, Robert Chaney) at [[Hewlett-Packard]] in the USA, produced the first commercial monochromatic XPS instrument in 1969. Siegbahn received the [[Nobel Prize]] for Physics in 1981, to acknowledge his extensive efforts to develop XPS into a useful analytical tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/siegbahn-lecture.html Electron Spectroscopy for Atoms, Molecules and Condensed Matter], Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with Siegbahn's work, [[David W. Turner|David Turner]] at Imperial College (and later at Oxford University) in the UK developed [[ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) on molecular species using helium lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1733134|title=Determination of Ionization Potentials by Photoelectron Energy Measurement|year=1962|last1=Turner|first1=D. W.|last2=Jobory|first2=M. I. Al|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=37|pages=3007|bibcode = 1962JChPh..37.3007T|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic physics==
A typical XPS spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected (sometimes per unit time) (''Y''-axis, ordinate) versus the [[binding energy]] of the electrons detected (''X''-axis, abscissa). Each element produces a characteristic set of XPS peaks at characteristic [[binding energy]] values that directly identify each element that exists in or on the surface of the material being analyzed. These characteristic spectral peaks correspond to the [[electron configuration]] of the electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1''s'', 2''s'', 2''p'', 3''s'', etc. The number of detected electrons in each of the characteristic peaks is directly related to the amount of element within the XPS sampling volume. To generate atomic percentage values, each raw XPS signal must be corrected by dividing its signal intensity (number of electrons detected) by a "relative sensitivity factor" (RSF), and normalized over all of the elements detected. Since hydrogen is not detected, these atomic percentages exclude hydrogen.

To count the number of electrons during the acquisition of a spectrum with a minimum of error, XPS detectors must be operated under [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) conditions because electron counting detectors in XPS instruments are typically one meter away from the material irradiated with X-rays. This long path length for detection requires such low pressures.

==Surface sensitivity==
XPS detects only those electrons that have actually escaped from the sample into the vacuum of the instrument, and reach the detector. In order to escape from the sample into vacuum, a photoelectron must travel through the sample. Photo-emitted electrons can undergo inelastic collisions, recombination, excitation of the sample, recapture or trapping in various excited states within the material, all of which can reduce the number of escaping photoelectrons. These effects appear as an exponential attenuation function as the depth increases, making the signals detected from analytes at the surface much stronger than the signals detected from analytes deeper below the sample surface. Thus, the signal measured by XPS is an exponentially surface-weighted signal, and this fact can be used to estimate analyte depths in layered materials.

==Components of a commercial system==
[[File:Silver Target in XPS Spectrometer cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|An inside view of an old-type, non-monochromatic XPS system.]]
The main components of a commercially made XPS system include a source of X-rays, an [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) stainless steel chamber with UHV pumps, an electron collection lens, an electron energy analyzer, [[Mu-metal]] magnetic field shielding, an electron detector system, a moderate vacuum sample introduction chamber, sample mounts, a sample stage, and a set of stage manipulators.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Monochromatic aluminum K-alpha X-rays are normally produced by diffracting and focusing a beam of non-monochromatic X-rays off of a thin disc of natural, crystalline [[quartz]] with a [[Miller index|&lt;1010&gt; orientation]]. The resulting wavelength is 8.3386 angstroms (0.83386&amp;nbsp;nm) which corresponds to a photon energy of 1486.7 eV. Aluminum ''K''-alpha X-rays have an intrinsic [[#Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)|full width at half maximum (FWHM)]] of 0.43 eV, centered on 1486.7 eV (''E''/Δ''E'' = 3457). For a well optimized monochromator, the energy width of the monochromated aluminum ''K''-alpha X-rays is 0.16 eV, but energy broadening in common electron energy analyzers (spectrometers) produces an ultimate energy resolution on the order of FWHM=0.25 eV which, in effect, is the ultimate energy resolution of most commercial systems. When working under practical, everyday conditions, high-energy-resolution settings will produce peak widths (FWHM) between 0.4–0.6 eV for various pure elements and some compounds. For example, in a spectrum obtained in 1 minute at a pass energy of 20 eV using monochromated aluminum ''K''-alpha X-rays, the Ag 3''d''&lt;sub&gt;5/2 &lt;/sub&gt; peak for a clean silver film or foil will typically have a FWHM of 0.45 eV.

Non-monochromatic magnesium X-rays have a wavelength of 9.89 angstroms (0.989&amp;nbsp;nm) which corresponds to a photon energy of 1253 eV. The energy width of the non-monochromated X-ray is roughly 0.70 eV, which, in effect is the ultimate energy resolution of a system using non-monochromatic X-rays. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources do not use any crystals to diffract the X-rays which allows all primary X-rays lines and the full range of high-energy [[Bremsstrahlung]] X-rays (1–12 keV) to reach the surface. The ultimate energy resolution (FWHM) when using a non-monochromatic Mg ''K''-alpha source is 0.9–1.0 eV, which includes some contribution from spectrometer-induced broadening.

==Uses and capabilities==
XPS is routinely used to determine:
*What elements and the quantity of those elements that are present within the top 1-12&amp;nbsp;nm of the sample surface
*What contamination, if any, exists on the surface or in the bulk of the sample
*Empirical formula of a material that is free of excessive surface contamination
*The chemical state identification of one or more of the elements in the sample and also give information on local bonding of atoms
*The binding energy of one or more electronic states
*The thickness of one or more thin layers (1–8&amp;nbsp;nm) of different materials within the top 12&amp;nbsp;nm of the surface
*The density of electronic states

==Capabilities of advanced systems==
*Measure uniformity of elemental composition across the top of the surface (or ''line profiling or mapping'')
*Measure uniformity of elemental composition as a function of depth by ion beam etching (or ''depth profiling'')
*Measure uniformity of elemental composition as a function of depth by tilting the sample (or ''angle-resolved XPS'')

==Chemical states and chemical shift==
The ability to produce chemical state information (as distinguished from merely elemental information) from the topmost few nm of any surface makes XPS a unique and valuable tool for understanding the chemistry of any surface, either as received, or after physical or chemical treatment(s).  In this context, "chemical state" refers to the local bonding environment of a species in question. The local bonding environment of a species in question is affected by its formal oxidation state, the identity of its nearest-neighbor atom, its bonding hybridization to that nearest-neighbor atom, and in some cases even the bonding hybridization between the atom in question and the next-nearest-neighbor atom. Thus, while the nominal binding energy of the C&lt;sub&gt;1''s''&lt;/sub&gt; electron is 284.6 eV (some also use 285.0 eV as the nominal value for the binding energy of carbon), subtle but reproducible shifts in the actual binding energy, the so-called ''chemical shift'', provide the chemical state information referred to here.

Chemical-state analysis is widely used for the element carbon. Chemical-state analysis of the surface of carbon-containing polymers readily reveals the presence or absence of the chemical states of carbon shown in '''bold''', in approximate order of increasing binding energy, as:  carbide (-'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), silicone (-Si-'''C'''H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), methylene/methyl/hydrocarbon (-'''C'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''C'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-,  '''C'''H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-, and -'''C'''H='''C'''H-), amine (-'''C'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), alcohol (-'''C'''-OH), ketone (-'''C'''=O), organic ester (-'''C'''OOR), carbonate (-'''C'''O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), monofluoro-hydrocarbon (-'''C'''FH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-), difluoro-hydrocarbon (-'''C'''F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-), and trifluorocarbon (-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''C'''F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), to name but a few examples.

Chemical state analysis of the surface of a silicon wafer readily reveals chemical shifts due to the presence or absence of the chemical states of silicon in its different formal oxidation states, such as: n-doped silicon and p-doped silicon (metallic silicon in figure above), silicon suboxide (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), silicon monoxide (SiO), Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). An example of this is seen in the figure above: High-resolution spectrum of an oxidized silicon wafer in the energy range of the Si 2''p'' signal.

==Routine limits==

===Quantitative accuracy and precision===

*XPS is widely used to generate an empirical formula because it readily yields excellent quantitative accuracy from homogeneous solid-state materials.
* Quantification can be divided into two categories: absolute quantification and relative quantification. The former generally requires the use of certified (or independently verified) standard samples, is generally more challenging, and is generally less common.
* Relative quantification is more common and involves comparisons between several samples in a set for which one or more analytes are varied while all other components (the sample matrix) are held constant.
*Quantitative accuracy depends on several parameters such as: [[signal-to-noise ratio]], peak intensity, accuracy of relative sensitivity factors, correction for electron transmission function, surface volume homogeneity, correction for energy dependence of electron mean free path, and degree of sample degradation due to analysis.
*Under optimum conditions, the quantitative accuracy of the atomic percent (at%) values calculated from the '''Major XPS Peaks''' is 90-95% for each major peak. If a high level quality control protocol is used, the accuracy can be further improved.
*Under routine work conditions, where the surface is a mixture of contamination and expected material, the accuracy ranges from 80-90% of the value reported in atomic percent values.
*The quantitative accuracy for the weaker XPS signals, that have peak intensities 10-20% of the strongest signal, are 60-80% of the true value, and depend upon the amount of effort used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (for example by signal averaging).
* Quantitative precision (the ability to repeat a measurement and obtain the same result) is an essential consideration for proper reporting of quantitative results. Standard statistical tests, such as the [[Student's t test]] for comparison of means, should be used to determine confidence levels in the average value from a set of replicate measurements, and when comparing the average values of two or more different sets of results. In general, a p value (an output of the Student's t test) of 0.05 or less indicates a level of confidence (95%) that is accepted in the field as significant.

===Analysis time===

*Typically ranging 1–20 minutes for a broad survey scan that measures the amount of all detectable elements, typically 1–15 minutes for high resolution scan that reveal chemical state differences (for a high signal/noise ratio for count area result often requires multiple sweeps of the region of interest), 1–4 hours for a depth profile that measures 4–5 elements as a function of etched depth (this process time can vary the most as many factors will play a role).

===Detection limits===
Detection limits may vary greatly with the cross section of the photoelectron line of interest and the background signal level which is a function of the matrix material.  In general photoelectron cross sections increase with atomic number, while the background is a function of the composition of the matrix material and the binding energy.  Background signals generally increase with atomic number of the matrix material and decrease with increasing kinetic energy. For example in the case of gold on silicon where the high cross section Au4f peak is at a higher kinetic energy than the major silicon peaks, it sits on a very low background and detection limits of 1ppm or better may be achieved with reasonable acquisition times. Conversely for silicon on gold, where the modest cross section Si2p line sits on the large background below the Au4f lines, detection limits would be much worse for the same acquisition time.
Detection limits are often quoted as 0.1–1.0 % atomic percent (0.1 % = 1 [[parts per thousand|part per thousand]] = 1000 [[parts per million|ppm]]) for practical analyses, but lower limits may be achieved in many circumstances.

===Measured area===

*Measured area depends on instrument design. The minimum analysis area ranges from 10 to 200 micrometres. Largest size for a monochromatic beam of X-rays is 1–5&amp;nbsp;mm. Non-monochromatic beams are 10–50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. Spectroscopic image resolution levels of 200&amp;nbsp;nm or below has been achieved on latest imaging XPS instruments using synchrotron radiation as X-ray source.

===Sample size limits===

Instruments accept small (mm range) and large samples (cm range), e.g. wafers. Limiting factor is the design of the sample holder, the sample transfer, and the size of the vacuum chamber. Large samples are laterally moved in x and y direction to analyse a larger area. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Degradation during analysis===

*Depends on the sensitivity of the material to the wavelength of X-rays used, the total dose of the X-rays, the temperature of the surface and the level of the vacuum. Metals, alloys, ceramics and most glasses are not measurably degraded by either non-monochromatic or monochromatic X-rays. Some, but not all, polymers, catalysts, certain highly oxygenated compounds, various inorganic compounds and fine organics are degraded by either monochromatic or non-monochromatic X-ray sources.
*Non-monochromatic X-ray sources produce a significant amount of high energy Bremsstrahlung X-rays (1–15 keV of energy) which directly degrade the surface chemistry of various materials. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources also produce a significant amount of heat (100 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C) on the surface of the sample because the anode that produces the X-rays is typically only 1 to {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} away from the sample. This level of heat, when combined with the Bremsstrahlung X-rays, acts synergistically to increase the amount and rate of degradation for certain materials. Monochromatic X-ray sources, because they are far away (50–100&amp;nbsp;cm) from the sample, do not produce any heat effects. 
*Monochromatic X-ray sources are monochromatic because the quartz monochromator system diffracts the Bremsstrahlung X-rays out of the X-ray beam, which means the sample is only exposed to one narrow band of X-ray energy. For example, if aluminum K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.43 eV, centered on 1,486.7 eV (''E''/Δ''E'' = 3,457). If magnesium K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.36 eV, centered on 1,253.7 eV  (''E''/Δ''E'' = 3,483). These are the intrinsic X-ray line widths; the range of energies to which the sample is exposed depends on the quality and optimization of the X-ray monochromator.
*Because the vacuum removes various gases (e.g., O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO) and liquids (e.g., water, alcohol, solvents, etc.) that were initially trapped within or on the surface of the sample, the chemistry and morphology of the surface will continue to change until the surface achieves a steady state. This type of degradation is sometimes difficult to detect.

===General summary of use===
*XPS is, in effect, a non-destructive technique that measures the surface chemistry of most any material, however non-dry, outgassing, radioactive or highly magnetic materials can pose serious challenges.

===Peak identification===
The number of peaks produced by a single element varies from 1 to more than 20.  Tables of binding energies (BEs) that identify the shell and spin-orbit of each peak produced by a given element are included with modern XPS instruments, and can be found in various handbooks [citations] and websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook of The Elements and Native Oxides|url=http://www.xpsdata.com/XI_BE_Lookup_table.pdf|publisher=XPS International, Inc.|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because these experimentally determined BEs are characteristic of specific elements, they can be directly used to identify experimentally measured peaks of a material with unknown elemental composition.

Before beginning the process of peak identification, the analyst must determine if the BEs of the unprocessed survey spectrum (0-1400 eV) have or have not been shifted due to a positive or negative surface charge.  This is most often done by looking for two peaks that due to the presence of carbon and oxygen.
{tbc}

===Charge referencing insulators===
Charge referencing is needed when a sample suffers either a positive (+) or negative (-) charge induced shift of experimental BEs.   Charge referencing is needed to obtain meaningful BEs from both wide-scan, high sensitivity (low energy resolution) survey spectra (0-1100 eV), and also narrow-scan, chemical state (high energy resolution) spectra.

Charge induced shifting causes experimentally measured BEs of XPS peaks to appear at BEs that are greater or smaller than true BEs. Charge referencing is performed by adding or subtracting a "Charge Correction Factor" to each of the experimentally measured BEs.  In general, the BE of the hydrocarbon peak of the C (1s) XPS signal is used to charge reference (charge correct) all BEs obtained from non-conductive (insulating) samples or conductors that have been deliberately insulated from the sample mount.

Charge induced shifting is normally due to:  a modest excess of low voltage (-1 to -20 eV) electrons attached to the surface, or a modest shortage of electrons (+1 to +15 eV) within the top 1-12&amp;nbsp;nm of the sample caused by the loss of photo-emitted electrons. The degree of charging depends on various factors. If, by chance, the charging of the surface is excessively positive, then the spectrum might appear as a series of rolling hills, not sharp peaks as shown in the example spectrum.

The C (1s) BE of the hydrocarbon species (moieties) of the "Adventitious" carbon that appears on all, air-exposed, conductive and semi-conductive materials is normally found between 284.5 eV and 285.5 eV.   For convenience, the C (1s) of hydrocarbon moieties is defined to appear between 284.6 eV and 285.0 eV. A value of 284.8 eV has become popular in recent years. However, some recent reports indicate that 284.9 eV or 285.0 eV represents hydrocarbons attached on metals, not the natural native oxide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The 284.8 eV BE is routinely used as the "Reference BE" for charge referencing insulators.  When the C (1s) BE is used for charge referencing, then the charge correction factor is the difference between 284.8 eV and the experimentally measured C (1s) BE of the hydrocarbon moieties.

When using a monochromatic XPS system together with a low voltage electron flood gun for charge compensation the experimental BEs of the C (1s) hydrocarbon peak is often 4-5 eV smaller than the reference BE value (284.8 eV).  In this case, all experimental BEs appear at lower BEs than expected and need to be increased by adding a value ranging from 4 to 5 eV.  Non-monochromatic XPS systems are not usually equipped with a low voltage electron flood gun so the BEs will normally appear at higher BEs than expected.  It is normal to subtract a charge correction factor from all BEs produced by a non-monochromatic XPS system.

Conductive materials and most native oxides of conductors should never need charge referencing.  Conductive materials should never be charge referenced unless the topmost layer of the sample has a thick non-conductive film.

===Peak-fitting===
The process of peak-fitting high energy resolution XPS spectra is still a mixture of art, science, knowledge and experience.  The peak-fit process is affected by instrument design, instrument components, experimental settings (aka analysis conditions) and sample variables.  Most instrument parameters are constant while others depend on the choice of experimental settings.

Before starting any peak-fit effort, the analyst performing the peak-fit needs to know if the topmost 15&amp;nbsp;nm of the sample is expected to be a homogeneous material or is expected to be a mixture of materials.  If the top 15&amp;nbsp;nm is a homogeneous material with only very minor amounts of adventitious carbon and adsorbed gases, then the analyst can use theoretical peak area ratios to enhance the peak-fitting process.

Variables that affect or define peak-fit results include:

*FWHMs
*Chemical Shifts
*Peakshapes
*Instrument design factors
*Experimental settings
*Sample factors

====Full width at half maximum (FWHM)====

The [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) values are useful indicators of chemical state changes and physical influences. That is, broadening of a peak may indicate: a
change in the number of chemical bonds contributing to a peak shape, a change in the sample condition (x-ray damage) and/or
differential charging of the surface (localised differences in the charge state of the surface). However, it should be noted that the FWHM also depends on the detector, and can also increase due to the sample getting charged.

:When using high energy resolution experiment settings on an XPS equipped with a monochromatic Al K-alpha X-ray source, the FWHM of the major XPS peaks range from 0.3 eV to 1.7 eV.  The following is a simple summary of FWHM from major XPS signals:

* Main metal peaks (e.g. 1s, 2p3, 3d5, 4f7) from pure metals have FWHMs that range from 0.30 eV to 1.0 eV
* Main metal peaks (e.g. 1s, 2p3, 3d5, 4f7) from binary metal oxides have FWHMs that range from 0.9 eV to 1.7 eV
* The O (1s) peak from binary metal oxides have FWHMs that, in general, range from 1.0 eV to 1.4 eV
* The C (1s) peak from adventitious hydrocarbons have FWHMs that, in general, range from 1.0 eV to 1.4 eV

====Chemical shifts====

Chemical shift values depend on the degree of electron bond polarization between nearest neighbor atoms. A specific chemical shift is the difference in BE values of one specific [[chemical state]] versus the BE of one form of the pure element, or of a particular agreed-upon chemical state of that element. Component peaks derived from peak-fitting a raw chemical state spectrum can be assigned to the presence of different chemical states within the sampling volume of the sample.

====Peak shapes====

:Depends on instrument parameters, experimental parameters and sample characteristics

====Instrument design factors====

:FWHM and purity of X-rays used (monochromatic Al, non-monochromatic Mg, Synchrotron, Ag, Zr...)
:Design of electron analyzer (CMA, HSA, retarding field...)

====Experiment settings====

:Settings of the electron analyzer (e.g.  pass energy, step size)

====Sample factors====

:Physical form of the sample (single crystal, polished, powder, corroded...)
:Number of physical defects within the analysis volume (from Argon ion etching, from laser cleaning...)

==Advanced instrumentation aspects==

===Hemispherical electron energy analyzer===
A '''hemispherical electron energy analyzer''' is generally used for applications where a higher resolution is needed. An ideal hemispherical analyzer consists of two concentric hemispherical electrodes (inner and outer hemispheres) held at proper voltages. It is possible to demonstrate that in such a system, (i) the electrons are linearly dispersed along the direction connecting the entrance and the exit slit, depending on their kinetic energy, while (ii) electrons with the same energy are first-order focused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hadjarab|first=F.|author2=J.L. Erskine |title=Image properties of the hemispherical analyzer applied to multichannel energy detection|journal=Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and related Phenomena|year=1985|volume=36|issue=3|pages=227|doi=10.1016/0368-2048(85)80021-9|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0368204885800219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When two potentials, &lt;math&gt;V_{1}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;V_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  are applied to the inner and outer hemispheres, respectively, the electric potential and field in the region between the two electrodes can be calculated by solving the Laplace equation:

:&lt;math&gt; V(r)= - \left[\frac{(V_{2}-V_{1})}{(R_{2}-R_{1})}\right]\cdot\frac{(R_{1}R_{2})}{r} + const.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; |E(r)|= - \left[\frac{(V_{2}-V_{1})}{(R_{2}-R_{1})}\right]\cdot\frac{(R_{1}R_{2})}{r^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the two hemispheres. In order for the electrons with kinetic energy E0 to follow a circular trajectory of radius &lt;math&gt;R_{0} = \frac{(R1 + R2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, the force exerted by the electric field 
(&lt;math&gt;F_{E} = -e|E(r)|&lt;/math&gt;) must equal the centripetal force (&lt;math&gt;F_{C}&lt;/math&gt;) along the whole path. After some algebra, the following expression can be derived for the potential:

:&lt;math&gt;V (r) = \left(\frac{V_{0}R_{0}}{r}\right)+const.&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; V_{0} = \frac{E_{0}}{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the electrons expressed in eV. 
From this equation, we can calculate the potential difference between the two hemispheres, which is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{2}-V_{1}=V_{0}\left( \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}-\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter equation can be used to determine the potentials to be applied to the hemispheres in order to select electrons with energy &lt;math&gt; E_{0}=|e|V_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called ''pass energy''.

In fact, only the electrons with energy &lt;math&gt;E_{0}&lt;/math&gt; impinging normal to the entrance slit of the analyzer  describe a trajectory of radius &lt;math&gt;R_{0}=(R_{1}+R_{2})/2&lt;/math&gt; and reach the exit slit, where they are revealed by the detector.

The instrumental energy resolution of the device depends both on the geometrical parameters of the analyzer and on the angular divergence of the incoming photoelectrons:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E=E_{0}\left(\frac{w}{2R_{0}}+\frac{\alpha ^2}{4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the average width of the two slits, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence angle of the incoming photoelectrons.
Though the resolution improves with increasing &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, technical problems related to the size of the analyzer put a limit on the actual value of &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
Although a low pass energy &lt;math&gt;E_{0}&lt;/math&gt; improves the resolution, the electron transmission probability is reduced at low pass energy, and the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates, accordingly.
The electrostatic lenses in front of the analyzer have two main purposes: they collect and focus the incoming photoelectrons into the entrance slit of the analyzer, and they decelerate the electrons to the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;E_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, in order to increase the resolution.

When acquiring spectra in ''sweep'' (or ''scanning'') mode, the voltages of the two hemispheres &lt;math&gt;V_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{2}&lt;/math&gt; -
and hence the pass energy- are held fixed; at the same time, the voltage applied to the electrostatic lenses is swept in such a way that each channel counts electrons with the selected kinetic energy for the selected amount of time.
In order to reduce the acquisition time per spectrum, the so-called ''snapshot'' (or ''fixed'') mode has been introduced. This mode exploits the relation between the kinetic energy of a photoelectron and its position inside the detector. If the detector energy range is wide enough, and if the photoemission signal collected from all the channels is sufficiently strong, the photoemission spectrum can be obtained in one single shot from the image of the detector.

===Cylindrical mirror analyzer===
Since the relevant information, in photoemission spectroscopy, is contained in the kinetic energy distribution of the photoelectrons, a specific device is needed to energy-filter the electrons emitted (or scattered) by the sample.
Electrostatic monochromators are the most common choice. The older design, a CMA, represents a trade-off between the need for high count rates and high angular/energy resolution. The so-called '''cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA)''' is mostly used for checking the elemental composition of the surface.
It consists of two co-axial cylinders placed in front of the sample, the inner one being held at a positive potential, while the outer cylinder is held at a negative potential.
Only the electrons with the right energy can pass through this set-up and are detected at the end. The count rates are high but the resolution (both in energy and angle) is poor.

===Synchrotron based XPS===
A breakthrough has been actually brought about in the last decades by the development of large scale [[synchrotron]] radiation facilities. Here, bunches of relativistic electrons kept on a circular orbit inside a storage ring are accelerated through bending magnets or insertion devices like [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wigglers]] and [[undulator]]s to produce a high brilliance and high flux photon beam. 
The main advantages of using synchrotron light are
* the high brilliance of this kind of radiation, which is orders of magnitude more intense and better collimated than the one produced by anode-based sources;
* the tunability of synchrotron radiation over a wide frequency range;
* its high polarization;
* the high photon flux;
* the possibility of producing extremely short pulses at a frequency as high as a MHz.

The highest spectral brightness and narrowest beam energy dispersion is attained by undulators, which consist of periodic array of dipole magnets in which the electrons are forced to wiggle and thus to emit coherent light. Besides the high intensity, energy tunability is one of the most important advantages of synchrotron light compared to the light produced by conventional X-ray sources. In fact, a wide energy range (from the IR to the Hard X-ray region, depending on the energy of the electron bunch) is accessible by changing the undulator gaps between the
arrays. Continuous energy spectra available from a synchrotron radiation source allows selection of photon energies yielding optimum photoionization cross-sections appropriate for probing a particular core level. 
The high photon flux, in addition, makes it possible to perform  XPS experiments also from low density atomic species, such as molecular and atomic adsorbates.

==Electron detectors==

===Older style electron detector===
Electrons can be detected using an [[electron multiplier]], usually a '''channeltron'''. This device essentially consists of a glass tub with a resistive coating on the inside. A high voltage is applied between the front and the end. An electron which enters the channeltron is accelerated to the wall, where it removes more electrons,  in such a way that an electron avalanche is created, until a measurable current pulse is obtained.

==Theoretical aspects==

===Quantum mechanical treatment===

When a photoemission event takes place, the following energy conservation rule holds:

:&lt;math&gt; h\nu =|E_{b}^{v}|+E_{kin} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the photon energy, &lt;math&gt;|E_{b}^{v}|&lt;/math&gt; is the electron BE (with respect to the vacuum level) prior to ionization, and &lt;math&gt;E_{kin}&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. If reference is taken with respect to the Fermi level (as it is typically done in [[photoelectron spectroscopy]]) &lt;math&gt;|E_{b}^{v}|&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by the sum of the binding energy (BE) relative to the Fermi level, &lt;math&gt;|E_{b}^{F}|&lt;/math&gt;, and the sample work function, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{0}&lt;/math&gt; .

From the theoretical point of view, the photoemission process from a solid can be described with a semiclassical approach, where the electromagnetic field is still treated classically, while a quantum-mechanical description is used for matter.
The one—particle Hamiltonian for an electron subjected to an electromagnetic field is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\left[\frac{1}{2m}\left(\mathbf{\hat{p}}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{\hat{A}}\right)^2+ \hat{V} \right]\psi=\hat{H}\psi &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the electron wave function, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the unperturbed potential of the solid.
In the Coulomb gauge (&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}=0&lt;/math&gt;), the vector potential commutes with the momentum operator 
(&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{\hat{p}}, \mathbf{\hat{A}}]=0 &lt;/math&gt;), so that the expression in brackets in the Hamiltonian simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbf{\hat{p}}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{\hat{A}}\right)^2=\hat{p}^2 -2\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{\hat{A}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{p}}+\left(\frac{e}{c}\right)^2\hat{A}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Actually, neglecting the &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; term in the Hamiltonian, we are disregarding possible photocurrent contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hüfner|first=S.|title=Photoelectron spectroscopy: principles and applications|year=1995|publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effects are generally negligible in the bulk, but may become important at the surface.
The quadratic term in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be instead safely neglected, since its contribution in a typical photoemission experiment is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the first term .

In first-order perturbation approach, the one-electron Hamiltonian can be split into two terms, an unperturbed Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, plus an interaction Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}'&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the effects of the electromagnetic field:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}'=-\frac{e}{mc}\mathbf{\hat{A}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{p}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the time-dependent perturbation theory for harmonic perturbations, the transition rate between the initial state &lt;math&gt;\psi_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and the final state &lt;math&gt;\psi_{f}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed by the [[Fermi's golden rule]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\omega}{dt}\propto \frac{2\pi}{\hbar}|\langle \psi_{f}|\hat{H}'|\psi_{i} \rangle |^2 \delta (E_{f}-E_{i}-h\nu) &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;E_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{f}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian in the initial and final state, respectively, and &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the photon energy. The Fermi Golden rule strictly applies only if the perturbation acts on the system for an infinite time. Since in a real system the interaction has a finite duration, the Dirac delta function in the equation above must be replaced by the density of states in the final state, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{f}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\omega}{dt}\propto \frac{2\pi}{\hbar}|\langle \psi_{f}|\hat{H}'|\psi_{i} \rangle |^2 \rho_{f}=|M_{fi}|^2 \rho_{f} &lt;/math&gt;

In a real photoemission experiment  the ground state core electron BE cannot be directly probed, because the measured BE 
incorporates both initial state and final state effects, and the spectral linewidth is broadened owing to the finite core-hole lifetime (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;).

Assuming an exponential decay probability for the core hole in the time domain (&lt;math&gt; \propto \exp{-t/\tau} &lt;/math&gt;), the spectral function will have a Lorentzian shape, with a FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; given by:

:&lt;math&gt; I_{L}(E)=\frac{I_{0}}{\pi}\frac{\Gamma /2}{(E-E_{b})^2+(\Gamma /2)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

From the theory of Fourier transforms, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are linked by the indeterminacy relation:

&lt;math&gt; \Gamma \tau \geq \hbar &lt;/math&gt;

The photoemission event leaves the atom in a highly excited core ionized  state, from which it can decay radiatively (fluorescence) or non-radiatively (typically by ''Auger'' decay).
Besides  Lorentzian broadening, photoemission spectra are also affected by a Gaussian broadening, whose contribution can be expressed by

:&lt;math&gt; I_{G}(E)=\frac{I_{0}}{\sigma \sqrt{2}}\exp{\left( -\frac{(E-E_{b})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Three main factors enter the Gaussian broadening of the spectra: the experimental energy resolution,  vibrational and inhomogeneous broadening.
The first effect is caused  by the non perfect monochromaticity of the photon beam -which results in a finite bandwidth- and by the limited resolving power of the analyzer. The vibrational component is produced by the excitation of low energy vibrational modes both in the initial and in the final state. Finally, inhomogeneous broadening can originate from the presence of unresolved core level components in the spectrum.

===Theory of core level photoemission of electrons===
In a solid, also inelastic scattering events contribute to the photoemission process, generating electron-hole pairs which show up as an inelastic tail on the high BE side of the main photoemission peak. 
In some cases, we observe also energy loss features due to [[plasmon]] excitations. This can either a final state effect caused by core hole decay, which generates quantized electron wave excitations in the solid ('''intrinsic plasmons'''), or it can be due to excitations induced by photoelectrons travelling from the emitter to the surface ('''extrinsic plasmons''').
Due to the reduced [[coordination number]] of first-layer atoms, the plasma frequency of bulk and surface atoms are related by the following equation:  
&lt;math&gt; \omega_{surf} = \frac{\omega_{bulk}}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
so that  surface and bulk plasmons can be easily distinguished from each other.
Plasmon states in a solid are typically localized at the surface, and can  strongly affect the electron Inelastic Mean Free Path ([[IMFP]]).

''Vibrational effects''

Temperature-dependent atomic lattice vibrations, or [[phonon]]s, can broaden the core level components and attenuate the interference patterns in an XPD (X-Ray Photoelectron Diffraction) experiment. The simplest way to account for vibrational effects is by multiplying the scattered single-photoelectron wave function &lt;math&gt;\phi_{j}&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Debye-Waller factor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;W_{j}= \exp{(-\Delta k_{j}^2 \bar{U_{j}^2})}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_{j}^2&lt;/math&gt; is the squared magnitude of the wave vector variation caused by scattering,
and &lt;math&gt;\bar{U_{j}^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature-dependent one-dimensional vibrational [[mean squared displacement]] of the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; emitter. In the Debye model, the mean squared displacement is calculated in terms of the Debye temperature, &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{D}&lt;/math&gt;, as:

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{U_{j}^2}(T) = 9 \hbar ^2 T^2 / m k_{B} \Theta_{D} &lt;/math&gt;
