The group promotes [[collaborative fiction]] writing through workshops, public lectures, and the internet.


==Members==
Alice Campion consists of four core members: Denise Tart, a Sydney civil celebrant with a background in writing and performance;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denisetart.com.au/|title=Denise Tart Celebrant |website=Denise Tart Celebrant |language=de|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Richards, a senior travel editor with Australian media group [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]]; Jane St Vincent Welch (full name Mary Jane St Vincent Welch), an Australian film editor; and Jenny Crocker, a communications manager specialising in [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]] campaigns. For its first novel, the Alice Campion group also included Madeline Oliver.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Origins==
The Alice Campion collaborators met as members of an inner-city book club in [[Sydney]], Australia, The Book Sluts. In 2010, while discussing [[Crime and Punishment]], five members of the group decided spontaneously to write a ‘[[bestseller]]’ in order to fund a trip to Russia. What began as a light-hearted attempt to write a run-of-the-mill romance soon developed into a more serious attempt to write a quality [[Genre fiction|genre novel]]. The group was also motivated by the lack of [[collaborative writing]] in commercial fiction. While other forms of creative writing – notably [[screenwriting]] for television and movies – thrived on collaboration, multi-author novels were rare, and the few that did exist were experimental, avant garde works, such as [[Wu Ming]], or [[Naked Came The Stranger|spoofs]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} 
&lt;br&gt;
Other successful collaborative pairs writing commercial [[Australian literature]] include [[Thomas Kenneally]] and his daughter Meg Kenneally as well as [[Florence James]] and [[Dymphna Cusack]], who wrote the classic Australian novel [[Come In Spinner]]. Alice Campion remains the only multi-member commercial fiction group collaboration in the world.

==Writing process==
The Alice Campion authors, as Group Fiction, have outlined their writing process in detail and with examples of key documents in their e-book ''How to Write Fiction as a Group''. Generally, the group meets on a Sunday to develop the plot of the book. This involves breaking the existing story into short scenes of around two to four pages. The group collaboratively decides what will happen in each scene: the action, setting the point of view, impacts on the emotion and knowledge of the participating character and the tone. Each writer then takes a single scene away and writes it as a draft. Scenes must be written and circulated to the other writers ahead of the next meeting, which generally takes place on a Thursday. At this Revision Meeting, each writer reads her own scene out loud and other participants have an opportunity to suggest improvements, which are integrated or not by agreement. In subsequent drafts, scenes are re-written by someone other than the original author and [[Collaborative editing|edited collaboratively]] to ensure a smooth and seamless narrative. Disagreements are decided by a vote. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Anastasia and Tatiana Dogaru''' (born 13 January 2004&lt;ref name="cnnlibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/11/world/conjoined-twins-fast-facts/|title=Conjoined Twins Fast Facts|author=CNN Library|date=11 July 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are [[Craniopagus twins|craniopagus]] [[conjoined twins]]. They were scheduled to begin the first of several surgeries to separate them at Rainbow Babies and Children's Medical Center in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. However, in August 2007 the surgery was called off as too dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins were born in [[Rome, Italy]] to [[Romania]]n parents, Alin Dogaru, a [[Byzantine Catholic]] priest, and Claudia Dogaru, a nurse. Their mother heard about the successful separation of Egyptian-born twins who were also joined at the head and hoped her children could also be successfully separated. The Dogaru family — who also have an older daughter, Maria, and younger son Theodor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/10/19/seven-year-old-conjoined-twins-face-life-or-death-surgery-decision_n_7384132.html |title=Seven-Year-Old Conjoined Twins Face Life Or Death Surgery Decision |publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]'' |date=October 19, 2011 |author=Parentdish UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; — were brought to north [[Texas]] by the World Craniofacial Foundation to have Anastasia and Tatiana evaluated for possible separation.

The girls are currently developing normally for their age and speak both Romanian and English. They get around with Anastasia leading the way and Tatiana following. The top of Tatiana's head is attached to the back of Anastasia's. Anastasia, whose kidneys don't function, relies on her sister's kidneys, and Tatiana on her sister's circulatory system. The girls also share blood flow to the back of the brain and some brain matter. Doctors estimated the twins had only a 50 percent chance of surviving the surgery. There were also risks of complications, such as brain damage, but the girls also risk early death if they remain conjoined. Their parents believed separation would give them their best chance at living a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.wkyc.com/news/health/health_article.aspx?storyid=64898| title = Conjoined twins to be separated in Cleveland| publisher =www.wkyc.com | date = March 25–29, 2007}} {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2994617&amp;page=1| title =Conjoined Twins Prepare for Separation Surgery | publisher =www.abcnews.go.com | date = 2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.wkyc.com/news/health/health_article.aspx?storyid=65184| title =Conjoined Twins Say Goodbye to Dallas| publisher =www.wkyc.com | date = 2007-03-30}} {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, doctors used a catheter to insert wire coils into the veins of the two girls, successfully redirecting their blood flow. It was the first time the procedure was attempted in conjoined twins. Doctors pushed back the first of the planned separation surgeries to June 2007 while studying the complex circulatory system of the twins, but, in August of that year, decided it was too risky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/17177714.htm| title = Doctors postpone surgery on twins| publisher =Akron Beacon Journal| date = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnlibrary"/&gt;

'''Barbara Gordon''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly in association with the superhero [[Batman]]. The character was created by [[William Dozier]], [[Julius Schwartz]], and [[Carmine Infantino]]. At the request of the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, DC editor Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero [[Batman]] that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as '''[[Batgirl]]''' in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, titled "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!" (January 1967), by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|editor-last=Dolan |editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 122 |quote = Nine months before making her debut on ''Batman'', a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of ''Detective Comics''...Yet the idea she is also seen as batmans secretary on the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics. Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Gordon is the daughter of [[Gotham City]] police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], the sister of [[James Gordon Jr.]], and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in ''[[Batman Family]]'' which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]]. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in ''Batgirl Special'' #1, the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' depicts the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in [[paraplegia]]. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a computer expert and [[information broker]] known as '''Oracle'''. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during [[The New 52]] event, featuring her in the eponymous ''Batgirl'' monthly title as well as ''Birds of Prey''. These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as [[DC Rebirth]].

The character was a popular comic book figure during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], due to her appearances in the ''Batman'' television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] under the ''Birds of Prey'' publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of ''The Killing Joke'', which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.

As both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the [[Batman franchise media|Batman franchise]], including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character has been portrayed by [[Yvonne Craig]] and [[Dina Meyer]] and has been voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]], [[Tara Strong]], Danielle Judovits, [[Alyson Stoner]], [[Mae Whitman]], [[Kimberly Brooks]] and [[Rosario Dawson]], among others. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes".&lt;ref name="Top 100 Comic Book Heroes"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17 | title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Barbara Gordon, the [[Batwoman]] character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor [[Julius Schwartz]] for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the ''Batman'' television series of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{citation |author = [[Les Daniels]] | title = Batman: The Complete History | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 2004 | pages = 113, 115 |isbn = 0-8118-4232-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[William Dozier]] suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl.&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= February 2010|title= Growing Up Gordon: The Early Years of Batgirl|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 65–70|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist [[Carmine Infantino]] during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the '50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Michael Fitzgerald | title = Carmine infantino: Decades at DC and Beyond | year = 2007 | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004812442.cfm | accessdate =November 23, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124223127/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004812442.cfm |archivedate = November 24, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yvonne Craig]] portrayed the character in the show's third season.&lt;ref name="Daniels 1995 141"&gt;{{citation|first= Les |last= Daniels |title= DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes |year= 1995 |publisher= Bulfinch |page= 141 |isbn= 0-8212-2076-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl debuted in ''Detective Comics'' #359, "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl" (1967), as the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon. In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, sporting a black bodysuit with yellow gloves, boots, utility belt and a bat-symbol along with a blue cape and cowl (similar to Batman's), Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain [[Killer Moth]], attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.&lt;ref name="supergirls"&gt;{{citation|first= Mike |last= Madrid|title=The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines|publisher=Exterminating Angel Press|year=2009|pages=136–138|isbn= 978-1-935259-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her civilian identity, Barbara Gordon, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of Gotham City public library, "presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality."&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"&gt;{{citation |first= Wendi |last= Arant|author2= Candace Benefiel | title = The Image and Role of the Librarian | publisher = Haworth Press | year = 2002 | pages = 77–80 | isbn = 0-7890-2099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given a regular backup slot in ''Detective Comics'' starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. [[Frank Robbins]] wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by [[Gil Kane]] and later by [[Don Heck]].&lt;ref name= Back38 /&gt; Barbara Gordon's Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in ''Detective Comics'' #417 (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= ''Detective'' #417 |year= 1971 | publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "I'd like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back&amp;nbsp;... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm | title=Remembering Kathy Kane: The First Batwoman | first= Fred |last= Grandinetti | publisher=Newsarama | accessdate= September 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132840/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm |archivedate = September 29, 2007|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, as a supporting character in ''Detective Comics'', in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'',&lt;ref name="Justice League of America #60"&gt;{{citation |first= Gardner |last= Fox |title= ''Justice League of America'' #60 |year= 1968 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Cary Bates| first= Cary| last= Bates |title= World's Finest Comics #176 |year= 1968 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Bob Haney|first= Bob |last= Haney |title= ''The Brave and the Bold'' #78 |year= 1968 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Action Comics]]'',&lt;ref name="Action Comics #381"&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Cary Bates|first= Cary |last= Bates |title= ''Action Comics'' #381 |year= 1969 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Elliot |last= Maggin |title= ''Superman'' #268 |year= 1975 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, Batgirl reveals her [[secret identity]] to her father (who had already discovered it on his own) and serves as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972, appeared in a story entitled "Batgirl's Last Case."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= ''Detective Comics'' #424|year= 1972|publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #268 (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Amazing Adventures of Superman #268|year= 1973|publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she has a blind date with [[Clark Kent]], establishing their friendship, and fights alongside [[Superman]]. Batgirl and Superman team up twice more, in ''Superman'' #279 and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #19.

Batgirl also guest-starred in other Superman related titles such as ''Adventure Comics'', and in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #171, where she teams with Supergirl. The character is given a starring role in DC's ''[[Batman Family]]'' comic book which debuted in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Elliot | last= Maggin| title= Batman Family #1 |year= 1975 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Robin [[Dick Grayson]] became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the "Dynamite Duo: Batgirl &amp; Robin." Batgirl meets Batwoman in ''Batman Family'' #10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime-fighting (before Kane is murdered by the [[Bronze Tiger]]). The two fight [[Killer Moth]] and [[Cavalier (comics)|Cavalier]], and learn each other's secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crime-fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Batman Family #10| year= 1977|publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this series ended after three years of publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= David |last= Reed |title= ''Batman Family'' #20 |year= 1978 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batgirl continued to appear in back up stories published in ''Detective Comics'' through issue #519 (October 1982).

''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue seven of the 12-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authorlink= Marv Wolfman| first= Marv |last= Wolfman|title= Crisis on Infinite Earths |year= 1985|publisher= DC Comics | page=215 |isbn= 1-56389-750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' changed [[DC Universe]] [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in many ways. Following the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]], Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon's niece/adopted daughter in current [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Post-''Crisis'', Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by [[Power Girl]]. In ''[[Secret Origins]] #20: Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite'' (1987),&lt;ref name=SO20&gt;{{citation | first = Barbara |last= Randal | title = Secret Origins # 20 Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite | publisher = DC Comics |year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randall. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a [[sensei]], memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.

=== ''Batgirl Special'' and ''Batman: The Killing Joke'' (1988) ===
{{Main|Batman: The Killing Joke}}
[[File:Batmanthekillingjoke.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] shoots Barbara Gordon in ''Batman: The Killing Joke''. The injury results in the character's paralysis.]]

DC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic ''Batgirl Special'' #1 (July 1988), written by [[Barbara Kesel]].&lt;ref name="Batgirl Special #1"&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Barbara Kesel| first=Barbara | last=Randall |title= ''Batgirl Special'' #1 |year= 1988 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore's ''Batman: The Killing Joke''. In this graphic novel, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in ''The Killing Joke'' exert a great impact on the character, the story has little to do with her.&lt;ref name="Moore 1988"&gt;{{citation |first= Alan |last= Moore |title= Batman: The Killing Joke |year= 1988 |publisher= DC Comics|isbn= 978-0-930289-45-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is employed as a [[plot device]] to cement the Joker's vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it "shallow and ill-conceived."&lt;ref name="bitch"&gt;{{citation|first=Shannon | last=Cochran|title=The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence|newspaper=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, "I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to [[Len Wein]], who was our editor on the project", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, "Len got back onto the phone and said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'"&lt;ref name="bitch"/&gt; Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of ''Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed'' (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the ''Batgirl Special'' specifically to retire the character and set her in place for ''The Killing Joke''.&lt;ref name="Spy"&gt;{{citation| first=Brian | last= Cronin|title=Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher= Penguin|year=2009|pages=45, 47|isbn= 978-0-452-29532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer [[Kim Yale]] discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer [[John Ostrander]]. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability.&lt;ref name="A (Perhaps Unnecessary) Guide to Oracle's Formative Years"&gt;{{citation |first= Brian |last= Cronin | title = A (Perhaps Unnecessary) Guide to Oracle's Formative Years | year = 2007 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/02/15/a-perhaps-unnecessary-guide-to-oracles-formative-years | accessdate =September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gail Simone]] would include the character's paralysis in a list of "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon "[[Women in Refrigerators]]" in reference to a 1994 ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' story where [[Kyle Rayner|the title character]] discovers his [[Alexandra DeWitt|girlfriend]]'s mutilated body in his refrigerator.&lt;ref name= curves&gt;{{citation|first=Jeffrey A. |last= Brown|title=Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture|publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]]|year= 2011| page= 175|isbn= 978-1-60473-714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Suicide Squad'', ''Birds of Prey'' and other appearances (1989–2011) ===
{{Overly detailed|date=November 2017|section=yes}}
Yale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle for the next several years.&lt;ref name="A (Perhaps Unnecessary) Guide to Oracle's Formative Years" /&gt; The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #23, anonymously offering her services to the government's Task Force X.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 239: "Barbara [Gordon] set herself as an information guru...Called Oracle, Barbara was recruited by the Suicide Squad in the pages of issue #23 of the Squad's comic, written by John Ostrander and Kim Yale, and pencilled by Luke McDonnell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John |last= Ostrander | title = Suicide Squad (Vol. 1) #23| publisher = DC Comics | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=8207 | isbn = 1-4012-1491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following two years, Oracle, under pen of Ostrander and Yale, made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in ''Suicide Squad'' #38 (1990) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue #48 following an invitation from [[Amanda Waller]]. In 1992, Dennis O'Neil wrote Oracle as Batman's sole source of information in ''[[Azrael (comics)|Batman: Sword of Azrael]] #1''. This newly forged partnership established Oracle's status as Batman's intellectual equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= Dennis |last= O'Neil | title = ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' #1 | publisher = DC Comics | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-1-56389-100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is subsequently featured in the 12-issue miniseries ''[[The Hacker Files]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first= Lewis |last=Shiner | title = The Hacker Files| publisher = DC Comics | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Oracle: Year One"—a story arc contained in ''[[The Batman Chronicles]]'' #5 (1996)—Yale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle. Initially, Gordon's paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression. However, she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime.

In a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she possesses a [[genius]]-level intellect; [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]]; deep knowledge of computers and electronics; expert skills as a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] of [[Greek mythology]]) has her own face; it's then that she adopts "Oracle" as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to [[Police|law enforcement]] organizations and members of the superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of [[Richard Dragon]], one of DC's premiere [[martial arts|martial artists]], to engage in combat (using [[eskrima]]) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper-body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and [[batarang]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation | title = ''The Batman Chronicles'' #5 | publisher = DC Comics | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of [[Chuck Dixon]]'s ''Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey'' (1996) led to the comic series ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' starring the two title characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 = Chuck |last1=Dixon |first2= Jordan |last2= Gorfinkel | title = Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey | publisher = DC Comics | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-56389-484-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Chuck Dixon's crossover series ''Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author = Chuck Dixon |title= Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle| year= 2003 |publisher= DC Comics| isbn= 978-1-56389-940-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first ''Batgirl'' monthly comic was launched with [[Cassandra Cain]] as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of ''Birds of Prey'' with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She's fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she's tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jennifer |last=Contino |title=Interview with Gail Simone |publisher=Mania Comics |year=2006 |url=http://www.mania.com/53133.html |accessdate=September 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012183111/http://www.mania.com/53133.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone integrates the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors [[Scott Beatty]] and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon's origin with the miniseries ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation| first1= Chuck |last1= Dixon |first2= Scott |last2= Beatty |title= Batgirl: Year One |year= 2003 |publisher= DC Comics |isbn= 978-1-4012-0080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.

During the 2004 crossover event ''[[Batman: War Games]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1= Ed |last1=Brubaker |first2= Bill | last2= Willingham | title = Batman: War Games | publisher = DC Comics | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4012-0431-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] commandeers Oracle's computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. In the events comprising Gail Simone's ''Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Gail |last=Simone |title= Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn |year= 2005 |publisher= DC Comics | isbn = 1-4012-0940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Birds of Prey: The Battle Within'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Gail |last= Simone |title= Birds of Prey: The Battle Within |year= 2005 |publisher= DC Comics | isbn = 978-1-4012-1096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle is possessed by arch-villain [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.

During the company-wide crossover ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Geoff Johns |author2= Phil Jimenez |author3=George Perez |author4=Jerry Ordway |author5=Ivan Reis |author6=Andy Lanning | title = Infinite Crisis | publisher = DC Comics | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4012-0959-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle teams with the [[Martian Manhunter]] in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society's]] global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the ''Infinite Crisis'' storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Marc |last= Andreyko |title= Nightwing Annual 2 |year= 2007 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When DC continuity jumps forward [[One Year Later|one year]] after the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Oracle and her team continue to work in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Oracle works with Batman, although not on a regular basis as before. Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey, and expands the ranks of the operation. In ''Birds of Prey'' #99, Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team's ''de facto'' field leader, while [[Big Barda]] is brought in as the group's heavy-hitter alongside a larger, rotating roster. Oracle also makes an attempt to reforge her alliance with Power Girl. However, when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team, she replies that she will do so "when Hell freezes over."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Gail |last= Simone |title= Birds of Prey: Blood and Circuits |year= 2007 | publisher= DC Comics | isbn = 978-1-4012-1371-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She struggles to keep the identities of the world's heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], a villainous hacker and information broker.

In "Whitewater", Gail Simone's final story arc on ''Birds of Prey'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Gail |last= Simone |title= Birds of Prey: Whitewater |year= 2007 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle and her team struggle for power with [[Spy Smasher#Katarina Armstrong|Spy Smasher]], a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization. Eventually, Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle. At the conclusion of the arc, Oracle also adopts [[Misfit (DC Comics)|Misfit]] into the Birds of Prey. [[Sean McKeever]] temporarily took over as author of ''Birds of Prey'', writing issues #113–117, ''Birds of Prey: Metropolis or Dust'' (2008). The following arc of the series ''Birds of Prey: Platinum Flats'' (2008) is written by [[Tony Bedard]]. In the company-wide 2008 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Darkseid]]—who has finally gained control of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]—attempts to put the mind-control equation on the internet. Both Oracle and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid, even attempting to shut down the entire Internet. Unfortunately, they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid. Freed from Darkseid's control after the restoration of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], she attempts to shut down the criminal ''Unternet'' set up by her opposite number, the Calculator, as a Darkseid-free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech-savvy criminals. However, the Calculator, preventing her moves, takes control of the [[Maxwell Lord#Publication history|Kilg%re]], gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars, and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers. Even though Oracle foils him, she starts doubting her abilities and fears she's losing her edge and brilliance, which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul-searching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Antony J. L. |last= Bedard|title=Birds of Prey #127|publisher=DC Comics|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Birds of Prey'' received cancellation in early 2009, with the final issue being #127.

Oracle is subsequently featured in ''Oracle: The Cure'', a limited series written by [[Kevin VanHook]] and a crossover arc with ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' (2009). The story chronologically follows the events of ''Final Crisis'' and ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' (2008). Oracle has returned to Gotham, and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded, she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham. The Calculator's plans finally come to their fruition, and Kuttler, hoping to save his dying daughter [[Wendy and Marvin|Wendy]] takes on the "Babbage" alias and begins prowling the digital world of ''Alta Viva'', a [[virtual world]] game, for fragments of the Anti-Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid. Oracle, now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham, becomes aware of Kuttler's activities after "Cheesefiend", one of her informants, is brutally killed, with the Anti-Life Equation itself, after coming in contact with Babbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first= Kevin |last= VanHook| authorlink= Kevin VanHook |title=Oracle: The Cure ''#1''|publisher=DC Comics|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti-Life Equation in his possession, Oracle travels to Hong Kong, hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage. However the Calculator discovers her attempts, swearing vengeance upon her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Kevin |last= VanHook|title=Oracle: The Cure ''#2''|publisher=DC Comics|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She manages to defeat Calculator, rendering the Anti-Life Equation's fragments useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Kevin |last= VanHook|title= Oracle: The Cure ''#3''|publisher=DC Comics| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the ''Batgirl'' comic book was relaunched with [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] starring as the title character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. In addition, she also mentors the Calculator's daughter, [[Wendy and Marvin|Wendy Harris]], who was crippled following an attack at [[Titans Tower]].&lt;ref name=Batgirl3&gt;{{citation|authorlink= Bryan Q.

Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at [[Gotham Central]]. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated [[King Snake]] and the [[Trigger Twins]]. After being rescued by Batman, [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes.

=== The New 52: ''Batgirl'', ''Birds of Prey'', and other appearances (2011–2016) ===
In September, 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new ''Batgirl'' series—one of [[The New 52]] titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, "our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters."&lt;ref name="New 52"&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Doran|title=DC Releases New "The New 52" Info &amp; Answers to Retailers|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-the-new-52-retailer-info-110701.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne also stated that "''The Killing Joke'' still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences.&lt;ref name="New 52"/&gt; Public reaction to the change has been mixed, and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as "being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle."&lt;ref name="OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be"&gt;{{citation|author=Jill Pantozzi|title=OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/oracle-is-stronger-than-batgirl-110606.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Batgirl Triumphant: The Price of Restoring DC Comics' Disabled Heroine |url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/06/batgirl-barbara-gordon-disabled/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609185128/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/06/batgirl-barbara-gordon-disabled |archivedate=June 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Fixing" Barbara Gordon's Legs: The Politics of Retconning a Disability|url=http://www.sequart.org/magazine/1236/fixing-barbara-gordons-legs-the-politics-of-retconning-a-disability/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DC Comics co-publisher [[Dan DiDio]] explained the decision by stating that "[w]e didn't want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl]. We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jen Doll|title=Comic Fans to Gather in Times Square at Midnight for Launch of 'The New 52'|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/08/dc_comics_new_52.php|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=August 30, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214191053/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/08/dc_comics_new_52.php|archivedate=February 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It's a bit of a shock, to be sure, but we're doing everything we can to be respectful to this character's amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time&amp;nbsp;... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling."&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

In the new, revised continuity, the events of ''The Killing Joke'' took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{citation|author=Vaneta Rogers|title=GAIL SIMONE on Revelations About BATGIRL's Miraculous Cure|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/gail-simone-batgirl-cure-revelations-120111.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is "one of the smartest and toughest women in comics&amp;nbsp;... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that "some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara's spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate."&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

Prior to release, ''Batgirl'' #1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. Along with ''Action Comics'' #1, ''Justice League'' #1, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1, ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' #1, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]'' #1, ''Detective Comics'' #1, ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' #1, ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' #1, and ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #1, retailers were required to order a second printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Vaneta Rogers|title=Ten NEW 52 Titles Exceed 100k, DC Touts Sales Success|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dc-touts-new-52-sales-success-110912.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=September 12, 2011|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Mark |last= Langshaw|title='Action Comics' No. 1, 'Batgirl' No. 1 sell out at distribution level| url=http://www.digitalspy.com/comics/news/a338458/action-comics-1-batgirl-1-sell-out-at-distribution-level.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Reid of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' states in a review of the first issue: "The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone's script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl.

In October 2014, the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher (writer) [[Cameron Stewart]] (writer, layouts), [[Babs Tarr]] (artist) and Maris Wicks (colors). The first six-issue story explored Barbara Gordon's attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside. While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone's darker preceding run, the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs' inability to fully escape her [[Batman: The Killing Joke|earlier trauma]] and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans, an algorithm similar to the pre-New 52 Oracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooker|first1=Will|last2=LeBas|first2=Samantha|title='The Burnside HOOQ-Up: Special Edition – I Made A Backup (The Oracle Theory)'|url=http://multiversitycomics.com/annotations/the-burnside-hooq-up-special-edition-i-made-a-backup-the-oracle-theory/|website=Multiversity Comics|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the reboot was highly praised for its innovative use of social media, its fun and energy, and particularly for Tarr's art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CBR News|title='Batgirl 36 Review'|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=7993|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; several critics condemned the villain Dagger Type in issue #37 as a transphobic caricature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Rachel|title='Disappointment Again: Batgirl 37 is Transphobic'|url=http://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2014/12/12/disappointment-again-batgirl-37-is-transphobic/|website=Women Write About Comics|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.

On March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to ''Batgirl'' #41 by artist [[Rafael Albuquerque]] that took its inspiration from ''The Killing Joke''. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.

[[File:Batgirl Vol 5 7.png|thumb|Batgirl as she appears in volume five of her eponymous series. Cover of ''Batgirl'' vol. 5, #7 (March 2017)&lt;br&gt;Art by Chris Wildgoose]]
The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The [[hashtag]] #changethecover drew hundreds of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled."&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Albert (March 16, 2015).

=== Alternative versions ===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Barbara Gordon}}

Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as ''[[Elseworlds]]'' and ''[[All Star DC Comics]]'' have also featured alternate versions of the character.

Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in ''Elseworlds'' comics since 1997. The ''Elseworlds'' imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes "as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=M.

In addition, the character has supporting roles in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' (1998), ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author = [[Fabian Nicieza]] |title = ''JLA: Created Equal'' |year = 2000 |publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author = [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]|title = ''Superman/Batman Generations II'' #2 |year = 2003 |publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Batman: Year 100]]'' (2006), and ''[[Batman: Earth One]]'' (2012).

In 2005, DC Comics launched its ''All Star'' imprint—an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to ''Elseworlds'', ''All Star'' is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to [[Dan DiDio]], "[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Rik Offenberger]] |title=Dan DiDio: DC Comics' All Star |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |year=2007 |url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/111605849050665.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204926/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/111605849050665.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'' (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous ''All Star Batgirl'' title, written by [[Geoff Johns]]; however, the series was canceled prior to publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Ben Morse| title = HEY NOW, YOU'RE AN ALL STAR |work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001559179.cfm | accessdate =November 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141004/http://wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001559179.cfm |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Batgirl: Future's End]]'' #1 (Nov. 2014), set in an alternate future, a trio of Batgirls include Casandra Cain, Stephanie Brown and newcomer Tiffany Fox—the daughter of [[Lucius Fox]] and the first African American character to be portrayed as Batgirl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Santori-Griffith|title=Review: BATGIRL: FUTURES END #1|url=http://www.comicosity.com/review-batgirl-futures-end-1/|publisher=Comicosity|date=2014-09-10|accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, DC began publishing ''DC Bombshells'', a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s. In Digital Issue 42 (collected in Print Issue 14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering "the Belle of the Bog", who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics Bombshells #14|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/dc-comics-bombshells-2015/dc-comics-bombshells-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''DC Comics Bombshells Annual #1'', published on 31 August 2016, reveals that Barbara Gourdon was a French fighter pilot during World War I.

== Critical and editorial commentary ==
{{quote box|quote=One could argue that curing Barbara and allowing her to be Batgirl again would simply allow her to do more good fighting crime than she ever could in a wheelchair, but then you look insensitive to the ability and usefulness she has in other capacities as Oracle. Conversely, you could say that removing Barbara from her wheelchair drastically alters her character, but then wouldn't that indicate that this is a character defined by her handicap? This begs the question of why so many fans adore her: is it because she's a bold and daring leader that rivals the Calculator in brains? Or is it because she's all of that, but stuck in a wheelchair? Think about the question, and surely many of you will find an answer you don't like.|source= — Joey Esposito, [[CraveOnline]], 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Joey Esposito |title=The Life and Times of Barbara Gordon |url=http://www.craveonline.com/comics/articles/146996-the-life-and-times-of-barbara-gordon |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |date=March 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605214208/http://www.craveonline.com/comics/articles/146996-the-life-and-times-of-barbara-gordon |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=350px}}

In  the aftermath of ''Batman: The Killing Joke'', Barbara Gordon's paralysis has been the subject of debate, with arguments in favor of, and against, restoring her mobility. Writers, artists, editorial staff and critics have spoken in great length about the nature of subject, citing responses from readership, issues of sexism, diversity and representation, as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character's portrayal.

=== Commentary in favor of Batgirl ===
Reacting to ''The Killing Joke'' and Barbara Gordon's later character development as Oracle in ''Batman: Gotham Knights'', Ray Tate, a reviewer at [[Comics Bulletin]], wrote "[t]here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant'' The Killing Joke'' as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker&amp;nbsp;... [Batman] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of [[stem cell]] technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair."&lt;ref name="LINE OF FIRE REVIEWS: Batman Gotham Knights #12"&gt;{{citation|author=Ray Tate |title=LINE OF FIRE REVIEWS: Batman Gotham Knights #12 |date=December 31, 2000 |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/97832472765596.htm |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522191812/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/97832472765596.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts "[i]t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl."&lt;ref name="LINE OF FIRE REVIEWS: Batman Gotham Knights #12"/&gt; In an article for ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine entitled "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: "Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years."&lt;ref name="bitch"/&gt;

Artist [[Alex Ross]] and writer/producer [[Paul Dini]] made attempts to return the character to her original conception. Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a [[Lazarus Pit]], a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that "we pitched then-Batman editor [[Denny O'Neil]] with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character&amp;nbsp;... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer."&lt;ref name="ALEX ROSS: GIVING BATWOMAN HER LOOK"&gt;{{citation | author = Dave Johnson | title = Alex ross: giving batwoman her look | publisher = Newsarama | year = 2006 | url = http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/52/Batwoman/BatwomanRoss.html | accessdate =September 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204921/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/52/Batwoman/BatwomanRoss.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1= Geoff Johns |author2=Grant Morrison |author3=Greg Rucka |author4=Mark Waid |others=Keith Giffen; J.G.

=== Commentary in favor of Oracle ===
{{Quote box|quote=Without much fanfare, Barbara Gordon has become the most popular handicapped character since [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]&amp;nbsp;... There WAS some idea of her being a role model&amp;nbsp;... We wanted her to cope with what had happened to her and becoming, in many ways, more effective as Oracle than she ever was as Batgirl. And we knew that others with disabilities might look at her and feel good reading about her&amp;nbsp;... I don't think people 'dance around' her disabilities as they don't want to focus on them, but on her character. These shouldn't be stories about a disabled person; they are stories about a compelling fascinating character who HAPPENS to be in a wheelchair and I think that's correct. Barbara isn't her handicap; there's more to her than that.|source= — John Ostrander, Comic Book Resources&lt;ref name="OSTRANDER ON ORACLE"&gt;{{citation | author =Beau Yarbrough | title = OSTRANDER ON ORACLE, MARTIAN MANHUNTER AND MARVEL'S WESTERN HEROES | publisher = Comic Book Resources | year = 1999 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=326 | accessdate =November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=350px}}

Although critical reception of Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle have been mixed among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle."&lt;ref name="OSTRANDER ON ORACLE"/&gt; Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President [[Dan DiDio]] comments, "Some stories&amp;nbsp;... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry]]'s sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Jordan Justin| title = WW PHILLY: Crisis counseling with Dan DiDio: DC jumps one year into the future | year = 2005 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=5129 | accessdate =October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character went through possible restoration during ''Birds of Prey'' when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of ''War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film'' (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that "[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when [[Christopher Reeve]] never had that opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Marc Dipaolo|title=War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|page=145|isbn=978-0-7864-4718-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration of the character's mobility and aftermath ===
In June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former ''Birds of Prey'' writer Gail Simone would be writing the series.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Doran|title=UPDATE 7: More DCnU BATMAN Reveals, BATMAN, INC. Info|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-detective-batman-titles-110606.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Dareh Gregorian|title=She's Bat in Action!|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/she_bat_in_action_khKyEe07oducT2eV8Fk0EJ|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=August 29, 2011|accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with [[muscular dystrophy]], stated that "people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It's that type of honesty I expect more of&amp;nbsp;... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I've seen in a long time."&lt;ref name="OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be"/&gt; Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed.&lt;ref name="Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL &amp; ORACLE"&gt;{{citation|author=Jill Pantozzi|title=Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL &amp; ORACLE|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/gail-simone-dicusses-batgirl-and-oracle-110609.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing ''Batgirl'' with Gordon as the title character was that "[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of [[Purple Ray|purple rays]] and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point."&lt;ref name="Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL &amp; ORACLE"/&gt;

Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, "[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals&amp;nbsp;... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn't involve violence."&lt;ref name="endure"&gt;{{citation|author=Vaneta Rogers|title=Why They Endure(d): ORACLE Remembered by Creators, Advocates|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/why-they-endured-oracle-110907.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, "Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration."&lt;ref name="endure"/&gt; Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that "[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era&amp;nbsp;... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful."&lt;ref name="endure"/&gt;

== Characterization ==

=== Silver Age ===
At the time of her conception, Barbara Gordon's character was intended to reflect the [[women's liberation movement]] as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; In ''The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines'' (2009), author Mike Madrid states: "While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs."&lt;ref name="supergirls"/&gt; Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections.&lt;ref name="Gina Renée Misiroglu"&gt;{{citation|author=Gina Renée Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=724–726|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair "tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative—not to say dowdy—clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day--busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior."&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that "[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]"&lt;ref name="Gina Renée Misiroglu"/&gt;

=== Bronze Age ===
In spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, "by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts". Her color scheme from the '' Adventures of Batman'' cartoon are used as her primary outfit.&lt;ref name="Gina Renée Misiroglu"/&gt; However, by the end of the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise "where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels".&lt;ref name="Spy"/&gt; In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.&lt;ref name="Gina Renée Misiroglu"/&gt;

=== Modern Age ===
Robin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews'' notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in ''Batman: The Killing Joke'', stating, "Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings."&lt;ref name="RAR"/&gt; Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer [[Devin Grayson]] stated that being "[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind."&lt;ref name="The Superhero Book"&gt;{{citation|author=Gina Renée Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's ''Birds of Prey'' issue #10, "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that "[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Loren Di Iorio |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/96477345452404.htm |title=Chuck Dixon Chats with Loren Di Iorio |publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |date=July 28, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422141903/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/96477345452404.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's ''Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds'' when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gail Simone|title=Birds of Prey #59|publisher=DC Comics|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.&lt;ref name="Hero Hunters"/&gt;

=== The New 52 ===
As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's paralysis is described as lasting only three years time. In ''Batgirl'' (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having earned a degree in [[forensic psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Gail Simone]]|penciler=Ardian Syaf|inker=Vicente Cifuentes|title=Batgirl|issue=3|volume=4|publisher=DC Comics|date=February 2012|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt; The character also exhibits [[survivor guilt]] due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt; In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Josie Campbell|title=Simone Adds "Batgirl," "Fury of Firestorm" to DC's New 52|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=34263|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Batgirl #45, Barbara Gordon began a romantic relationship with [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Luke Fox]], the son of [[Lucius Fox]] and the new Batwing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Batgirl's' creative team pops a new romantic question: Is three company, or a crowd?|author=David Betancourt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/10/28/batgirls-creative-team-pops-a-new-romantic-question-is-three-company-or-a-crowd/|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Brenden Fletcher, Cameron Stewart|artist=Babs Tarr|title=Batgirl|issue=45|volume=4|date=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the character's background and previous relationships were erased. According to the artist of the new Batgirl series, [[Babs Tarr]], Barbara Gordon and [[Dick Grayson]] were never romantically involved in the New 52 continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BATGIRL Breaks DICK’s Heart For FOX, Readies for 2016 Status Quo Change|author=Vaneta Rogers|url=http://www.newsarama.com/26551-batgirl-team-on-dick-grayson-s-heartbreak-status-quo-change-for-barbara.html|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DC Rebirth ===
For DC's 2016 [[DC Rebirth]] launch, Barbara Gordon headlines two monthly series: ''Batgirl'' and ''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey''.

== Powers and abilities ==

=== Martial artistry ===
According to the character's fictional biography, Barbara Gordon trained in [[Judo]],&lt;ref name=BarbaraGordonMartialArts&gt;''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #2 (April 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kung Fu]], [[Eskrima]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Karate]]&lt;ref name="BarbaraGordonMartialArts" /&gt; and [[Jujutsu]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; earning black belts prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a "star athlete."&lt;ref name=SO20 /&gt; Following the events of ''The Killing Joke'', Barbara Gordon continued to train in martial arts as Oracle, despite being paralyzed from the waist down. She has extensive skills with [[eskrima]] fighting sticks, small firearms, and batarangs; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency. In the revised continuity of The New 52, she reflects on the fact that she has been taking self-defense training since age six in ''Batgirl'' #0 (2012).

=== Intelligence and technological skill ===
Gordon is written as having a genius-level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory.&lt;ref name="Scott Peterson"&gt;{{citation | author = Scott Peterson | title = ''A Little Knowledge Showcase 94'' #12 | publisher = DC Comics | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alex Zalben|title=SDCC 2011: The LAST New DC Comics 52 Panel Recap|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/07/26/sdcc-2011-the-last-new-dc-comics-52-panel-recap/|publisher=MTV|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by [[Lex Luthor]] during his tenure as President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Matt Brady | title = The simone files i: birds of prey – updated | publisher = newsarama.com | year = 2007 | url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98825 | accessdate =December 19, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014175327/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98825 | archivedate = October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information broker ===
As Oracle, Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe's heroes.&lt;ref name="Scott Peterson"/&gt; She is a skilled hacker, capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites, military installations, government files, and the properties of Lex Luthor.&lt;ref name="Hero Hunters"&gt;{{citation|author= Gail Simone |title= ''Birds of Prey'' #80 |year= 2006 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman, himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance. Writer and editor Dennis O'Neil, who first established Oracle as Batman's intellectual equal and source of information, stated that "[i]t was logical for her to be there in Batman's world&amp;nbsp;... Batman would need someone like that."&lt;ref name="endure"/&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the ''Batman'' television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons.&lt;ref name="Overviews"&gt;{{citation|author1=Frances H. Early |author2=Kathleen Kennedy |title=Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|year=2003|page=187|isbn=978-0-313-33589-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Brian Cronin, in ''Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed'' (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, "Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon."&lt;ref name="Spy"/&gt; Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of ''The Killing Joke'', Barbara Gordon—in her new persona as Oracle—became "more popular, in fact, than she was when she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes[.]"&lt;ref name="Spy"/&gt; The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics, and is the only female character to appear on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Joseph Pisani]] | title = The Smartest Superheroes |work=BusinessWeek | year = 2006 | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | accessdate =November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Barbara Gordon was ranked 17th in both [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" and ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics".&lt;ref name="Top 100 Comic Book Heroes"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17 | title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 20| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist interpretations ===
In ''The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines'' (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, "she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden."&lt;ref name="supergirls"/&gt; Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male."&lt;ref name="supergirls"/&gt; Historian [[Peter Sanderson]] observed that while "Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian&amp;nbsp;... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)"&lt;ref name="Sanderson 2007"&gt;{{citation|author=[[Peter Sanderson]] | title = Comics in Context #67: Catch As Cats Can | year = 2007 | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595646p7.html |publisher=IGN| accessdate =November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Barbara Kesel]], after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in ''Detective Comics''. Robin Anne Reid, in ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews'' (2009), wrote that "Kesel's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her ''Secret Origins'' (1987) and ''Batgirl Special'' (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore's acclaimed ''The Killing Joke'' (1988)."&lt;ref name="RAR"&gt;{{citation|author=Robin Anne Reid|title=Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|pages=88, 89|isbn=978-0-313-33591-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that Kesel's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states "[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character."&lt;ref name="RAR"/&gt;

In ''Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks'' (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that "[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material", calling the work "sadistic to the core."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sharon Packer|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=201|isbn=978-0-313-35536-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cronin noted that "[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out."&lt;ref name="Spy"/&gt; Jeffrey A. Brown, author of ''Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture'' (2011) noted ''The Killing Joke'' as an example of the "inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry" in light of the "relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to."&lt;ref name="curves"/&gt; While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage.&lt;ref name="curves"/&gt; Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, "if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly."&lt;ref name="RAR"/&gt;

Despite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman "rather than standing alone as leader, such as [[Wonder Woman]]" who had no pre-existing male counterpart.&lt;ref name="Girl Culture"/&gt; In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, "while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names" such as the Batgirl character.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=[[Becky Francis]] |author2=Christine Skelton |title=Reassessing Gender and Achievement: Questioning Contemporary Key Debates|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2005|page=146|isbn=978-0-415-33324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at [[Marquette University]], stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, "she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps."&lt;ref name="endure"/&gt; Following ''The Killing Joke'', her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of ''Birds of Prey'', "we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman."&lt;ref name="endure"/&gt;

=== Representation for library and information science ===
In ''The Image and Role of the Librarian'' (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a "career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up."&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; In the essay "Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that "[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Abigail |last=Luthmann|title=Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality|journal=Library Review|volume=56|issue=9|pages=773–80 |doi=10.1108/00242530710831211|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, "[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life)."&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting "to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD"&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; In her new persona, "the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-dom—the 'information goddess' as crime stopper."&lt;ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian"/&gt; Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for [[business networking]]. In ''How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work'' (2008) he states that "[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sean Wise|title=How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2008|page=151|isbn=978-0-399-53456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the [[American Library Association]] and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy. These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon. In 2004, artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library. Her Batgirl costume appears in a window's reflection. The tagline "Librarians are heroes every day!" appears at the bottom of the poster and bookmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gene Ha Gallery|url=http://geneha.com/superheroes/4585607115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gene Ha Bookmark and Poster|url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2012/12/batgirl-works-at-library.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a poster featured Barbara Gordon as the Oracle alongside Batman, Nightwing, Robin, the Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, and Huntress.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bat Team Poster|url=http://chicagopubliclibrary.tumblr.com/post/105131476/librarianpirate-alas-newest-read-poster-i-love}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the ALA and DC Comics collaborated on a new set of posters and bookmarks in the ALA's "READ" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=DC Comics Superhero Set|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11422}}&lt;/ref&gt; By herself, Barbara Gordon appears in the "Batgirl of Burnside" guise as envisioned by Babs Tarr.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Batgirl Poster|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Batgirl Bookmark|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11425}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another design, she appears as the Oracle alongside other members of the extended Bat Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Li'l Gotham Poster|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Li'l Gotham Bookmark|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation for the disabled ===
Following the character's reinvention as the information broker Oracle, she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for disabled people. In ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'' (2008), author T. James Musler notes that "[f]or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable" citing [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness.&lt;ref name="TJM"&gt;{{citation|author=T. James Musler|title=Unleashing the Superhero in Us All|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]]|year=2008|page=62|isbn=978-1-4357-4633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states "[r]ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information."&lt;ref name="TJM"/&gt; Her character thus signifies that "[n]o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not."&lt;ref name="TJM"/&gt; In ''The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes'' (2004), author Gina Renée Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or—as with Charles Xavier and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]—are introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, "[a]s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it."&lt;ref name="The Superhero Book"/&gt; James B. South's chapter "Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism" in the 2004 book ''Superheroes and Philosophy'' analyzes how the changes in her life "from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle" drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=James B. South | title = Superheroes and Philosophy | pages = 89–101 | publisher = [[Open Court]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8126-9573-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yvonne Craig Batgirl.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Yvonne Craig]] as Batgirl|alt=Yvonne Craig poses in the Batgirl costume from the 1960s television show]]
Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (1967). Les Daniels, in ''Batman: The Complete History'' (2004) wrote that the goal of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was to "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men."&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt; According to Craig: "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle&amp;nbsp;... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice."&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt; A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes portrayed later in television (such as Wonder Woman and the [[The Bionic Woman|Bionic Woman]]), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen.&lt;ref name="Overviews"/&gt; As such, "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use."&lt;ref name="Overviews"/&gt; However, Craig has also stated: "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model&amp;nbsp;... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that's lovely."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ashley McAllister | title = From the Library: Batgirl! | url = http://bitchmagazine.org/post/from-the-library-batgirl |publisher=Bitch Media| date = August 15, 2010|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate [[equal pay for women]].&lt;ref name="Girl Culture"&gt;{{citation|author1=Claudia Mitchell |author2=Jacqueline Reid-Walsh |title=Girl Culture: Studying Girl Culture : A Readers' Guide|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2008|page=170|isbn=978-0-313-33908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''Batman'', the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media.&lt;ref name="Girl Culture"/&gt; As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' (1968), Melendy Britt in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' (1977), [[Melissa Gilbert]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1992), [[Tara Strong]] in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (1997) and ''[[Beware the Batman]]'' (2013), Danielle Judovits in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' (2004), [[Mae Whitman]] in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' (2008)&lt;ref name="Girl Culture"/&gt; and [[Alyson Stoner]] in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (2011). ''The Batman'' series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by [[Kellie Martin]] in the episode "Artifacts" (2007). She also appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' voiced by [[Mae Whitman]] in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as [[Batgirl]]. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by [[Stockard Channing]] and [[Angie Harmon]] in 1999's ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.&lt;ref name="Girl Culture"/&gt;

[[Dina Meyer]] starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs&amp;nbsp;... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ian Spelling|title=Meyer's 'Prey' Role Has A Different Twist|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=September 28, 2002|page=2|issn=1074-7109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Bianco|title='Birds' Has Looks But Flies Too Low|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2002|page=D.04|issn=0734-7456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Vince Horiuchi|title=The WB's 'Birds of Prey' Needs Special Powers to Attract Viewers|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=October 9, 2002|page=C.8|issn=0746-3502}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', after [[Felicity Smoak]] suffered a similar paralyzing injury, [[Oliver Queen]] gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that "Oracle" was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Arrow |title=A.W.O.L. |date=27 January 2016}} Oliver: "Overwatch, we're on site." Felicity: "Excuse me?" Oliver: "Well, I thought it was time you got a code name. What do you think?" Felicity: "It's perfect." Oliver: "Was gonna go with Oracle, but it's taken."&lt;/ref&gt; Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the [[Teen Titans]] she was slated to appear in the live-action ''[[Teen Titans#Live-action television|Titans]]'' series for [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abandoned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/exclusive-which-dc-characters-will-be-on-tnts-the-titans/ |title=Exclusive: Which DC Characters Will Be On TNT's The Titans/ |publisher=Nerdist |last=Diaz |first=Eric |date=February 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202210414/http://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/exclusive-which-dc-characters-will-be-on-tnts-the-titans/ |archivedate=February 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in ''[[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin]]'', ''[[Batman: Vengeance]]'', ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 92.&lt;/ref&gt; She plays a supporting role as Oracle in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' for the [[personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], serving as Batman's guide through [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham]], and is voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]]. She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth, as they both serve as Batman's guides in the sequel, ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. A teenage Barbara also appears in the prequel ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne. In the 2008 live-action film, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', a very young Barbara Gordon is depicted. She is credited as "Gordon's Daughter", while the name "Barbara Gordon" is reserved for Commissioner Gordon's wife. She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Katherine Catmull for the [[personal computer|PC]] and the [[PlayStation 3]]. She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower. She is a playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', with Kimberly Brooks reprising her role. Barbara has returned in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' where she is voiced by [[Ashley Greene]]. In addition, Barbara also appears as a playable character as part of the game's season pass.

Barbara Gordon appears in the 2017 animated film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]. She is introduced taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5859">'''Charles Donald Albury''' (October 12, 1920 – May 23, 2009) was an [[Americans|American]] military [[aviator]] who participated in both [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. He co-piloted the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[B-29]] [[bomber]] known as the ''[[Bockscar]]'' during the mission which dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Charles Donald Albury dies at 88; copilot on the Nagasaki bomb plane|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-charles-albury9-2009jun09,0,954488.story |work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bombing of Nagasaki]] killed an estimated 40,000 people instantly, and led to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945, ending [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Albury was born in 1920 at his parents' home in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The [[Miami Police Department]] building currently stands on the site of Albury's [[birthplace]], as of 2009.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===World War II===
Albury enrolled at the [[University of Miami]]'s [[engineering]] school, but dropped out before he completed his [[bachelor's degree]] in order to enlist in the [[United States Army]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He was one of three pilots assigned under the command of Captain [[Charles Sweeney]] to test the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#XB-29|XB-29]] and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#YB-29|YB-29]] delivered to [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in September 1943. Albury joined (now Major) Sweeny at [[Wendover Air Force Base]] in [[Utah]] where he and Sweeney were invited by Colonel [[Paul Tibbets]] to join what would become the nucleus of the [[509th Composite Group]] in September 1944. (The 509th Composite Group was activated December 17, 1944.) Tibbets initially organized two air crews: one headed by himself with [[Robert A. Lewis]] as co-pilot (cockpit crew of the [[Enola Gay]] during the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]), the other headed by Sweeney with Albury as the co-pilot. Roberts and Albury acted as pilots and crew commanders for their respective planes when Tibbets and/or Sweeney were not flying.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney: 38–39, 81, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic bombing of Hiroshima===
On August 6, 1945, Albury witnessed the first atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] as pilot of the instrument observation plane, [[The Great Artiste]], which accompanied the [[Enola Gay]] commanded by Tibbets.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney: 164–71&lt;/ref&gt; Albury measured the levels of [[radioactivity]] and [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] of the atomic bomb from his plane.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He would later state in an interview with [[Time Magazine]], "When Tibbets dropped the bomb, we dropped our instruments and made our left turn. Then this bright light hit us and the top of that [[mushroom cloud]] was the most terrifying, but also the most beautiful, thing you've ever seen in your life. Every color in the [[rainbow]] seemed to be coming out of it."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Atomic bombing of Nagasaki===
On August 9, 1945, just three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, Sweeney's crew, with Albury as co-pilot, took off in the [[B-29 Superfortress]], nicknamed the [[Bockscar]], which would drop the atomic bomb known as the "[[Fat Man]]" on the city of [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney: 207–26&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was delayed by cloud cover until the crew located a hole in the clouds.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The Bockscar dropped the 10,200-pound "[[Fat Man]]" on the city of Nagasaki, instantly killing 40,000 people, the vast majority of them munitions workers.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; An additional 35,000 Japanese citizens would succumb from [[radiation sickness]] and other injuries in the aftermath of the bombing.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Immediately after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, Albury flew with Tibbetts, Sweeney and close to twenty other members of their aircrews to Japan. The group eventually reached Nagasaki and witnessed on the ground the destruction caused by the atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney: 247, 252–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Albury stated repeatedly during his life that he did not have any [[remorse]] for the attack or his role in the attack on [[Nagasaki]], noting that many more lives would have been lost if the [[United States]] had launched a full [[Operation Downfall|invasion of mainland Japan]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Life following World War II===
At the end of the second world war, Albury moved to [[Coral Gables, Florida]] with his wife, Roberta.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He chose a career as a commercial airline pilot for the now defunct [[Eastern Airlines]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He later became the co-[[management|manager]] of Eastern's [[Airbus A300]] training program. He later moved to a house in Hunter's Creek (south Orlando) where he lived until his death.

Charles Donald Albury died on May 23, 2009, at a hospital in [[Orlando, Florida]], at the age of 88. He had suffered from congestive heart failure for several years before his death.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He appeared in the [[Smithsonian Networks]] program ''Smithsonian Channel's War Stories'', "The Men Who Brought the Dawn", in 1995, giving his recollections and reflections on the two atomic bomb missions.

Evans was loaned to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2007, where he scored 10 goals in 28 league appearances, before returning to his parent club. With first team opportunities at City limited he was subsequently sold to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for £3 million in 2009. After an unspectacular first two seasons at [[Bramall Lane]] he scored 35 goals during the [[2011–12 Sheffield United F.C. season|2011–12 season]].

Evans was [[R v Evans|convicted of rape]] in April 2012 and spent two and a half years in prison. His conviction was quashed on 21 April 2016 by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and a retrial was ordered. On 14 October 2016, he was found not guilty. Prior to the retrial, he joined [[Chesterfield F.

===Sheffield United===
In April 2014, Sheffield United Co-Chairman [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] and new manager [[Nigel Clough]] met with Evans in [[HM Prison Wymott]] to discuss the possibility of Sheffield United re-signing Evans after his release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgens |first=Dave |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/ched-evans-sheffield-united-striker-to-return-to-club-after-rape-sentence-despite-petition-garnering-60000-signatures-against-him-9666380.html |title=Sheffield United striker 'to return' to club after rape sentence, despite petition garnering 60,000 signatures against him |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following speculation that Evans could rejoin his former club, a petition was signed by 150,000 people urging the club not to do so, which stated that it would be a "deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist".&lt;ref name=ccrc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29541498|title=Ched Evans: PFA chief Gordon Taylor backs player's return|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Mike |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1317716/petition-to-stop-ched-evans-sheffield-return |title=Petition To Stop Ched Evans' Sheffield Return |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |publisher=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pidd |first=Helen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/13/sheffield-united-ched-evans-rape-re-sign-prison |title=Sheffield United urged not to re-sign rapist Ched Evans |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28769026 |title=Ched Evans petition: Sheffield United urged not to re-employ rape footballer |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Percy |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sheffield-united/11032474/Sheffield-United-face-opposition-to-plans-to-re-sign-former-striker-Ched-Evans.html |title=Sheffield United face opposition to plans to re-sign former striker Ched Evans|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/11167114/Ched-Evans-should-never-be-allowed-to-play-a-professional-football-match-again.html|title=Ched Evans should never be allowed to play a professional football match again|date=16 October 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, following his release from prison, it was announced that Evans would resume training with Sheffield United after the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] had requested that Sheffield United let Evans train at the club as they were his last club before his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Sheffield United allow training return at PFA request|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29980279|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was controversial, and caused television presenter [[Charlie Webster]], businesswoman Lindsay Graham and musicians [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry]] and [[Paul Heaton]] to resign as patrons of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Charlie Webster resigns as Sheffield United patron|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30015701|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Alex|title=Another Sheffield United patron, Lindsay Graham, quits in row over Ched Evans training with club|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/another-sheffield-united-patron-lindsay-graham-quits-in-row-over-ched-evans-training-with-club-1-6948513|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=[[The Star (Sheffield)]]|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dave Berry"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30028738 | title=Ched Evans row: Sheffield United patron Dave Berry resigns | publisher=BBC News | date=12 November 2014 | accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heaton"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-30087979 | title=Sheffield United patron Paul Heaton resigns over Ched Evans rape row | publisher=BBC News | date=17 November 2014 | accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athlete [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]] stated that she would want her name removed from a [[Bramall Lane#Jessica Ennis stand|stand at Bramall Lane]] if Evans was signed by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Jessica Ennis-Hill makes Sheffield United warning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30046618|accessdate=14 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Football League]] stated that although they recognised the gravity of Evans' crime, they valued the reintegration of reformed criminals and could not take any action against any club which would hire Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Football League would have to 'accept' signing|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30014184|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield United manager [[Nigel Clough]] said on 12 November that the club were "no where near" signing Evans, citing his 30 months out of the professional game and an important run of fixtures as reasons why a decision would not be taken immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans 'nowhere near' Sheffield United contract|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30023525|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DBL Logistics, Sheffield United's sponsor on the back of their shirts, stated that they would end their sponsorship if Evans was signed by the club. John Holland Sales, who sponsor on the front of the shirts, declared that they would "re-evaluate" their relation to the club if he were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Sheffield United shirt sponsor in quit threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30023525|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November, Sheffield United withdrew their offer to allow Evans to use their training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30054475|title=Sheffield United will not let convicted rapist train|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-chairman Jim Phipps, however, attributed the decision to "mob-like behaviour", stating his belief that Evans had a right to return to his career having served his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ched Evans: Sheff Utd's Phipps 'angry' over training U-turn|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30151774|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hartlepool United===
In December 2014, [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] manager [[Ronnie Moore]] said that he would like Evans to join the club. The comment brought criticism from [[Hartlepool (UK Parliament constituency)|Hartlepool]]'s [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]], [[Iain Wright]], who described Evans as a "[[Outcast (person)|pariah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/20/ronnie-moore-admits-hartlepool-united-interest-in-signing-ched-evans | title=Ronnie Moore admits Hartlepool United interest in signing Ched Evans | work=The Guardian | date=20 December 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club later followed up this headline with a statement saying that Hartlepool does not wish to sign Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/news/article/hartlepool-united-statement-on-ched-evans-2157918.aspx | title=Club Statement | work=Hartlepool United Club Website | date=21 December 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hibernians===
On 2 January 2015, [[Hibernians F.C.|Hibernians]] of the [[Maltese Premier League]], through their English vice-president [[Stephen Vaughan, Sr.|Stephen Vaughan]], announced that they had offered Evans a contract up to the end of the season.&lt;ref name="Indie_20150102"&gt;{{cite news | title = Ched Evans has been offered a contract - in Malta | author = Tim Moynihan | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 2 January 2015 | accessdate = 3 January 2015 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ched-evans-offered-contract-with-maltas-hibernians-football-club-9955259.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] said that such a move would not be possible as Evans was a convicted sex offender on licence and, as such, barred from working abroad.&lt;ref name=malta&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/03/malta-prime-minister-hibernians-ched-evans | title=Ministry of Justice steps in to prevent Ched Evans from playing abroad | work=The Guardian | agency=3 January 2015 | accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta's Prime Minister, [[Joseph Muscat]], warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister [[Owen Bonnici]] stated that Evans had a right to return to his profession after being released from prison.&lt;ref name=malta/&gt;

===Oldham Athletic===
On 4 January 2015, it was reported that Evans had been in discussion with League One club [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and was expected to sign for them in a deal which may be worth as little as £400 per week. The club's manager [[Lee Johnson (footballer)|Lee Johnson]] was reported to have expressed "grave reservations" about the signing, but was overruled by the club's owner [[Simon Corney]].&lt;ref name="Independent_20150104"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Ched Evans to Oldham exclusive: League One Latics manager Lee Johnson against idea of signing Evans | author = Ian Herbert | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 4 January 2015 | accessdate = 4 January 2015 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ched-evans-to-oldham-exclusive-league-one-latics-manager-lee-johnson-against-idea-of-signing-evans-9956932.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A petition against the signing gathered 19,000 signatures within a few hours&lt;ref name="BBC_Sport_2015-01-04"&gt;{{Cite news | title = BBC Sport - Ched Evans: Convicted rapist in talks with Oldham Athletic | last = Roan | first = Dan | work = BBC Sport | date = 4 January 2015 | accessdate = 4 January 2015 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30671692 | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 30,000 by the next day,&lt;ref name="BBC-30678251"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Ched Evans: Oldham say talks still ongoing for possible deal | date = 5 January 2015 | accessdate = 6 January 2015 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30678251 | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while politicians such as Labour Party leader [[Ed Miliband]] voiced their opposition to the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ched Evans: 'I wouldn't take footballer on,' Miliband says|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30680239|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2015, Oldham Athletic ended their interest in signing Evans, citing that proceeding could have resulted in "significant financial pressure" and would have "continued to be a divisive influence", while condemning the "vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ziegler|first1=Martyn|title=Ched Evans deal was axed after 'vile and abusive threats, including death threats', reveal Oldham|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ched-evans-deal-was-axed-after-vile-and-abusive-threats-including-death-threats-reveal-oldham-9966042.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Sport]] reported that a named relative of a staff member was threatened with rape, and that one sponsor already having ended their association with Oldham in protest and another saying that it would follow suit if Evans signed. The petition against Evans signing had reached over 60,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30727729 | title=Ched Evans: Oldham abandon bid to sign convicted rapist | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a total of ten other clubs (other than Oldham and Sheffield United) from League One and League Two told BBC Sport that they would not sign Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ched Evans: League One and Two clubs snub convicted rapist|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30698618|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2015, it was announced by [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] director [[John Fenty]] that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages in order to bring Evans to the [[Conference Premier]] club.

'''Claude Elwood Shannon''' (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American [[mathematician]], [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]], and [[cryptography|cryptographer]] known as "the father of [[information theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = I. | authorlink = Ioan James | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2009.0015 | title = Claude Elwood Shannon 30 April 1916 – 24 February 2001 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 55 | pages = 257–265 | year = 2009 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features/News_Feature_Detail_000025|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722011711/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/%21ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA%21%21?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features%2FNews_Feature_Detail_000025|title=Bell Labs Advances Intelligent Networks|archivedate=July 22, 2012|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'', that he published in 1948. He is, perhaps, equally well known for founding [[digital circuit]] design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old [[master's degree]] student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT)—he wrote [[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits|his thesis]] demonstrating that electrical applications of [[Boolean algebra]] could construct any logical numerical relationship.&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite book |last= Poundstone |first=William |title=Fortune's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street |location= |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8090-4599-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon contributed to the field of [[cryptanalysis]] for national defense during [[World War II]], including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure [[telecommunication]]s.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Shannon was born in [[Petoskey, Michigan]] and grew up in [[Gaylord, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Shannon|url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610003/shan.html|website=nyu.edu|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Claude, Sr. (1862–1934), a descendant of early settlers of [[New Jersey]], was a self-made businessman, and for a while, a Judge of [[Probate]]. Shannon's mother, [[Mabel Wolf Shannon]] (1890–1945), was a language teacher, and also served as the principal of [[Gaylord High School]].

Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from [[Gaylord High School]] in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire [[telegraph]] system to a friend's house a half-mile away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-claude-shannon-b-1916-bit-player.html?mcubz=1 "The Lives They Lived: Claude Shannon", ''New York Times'', 30 December 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the [[Western Union]] company.

His childhood hero was [[Thomas Edison]], who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of [[John Ogden (colonist)|John Ogden]] (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.&lt;ref name="MIT obituary"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shannon.html MIT Professor Claude Shannon dies; was founder of digital communications], MIT&amp;nbsp;— News office, Cambridge, Massachusetts, February 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sloane-wyner93"&gt;{{cite book| title=Claude Elwood Shannon: Collected Papers | editor1-first=N.J.A | editor1-last=Sloane | editor2-first=Aaron D. | editor2-last=Wyner | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]/[[IEEE Press]] | isbn=978-0-7803-0434-5 | date=1993 | url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0780304349.html | accessdate=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon was [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] and an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-374-70708-8|page=18|author=William Poundstone|quote=Shannon described himself as an atheist and was outwardly apolitical.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 13, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic circuits===
In 1932, Shannon entered the [[University of Michigan]], where he was introduced to the work of [[George Boole]]. He graduated in 1936 with two [[bachelor's degree]]s: one in [[electrical engineering]] and the other in [[mathematics]].

In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in [[electrical engineering]] at [[MIT]], where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an early [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Claude_E._Shannon |title=Claude E. Shannon, an oral history |author=Robert Price |work=IEEE Global History Network |year=1982 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the complicated ''ad hoc'' circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed [[switching circuit]]s based on [[Boole's inequality|Boole's concepts]]. In 1937, he wrote his [[master's degree]] thesis, ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]''.&lt;ref name="SymbolicAnalysis"&gt;Claude Shannon, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/11173/34541425-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,"] unpublished MS Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, August 10, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; A paper from this thesis was published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the [[electromechanical]] [[relay]]s that were used then in [[public switched telephone network|telephone call routing switches]]. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.&lt;ref name="SymbolicAnalysis" /&gt;

Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all [[Computer|electronic digital computers]]. Shannon's work became the foundation of [[digital circuit]] design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ''ad hoc'' methods that had prevailed previously. [[Howard Gardner]] called Shannon's thesis "possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution |first=Howard |last=Gardner |authorlink=Howard Gardner |publisher=Basic Books |year=1987 |isbn=0-465-04635-5 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon received his Ph.D. degree from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], in order to develop a mathematical formulation for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called ''An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Shannon, "An algebra for theoretical genetics," (Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1940), MIT-THESES//1940–3 [http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11174 Online text at MIT] — Contains a biography on pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1940, Shannon became a [[National Research Fellow]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and [[mathematician]]s such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]], and he also had occasional encounters with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Erico Marui Guizzo, “[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/39429/54526133-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory]” (M.S. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Humanities, Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies, 2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime research===
Shannon then joined [[Bell Labs]] to work on [[fire-control system]]s and [[cryptography]] during [[World War II]], under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).

Shannon is credited with the invention of [[signal-flow graph]]s, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = NASAP-70 User's and Programmer's manual|last = Okrent|first = Howard|publisher = School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California at Los Angeles|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Los Angeles, California|pages = 3–9|first2 = Lawrence P.|last2 = McNamee|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710025849.pdf|chapter = 3. 3 Flowgraph Theory|accessdate = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the [[U.S. Navy]]'s cryptanalytic service the methods used by the [[Government Communications Headquarters|British Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] to break the ciphers used by the [[Kriegsmarine]] [[U-boat]]s in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Hodges1992&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1992 | title = [[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] | publication-place = London | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] | pages = 243–252 | isbn = 978-0-09-911641-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria.&lt;ref name=Hodges1992 /&gt; Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the "[[Universal Turing machine]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Turing | first= A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | year = 1936 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | pages = 230–65 | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | pages = 544–6 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.

In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with "the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell, ''Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing Before Cybernetics'', (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 319-320. {{ISBN|0-8018-8057-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[Information Age]].

Shannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on [[communication theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', rev. ed., (New York: Simon and Schuster), 1996, pp. 743–751. {{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for [[Bell Telephone Labs]] entitled "A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography," dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as "[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that "they were so close together you couldn’t separate them".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to "develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Erico Marui Guizzo, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf "The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182200/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }} unpublished MS thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the [[cryptographic]] [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Claude (1949). "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems". Bell System Technical Journal 28 (4): 656–715.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information theory===
In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work, he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure of the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of [[information theory]]. In 1949 Claude Shannon and [[Robert Fano]] devised a systematic way to assign code words based on probabilities of blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1069|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, known as [[Shannon-Fano coding]], was first proposed in the 1948 article.

The book, co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver pointed out that the word "information" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.

Information theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

Another notable paper published in 1949 is "[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]", a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

He returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.

===Teaching at MIT===
In 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.

===Later life===
Shannon developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and spent the last few years of his life in a [[nursing home]] in [[Massachusetts]] oblivious to the marvels of the [[digital revolution]] he had helped create. He died in 2001. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon, his son, Andrew Moore Shannon, his daughter, Margarita Shannon, his sister, Catherine Shannon Kay, and his two granddaughters.&lt;ref name =SW&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Shannon.html | title=Shannon, Claude Elwood (1916–2001) | first=Eric | last=Weisstein | work=World of Scientific Biography | publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/shannon_claude.htm | title=Claude Shannon – computer science theory | work=www.thocp.net | publisher=The History of Computing Project | accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife stated in his obituary that, had it not been for Alzheimer's disease, "He would have been bemused" by it all.&lt;ref name="star ledger" /&gt;

=== Hobbies and inventions ===

[[File:Minivac 601.jpg|thumb|The [[Minivac 601]], a digital computer trainer designed by Shannon.]]

Outside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], and [[chess]]. He also invented many devices, including a [[Roman numeral]] computer called [[THROBAC]], [[robot juggling|juggling machines]], and a flame-throwing [[trumpet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?module=people&amp;type=related&amp;kv=12372 | title=People: Shannon, Claude Elwood | publisher=[[MIT Museum]] | accessdate=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the "[[Useless machine|Ultimate Machine]]", based on an idea by [[Marvin Minsky]]. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box (similar to : Qiyun Stealing Coin Cat Piggy Bank). In addition, he built a device that could solve the [[Rubik's Cube]] puzzle.&lt;ref name="MIT obituary"/&gt;

Shannon designed the [[Minivac 601]], a [[digital computer]] trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the [[Scientific Development Corp]] starting in 1961.

He is also considered the co-inventor of the first [[wearable computer]] along with [[Edward O. Thorp]].&lt;ref name="Wearable computer"&gt;[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/courses/mobwear/resources/thorp-iswc98.pdf The Invention of the First Wearable Computer Online paper by Edward O. Thorp of Edward O. Thorp &amp; Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; The device was used to improve the odds when playing [[roulette]].

===Personal life===
Shannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married [[Ben Barzman]].&lt;ref name=SoniGoodman&gt;{{cite book

Shannon met his second wife [[Betty Shannon]] (née Mary Elizabeth Moore) when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949.&lt;ref name=SW /&gt; Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/betty-shannon-unsung-mathematical-genius/|title=Betty Shannon, Unsung Mathematical Genius|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude and Betty Shannon had three children, Robert James Shannon, Andrew Moore Shannon, and Margarita Shannon, and raised his family in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]]. Their oldest son, Robert Shannon, died in 1998 at the age of 45.

After suffering from a progressive decline over some years due to [[Alzheimer's disease]], Shannon died at the age of 85, on February 24, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/27/nyregion/claude-shannon-mathematician-dies-at-84.html|title=Claude Shannon, Mathematician, Dies at 84|last=Johnson|first=George|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Tributes===
To commemorate Shannon's achievements, there were celebrations of his work in 2001.

There are currently six statues of Shannon sculpted by [[Eugene Daub]]: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the [[MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems|Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems]]; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the [[University of California, San Diego]]; one at Bell Labs; and another at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories|AT&amp;T Shannon Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/shannonstatue/|title=Claude Shannon Statue Dedications|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731230211/http://www.eecs.umich.edu/shannonstatue/|archivedate=July 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[breakup of the Bell System]], the part of Bell Labs that remained with [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] was named Shannon Labs in his honor.

According to [[Neil Sloane]], an [[AT&amp;T Fellow]] who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called [[information theory]]) is the foundation of the [[Digital Revolution|digital revolution]], and every device containing a [[microprocessor]] or [[microcontroller]] is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948:&lt;ref name="shannon paper"&gt;C. E. Shannon: ''A mathematical theory of communication.'' Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, pp. 379–423 and 623–656, July and October 1948&lt;/ref&gt; "He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him."&lt;ref name="star ledger"&gt;Bell Labs digital guru dead at 84&amp;nbsp;— Pioneer scientist led high-tech revolution (''[[Star-Ledger|The Star-Ledger]]'', obituary by Kevin Coughlin February 27, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The unit [[shannon (unit)|shannon]] is named after Claude Shannon.

''A Mind at Play'', a biography of Shannon written by [[Jimmy Soni]] and Rob Goodman, was published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elegance-of-ones-and-zeroes-1500667513 | title =

==Other work==
[[File:Shannonmouse.PNG|thumb|Shannon and his [[electromechanical]] mouse ''Theseus'' (named after [[Theseus]] from Greek mythology) which he tried to have solve the maze in one of the first experiments in [[artificial intelligence]].]]

===Shannon's mouse===
"Theseus", created in 1950, was a magnetic mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a [[maze|labyrinth]] of 25 squares. Its dimensions were the same as those of an average mouse.&lt;ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /&gt; The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions.&lt;ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /&gt; The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.&lt;ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /&gt; Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.&lt;ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /&gt;

===Shannon's estimate for the complexity of chess===
{{Main|Shannon number}}
In 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the [[Game complexity|game-tree complexity]] of [[chess]], which is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;. This number is now often referred to as the "Shannon number", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to [[Solving chess|solving the game of chess]] using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. [[Brute-force search|brute force analysis]]).&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Claude Shannon | title = Programming a Computer for Playing Chess | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 41 | issue = 314 | year = 1950 | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James Grime. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km024eldY1A "How many chess games are possible? (films by Brady Haran). MSRI, Mathematical Sciences".] Numberphile, July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shannon's computer chess program===
On March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called "Programming a Computer for playing Chess." The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in Philosophical Magazine, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to [[Solving chess|solve the game]].&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://billwall.phpwebhosting.com/articles/computer_early_chess.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. ''Material'' was counted according to the usual [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Artificial dreams: the quest for non-biological intelligence | author = Hamid Reza Ekbia | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-87867-8 | page = 46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each [[doubled pawn]], [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]. Another positional factor in the evaluation function was ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'', adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered [[checkmate]] to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper:

:The coefficients .5 and .1 are merely the writer's rough estimate. Furthermore, there are many other terms that should be included. The formula is given only for illustrative purposes. Checkmate has been artificially included here by giving the king the large value 200 (anything greater than the maximum of all other terms would do).

The evaluation function was clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic.

===Shannon's maxim===
Shannon formulated a version of [[Kerckhoffs's principle|Kerckhoffs' principle]] as "The enemy knows the system". In this form it is known as "Shannon's maxim".

==Commemorations==

===Shannon Centenary===
{{Update-section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Claude Shannon Centenary Logo.jpg|thumb|Claude Shannon Centenary]]
The Shannon Centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916. It was inspired in part by the [[Alan Turing Year]]. An ad hoc committee of the [[IEEE Information Theory Society]] including Christina Fragouli, Rüdiger Urbanke, Michelle Effros, Lav Varshney and [[Sergio Verdú]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.itsoc.org/publications/newsletters/june-2015-issue/at_download/file | title=Newsletter | work=[[IEEE Information Theory Society]] | publisher=[[IEEE]] | date=June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinated worldwide events.

'''David Scott Blackhall''' was a [[radio]] personality, author and [[poet]].

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Cirencester]], [[Gloucestershire]] on 9 May 1910 to George William and Annie Blackhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1969|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kHREAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio|title=Contemporary Authors: First revision, Volumes 5-8|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Research]]|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an accident in his teens, in which he sustained a detached retina, he lost the sight in his left eye. He underwent an operation in about 1943 to restore some sight in this eye, but the operation was unsuccessful. The eyesight in his right eye began to seriously deteriorate in the 50s and an operation for cataracts was unsuccessful, leaving him totally blind by age 45.

In 1961 his autobiography ''This House Had Windows'' was published and in which he explained he learned braille, which took him three weeks to learn the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KX8iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIi8jUwa3CxwIVlxaSCh3DgQbB This house had windows], page 102, 1962, I. Oblonsky&lt;/ref&gt; The 'David Scott Blackhall Award for Services to the Blind' was named in his honour by the [[BBC]] radio's ''[[In Touch (radio series)|In Touch]]'' programme, a programme which Blackhall first hosted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1bJIAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIi8jUwa3CxwIVlxaSCh3DgQbB he New Beacon, Volume 76, Issues 894-904], 1992, page 475, [[RNIB]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Street |first=Sean |date=2015 |title=Historical Dictionary of British Radio |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Df-dCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20Scott%20Blackhall%20radio&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |page=180 |isbn=1442249234 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another award started in Blackhall's memory was the Patients' Aid Association's David Scott Blackhall Memorial Award which would award a cash prize to individuals making a positive impact to the blind community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y25MAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjwpKO-t8LHAhVTGpIKHT3TANI Country Life], Volume 180, 1986, page 1428&lt;/ref&gt; Another blind colleague of Blackhall's at Radio 4 was Jill Allen-King.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1969 during one of his radio editions of "In Touch", he commented on a group of blind people who had climbed Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, and went on to say that Britain's highest mountain was Ben Nevis - if anyone was interested.  It seemed they were, as he had a flood of letters from interested listeners who wished to make that climb.  With the help of local people in the town of Fort William, a weekend was arranged at the Milton Hotel - appropriately Milton was a blind poet - and a group of 15 visually impaired men and women with local sighted companions and Blackhall at the helm, made the climb, arriving at the summit to the sound of the bagpipes, played by one of the group.  It was a proud moment for him and the start of the Milton Mountaineers, who went on to meet annually to climb more of Britain's and Ireland's highest peaks.  One of Blackhall's poems, "Prayer", is still recited by the leader of the Mountaineers at each summit. Other works of Blackhall's were ''Dark Is A Long Way'', a radio play about his Blind experiences that was broadcast in Britain in September 1958. Blackhall hosted ''In Touch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15184993|title=In Touch marks 50th anniversary|date=October 7, 2011|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until a week before his death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donovan|first=Paul|date=1991|url=https://books.google.com/?id=79IaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio|title=The radio companion|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=0246136480|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September  14, 1981, aged 71.&lt;ref name="Undaunted "&gt;{{cite book |last=Olstrom |first=Clifford E. |date=2012 |title=Undaunted by Blindness, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k9K77s1IRgoC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;dq=David+Scott+Blackhall+radio#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20Scott%20Blackhall%20radio&amp;f=false |publisher=eBookIt.com |page= |isbn=0982272197 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three daughters: Anne (b. 1936), (Leader of the Milton Mountaineers from 1992 to 2005); Jane (b. 1940) and Susan (b. 1949) and was married to Edna (née Westwood).

'''Mark Welson Chua''' (died sometime between 15–18 March 2001) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] student of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] whose death is widely believed to be linked to his exposé of alleged irregularities in the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps in the Philippines|Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] unit of the university.&lt;ref name="pangalangan"&gt;{{cite web | last =Pangalangan | first = Raul | title = Mandatory ROTC?

==Background==
Chua took his elementary and high school education at Saint Jude Catholic School and his college education at the University of Santo Tomas. As a member of the ROTC unit's intelligence monitoring team, he had first-hand knowledge of [[corruption]] within the organization, which he and another student, Romulo Yumol,&lt;ref name="requinta"/&gt; divulged to UST's official student publication ''[[The Varsitarian]]'' in January 2001. This resulted in the relief of then-commandant Major Demy Tejares and his staff.

==Death==
Chua received [[death threat]]s after his revelations. The new ROTC commandant advised him to undergo security training at [[Fort Bonifacio]]. On 15 March 2001, he was supposed to meet with an agent but he was never seen alive again. Three days later his decomposing body, wrapped in a carpet, was found floating in the [[Pasig River]] near the [[Jones Bridge]].&lt;ref name="requinta"/&gt; His hands and feet were tied and his face wrapped in cloth and packing tape. The autopsy report showed that sludge was in his lungs, indicating that he was alive when he was thrown into the river.&lt;ref name="pangalangan"/&gt; In order to mislead investigators, his abductors had pretended to demand ransom from the Chua family.&lt;ref name="aravilla"&gt;{{cite web | last =Aravilla | first = Jose | title = 4 more suspects tagged in Mark Chua slay case  | url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/135728/4-more-suspects-tagged-mark-chua-slay-case | accessdate = 26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2004, Arnulfo Aparri, Jr.,&lt;ref name="requinta"/&gt; one of the four suspects in the killing of Chua, was sentenced to die by [[lethal injection]], and was ordered to pay [[Philippine peso|Php]] 50,000.00 to the victim's family as [[indemnity]]. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment without parole after the [[death penalty]] was abolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Cabigao | first =Verity Ayrah B.  | title = Chua slay suspect's appeal denied | url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20071116/chua_slay_suspects_appeal_denied | accessdate = 2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the accused, Eduardo Tabrilla, pleaded guilty to [[homicide]] and was sentenced to 6-14 years of imprisonment in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Elmenzo | first = Marlene H. | title = Mark Chua's dad dies; search for justice goes on  | url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/mark_chuas_dad_dies_search_for_justice_goes_on | accessdate = 1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of the two other suspects, Paul Joseph Tan and Michael Von Rainard Manangbao remain uncertain.&lt;ref name="requinta"/&gt;

'''Dennis Andrew Canavan'''  (born 8 August 1942) is a Scottish politician. He was the Member of Parliament for [[Falkirk West (UK Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]] from 1974 to 2000 (known as [[West Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Stirlingshire]] from 1974 to 1983), first as a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and then as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]].  He then served as an Independent [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Member]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Falkirk West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]] from 1999 to 2007.

In 2014, he was the chair of the Advisory Board of [[Yes Scotland]], the campaign for a ''Yes'' vote in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Cowdenbeath]], Canavan was educated at St. Bride's and [[St. Columba's R.C. High School, Dunfermline|St. Columba's School]]s, Cowdenbeath, [[St Andrew's College, Drygrange]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Canavan, ''Let the people decide: the autobiography of Dennis Canavan'' (2009), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He worked as a schoolteacher from 1968 until 1974 and was Assistant Head of [[Holy Rood High School Edinburgh]] at the time of his first election to Parliament. Canavan was also head of the maths department at St Modans High in Stirling.

==Career==

===British Parliament===
He was leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Group on [[Stirling]] [[Stirling (district)|District Council]] in 1974 and, in October of that year, was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for [[West Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Stirlingshire]]. Following boundary changes, he was MP for [[Falkirk West (UK Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]] from 1983 to 2000. He was Chair of the [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group]], 1980 – 1981. In 1975, he tried introducing a bill to abolish [[corporal punishment]] in schools and his efforts formed part of the case presented to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] which led eventually to abolition. He voted against the [[Blair ministry|Blair Government]]'s proposals to cut benefits for children of [[Single-parent|lone parents]], abolish [[Student Grant]]s and introduce [[tuition fees]].

A keen sports enthusiast, he was founder and Convener of the Scottish Sports Group at Westminster and the Cross-Party Sports Group in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. He has completed a marathon in less than 3 hours and the [[Ben Nevis Race]] in just over 2 hours. He won a gold medal, playing for Scotland in the British Universities Football Championships in 1967. In his book, ''The Final Whistle?'', Harry Reid claims that he took part in the 1977 Wembley pitch invasion after Scotland beat England and ripped up a patch of the turf (see [[Home Internationals#1977: Wembley pitch invasion|Wembley pitch invasion]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Harry, ''The Final Whistle?'', Birlinn, 52, {{ISBN|1-84158-362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He takes an active interest in [[international relations|international affairs]] and served as a member of the [[Select Committees|House of Commons Select Committees]] on [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee|Foreign Affairs]] and [[International Development Select Committee|International Development]]. He is still a member of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]] and [[Amnesty International]] and is interested in [[conflict resolution]].

He chaired the Northern Ireland Committee of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] from 1989 to 1997, and led several Parliamentary delegations to Ireland during [[The Troubles]]. He served on the [[British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body]] from 1992 to 2000. As a member of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament, he was author of a report on the potential for co-operation between [[Scotland]] and Ireland. He has frequently spoken out against [[sectarianism]] and racism.

===Scottish Parliament===
Throughout his entire political life, Canavan played a leading part in the [[Campaign for a Scottish Assembly|campaign for a Scottish Parliament]]. When Labour was in opposition, he led a nationwide consultation about [[devolution]], on behalf of the [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Group of Labour MPs]], leading to the publication of a [[Scotland Act 1998|bill]] to establish a Scottish Parliament with revenue-raising powers. However, in 1999, when the [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|first elections to the Scottish Parliament]] were held, the [[New Labour]] leadership rejected him as an official Labour candidate, despite the fact that he had the support of 97% of [[Constituency Labour Party|local party members]]. He therefore stood as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]], and was consequently expelled from the party. He won with almost 55 percent of the vote, the highest majority of any MSP in the [[Scottish Parliament Election, 1999|1999 election]]. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000 to concentrate on representing his constituents in the Scottish Parliament. Canavan retained his [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|Holyrood seat in 2003]] with 55.7 percent of the vote, again with the biggest majority in Scotland.

In the Scottish Parliament, he was a member of the European and External Relations Committee and Convener of the All-Party Sports Group from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/1271193.stm |title=Scots hide Irish heritage |publisher=BBC News |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/1058132.stm |title=Catholic church backing |publisher=BBC News |date=6 December 2000 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2003 he criticised the [[Scottish football]] authorities when [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk Football Club]] was refused promotion to the [[Scottish Premier League]], despite having won the First Division Championship. He supported Falkirk's efforts to build a new stadium for community use and he still regularly attends the club's matches. He is also Honorary President of Milton Amateurs Football Club.

Canavan enjoys hill-walking and, in the Scottish Parliament, he championed the people's right of access to the countryside, successfully introducing amendments to the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003|Land Reform (Scotland) Bill]] to extend the right of access to country estates, including land belonging to the Queen. He is now President of [[Ramblers' Association|Ramblers Scotland]].

He is a strong supporter of the idea of a [[public holiday|national holiday]] to celebrate [[St Andrew's Day]], and his bill to achieve this was eventually passed as the [[St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007]].

==Retirement==
When he announced his retirement before the [[2007 Scottish Parliament elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/6289637.stm Canavan will not fight election], ''bbc.co.uk'', 23 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; he was the longest serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having completed a combined 33 years at Westminster and Holyrood. After this announcement he received an ovation in the [[Scottish Parliament#Parliamentary chamber|Chamber of the Scottish Parliament]] from other MSPs and was praised by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Jack McConnell]] as "an outstanding parliamentarian over a long, long period of time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/6298617.stm Canavan receives Holyrood ovation], ''bbc.co.uk'', 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Canavan declared his support for John McNally, the [[Scottish National Party]] candidate for [[Falkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Falkirk]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Falkirk is the successor to Canavan's former Westminster constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.caledonianmercury.com/2010/04/25/blow-for-labour-as-canavan-backs-snp-candidate/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501061549/http://politics.caledonianmercury.com/2010/04/25/blow-for-labour-as-canavan-backs-snp-candidate/ |date=1 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has [[honorary doctorate]]s from the Universities of [[Stirling University|Stirling]] and [[Strathclyde University|Strathclyde]].

The '''Emiratis''' or '''Emirati people''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|إماراتي}}}}) are the [[citizen]]s of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). Their largest concentration is in the UAE, where there are 1.5 or approximately 
2 million Emiratis.&lt;ref name="natur"/&gt;

Formerly known as the [[Trucial States]] or Trucial Oman, the UAE is made up of seven emirates, each of which had a dominant or ruling family or tribe. [[Abu Dhabi]] was home to the [[Bani Yas]] tribal confederation; [[Dubai]] settled in 1833 by an offshoot of the Bani Yas, the [[House of Al-Falasi|Al Bu Falasah]]; [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] and [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]] to the [[Al Qasimi]] or Qawasim; [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajman]] to the [[Na'im|Al Na'im]] and [[Fujairah|Fujeirah]] to the [[Sharqiyin]]. Additionally, a number of large tribes settled in these territories or travelled the interior of the UAE, including the [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]], [[Al-Ali (tribe)|Al Ali]],  [[Awamir]], [[Mazari (Emirati)|Mazari]], [[Bani Qitab]], [[Al Bu Shamis]], Manahil, Rashid, [[Al Murrah]], [[Zaab]], Tanaij, [[Naqbiyin]], Ghafalah and the [[Bani Kaab]]. A large number of them are from other Arab countries too and some have South Asian blood and Sub-Saharan African blood in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/society/more-emiratis-marrying-other-nationalities-1.1377845 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023256/http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/society/more-emiratis-marrying-other-nationalities-1.1377845 |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the United Arab Emirates}}
Emirati culture is based on [[Arab culture]] and has been influenced by the religion [[Islam]]. Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture. Ever since the 20th century, the country has become more cosmopolitan and aspects of Western culture are very visible here.

===Values===
The influence of Islamic culture on Emirati [[architecture]], [[music]], [[Clothing|attire]], [[cuisine]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] are very prominent as well. Five times every day, [[Muslim]]s are called to the prayer from the [[minaret]]s of [[mosque]]s which are scattered around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/culture.htm |title=UAE Culture |publisher=Uae.gov.ae |date=1 June 2000 |accessdate=15 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617075529/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/culture.htm |archivedate=17 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some oriental educationists and cultural academics have stated that luxuriousness and some extravagance is a feature of the Emirati culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Stuart|title=Oman, UAE &amp; Arabian Peninsula|date=2007|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
{{main|Music of the United Arab Emirates}}
Emirati music varies to each area although most are on folklore's, some cultural dances are the horbya which well known all over the United Arab Emirates, The Ayala which is well known in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Other music is shalat which does not involve any type of instruments.

==History==
The United Arab Emirates is a recently created country with a history entwined with various empires, such as those of Portugal and the United Kingdom. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] also exerted influence in the Persian Gulf. Envoys from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] saw the islands convert to [[Islam]] around 630 C.E.

Later in the 16th century the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] would battle the then dominant force in the Persian Gulf, the [[Safavid dynasty]], for control of the region. During the 17th century, the Ottomans took control of the islands and UAE was known as the "Pirate Coast." By the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] had taken complete control of the land then called the [[Trucial States]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=Travel Dubai, United Arab Emirates: Illustrated Guide, Phrasebook and Maps|author=MobileReference|publisher=Google eBooks|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuwWKHmKmyoC&amp;pg=PT319&amp;dq=History+of+Emirates&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YUXQTd7fHaXt0gGw8rWCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Emirates&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123103303/https://books.google.com/books?id=KuwWKHmKmyoC&amp;pg=PT319&amp;dq=History+of+Emirates&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YUXQTd7fHaXt0gGw8rWCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Emirates&amp;f=false|archivedate=23 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil was discovered in 1959. The Trucial States were under the control of the British Empire until 1971. Consequently, with weakening British control, the Trucial States became the UAE in 1971 with [[Ras al-Khaimah]] joining in 1972.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The term ''Emirati'' comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word  ''[[emir]]'' ({{lang-ar|أمير}}) which means ''commander''.  Each emirate is ruled by an emir. The [[Bani Yas]] tribe forms the basis of many clans within the UAE. Sub-clans of the Bani Yas include&lt;ref name=emirati1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=98Chiu4kug4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA128&amp;ots=2Q9YZxEtcf&amp;sig=-G79_Neg5e3ToWx4DMMBT0kOm1U#PPA156,M1 : The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105080413/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=98Chiu4kug4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA128&amp;ots=2Q9YZxEtcf&amp;sig=-G79_Neg5e3ToWx4DMMBT0kOm1U |date=5 November 2015 }}. Long, Reich.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Al Bu Falah'' ([[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]])
* ''Al Bu Falasah'' ([[Dubai]])

The term "Emirati" also refers to Arabs with origins in the UAE. Many modern Emirati names are derived from these tribal names or offshoots of these tribes, for instance Mazroui (from Mazari), Nuaimi (from Naim) and Al Sharqi (from Sharqiyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Heard-Bey|first = Frauke|publisher = Longman|year = 1990|isbn = 0582277280|location = London|pages = 27–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emiratism==
Emiratism (or Emirianism) is the advocacy of Emirati national identity. The government promotes Emiratism by procuring nationals with preferential treatment on several socio-political platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jime.ieej.or.jp/htm/english/2008/0811.htm|title=Nationalism and Internal Tensions in the UAE|publisher=The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan|author=Neil Patric|date=8 November 2008|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704102100/https://jime.ieej.or.jp/htm/english/2008/0811.htm|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished through several means, such as increasing the visibility of Emirati culture, by preserving Emirati cultural identity, and by preferentially employing Emiratis in the workforce. The latter policy is referred to as [[Emiratisation]] by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalir, Sur|first1=Barak, Malini|title=Transnational Flows and Permissive Politie|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexicology===
The word Emirati is an English word derived from a combination of the word emir, which is an Islamic leader, and the English suffix ''-ate''. It gradually came to mean the United Arab Emirates. The demonym Emirian has a similar root from except with the suffix ''-ian'' being added to emir. Rarer Emirian demonyms and adjectives include ''Emiri'' and ''Emiratian'', both of which are unofficial and informal alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=Allen|title=Arab comic strips|date=1994|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to strong tribal allegiances, many Emiratis also self-identify by their tribal affiliations, whereby some Emiratis may call themselves a "Bani Yasi", "Suweidi" or an "al-Shamsi", especially if they come from an influential tribe.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Historically, Emiratis were called ''Trucial Coasters''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winder|first1=Bayly|title=Saudi Arabia in the Nineteenth Century|date=1965|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Trucials''.&lt;ref&gt;Unexceptional: America's Empire in the Persian Gulf, 1941-2007, Marc J. O'Reilly, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==National symbols==
[[Falcon]] training is one of the UAE's national symbols. These birds can be seen on the [[coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates]]. They were traditionally used for hunting, and trained by the [[Bedouin]] tribes. Most Emiratis view Sheikh Zayed as an essential component of Emirati nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Jay|title=Informal Learning|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emiratis are proud of their nations global name associated with tourist prospects, prefer interactions with fellow nationals, most are computer literate and adult Emiratis past born in the 21st century are more likely to be bilingual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/06/emiratis-dress-code_n_1653446.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Emiratis Want Crackdown On Tourists' Skimpy Dresses | date=6 July 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007060053/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/06/emiratis-dress-code_n_1653446.html | archivedate=7 October 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahdi|first1=Ali|title=Teen Life in the Middle East|date=2003|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are many landmarks and sculptures in the country of teapots, water jugs and coffeemakers to symbolize the hospitality of the Emirati people. Due to the pearl-diving history of the Emirates, nautical sailing and other activities at sea are sometimes emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruijn|first1=Liza|title=Doing the deal, globally|date=2010|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its prominence throughout Emirati history in cultivation, [[datefruit]]s play an important role in Emirati life. Another national symbol is the arabic coffee pot with the elongated thin spout called a Dallah; a sign of Emirati generosity.

In spite of moving so many times at a young age, Osbourne did not find it disruptive.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, ''21 Years Gone'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only aspect of his life that constant moving did affect was his school life, and Osbourne soon despised going to school, which was not helped by the fact that he was diagnosed with a form of [[dyslexia]] at the age of eight,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jack-osbourne/bio/196524 Jack Osbourne Biography |TVGuide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/artist.nsf/artistbiog/jack%20osbourne Jack Osbourne profile at www.contactmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] at the age of 10.

'''Jacob Steiner''' (Steiner Erik, Budapest) is a professor at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and a researcher of the [[physiology]] of the [[sense]]s.

== Academia==

He received his Ph.D. from [[University of Basel]] in 1964.

He became a lecturer in 1965, a senior lecturer in 1974, an associate professor in 1979 and became emeritus in 1996.

He was a visiting Associate Professor to the [[University of Pennsylvania]].
He was a visiting Professor to [[Brown University]].
He was a visiting Scholar at Monell Chemical Senses Center, in Philadelphia.

== Research interests ==

He did research on the [[physiology]] of the [[senses]] of [[taste]] and [[olfaction|smell]] in man and in animals and their [[clinical trial]].
On the behavioral, [[electrophysiological]] and autonomous reactions to chemical stimuli.
And on the developmental aspects of oral functions.

== Research projects ==

*[[Behavioral]] reactions to chemical stimuli ([[taste]] and [[olfaction|smell]]) in [[autistic]] people.
*Behavioral response to chemical stimuli in man and animals:

"Steiner’s research, which involved infants only a few hours old, clearly shows that humans 
are born with the capacity to distinguish between various tastes. Jacob E. Steiner, a taste 
researcher at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, almost all babies, when tasting
sweet stimuli, show a ’’marked relaxation of the face, resembling an expression of ’satisfaction.’ ’’ 
This expression is often followed by a slight smile and even ’’eager licking of the upper lip.’’ 
When the babies were fed a bitter solution, on the other hand, their facial expressions turned to 
’’dislike and disgust or rejection.’’" 
New York Times  April 16.1989. Can Society Tell You What Tastes Good?

"The meticulous observation, semiquantitative analysis and evaluation of behavioral reactions is proposed as one of the most relevant and valid avenues of investigation on the workup of chemosensory stimuli by the living organism. Behavioral manifestations, are probably even in a much easier way "readable" indicators of pleasure and displeasure than any other event-related bodily manifestation. In fact, the phenomenon of bacterial chemotaxis (as usually divided in positive- respectivel y negative chemotaxis) belong to the same category or kind of innate, probably even inherited reflectory mechanisms expressing " acceptance" - 'indifference' and 'aversion' of the organism." Jacob E. Steiner

[[Lars Ernster]], Edith Ernster and Jacob Steiner lived during the [[World War II]] in the office of the Swedish Embassy in [[Budapest]] Üllöi ut 2-4. Initially, there were 250 workers; later about 400 people working around the clock (Edith Ernster remembers Wallenberg). In the night of January 8. 1945 all inhabitants were dragged away by an [[Arrow Cross Party]] executing brigade of the city commandership near to the Danube banks.   At midnight 20 policemen with drawn bayonets broke into the Arrow Cross house and rescued all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetime-sensor.de/wallenberg.htm Karoly Szabo - Wallenberg, 1947, 1965&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the saved persons January 8. 1945.

'''Jean-Antoine Watteau''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ɑ̃twan vato|lang}}; baptised October 10, 1684 – died July 18, 1721),&lt;ref name="Wine"&gt;Wine, Humphrey, and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. "Watteau" in ''Grove Art Online''. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T090852pg1 oxfordartonline.com] Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''Antoine Watteau''', was a [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]] whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement, as seen in the tradition of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. He revitalized the waning [[Baroque]] style, shifting it to the less severe, more naturalistic, less formally classical, [[Rococo]]. Watteau is credited with inventing the genre of ''[[fête galante|fêtes galantes]]'', scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, suffused with a theatrical air. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of [[Italy|Italian]] [[comedy]] and [[ballet]].

==Early life and training==
Watteau was born in October 1684 in the town of [[Valenciennes]]&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 29. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had recently passed from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] to France. His father, Jean-Philippe Watteau, was a roofer given to brawling.&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. p. 17. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing an early interest in [[painting]], Jean-Antoine may have been apprenticed to [[Jacques-Albert Gérin]], a local painter.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt; Jean-Antoine's first artistic subjects were charlatans selling quack remedies on the streets of Valenciennes.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt; Watteau left for Paris in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. p. 19. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There he found employment in a workshop at [[Pont Notre-Dame]], making copies of popular [[Genre works|genre painting]]s in the Flemish and Dutch tradition; it was in that period that he developed his characteristic sketchlike technique.

By 1705 he was employed as an assistant by the painter [[Claude Gillot]], whose work represented a reaction against the turgid official art of [[Louis XIV]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Marianne Roland. "Gillot, Claude". ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. 10 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In Gillot's studio Watteau became acquainted with the characters of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' (its actors had been expelled from France in 1697), a favorite subject of Gillot's that would become one of Watteau's lifelong passions.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt;

Afterward he moved to the workshop of [[Claude Audran III]], an [[interior decorator]], under whose influence he began to make drawings admired for their consummate elegance. Audran was the curator of the [[Palais du Luxembourg]], where Watteau was able to see the magnificent series of canvases painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for Queen [[Marie de Medici]]. The Flemish painter would become one of his major influences, together with the [[Venetian painting|Venetian masters]] he would later study in the collection of his patron and friend, the banker [[Pierre Crozat]].&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:Antoine Watteau - Pleasures of Love - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px| ''Pleasures of Love'' (1718–1719)]]
[[File:Antoine Watteau - The Feast of Love - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Feast (or Festival) of Love'' (1718–1719)]]

[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|350px|''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717, [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]]. Many commentators note that it depicts a ''departure'' from the island of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], the birthplace of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], thus symbolizing the brevity of love.]]
In 1709 Watteau tried to obtain the [[Prix de Rome]] and was rejected by the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. p. 20. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1712 he tried again and was considered so good that, rather than receiving the one-year stay in [[Rome]] for which he had applied, he was accepted as a full member of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. p. 21. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He took five years to deliver the required "[[reception piece]]", but it was one of his masterpieces: the ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'', also called the ''[[Embarkation for Cythera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. p. 396. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau lacked aristocratic [[patron]]s; his buyers were [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] such as bankers and dealers. Among his most famous paintings, beside the two versions of the ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera|Pilgrimage to Cythera]],'' one in the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], [[Berlin]], are ''Pierrot'' (long identified as ''"Gilles"''), ''Fêtes venitiennes'', ''Love in the Italian Theater'', ''Love in the French Theater'', ''"Voulez-vous triompher des belles?"'' and ''Mezzetin.'' The subject of his hallmark painting, ''Pierrot'' (''Gilles''), is an actor in a white satin costume who stands isolated from his four companions, staring ahead with an enigmatic expression on his face.&lt;ref&gt;Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Pierre Rosenberg, Nicole Parmantier, and Antoine Watteau. 1984. ''Watteau, 1684-1721''. Washington: National Gallery of Art. pp. 429–434. {{ISBN|0894680749}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau's final masterpiece, the [[L'Enseigne de Gersaint|''Shop-sign of Gersaint'']], exits the pastoral forest locale for a mundane urban set of encounters. Painted at Watteau's own insistence, "in eight days, working only in the mornings ... in order to warm up his fingers",&lt;ref name="Watteau_2009"&gt;Watteau, Antoine, Katharine Baetjer, and Georgia Cowart. 2009. ''Watteau, Music, and Theater''. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art. p. 6. {{ISBN|9781588393357}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this sign for the shop in Paris of the paintings dealer [[Edme François Gersaint]] is effectively the final curtain of Watteau's theatre. It has been compared with ''[[Las Meninas]]'' as a meditation on art and illusion.&lt;ref name="Watteau_2009"/&gt; The scene is an art gallery where the façade has magically vanished, and the gallery and street in the canvas are fused into one contiguous drama.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Sanford. 1990. ''Artists and Writers''. New York: Yarrow Press. pp. 140–141. {{ISBN|1-878274-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau alarmed his friends by a carelessness about his future and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. [[Richard Mead]], one of the most fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from [[Tuberculosis|tuberculous]] laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Dormandy, Thomas. "The White Death: The History of Tuberculosis". New York University Press, 2000. p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

His nephew, [[Louis Joseph Watteau]], son of Antoine's brother Noël Joseph Watteau (1689–1756), and grand nephew, [[François-Louis-Joseph Watteau]], son of Louis, followed Antoine into painting.

==Critical assessment and legacy==

Little known during his lifetime beyond a small circle of his devotees, Watteau "was mentioned but seldom in contemporary art criticism and then usually reprovingly".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Rococo, Classicism and Romanticism''. Routledge (UK), 1999. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Michael Levey]] once noted that Watteau "created, unwittingly, the concept of the individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone". If his immediate followers, Lancret and Pater, would depict the unabashed frillery of aristocratic romantic pursuits, Watteau in a few masterpieces anticipates an art about art, the world of art as seen through the eyes of an artist. In contrast to the Rococo whimsicality and licentiousness cultivated by [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] in the later part of [[Louis XV]]'s reign, Watteau's theatrical panache is usually tinged with a note of sympathy, wistfulness, and sadness at the transience of love and other earthly delights.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Lawrence, and John J. Reich. 2010. ''Culture and Values: A Survey of the Western Humanities''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning. p. 399. {{ISBN|9780495568773}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Famously, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] essayist [[Walter Pater]] wrote of Watteau: "He was always a seeker after something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pater|first=Walter|year=1885|title=A Prince of Court Painters|url=|journal=Macmillan's Magazine|volume=52|pages=401 - 4114|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau was a prolific draftsman. His drawings, typically executed in ''[[trois crayons]]'' technique, were collected and admired even by those, such as [[Anne Claude de Caylus|Caylus]] or Gersaint, who found fault with his paintings.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt; In 1726 and 1728, [[Jean de Jullienne]] published suites of etchings after Watteau's drawings, and in 1735 he published a series of engravings after his paintings, ''The Recueil Jullienne''.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt; The quality of the reproductions, using a mixture of engraving and etching following the practice of the Rubens engravers, varied according to the skill of the people employed by Jullienne, but was often very high. Such a comprehensive record was hitherto unparalleled.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt; This helped disseminate his influence round Europe and into the decorative arts.

Watteau's influence on the arts (not only painting, but the [[decorative art]]s, [[costume]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[music]]) was more extensive than that of almost any other 18th-century artist. The ''[[1700–1750 in fashion#Gowns and dresses|Watteau dress]]'', a long, sacklike dress with loose [[pleat]]s hanging from the shoulder at the back, similar to those worn by many of the women in his paintings, is named after him. According to the [[1911 Britannica|1911 ''Britannica'']], "in his treatment of the landscape background and of the atmospheric surroundings of the figures can be found the germs of [[Impressionism]]". His influence on later generations of painters may have been less apparent in France than in England, where [[J.M.W. Turner]] was among his admirers.&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence, and Michel Laclotte. 1987. ''Paintings in the Louvre''. New York: Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. p. 506. {{ISBN|1556700075}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A revived vogue for Watteau began in England during the [[British Regency]], and was later encapsulated by the [[Goncourt brothers]] and the ''[[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]]''.

In 1984 Watteau societies were created in Paris, by [[Jean Ferré]], and London, by Dr. Selby Whittingham. A major exhibition in Paris, Washington and Berlin commemorated the 1984 tercentenary of his birth. Since 2000 a Watteau centre has been established at Valenciennes by Professor Chris Rauseo. A catalogue of his drawings has been compiled by [[Pierre Rosenberg]], replacing the one by Sir [[Karl Parker]], and Alan Wintermute is preparing one for his paintings. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Image:Johann Kaspar Lavater.jpg|thumb|Johann Kaspar Lavater, by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]
'''Johann Kaspar''' (or '''Caspar''') '''Lavater''' ({{IPA-gsw|ˈlɒːv̥ɒtər|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forvo.com/word/lavater/|title=How to pronounce Lavater|work=Forvo.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 November 1741 – 2 January 1801) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[poet]], writer, philosopher, [[physiognomist]] and theologian.

==Early life==
Lavater was born in [[Zürich]], and was educated at the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' there, where [[Johann Jakob Bodmer|J. J. Bodmer]] and [[Johann Jakob Breitinger|J. J. Breitinger]] were amongst his teachers.

==Corruption fighter==
At barely twenty-one years of age, Lavater greatly distinguished himself by denouncing, in conjunction with his friend [[Henry Fuseli]] the painter, an iniquitous magistrate, who was compelled to make restitution of his ill-gotten gains.

==Zwinglian==
In 1769 Lavater took [[Holy Orders]] in Zurich's [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian Church]], and officiated until his death as [[deacon]] or [[pastor]] in churches in his native city. His oratorical fervor and genuine depth of conviction gave him great personal influence; he was extensively consulted as a [[casuist]], and was welcomed with enthusiasm on his journeys throughout Germany. His writings on mysticism were widely popular as well.

In the same year (1769), Lavater tried to convert [[Moses Mendelssohn]] to Christianity, by sending him a translation of [[Charles Bonnet]]'s ''Palingénésie philosophique'', and demanding that he either publicly refute Bonnet's arguments or convert. Mendelssohn refused to do either, and many prominent intellectuals took Mendelssohn's side, including [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]].

==Physiognomy==
[[File:Lavater1792.jpg|thumb|Image of woodcut from ''Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe'' (1775-1778)]]

Lavater is most well known for his work in the field of [[physiognomy]], ''Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe'', published between 1775 and 1778. He introduced the idea that physiognomy related to the specific character traits of individuals, rather than general types.&lt;ref name="BaggermanDekker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Arianne Baggerman|author2=Rudolf M. Dekker|author3=Michael James Mascuch|title=Controlling Time and Shaping the Self: Developments in Autobiographical Writing Since the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-pc5Sf6sNkC&amp;pg=PA250|date=22 June 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-19500-9|page=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fame of this book, which found admirers in France and England as well as Germany, rests largely upon the handsome style of publication and the accompanying illustrations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The two principal sources from which Lavater developed his physiognomical studies were the writings of the Italian [[polymath]] [[Giambattista della Porta]], and the observations made by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (translated into German in 1748 and praised by Lavater).

==Poet==
[[File:Lavater's Apparatus for Taking Silhouettes.--(From an ancient engraving of 1783).jpg|thumb|Lavater's Apparatus for Taking Silhouettes.--(From an ancient engraving of 1783)]]
As a [[poet]], Lavater published ''Christliche Lieder'' (1776–1780) and two [[epic poetry|epics]], ''Jesus Messias'' (1780) and ''Joseph von Arimathia'' (1794), in the style of [[Gottlieb Friedrich Klopstock|Klopstock]]. More relevant to the religious temperament of Lavater's times are his introspective ''Aussichten in die Ewigkeit'' (4 vols. 1768-1778), ''Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner selbst'' (2 vols., 1772–1773), and ''Pontius Pilatus, oder der Mensch in allen Gestalten'' (4 vols., 1782–1785).

==Goethe==
From 1774 on, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was intimately acquainted with Lavater, but later had a falling out with him, accusing him of [[superstition]] and hypocrisy.

==Blake==
In 1788 [[William Blake]] annotated Lavater's ''Aphorisms of Man''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/aphorismsonman00lavauoft ''Aphorisms of Man'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/erdman.xq?id=b12.1 ''Annotations to Lavater's Aphorisms on Man'']&lt;/ref&gt; Lavater published 632 [[aphorisms]] in all. Blake considered the following aphorism to be an excellent example of an aphorism. "40. Who, under pressing temptations to lie, adheres to truth, nor to the profane betrays aught of a sacred trust, is near the summit of wisdom and virtue."

==Last days==
During his later years, Lavater's influence waned, and he incurred considerable ridicule due to his vanity. His conduct during the French occupation of Switzerland  brought about his death. On the taking of Zürich by the French in 1799, Lavater, while trying to appease the aggressors, was shot by an infuriated grenadier; he died over a year later, after protracted sufferings borne with great fortitude.

The [[Swiss people|Swiss]] artist and illustrator, [[Warja Honegger-Lavater]], was a direct descendent of Johann Kaspar Lavater.

The '''1960 presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]]''', a [[United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], began on January 2, 1960, when Kennedy formally announced his candidacy for [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] [[President of the United States]], replacing [[incumbent]] [[President|President of the United States]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  Kennedy was nominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention of 1960]], taking place between July 11 and July 15, 1960.  On July 15, 1960, Kennedy named Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] as his official running mate.  Kennedy and Johnson won the election on November 8, 1960, defeating incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and [[1960 Republican National Convention|Republican nominee]] [[Richard Nixon]], who would later go on to be the 37th President of the United States.  Kennedy and Johnson were sworn in as 35th President and 37th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1961 respectively.  Kennedy would serve as President of the United States until [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his death]] in November 1963.

On January 5, Kennedy received the endorsement of [[Michael DiSalle]].&lt;ref name=Pietrusza79&gt;{{cite book|title=1960: LBJ Vs. JFK Vs. Nixon : the Epic Campaign that Forged Three Presidencies|pages=79-80|first=David|last=Pietrusza|year=2008|publisher=Union Square Press|isbn=978-1402761140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kennedy won the [[New Hampshire]] primary on March 8 without facing any opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John F. Kennedy: A Biography|first=Michael|last=O'Brien|year=2006|page=444|isbn=978-0312357450 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the results came in, Kennedy expressed enthusiasm while in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]: "I'm very happy about it; we did better than I thought we would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/03/10/page/19/article/many-factors-aid-kennedys-n-h-triumph|title=Many Factors Aid Kennedy's N.H. Triumph|date=March 10, 1960|first=William|last=Fulton|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next primary was in [[Wisconsin]]. The year prior to the primaries, in June 1959, Kennedy met Jerry Bruno, who had organized the campaign of [[William Proxmire]] for the U.S. Senate, JFK making the request for the latter to open a campaign headquarters for him in [[Milwaukee]].&lt;ref name=Savage52&gt;{{cite book|title=JFK, LBJ, and the Democratic Party|page=52|first=Sean J.|last=Savage|year=2004|isbn=978-0791461693|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 1960, Kennedy announced his intent to compete in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=Pietrusza79&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the primary, Kennedy said it had been the "toughest, closest, most meaningful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/04/03/page/1/article/press-wisconsin-campaign|title=Press Wisconsin Campaign; Sen.

Humphrey's entry into the Wisconsin primary gave the Kennedy campaign the two objectives of decisively defeating him in most parts of the state to end his candidacy altogether and portray JFK's national appeal at capturing votes.&lt;ref name=Savage52&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the West Virginia primary, one of the goals the Kennedy campaign had was to financially weaken Humphrey's campaign, alongside the use of attack ads against him.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Ingraham''' (1762–1800) was an [[Americans|American]] sailor and [[maritime fur trade]]r who discovered several islands of the [[Marquesas Islands]] while on his way to trade along the west coast of North America. He was also a prisoner in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and an officer in the [[United States Navy]].

==Early life==
During the War of Independence, Ingraham was a sailor captured by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. He spent part of the war on a prison ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmm.net/revdead.html#anchor266979 American Prisoners of the Revolution: Names of 8000 Men.] American Merchant Marine at War. Retrieved on February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, he was second mate aboard the ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'' under the command of [[John Kendrick (American sea captain)|John Kendrick]] when it sailed to the Pacific Northwest to engage in the fur trade.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

'''Karl Johann Kautsky''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aʊ|t|s|k|i}}; {{IPA-de|ˈkaʊtski|lang}}; 16 October 1854 – 17 October 1938) was a Czech-Austrian philosopher, journalist, and [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretician. Kautsky was recognized as among the most authoritative promulgators of [[Orthodox Marxism]] after the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895 until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.

Following the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], engaging in polemics with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] on the nature of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet state]].

== Life and career ==

===Early years===
Karl Kautsky, born in [[Prague]] of an artistic and middle class family, his parents were [[Johann Kautsky]] (a scenic designer) and Minna (an actress and writer). The family moved to [[Vienna]] when Kautsky was the age of seven. He studied [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1874, and became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) in 1875. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in [[Zürich]] who were supported financially by [[Karl Höchberg]], and who smuggled socialist material into Germany at the time of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] (1878&amp;ndash;1890). Influenced by [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Höchberg]]'s secretary, he became a Marxist and in 1881 visited [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] in England.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Political career===
In 1883, Kautsky founded the monthly ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]'' ("The New Times") in [[Stuttgart]], which became a weekly in 1890. He edited the magazine until September 1917: this gave him a steady income and allowed him to propagate [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |author=Gary P Steenson |title= "Not One Man! Not One Penny!”  German Social Democracy, 1863-1914 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518004612/http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |archivedate=18 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1885 to 1890 he spent time in [[London]], where he became a close friend of Friedrich Engels. His position as a prominent Marxist theorist was assured in 1888, when Engels put him to the task of editing Marx's three-volume work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackledge|first=Paul|title=Karl Kautsky and Marxist Historiography|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=July 2006|volume=70|issue=3|pages=338|jstor=40404839}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 he co-authored the [[Erfurt Program]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) together with [[August Bebel]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]].

Following the death of Engels in 1895, Kautsky became one of the most important and influential theoreticians of Marxism, representing the mainstream of the party together with [[August Bebel]], and outlining a Marxist theory of [[imperialism]]. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position of the necessity for revolution in the late 1890s, Kautsky denounced him, arguing that Bernstein's emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the "progressive" bourgeoisie and a non-class approach.

===Wartime years===
In 1914, when the German Social-Democrat deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] voted for war credits, Kautsky (who was not a deputy but attended their meetings) suggested abstaining.  Kautsky claimed that Germany was waging a defensive war against the threat of Czarist Russia. However, in June 1915, about ten months after the war had begun and when it had become obvious that this was going to be a sustained, appallingly brutal and costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Eduard Bernstein and [[Hugo Haase]] against the pro-war leaders of the SPD and denounced the German government's annexationist aims. In 1917 he left the SPD for the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), which united Socialists who opposed the war.

After the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] in Germany, Kautsky served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short-lived SPD-USPD revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany.

===Polemics with the Bolsheviks===
[[File:18-kautsky-diediktatur desproletariats.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kautsky's opening broadside against the revolutionary violence of the Russian Revolution, ''Die Diktatur des Proletariats'' (The Dictatorship of the Proletariat), first published in Vienna in 1918.]]

After 1919, Kautsky's prominence steadily diminished. In 1920, when the USPD split, he went with a minority of that party back into the SPD. He visited [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 1920 and wrote a book on the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] that at that moment was still independent of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. By the time it was published in 1921, Georgia had been thoroughly influenced by the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army had invaded Georgia]], and the Bolsheviks had [[Soviet Occupation Day (Georgia)|imposed]] the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1924, at the age of 70, Kautsky moved back to Vienna with his family, and remained there until 1938. At the time of Hitler's [[Anschluss]], he fled to [[Czechoslovakia]] and thence by plane to [[Amsterdam]], where he died in the same year.

Karl Kautsky lived in [[Berlin]]-[[Friedenau]] for many years; his wife, [[Luise Kautsky]], became a close friend of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who also lived in Friedenau. A commemorative plaque marks where Kautsky lived at Saarstraße 14.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] described Kautsky as a "renegade" in his classic pamphlet "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky"; Kautsky in turn castigated Lenin in his 1934 work ''Marxism and Bolshevism: Democracy and Dictatorship'':

{{quote|The Bolsheviki under Lenin's leadership, however, succeeded in capturing control of the armed forces in Petrograd and later in Moscow and thus laid the foundation for a new dictatorship in place of the old Czarist dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1934/bolshevism/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both Lenin and Trotsky, however,  defended the Bolshevik Revolution as a legitimate and historic social upheaval akin to the [[French Revolution]], casting themselves and the Bolsheviks in the role of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], and viewing the "opportunism" of Kautsky and similar figures as a function of "social bribery" rooted in their increasing intimacy with the privileged classes.

A collection of excerpts of Kautsky's writings, ''Social Democracy vs. Communism,'' discussed Bolshevist rule in Russia. He saw the Bolsheviks (or Communists) as a conspiratorial organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Instead, a bureaucracy-dominated society developed, the miseries of which outweighed the problems of Western [[capitalism]].  He stated:

{{quote|Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur to them what enslavement, what lowering of human self-esteem was connected with the construction of those gigantic establishments.&lt;ref name="SDvC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kautsky |first=Karl |title=Social Democracy vs. Communism |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1930s/demvscom/index.htm |chapter=Is Soviet Russia A Socialist State?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And:

{{quote|They extracted the means for the creation of material productive forces by destroying the most essential productive force of all - the laboring man. In the terrible conditions created by the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Piatiletka]], people rapidly perished. Soviet films, of course, did not show this.&lt;ref name="SDvC" /&gt;}}

===Death and legacy===

Kautsky died on 17 October 1938, in Amsterdam. His son, {{Interlanguage link multi|Benedikt Kautsky|de|3=Benedikt Kautsky}} spent seven years in [[concentration camp]]s; his wife [[Luise Kautsky]] died in [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;
Callinicos, A. ''Social Theory: a historical introduction''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautsky is notable for, in addition to his anti-[[Bolshevik]] polemics, his editing and publication of Marx's ''[[Capital, Volume IV]]'' (usually published as ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'').

In 1925, he was admitted into the Katsina Training College and finished his studies with a teacher's certificate in 1929. He started working as a teacher in 1929 at the Borno [[Middle School]] and by 1933, he had become a Provincial Visiting Teacher. He was later promoted to a Senior Visiting Teacher and education officer for the [[province]] of Borno. He was conferred with the title of Shettima of Borno in 1935 and for a while he was known as Shettima Kashim. He joined politics in 1951-52, when he was elected into the Northern Regional Assembly, he was nominated from the [[Northern Region, Nigeria|North]] as a cabinet nominee. Thereafter, he was appointed the Federal minister for [[Social Services]] and later that of [[Education]].

In 1956, he was appointed as the Waziri of Borno by the [[Sheikh|Shehu]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosalynde Ainslie, Catherine Hoskyns, Ronald Segal. ''Political Africa: A Who's Who of  Personalities and Parties'', New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1961, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' is an American [[reality television]] show in which [[celebrity]] contestants and professional [[dance]] partners compete to be the best dancers, as determined by the show's judges and public voting. The series first broadcast in the 2005, and twenty-seven complete seasons have aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through Fall 2018. During each season, competitors are progressively eliminated on the basis of public voting and scores received from the judges until only a few contestants remain. These finalists participate in a finale, from which a winner is determined.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/dancing-with-the-stars/about-voting |title=Voting -- How It Works |publisher=American Broadcasting Company |accessdate=October 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008212227/http://abc.go.com/shows/dancing-with-the-stars/about-voting |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities appearing on ''Dancing with the Stars'' include "actors, singers, comedians, musicians, entrepreneurs, athletes, reality stars, journalists, internet personalities, newsmakers, and where-are-they-now personalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/17/delay-joins-dancing-stars/|title=Tom DeLay joins 'Dancing With the Stars'|first=Joseph|last=Weber|date=August 17, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2009|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Léon M'ba'''{{needs-IPA}}&lt;ref&gt;His surname is also written as M'Ba and Mba.&lt;/ref&gt; (9 February 1902&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1967)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/11/29/page/50/article/leon-mba-president-of-gabon-dies "Leon M'Ba, President of Gabon, Dies"], ''Chicago Tribune'', November 29, 1967, p2-6&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Prime Minister of Gabon|Prime Minister]] (1959–1961) and [[President of Gabon|President]] (1961–1967) of [[Gabon]]. A member of the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]] ethnic group, M'ba was born into a relatively privileged village family. After studying at a seminary, he held a number of small jobs before entering the colonial administration as a [[customs agent]]. His political activism in favor of black people worried the French administration, and as a punishment for his activities, he was issued a prison sentence after committing a minor crime that normally would have resulted in a small fine. In 1924, the administration gave M'ba a second chance and selected him to head the [[canton (administrative division)|canton]] in [[Estuaire Province]]. After being accused of [[complicit]]y in the murder of a woman near Libreville, he was sentenced in 1931 to three years in prison and 10 years in exile. While in exile in [[Oubangui-Chari]], he published works documenting the tribal [[custom (law)|customary law]] of the Fang people. He was employed by local administrators, and received praise from his superiors for his work. He remained a ''[[persona non grata]]'' to Gabon until the French colonial administration finally allowed M'ba to return his native country in 1946.

In 1946, he began his political ascent, being appointed prime minister on 21 May 1957. He served as prime minister until 21 February 1961. In 1958, he directed an initiative to include Gabon in the Franco-African community further than before. He became president upon independence from France on 17 August 1960. Political nemesis [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]] briefly assumed the office of president through a [[1964 Gabon coup d'état|coup d'état]] in February 1964, but order was restored days later when the French intervened. M'ba was reelected in March 1967, but died of cancer in November 1967 and was succeeded by his vice president, [[Omar Bongo|Albert-Bernard Bongo]].

==Early life==
[[File:Fang Christians (c.1912).jpg|thumb|left|Fangs in a [[Mission (Christian)|Christian mission]], c. 1912]]
A member of the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang ethnic tribe]],&lt;ref name="Biteghe24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba was born on 9 February 1902 in [[Libreville]], Gabon.&lt;ref name="Bernault215"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a small business manager&lt;ref name="Bernault215"/&gt; and village chief,&lt;ref name="Gates1278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Appiah|Gates|1999|p=1278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; once worked as the hairdresser to Franco-Italian explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]].&lt;ref name="Biteghe24"/&gt; His mother, Louise Bendome, was a seamstress.&lt;ref name="Biteghe24"/&gt; Both were educated&lt;ref name="Bernault216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and were among the first "evolved couples" in Libreville.&lt;ref name="Biteghe25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba's brother also played an important role in the colonial hierarchy; he was Gabon's first Roman Catholic priest.&lt;ref name="Gates1278"/&gt;

In 1909, M'ba joined a seminary&lt;ref name="Biteghe24"/&gt; to receive his primary education. From 1920, he was employed as a store manager, a lumberjack and trader before entering the French colonial administration as a customs agent.&lt;ref name="Biteghe25"/&gt; Despite his good job performance, M'ba's activism in helping black Gabonians,&lt;ref name="Biteghe25"/&gt; particularly for the Fangs, worried his superiors. In September 1922, M'ba wrote to Edmond Cadier, [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of Gabon:

{{quote|"If on the one hand, the fundamental duty of educating the Fangs is consistent with Gabon's evident economic, military, and even political interests, on the other side, growing in human dignity and the increase of their material well-being do stay, Mr. Governor, the first legitimization of the French authority on them."&lt;ref name="Keese144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Si d'un côté le devoir fondamental d'instruire les Pahouins concorde par su[r]croît avec les intérêts économiques, militaires et même politiques les plus évidents du Gabon, de l'autre côté leur accroissement en dignité humaine et l'augmentation de leur bien-être matériel, demeurent, Monsieur le Gouverneur, la légitimation première de l'autorité française sur eux.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His remarks upset authorities, and he suffered the consequences in December 1922, when he was sentenced to prison after having committed a minor crime of providing a colleague with falsified documents.&lt;ref name="Keese144"/&gt;

==Under the colonial administration==

===''Chef de canton''===
In either 1924&lt;ref name="Bernault216"/&gt; or 1926,&lt;ref name="Keese145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba reconciled with colonial authorities and was chosen to succeed the deceased ''chef de canton'' (similar to a village chief) of Libreville's Fang neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Gates1278"/&gt; As the leader of a group of young Libreville intellectuals, he ignored the advice of elder Fangs and quickly gained a reputation as a strong, confident, and able-minded man.&lt;ref name="Bernault216"/&gt; He once wrote in a letter that he was "[m]issioned to enforce public order and defend the general interest" and that he did "not accept that people transgress the orders received from the authority that I represent."&lt;ref name="Bernault216"/&gt;

M'ba did not have an idealist vision of his job; he saw it as a way to become wealthy.&lt;ref name="Keese145"/&gt; With his colleague Ambamamy,&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;His first name is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; he forced labour on the residents of the canton for his personal use, to cover his large expenditures. The colonial administration was aware of the embezzlement, but they chose to overlook it.&lt;ref name="Keese145"/&gt; However, beginning in 1929, the colonial administration started to investigate his activities after they intercepted one of his letters to a Kouyaté,&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt; secretary for the [[Ligue des droits de l'homme]], who was accused of being an ally of the [[Comintern]]. Despite this suspected Communist alliance, the French authorities did not oppose M'ba's appointment as head chief of the [[Estuaire Province]] by his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Keese146"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In those years, M'ba, a member of the Ligue,&lt;ref name=Reed293&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1987|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; distanced himself from Roman Catholicism, but did not break completely with his faith. He instead became a follower of the [[Bwiti]]&lt;ref name="Biteghe25"/&gt; religious sect, which Fangs were particularly receptive to.&lt;ref name="Bernault218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1967|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed this would help revitalise a society which he felt had been damaged by the colonial administration.&lt;ref name=Reed293/&gt; In 1931, the sect was accused of murdering a woman whose remains were discovered outside a market in Libreville.&lt;ref name="Bernault218"/&gt; Accused of [[complicit]]y, even though his involvement in the crime was not proven, M'ba was removed from power&lt;ref name="Keese146"/&gt; and sentenced to three years in prison and ten years of exile.&lt;ref name="Biteghe25"/&gt; Officially this was for embezzlement of tax revenues and his abusive treatment of the local labour force.&lt;ref name="Keese146"/&gt;

===Exile in Oubangui-Chari===
[[File:Oubangui-Chari.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Oubangui-Chari, c. 1910]]
While exiled in the French territory of [[Oubangui-Chari]], first in the towns of [[Bambari]] and then [[Bria, Central African Republic|Bria]],&lt;ref name="Biteghe26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he continued to exert influence among Fangs via correspondence with his compatriots in Libreville. Worried by the situation, Governor-General Antonetti ordered in 1934, at the end of his prison sentence, that M'ba be placed under surveillance.&lt;ref name="Keese147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years in exile, he wrote about the customary rights of the Fang people in the "Essai de droit coutumier pahouin" ({{lang-en|Essay of Pahouin customary rights}}) and published it in ''Bulletin de la société des recherches congolaises'' in 1938.&lt;ref name="Keese148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work quickly became the main reference on Fang tribal [[custom (law)|customary law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, the native ex-chief remained a ''[[persona non grata]]'' to Gabon, as stated in the letter from the head of the Estuarie [[Department (administrative division)|Department]], Assier de Pompignan:

{{quote|For Léon M'Ba not only was the leader who had claimed for personal use the colony's money. He enjoyed also a considerable amount of prestige, as his congeners could see, which he got from witchcraft activities he practiced. As he was intelligent, he exploited this situation to extort the people he had to administrate also the cabal which he had formed. But on the other hand, he knew how to flatter the representatives of the authority, beguiling their vigilance and gaining their confidence. That is why he had, years before, committed all kinds of abuses without ever being otherwise worried about it.&lt;ref name="Keese148"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|C'est que Léon M’Ba n’était pas seulement le chef qui s’était approprié pour des besoins personnels les deniers de la colonie. Il jouissait aussi aux yeux de ses congénères d'un prestige considérable qu’il tirait des pratiques de sorcellerie auxquelles il s’adonnait. Comme il était intelligent, il exploitait cette situation pour rançonner les gens qu’il avait charge d'administrer et qui le redoutaient ainsi que la camarilla dont il s’était entouré. Mais il savait, par contre, amadouer les représentants de l'autorité, endormir leur vigilance et capter leur confiance. C’est ce qui explique qu’il ait, des années devant, commis toutes sortes d'exactions sans jamais être autrement inquiété.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In spite of being in exile, M'ba was employed by local administrators. Placed in secondary offices and having no proper power, he was an accomplished and valuable employee. Thanks to praiseworthy reports from his superiors, he was once again seen as a reliable indigenous element on which the colonial administration could rely on.&lt;ref name="Keese149"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, a sentence reduction was granted to him.&lt;ref name="Biteghe26"/&gt; Following his release, he became a civil servant in [[Brazzaville]], where his prestige increased.&lt;ref name=frenchinvolvement&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/research/OPs/Pederson/html/contents/sect5.html |title=French Involvement in Gabon |last=Pederson |first=Nicholas |date=May 2000 |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] |accessdate=2008-08-09 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3APederson+intitle%3AFrench+Involvement+in+Gabon&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902133400/http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/Ops/Pederson/html/contents/sect5.html |archivedate=September 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ascension==

===Return to Gabon and local politician===
In 1946, M'ba returned to Gabon, where he was greeted exultantly by his friends.&lt;ref name="Biteghe26"/&gt; He was not reinstated as ''chef de canton''; instead, he obtained an important position as store manager for the English trading house [[John Holt plc|John Holt]].&lt;ref name="Biteghe26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rich|first=Jeremy|title=Troubles at the Office: Clerks, State Authority, and Social Conflict in Gabon, 1920-45|year=2004|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=38|issue=1|pages=58–87|oclc=108738271|doi=10.2307/4107268|jstor=4107268|publisher=Canadian Association of African Studies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he founded the [[Gabonese Mixed Committee]] (CMG), a political party close to the [[African Democratic Rally]] (RDA), an inter-African party led by [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]].&lt;ref name="Taylor140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's main objective was to obtain autonomy for its member states and oppose the [[Senegal]]ese leader [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]'s idea of federalism.&lt;ref name="Taylor140"/&gt; Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M'ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples.&lt;ref name="Bernault222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to win indigenous administrative and judicial posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his success in Libreville, M'ba aspired, at one point, to become the head of the region, an idea which many notable Fangs supported during the Pahouin congress at Mitzic in February 1947.&lt;ref name="Keese151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the colonial authorities refused to give him the position. Due to his relations with the RDA, which was linked to the [[French Communist Party]], M'Ba was seen as a communist and propagandist in the colony; for the authorities, these suspicions had been confirmed when M'ba was involved in the 1949 RDA congress in [[Abidjan]].&lt;ref name="Keese153"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the CMG decided to break its ties with the Communists, siding with the moderate position favored by Houphouët-Boigny while he did the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1987|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time M'ba, while maintaining his "rebellious" image to the electorate, became close with the French administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the administration was already supporting his main opponent, Congressman [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]], who was M'ba's protégé and his half-brother's foster son.&lt;ref name="Bernault222"/&gt; In the [[French legislative election, 1951 (Gabon–Moyen Congo)|legislative elections]] of 17 June 1951, Aubame was easily re-elected, as M'ba only received 3,257 votes, just 11% of the electorate.&lt;ref name="Bernault224"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gabonese Territorial Assembly election, 1952|territorial elections]] of March 1952, Aubame's [[Gabonese Democratic and Social Union]] (UDSG) won 14 of the 24 contested seats, against two for the CMG; however, the CMG received 57% of the votes cast in Libreville.&lt;ref name="Bernault224"/&gt;

===Rise to power===
[[File:Flag of Gabon 1959-1960.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Autonomous Republic of Gabon (1959–1960)]]
Initially rejected by the Territorial Assembly, M'ba allied himself with French representatives in the assembly.&lt;ref name="Bernault224"/&gt; However, using his charismatic traits and his reputation as a "man of the people", he managed to win a seat there in 1952.&lt;ref name=Yates103&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|1996|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He left the CMG to join the [[Gabonese Democratic Bloc]] (BDG) led by [[Paul Gondjout]] in 1954,&lt;ref name=Yates103/&gt; whom M'ba intended to overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gondjout, the secretary of the BDG, appointed M'ba secretary-general and formed a long term alliance against Aubame.&lt;ref name=Reed295&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1987|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, M'ba received 36% of the votes versus 47% for Aubame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not elected, M'ba became the leader of the indigenous territory, and some of the UDSG began to ally themselves with him.&lt;ref name="Keese159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the municipal elections of 1956, M'ba received support from the French logging industry, especially [[Roland Bru]], and was elected mayor of Libreville&lt;ref name=Yates103/&gt; with 65.5% of the vote. On 23 November he was appointed the first mayor of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been cited as the BDG's first significant victory over the UDSG.&lt;ref name=Reed295/&gt; In the French practice of holding multiple posts known as ''cumul des positions'', M'ba served as both mayor and deputy.&lt;ref name=Yates103/&gt;

In the territorial elections of March 1957, his reputation as a "forester's man" worked against him;&lt;ref name=Yates103/&gt; the BDG finished second again, winning 16 of the 40 contested seats, against 18 for the UDSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bru and other French foresters bribed several UDSG deputies to switch their political party to the BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, in the absence of an absolute majority, both parties were obliged to submit on 21 May 1957, a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for election into the government.&lt;ref name="Bernault262"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government council under the French governor.&lt;ref name="Taylor140"/&gt; Soon, divisions grew within the government, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote.&lt;ref name="Bernault263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the party a majority with 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=293}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After voting in favor of the [[French Community|Franco-African Community]], similar to the [[British Commonwealth]], in the [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|constitutional referendum]] of 28 September 1958,&lt;ref name="Bernault294"/&gt; Gabon became pseudo-politically independent.&lt;ref name=frenchinvolvement/&gt; French journalist [[Pierre Péan]] asserted that M'ba secretly tried to prevent Gabonese independence; instead, he lobbied for it to become an overseas territory of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Péan|1983|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1958, the Assembly voted to establish the legislature, and then [[wikt:promulgate|promulgated]] the constitution of the Republic of Gabon on 19 February 1959.&lt;ref name="Bernault294"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February, M'ba was appointed [[List of heads of government of Gabon|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Biteghe29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After M'ba openly declared for the departmentalization of Gabon in November 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Foccart]], [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s spin-doctor for African policy, told him that this solution was unthinkable.&lt;ref name="rvx"&gt;{{fr icon}} Pesnot, Patrick (producer) &amp; Billoud, Michel (director) (10 March 2007), [https://archive.is/20070620065034/http://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/em/rendezvousavecx/index.php?id=52892 1964, le putsch raté contre Léon M'Ba président du Gabon], ''[[France Inter]]''. Retrieved on 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba then decided to adopt a new flag by affixing the design of the national tree, the [[Aucoumea klaineana|Angouma]], over the French flag. Again, Foccart, as a loyal Frenchman, refused.&lt;ref name="rvx"/&gt;

From July 1958, a third political force tried to establish itself in Gabon: the Parti d'Union Nationale Gabonais ([[Gabonese National Unity Party|PUNGA]]), led by [[René-Paul Sousatte]] and Jean-Jacques Boucavel, created attempting to unite the southern Gabonese against the established BDG and UDSG. It was also supported by former UDSG members, "radical" students, and trade unionists.&lt;ref name=Reed295/&gt; Though it voted against the constitutional referendum,&lt;ref name="Bernault269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; PUNGA organised several events geared toward gaining independence and the holding of more parliamentary elections, which were also supported by the UDSG.&lt;ref name="Bernault294"/&gt; In March 1960, after independence had already been obtained, M'ba cracked down on PUNGA, claiming its goal had already been reached. He filed an [[arrest warrant]] for Sousatte for conspiring against him and searched the houses of UDSG members, who he accused of complicity. Intimidated, three deputies of the UDSG joined the majority.&lt;ref name="Bernault296"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of Gabon==

===Consolidation of power===
On 19 June 1960, legislative elections were organised through the ''[[scrutin de liste]]'' voting system, a form of [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc voting]] in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and obtains all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77.&lt;ref name="Bernault297"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the month before full political independence of Gabon was achieved on 13 August, M'ba signed 15 cooperation agreements with France, pertaining to national defense, technical cooperation, economic support, access to materials, and national stability.&lt;ref name=frenchinvolvement/&gt; On 17 August, independence was proclaimed. However, the Prime Minister realistically declared on 12 August, "We must not waste our chances by imagining that with independence, we now own a powerful fetish that will fulfill our wishes. In believing that with independence everything becomes easy and possible, there is a danger of descending into anarchy, disorder, poverty, famine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Ne gaspillons pas notre chance en imaginant qu’avec l'indépendance, nous détenons désormais un fétiche tout puissant qui va combler tous nos vœux. En croyant qu’avec l'indépendance tout est possible et facile, on risque de sombrer dans l'anarchie, le désordre, la misère, la famine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M'ba aspired to establish a democratic regime, which, in his view, was necessary for the development and attraction of investments in Gabon. He attempted to reconcile the imperatives of democracy and the necessity for a strong and coherent government.&lt;ref name="Biteghe35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in practice, the regime showed a fundamental weakness in attaining M'ba's goal in which he, who had by this time become known as "the old man",&lt;ref name="leaderindependence"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/11/29/archives/leon-mba-president-of-gabon-since-independence-dies-at-65-de-gaulle.html|title=Léon M'ba, President of Gabon Since Independence, Dies at 65|date=19 November 1967|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=47|accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the boss", would have a high degree of authority. A [[cult of personality]] developed steadily around M'ba; songs were sung in his praise and stamps and loincloths were printed with his effigy.&lt;ref name="Biteghe29"/&gt; His photograph was displayed in stores and hotels across Gabon, in government buildings hung next to that of de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matthews|1966|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1960, a crisis broke out within the majority party. After deciding to [[cabinet shuffle|reshuffle the cabinet]] without consulting Parliament, the president of the National Assembly, Paul Gondjout, a previous ally of M'ba's, filed a [[motion of no confidence|motion of censure]].&lt;ref name="Bernault300"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gondjout supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and specifically sought the establishment of a strong parliament and a prime minister with [[executive (government)|executive power]].&lt;ref name="Keese162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keese|2004|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively. On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, he declared a [[state of emergency]], ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after.&lt;ref name="Bernault300"/&gt; Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961.&lt;ref name="Biteghe41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gondjout was sentenced to two years in prison. Sousatte, who also opposed the constitution, was also sentenced to the same amount of jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|1996|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their releases, M'ba appointed Gondjout president of the economic council and Sousatte Minister of Agriculture, both mostly symbolic posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|1996|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Hyperprésident" of Gabon===
On 4 December, M'ba was elected to replace Gondjout as Secretary General of the BDG.&lt;ref name="Bernault301"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to the opposition to strengthen his position.&lt;ref name="Biteghe41"/&gt; With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions to appeal to the electorate.&lt;ref name="Biteghe44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Biteghe42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, M'ba was elected President of Gabon, being the only candidate.&lt;ref name="Biteghe44"/&gt; In thanks for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as [[foreign minister]] to replace [[André Gustave Anguilé]].&lt;ref name="Biteghe42"/&gt;

On 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted,&lt;ref name="Biteghe44"/&gt; providing for a "hyperpresidential" regime.&lt;ref name="Biteghe46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; M'ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of [[Fulbert Youlou]] at roughly the same time.&lt;ref name=RM123&gt;{{Harvnb|Matthews|1966|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the French secret service summarized the situation as follows:

{{quote|He regarded himself as a truly democratic leader; nothing irritated him more than being called a dictator. Still, he wasn't happy until he had the constitution rewritten to give him virtually all power and transforming the parliament into high-priced scenery that could be bypassed as needed.&lt;ref name="Keese162"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Se voulant et se croyant sincèrement démocrate, au point qu’aucune accusation ne l'irrite davantage que celle d'être un dictateur, il n’en a pas moins eu de cesse qu’il n’ait fait voter une constitution lui accordant pratiquement tous les pouvoirs et réduisant le parlement au rôle d'un décor coûteux que l'on escamote même en cas de besoin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The new constitution and the National Union (a political union they founded) suspended the quarrels between M'ba and Aubame from 1961 to 1963. Despite this, political unrest grew within the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many students held demonstrations on the frequent dissolutions of the National Assembly and the general political attitude in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president did not hesitate to enforce the law himself; with a [[sjambok|chicotte]], he whipped citizens who did not show respect for him, including passersby who "forgot" to salute him.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; In addition, in February 1961, he decreed the internment of approximately 20 people for these demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Bernault301"/&gt;

On 9 February 1963, the President pardoned those arrested during the political crisis of November 1960.&lt;ref name="Biteghe54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February, he broke his ties with Aubame; all UDSG representatives were dismissed, with the exception of M'ba supporter Francis Meye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February.&lt;ref name="Biteghe54"/&gt; Thereafter, M'ba claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with parliamentary functions. Aubame resolved the problem by resigning from his post on the Supreme Court, complicating matters for M'ba.&lt;ref name="Biteghe55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with reports of tension between the government and the National Assembly, even though 70% of it were BDG members, the Gabonese president dissolved the legislature on 21 January 1964&lt;ref name="Biteghe59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as an "economy measure".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873821,00.html |title=De Gaulle to the Rescue|date=28 February 1964|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2008-08-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing anyone who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darlington|Darlington|1968|pp=123–124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.&lt;ref name="Biteghe59"/&gt;

===1964 Gabon coup d'état===
{{main|1964 Gabon coup d'état}}
[[File:Afrique 32.JPG|thumb|left|Gabonese and French military officers]]
From the night of 17 February to the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 Gabonese military personnel, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, arrested President of the National Assembly [[Louis Bigmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/20/archives/gabon-insurgents-yield-as-france-rushes-in-troops-paris-aids.html|title=Gabon Insurgents Yield as France Rushes in Troops|last=Giniger|first=Henry|date=20 February 1964|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer,&lt;ref name="resumesoffice"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/21/archives/gabon-president-resumes-office-mba-restored-by-french-vows-total.html|title=Gabon President Resumes Office: Mba, Restored by French, Vows 'Total Punishment' for All Who Aided Coup|last=Garrison|first=Lloyd|page=1|date=21 February 1964|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a [[coup d'état]] had taken place, and that they required technical assistance and told the French not interfere in this matter. M'ba was instructed to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat.&lt;ref name="Biteghe62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits", he said. "It came to a boil."&lt;ref name="Biteghe62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Le jour J est arrivé, les injustices ont dépassé la mesure, ce peuple est patient, mais sa patience a des limites... il est arrivé à bout."&lt;/ref&gt;

During these events, no gunshots were fired. The people did not react strongly, which according to the military, was a sign of approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout.&lt;ref name="Biteghe64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plotters were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt;

Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to [[Ndjolé]], Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to [[Lambaréné]]. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville.&lt;ref name=DD134&gt;{{Harvnb|Darlington|Darlington|1968|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new head of government quickly contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals was protected and to ask him to prevent any French military intervention.&lt;ref name="Biteghe19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in Paris, de Gaulle decided otherwise.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; M'ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa. While visiting France in 1961, M'ba said: "All Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon."&lt;ref&gt;"Tout Gabonais a deux patries : la France et le Gabon."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biteghe23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, under his regime, Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment.&lt;ref name="Biteghe23"/&gt; The French authorities therefore decided, in accordance with signed Franco-Gabon agreements, to restore the legitimate government.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was otherwise occupied, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, [[Paul Marie Yembit]], who had not been arrested.&lt;ref name="Biteghe19"/&gt; However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in [[Dakar]] and [[Brazzaville]] landed in Libreville and restored M'ba back into power.&lt;ref name="Bernault19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernault|1996|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Grundy|first=Kenneth W.|title=On Machiavelli and the Mercenaries|jstor=159300|date=October 1968|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=6|pages=295–310|oclc=|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00017420|issue=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the operation, one French soldier was killed, while 15 to 25 died on the Gabonese side.&lt;ref name="Bernault19"/&gt;

===Under the tutelage of France===
After he was reinstated into power, M'ba refused to consider the coup was directed against him and his regime.&lt;ref name="Biteghe100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed it was a conspiracy against the state. Soon, however, anti-government demonstrations sprang up, with slogans such as "''Léon M'ba, président des Français!''" ({{lang-en|"Léon M'ba, president of the French"}}) or ones that called for the end of the "dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They showed solidarity after Aubame was charged on 23 March for his alleged involvement in the coup d'état.&lt;ref name="Biteghe100"/&gt; Despite the fact that he did not participate in the planning of the coup, Aubame was sentenced at his trial to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these events, legislative elections, which were planned before the coup, were held in April 1964. The major opposition parties were deprived of their leaders, who were prevented from participating in the elections due to their involvement in the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UDSG disappeared from the political scene, and the opposition consisted of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. The opposition still won 46% of the votes and 16 of 47 seats, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats in the assembly.&lt;ref name="Biteghe96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His French friends constantly surrounded him, protecting or providing him with counsel. A presidential guard was created by [[Bob Maloubier]], a former French secret agent, and co-financed by French oil groups.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; The oil groups, active in the country since 1957, had strengthened their interests in 1962 after the discovery of offshore oil deposits.&lt;ref name="guillaumat"&gt;{{citation|last=Gaston-Breton|first=Tristan|title=Pierre Guillaumat, Elf et la " Françafrique " |url=http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/2006/LesEchos/19726-47-ECH.htm|work=[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]|date=9 August 2006|accessdate=2008-08-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabon quickly became a major oil supplier for France. They carried such influence in Gabon that following the February 1964 coup, the decision to seek military intervention was taken by the CEO of Union Générale des Pétroles (UGP; now known as [[Elf Aquitaine]]), [[Pierre Guillaumat]], Foccart, and other French businessmen and leaders.&lt;ref name="guillaumat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|1996|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, another UGP executive, Guy Ponsaillé, was appointed as political adviser to the president and became M'ba's representative in discussions with French companies. However, the Gabonese president was afraid of internal strife or assassination, so he remained secluded inside his heavily defended presidential palace. Ponsaillé helped M'ba obtain support from political moderates and accompanied him in his visits around the country in order to restore his reputation among the Gabonese people.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt;

French ambassador Cousseran and American ambassador Charles F. Darlington, suspected of sympathizing with Aubame, left shortly after the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biteghe|1990|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new French ambassador François Simon de Quirielle, a "traditional diplomat", was determined not to interfere in the internal affairs of Gabon.&lt;ref name="foccart"&gt;{{Harvnb|Foccart|Gaillard|1995|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months of misunderstandings with de Quirielle, M'ba contacted Foccart to tell him that he could no longer work with the Ambassador. Foccart recounted the events in his memoirs, ''Foccart Speaks'':

{{quote|Do you realise, exploded the Gabonese President, I'm receiving de Quirielle to summarize the situation with him. I'm asking him his thoughts about this or that [Gabonese] minister, about this or that in the agenda [in Gabon's political interior]. And guess what his answer was? Mister President, I'm really sorry, but the duties I hold forbid me from intervening in the affairs of your country.&lt;ref name="foccart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Vous vous rendez compte, explose le président gabonais, je reçois de Quirielle pour faire un tour d'horizon avec lui. Je lui demande ce qu’il pense de tel ministre [gabonais], de telle question qui est à l'ordre du jour [de la politique intérieure du Gabon]. Devinez ce qu’il me réplique! Monsieur le président, je suis désolé, les fonctions que j’occupe m’interdisent d'intervenir comme vous me le demandez dans les affaires de votre pays.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result of this incident, Foccart appointed a "colonialist", Maurice Delauney, as the new French Ambassador to Gabon.&lt;ref name="foccart"/&gt;

===Succession and legacy===
From 1965, the French began looking for a successor for M'ba, who was aging and sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foccart|1997|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They found the perfect candidate in [[Albert Bernard Bongo]] (later known as Alhaji Omar Bongo Ondimba), a young leader in the President's cabinet.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt; Bongo was personally "tested" by General de Gaulle in 1965, during a visit to the [[Élysée Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Yahmed|first=Béchir Ben|title=Bongo par lui-même|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN17073bongoemmiul0 |newspaper=[[Jeune Afrique]]|date=17 July 2001|accessdate=2008-08-04|language=fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmed as M'ba's successor, Bongo was appointed on 24 September 1965 as Presidential Representative and placed in charge of defence and coordination.&lt;ref name=rvx/&gt;

In August 1966, M'ba was admitted to the Hôpital Charles Bernard, a hospital in Paris.&lt;ref name=Reed299&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1987|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inability to govern, the president clung to his power. Only after a long insistence by Foccart did M'ba agree to appoint Bongo as Vice President in replacement of Yembit, announcing his decision through a radio and television message recorded in his room on 14 November 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biarnes|2007|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A constitutional reform in February 1967 legitimized Bongo as M'ba's successor.&lt;ref name=Reed299/&gt; The preparations for the succession were finalized by the early legislative and presidential elections held on 19 March 1967. Since no one dared to stand on the opposition ticket, M'ba was reelected with 99.9% of the vote, while the BDG won all seats in the Assembly.&lt;ref name="Biarnes174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biarnes|2007|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1967, just days after he took his presidential oath at the Gabonese embassy, M'ba died of cancer in Paris, where he had been treated since August of that year. He was survived by his wife, Pauline M'ba, and 11 children.&lt;ref name="leaderindependence"/&gt; The day after M'ba's death, Bongo constitutionally succeeded him as President of Gabon.&lt;ref name=Reed299/&gt; Gabon's main airport, the [[Libreville International Airport|Leon M'ba International Airport]], was later named for him.

Forty years after his death, the Léon M'ba Memorial was built in Libreville to honor his memory. President Bongo laid the cornerstone for the Memorial on 9 February 2007, and it was inaugurated by Bongo on 27 November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mosa&gt;{{citation|title=REALISATIONS: Mémorial Léon Mba|url=http://www.mosa-concept.com/realisations.html|newspaper=Mosa Concept News|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-14|language=fr}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, it was opened to the public.&lt;ref name=Afrik&gt;{{Citation|first=Pierre Eric Mbog|last=Batassi|url=http://www.afrik.com/article15153.html|title=Gabon: Mémorial Léon Mba, un devoir de mémoire réussi|newspaper=Afrik.com|date=2009-09-13|accessdate=2008-09-14|language=fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to serving as a mausoleum for M'ba,&lt;ref name=Mosa/&gt; the Memorial is a cultural center.&lt;ref name=Afrik/&gt;

Ann Trow Sommers, was born in [[Painswick]], Gloucestershire, England in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlson|2008}} p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a labourer. At the age of fifteen she started work as a maid in a butcher's family, and at sixteen she married a [[Wiltshire]] man called Henry Sommers, who was an alcoholic tailor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olasky|first=Marvin|date=Summer 1986|title=Advertising abortion in the 1830s and 1840s: Madame Restell Builds a Business|url=https://ill.libraries.ou.edu/illiad.dll?Action=10&amp;Form=75&amp;Value=980970|journal=Journalism History|volume=13:2|pages=49–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years living in England, they emigrated to New York in 1831 where Sommers died of Typhoid in 1833.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ann Trow Sommers was left alone with an infant daughter, Caroline,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Crimes of Womanhood|last=Carlson|first=A. Cheree|publisher=University for Illinois Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-252-03401-5|location=Illinois|pages=111–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forced to make a poor living as a [[seamstress]] and midwife.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ann remarried in 1836, to a [[Volga Germans|German–Russian]] immigrant, Charles Lohman. Charles Lohman worked in the printing industry, and at the time was a printer for the ''[[New York Herald]]''. Lohman was a [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Freethought|freethinker]], a friend and colleague of [[George Matsell]], the publisher of the radical journal the ''Free Inquirer''. With Matsell, Lohman was involved in the publication of [[Robert Dale Owen]]'s book ''Moral Physiology; or, a Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question'' (1831) and [[Charles Knowlton]]'s ''Fruits of Philosophy; or, The Private Companion of Young Married People'' (1831) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fruits of Philosophy: A Treatise on the Population Question|last=Knowlton|first=Charles|publisher=Reader's Library|year=1891|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann's brother, Joseph Trow, had also emigrated to New York, and was working as a sales assistant in a [[pharmacy]]. Ann continued to develop an interest in women's health.

== Overview of career ==
Charles and Ann developed a story to validate Ann's interests in midwifery and women's health. According to their story, she had travelled to Europe to train in midwifery with a renowned French physician named Restell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She began selling [[patent medicine]], and (probably in partnership with her husband and brother) creating [[birth control]] products such as "preventative powders" and "Female Monthly Pills", advertised under the name "Madame Restell". She sold these products through the post and performed house visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When these "Monthly Pills" proved insufficient for a woman to end a pregnancy and thus maintain good standing in society, Restell devised another solution. Self-professed doctors and pharmacists, she and her husband became surgeons. The new title ensured more profitable procedures could be performed under the same legal penalty given for offering medication-induced abortions.&lt;ref&gt;Browder, Clifford. ''The Wickedest Woman in New York''. 16. Hamden: Archon Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortifacients used in this era were often blends of herbs such as [[ergot]], [[calomel]], [[aloe]], or [[black hellebore]]. These were thought to upset the digestive tract, inducing a miscarriage. Surgical abortions included rupturing the amniotic sac, or dilating the cervix (premature labor), or even in-utero decapitation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:National Police Gazette Restell.jpg|thumb]]
Madame Restell advertised her services as a "Female Physician" in newspapers such as the ''Herald'' and even the ''New York Times.'' She and her husband Charles operated out of a large brownstone mansion on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/realestate/madame-restells-other-profession.html|title=Madame Restell’s Other Profession|last=Gray|first=Christopher|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

When Restell began her business, abortions were hardly illegal. Only surgical abortions were forbidden. This was only after the [[quickening]], that is, when the woman started to feel the [[Fetal movement|fetus move]] (this was typically around 4 months time). Soon, Restell's success began to attract copiers and competition. This drew the attention of the AMA, which officially launched a campaign in 1857 to end abortion.  In order to rally support for their cause, the AMA targeted Restell, the most celebrated abortionist and deemed her the enemy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term "Restellism" became a euphemism for abortion. With the swift changes of law in New York, Restell was constantly being hounded by authorities and anti-abortion crusaders to end her practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She was also met with opposition from the press. Enoch E. Camp and George Wilkes' ''National Police Gazette'' covered New York's "crime news" and detailed stories about theft, abortion, and rape, among others. Coverage was not limited to New York but rather extended to major cities throughout the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Browder, Clifford. ''The Wickedest Woman'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gazette claimed that in addition to performing abortions, "…most of the abandoned infants found almost daily throughout the city came from her [Restell's ] establishment."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative editors such as Samuel Jenks Smith of the New York Sunday Morning News also publicly condemned Restell's profession. On July 7, 1839—the earliest press's attack on Restell—his editorial claimed her business "…strikes at the root of all social order." According to Smith, doctors believed Restell was engaging in dangerous work, and that "...what she was doing was impossible without endangering the lives of the patients."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work was considered "sinful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boweryboyshistory.com/2016/08/notorious-madame-restell-abortionist-fifth-avenue.html|title=The Notorious Madame Restell: The Abortionist of Fifth Avenue - The Bowery Boys: New York City History|date=2016-08-18|work=The Bowery Boys: New York City History|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;."
 
But exposure of this controversy was not limited to men. Female journalists also engaged in undercover operations to shed light on illegal abortions in cities such as Chicago, with one example being the Chicago Times' "Girl Reporter." This unidentified woman exposed physicians like the Chicago Medical Society's Dr. J.H. Etheridge, Dr. John Chaffee, and Dr. Edwin Hale. At her pleadings, these doctors and others agreed to perform abortions and thus violate the 1867 Illinois statute penalizing such procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Kim. "Those Magnificent Women and Their Typing Machines." Smithsonian Magazine. Accessed 10/5/17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madame Restell became so well known throughout New York City that copies of her trials were published in the ''Times'' and the ''Police Gazette.'' She was listed as a New York City attraction in NYC tour guides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legal troubles ==
In 1840, a patient named Maria Purdy accused Restell of causing tuberculosis through the abortion procedure. The press erupted with slander against Restell, calling her "the monster in human shape" and charging her with acts against God. Restell promised monetary compensation for anyone who could prove her methods were dangerous, and while she was initially found guilty, her appeal overturned said verdict. Her uneasy relationship with public opinion continued.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/madame-restell-the-abortionist-of-fifth-avenue-145109198/|title=Madame Restell: The Abortionist of Fifth Avenue|last=Abbott|first=Karen|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Applegate was an unmarried woman, a mistress, who had been sent to Madame Restell from Philadelphia by her illicit lover. The father had arranged for Restell to adopt the baby out.  Applegate was unaware of this deal until she had returned to Philadelphia and was greeted coldly by her former lover. Applegate then went back to Restell to ask for her child back, but Restell claimed to know nothing of the infant. Restell was immediately painted as the villain by the press in publications such as the ''New York Medical and Surgical Reporter.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1841, [[Mary Rogers]] was found dead in the Hudson River. Newspapers suggested that she had died during an abortion carried out by Restell.

Abortion was soon outlawed by the state of New York in 1845. This law further restricted the previous laws from a decade earlier. An abortion that resulted in the death of the mother or was performed after the "quickening" was second degree manslaughter. A new addendum to the law made selling abortifacients or performing abortions at any stage during the pregnancy a misdemeanor punishable by a mandatory year in jail. Additionally, women who sought after an abortion or attempted their own abortion were fined $1000.  Abortion became legally defined as an obscene subject and was no longer covered in the papers. Women were no longer allowed to freely discuss abortion. Restell skirted the legalities by advertising her services as methods to regulate menses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1847, Charges were again brought against Restell for performing an abortion, which led to a conviction.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Madame-Restell|title=Madame Restell {{!}} American abortionist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blackwell's Island prison.jpg|thumb|260x260px|
Blackwell's Island Prison
]]This conviction, however, was "universally hailed," and media coverage of the trial prompted discussion surrounding for-profit abortions performed by physicians. Furthermore, it was noted that the victims were typically "poor, uneducated women" from New England and Connecticut who came to New York for abortions.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, "Those Magnificent Women," 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maria Bodine was sent to Madame Restell by her master so that she could procure an abortion from Restell. Restell determined that Maria was too far along to have an abortion, but Maria's master insisted. Finally, he paid Restell heavily and she agreed to perform Maria's abortion. Maria then returned to her job as a maid. She fell ill and upon visiting a doctor, was forced to admit her abortion. Restell was taken to trial. During this case, Madame  Restell's defense painted Bodine as a "loose" woman whose injuries were a result of syphilis and had nothing to do with Restell, while Maria Bodine's lawyers cast Restell as a godless incompetent woman. Restell lost the case and was charged with a misdemeanor and a one-year prison sentence which was on Blackwell's Island.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After Madame Restell finished her sentence, she reworked her business. She removed surgical abortions entirely, and concentrated her efforts on pills and her boarding house. In 1854, Restell applied for US citizenship and was granted it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence given in a breach-of-promise case in 1854 suggests Restell and her husband were charging between $50 and $100 per abortion at this time and had a regular clientele. Prior to the 1845 law, Restell was charging her clients on a sliding scale according to social class. Many of Restell's wealthier patients were charged the upwards of $1000.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scandalous Lady|last=Keller|first=Allan|publisher=Atheneum|year=1981|isbn=0-689-11213-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Madame Restell dialed back her business, the press did not leave her reputation to rest. She was dubbed "The Wickedest Woman in New York".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:New York Halls of Justice.jpg|thumb|New York Halls of Justice]]
In 1855, Frederica Medinger, a German immigrant, approached Restell entreating as to room to stay in until the birth of her child According to Medinger, Restell gave her six pills at the time of the birth. A day after the birth, Medinger asked for her child and was told by Mme. Restell that the child had disappeared. The Madame was accused of kidnapping and being too greedy. When Restell was brought to court, Medinger did not show. Many assumed Restell had paid her to drop the case. Restell was dismissed and the woman and her baby were never heard of again. It is assumed the child was adopted out by Restell.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The various reactions to Restell and her New York practice echoed general attitudes toward abortion in the United States. Traveling salesmen in cities such as Boston and Philadelphia heard of her financial success and sold pills to capitalize on similar profits.&lt;ref&gt;Lizza, Ryan. "The Abortion Capital of America: As the Pro-Life Movement Intensifies Nationwide, New York Contemplates Its History and Future as a Refuge." New York Magazine. Retrieved 10/30/17.&lt;/ref&gt; Before her own legal troubles, Restell heard stories of abortionists in Philadelphia and Lowell, Massachusetts indicted for murder—indicators of growing opposition to the practice on a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;Browder, Clifford. ''The Wickedest Woman'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case was that of Dr. John Stevens, a physician who performed an abortion on a young Boston woman named Gallagher. Her death, a consequence of this high-risk operation, prompted Stevens to be accused of murder.&lt;ref&gt;''The Louisville Daily Courier'', 10 April 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Civil War distracted many Americans from the abortion debate, its end allowed some physicians to return to their anti-abortion campaign.

"Since the embryo, they argued, was fully alive from the point of conception, abortion at any point in time—regardless of whether the mother had quickened or not—was murder pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some physician took clear moral stances on the issue, others found their campaign increased the likelihood that untrained physicians would be penalized, thereby creating the potential to advance the activists' own professional goals.

Madame Restell had amassed a fortune. She owned several plots of land, one of which featured an extravagant mansion. She had the finest horses, carriages, and silk dresses. The Civil War gave Mme. Restell the cover she needed to get her business back on her feet. Although she had been imprisoned once and accused numerous times, Restell appeared ultimately unscathed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Comstock's deception ==
Postal Inspector [[Anthony Comstock]] was an influential moral reformer, who sought not only to regulate sexual activity, but the very way society thought about sex. He considered any information regarding the prevention or termination of a pregnancy to be pornographic. In 1873, the US Congress enacted the "Comstock Law," which made it illegal to discuss or distribute anything considered obscene by the government. Breaking these laws were punishable by six months to five years in prison and a fine of $100-$2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ann Lohman was arrested by Comstock, who posed as a customer looking for birth control pills and brought the police around the next day to have her arrested. Bail was set at $1000. Madame Restell was said to have reached into her purse to pull out $10,000, but the judge would only accept regular bail bonds,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; so Restell had to pay a bondsman. Following Restell's arrest in early 1878, a maid discovered Restell in the bathtub at her [[Fifth Avenue]] home; she had slit her own throat on the morning of April 1, 1878.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Upon her death, she was found to be worth between $500,000-$600,000 ($12.4 million-$14.9 million in present-day terms).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Literature==
Ann Trow Lohman is acknowledged as the inspiration for Kate Manning's heroine Annie "Axie" Muldoon in her historical novel ''My Notorious Life'', published on June 6, 2013 (UK) by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]].

Madame Restell is also a prominent character in Marge Piercy's historical novel, "Sex Wars", which depicts the social and political climate surrounding women's sexual, physical, and reproductive activities during the [[Gilded Age]].

Restell features as a minor character in Gore Vidal's novel 1876.
Restell is also featured in Edward Rutherfurd's novel New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">'''Max Léglise''' (1924–1996) was a [[France|French]] [[oenologist]]. Most of his career was spent working at the ''Station œnologique de Bourgogne'' ([[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[Beaune]]), where he entered in 1948, and that he directed from 1962 to 1984. 

Departing from the dominant conventional œnology that he practiced at the beginning of his career, he developed biological methods to be applied to vinification.
He was also one of the initiators of [[Wine_tasting#Sensory_analysis|sensory analysis]] and was therefore well regarded by fellow oenologists, wine merchants, and restaurateurs.

'''Mike Dash''' (born 1963) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writer, historian and researcher. He is best known for books and articles dealing with dramatic yet little-known episodes in history.

==Biography==
Dash was born in [[London]]. He attended [[Peterhouse]], a college at the [[University of Cambridge]] particularly noted for teaching [[history]],&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |title=David Knowles Remembered |editor=Brooke, Christopher |year=1991 |isbn=0-521-37233-X |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterhouse School"&gt;http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/themes/peterhouse_school.html&lt;/ref&gt; and completed postgraduate work at [[King's College London]], where he obtained a Ph.D.

Dash authored a series of books covering incidents in the history of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the [[Netherlands]], [[India under British rule]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] during the [[Progressive Era]]. Each focuses on a single event or series of events, among them the wreck of the East Indiaman [[Batavia (ship)|''Batavia'']], the Dutch [[tulip mania]] of 1634-1637, and the early years of the [[American Mafia]]. More recently he has become known as the author of a wide-ranging weekly historical [[blog]], "Past Imperfect", written for the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

As a historian, Dash is noted for the high quality of his research, which the academic journal ''The Age of Sail'' described as being "to a level rarely seen in books intended for a general audience."&lt;ref name="The Age of Sail"&gt;''The Age of Sail'', 2003 p.198.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' applauded his work as “up-close, personal, and full of you-are-there detail," adding, "Dash is that rarity: a perfectionist in his research and a writer who perfectly carves out his story with a pen as sharp as a stiletto,"&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"&gt;''The Globe and Mail'', August 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised his "unabashedly cinematic flair, backed by meticulous research."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;''New York Times'', April 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', writing of Dash's book on the ''Batavia'', charged that while he took the story "to a new level of grotesque accuracy," his "nautical drama never truly comes to life." &lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;''Publishers Weekly'', June 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Past Imperfect" has also attracted comment for introducing history that rarely features in text books to a new generation of readers. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' identified it as "the most mind-boggling read of the week",&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' added: "Show it to any kid who's complaining that history is boring and that will be the end of that conversation. And the beginning of a new one."&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor"&gt;''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dash's most recent book, ''The First Family'', is a new history of [[Giuseppe Morello]] and the establishment of [[the Mafia]] in the [[United States]]. He began writing for the Smithsonian in July 2011 when the Institution acquired his history site, A Blast from the Past, shortly after the [[History News Network]] awarded it the 2010 Cliopatria prize for history blogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/135179 | title=The Cliopatria Awards, 2010 | work=History News Network | date=January 7, 2011 | accessdate=2 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About A Blast from the Past"&gt;http://allkindsofhistory.wordpress.com/about/#comment-138&lt;/ref&gt;

She received a [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in [[sociology]] from the [[Université de Montréal]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. She describes her early life in Montreal as challenging, but credits community groups and her childhood role as a [[Girl Guides of Canada]] member as "sav(ing) her life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/monique-begin-the-feminist-trailblazer/|title=Monique Bégin: The feminist trailblazer - Macleans.ca|date=2017-11-07|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In 1967, Bégin became executive secretary of the [[Royal Commission on the Status of Women]], which published its report in 1970.

Bégin, [[Albanie Morin]] and [[Jeanne Sauvé]], all elected in 1972, were the first women ever elected to the House of Commons from [[Quebec]].

She was appointed to the [[Canadian Cabinet]] by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] as [[Minister of National Revenue (Canada)|Minister of National Revenue]] in 1976, and served as [[Minister of National Health and Welfare (Canada)|Minister of Health and Welfare]] from 1977 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984 during which the [[Canada Health Act]] was enacted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4574">'''Morfran''' ([[Middle Welsh]]: ''Moruran'' "cormorant"; literally "sea crow", from ''môr'', "sea", and ''brân'', "crow", from [[Common Brittonic]] *''mori-brannos'', as in [[French language|French]] ''cormoran'' &lt; L ''corvus marinus'')&lt;ref name="Zimmer2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmer|first1=Stephan|title=Some Names and Epithets in "Culhwch ac Olwen"|journal=Studi Celtici|date=2004|volume=3|page=176|url=https://www.academia.edu/4135527/2006_Some_Names_and_Epithets_in_Culhwch_ac_Olwen_|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a figure in [[Welsh mythology]]. Usually portrayed as a warrior under [[King Arthur]], he is noted for the darkness of his skin and his hideousness. He appears in the narratives about the bard [[Taliesin]] and in the [[Welsh Triads]], where he is often contrasted with the angelically handsome [[Sanddef]].

==Appearances==
He appears in the ''[[Taliesin|Tale of Taliesin]]'', where he is depicted as the son of [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]], and is given an extremely beautiful sister named Creirwy. In later versions of this tale his characteristic ugliness is transferred to a brother, '''Afagddu''' (Middle Welsh: ''Avagddu''; from ''y fagddu'', "utter darkness"), though [[Ifor Williams]] suggested this name arose as a nickname for the famously gruesome Morfran.{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=452}} In the story, Ceridwen tries to help her son make his way in the world by creating a potion whose first three drops would bestow the drinker with knowledge of the future. She gives Gwion Bach (the bard Taliesin) the job of stirring the brew; he splashes three drops on his fingers and licks them, whereupon he gains the knowledge intended for Morfran/Afagddu, who remains ugly and despised. The story has a parallel in the Irish tale ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', in which the young hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] receives prophetic wisdom intended for his master [[Finn Eces]] by consuming the [[Salmon of Knowledge]].{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=453}}

Morfran eil Tegid (Morfran son of Tegid) appears in several of the [[Welsh Triads]]. In Triad 24 he is recognized as one of the "Three Slaughter-Blocks of the Island of Britain",{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=46–47}} while Triad 41 celebrates his horse Guelwgan Gohoewgein (Silver-White, Proud and Fair) as one of the "Three Lover's Horses of the Island of Britain".{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=109–110}} Other manuscripts attribute this horse to Drystan ([[Tristan]]) and [[Ceredig ap Gwallawg]]. In other triads he is associated with [[Sanddef]], whose beauty is as notable as Morfran's ugliness. In a triad preserved in the prose tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', Morfran and Sanddef are named as two of the three men who survived the [[Battle of Camlann]], in Morfran's case because his ugliness led everyone to believe he was "a devil helping, for there was hair on his face like the hair of a stag."&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; This triad was adapted in the 15th-century triad collection known as "The Twenty-four Knights of Arthur's Court"; the pair are two of the "Three Irresistible Knights", as their peculiarities made it "repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything."{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=268}}

Morfran is further mentioned in the 12th-century prose tale ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Bromwich]] notes that a 12th-century poem by [[Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr]] contains a reference to an otherwise forgotten early poet named Morfran, and suggests a connection with the Morfran of ''The Tale of Taliesin'' who was the intended recipient of the cauldron of poetic inspiration.{{sfn|Bromwich|2014|p=453}} Scholar Caitlin Green further suggests a connection with the character called "Osfran's Son", who is buried at Camlann according to the ''[[Englynion y Beddau]]'' (''Stanzas of the Graves'').&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver King''' ([[circa|c.]] 1432&amp;nbsp;– 29 August 1503) was a [[Bishop of Exeter]] and [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] who restored [[Bath Abbey]] after 1500.

==Early life==
King was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was a king's scholar, and [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated Master of Arts by 1456/57, was a [[Fellow]] of King's and served as junior proctor of the University in 1459–1460.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KN449O|name=King, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[priest]] then studied civil law at the [[University of Orléans]] as well as at Cambridge, graduating as [[doctor of Civil Law]].

==Career==
In 1466 King was appointed Rector of Broughton, Hampshire, and in 1473 Warden of St John's Hospital, [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Under the new regime of [[Edward IV of England]] he was appointed [[Clerk of the Signet]] in 1473, in 1475 was sent as ambassador to the [[Duke of Brittany]].

On 18 March 1476, Oliver King Master of the seven liberal Arts and Licentate in Laws, became the king's 'first and principal Secretary' for the French tongue for life, and succeeded [[William Hatteclyffe]] as [[Secretary of State (England)|king's secretary]] in 1480.;&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Gunn, 'King, Oliver (d. 1503), bishop of Bath and Wells' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and receiving the salary of £20 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Rymer's Foedera, vol.7, p.26; Rotuli Parliamentorum (1477), p.1 and (1478), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly being expert in "the French language" Dr King was effectively second secretary, dischargng the duties of the Signet in Hatteclyffe's absence.  Under Edward IV the Secretary's office expanded the number of clerks to at least four, with a Gentleman and "writers of the King's Signet under him".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Secretary and his clerks pay for their carriage of harness in court, except a little coffer to which the king's warrants and bills are signed, and other letters and remembrances be kept ...Thiis coffer is carried at the King's cost, whereas the Controller will sign.  The Secretary has 3 Getlemen-in-waiting on him for all that office.  The remnant of all other servants to be found at his livery in the country delivered by the Herberger...{{Sic|whe}} he is out, ehe has a yeoman to keep chamber, eating at Chamberlain's board in the hall: both he and his clerks take clothing off the King's Wardrobe.&lt;ref&gt;Rotuli Parliamentorum, vol.6, pp.220-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During the early modern monarchy the Secretaries gradually assumed more importance, and standing at court, their office expanded and their salary improved to the same as the Clerk of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Foedera, vol.11, p.848&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1480 he was appointed [[Dean and Canons of Windsor#Canons of the Eleventh Stall|Canon of the eleventh stall]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], a position he held until 1503.&lt;ref&gt;''Fasti Wyndesorienses'', May 1950. S.L. Ollard. Published by the Dean and Canons of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.&lt;/ref&gt;

King was appointed Bishop of Exeter on 1 October 1492, consecrated on 3 February 1493.&lt;ref name=Handbook247&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; He was then translated to the [[see of Bath and Wells]] on 6 November 1495. He died on 29 August 1503.&lt;ref name=Handbook228&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of Bath Abbey===

King organised the restoration of [[Bath Abbey]] after 1500.  The story of the refounding is told on the front of the Abbey in carved Bath stone. King had a dream in which he saw a host of [[angel]]s on a ladder, the [[Holy Trinity]] and an olive tree with a crown on it.  He heard a voice:

:'Let an Olive establish the crown, and let a King restore the Church.'

King believed this was a call for him to support the candidature of [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] as King, and to restore the Abbey.  These images are carved on the West Front of the Abbey with coats of arms of the Montague Family (who paid for the carved wooden doors) and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s [[coat of arms]].  There are also statues of the twelve [[apostles]], including a large statue of [[St Peter]] and one of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].

He is a wealthy, [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] Wall Street [[investment banker]] who leads a double life as a [[serial killer]]. Bateman has also briefly appeared in other Ellis novels and their film and theater adaptations.

==Biography and profile==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{in-universe|section|date=March 2017}}
Bateman works as a specialist in [[mergers and acquisitions]] at the fictional Wall Street investment firm of Pierce &amp; Pierce (also Sherman McCoy's firm in ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hermione|last=Hoby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/10/bonfire-of-vanities-tom-wolfe|title= The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=9 January 2010|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lives at 55 West 81st Street, [[Upper West Side]] on the 11th floor of the American Gardens Building (where he is a neighbor of actor [[Tom Cruise]]). In his secret life, however, Bateman is a serial killer murdering a variety of people, from colleagues to the homeless to prostitutes. His crimes—including [[rape]], [[torture]], [[necrophilia]], and [[cannibalism]]—are described in graphic detail in the novel.

Bateman comes from a wealthy family. His parents have a house on [[Long Island]], and he mentions a summer house in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. His parents [[divorce]]d sometime earlier, while his mother became sick and now resides at a [[sanatorium]]. His father, who first appeared in Ellis' preceding novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'', grew up on an estate in [[Connecticut]], and now owns an apartment in the [[Carlyle Hotel]] in [[Manhattan]].  He is assumed to be dead as he is mentioned only in past tense during the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynsay|last=Smith|url=http://www.gothic.stir.ac.uk/blog/i-am-blameless-the-failure-of-the-father-in-american-psycho-part-2-of-2/|title=‘I am blameless’: The Failure of the Father in American Psycho (Part 2 of 2)|website=
The Gothic Imagination|publisher=[[University of Stirling, Scotland]]|location=Stirling, Scotland|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateman's younger brother [[Sean Bateman|Sean]] attends [[Camden College (fictional college)|Camden College]] (and is a protagonist of Ellis' previous novel, ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'', in which Patrick Bateman was first introduced). Bateman attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] for prep school.  He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1984 and [[Harvard Business School]] two years later, and moved to [[New York City]].

By the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Owen, and leaves a message on his lawyer's answering machine confessing to his crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Owen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach, and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: "This is not an exit".

==Personality==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
{{in-universe|section|date=March 2017}}
As written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of [[yuppie]] greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and [[conspicuous consumption]]. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and [[home cinema|home theater]] sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Richards. He has a mistress on the side and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life he has anything approaching feelings for is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as "Jean, my secretary who is in love with me" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he "will probably end up married to someday".

Despite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well—his friends mock him as the "boy next door"; his own lawyer refers to him as a "bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody"; and he is often dismissed as "yuppie trash" by people outside his social circle.

Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own [[sanity]] and he has periodic attacks of [[psychosis]], during which he [[hallucination|hallucinates]]. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an [[unreliable narrator]]. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan |url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors |work=Movieline |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief—being on the "verge of tears"—often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he "just wants to be loved". He takes [[psychotropic]]s, like [[Xanax]], to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and "traditional moral values" because he thinks it will make him more likable. He also has a very [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] philosophy, believing that everything, such as morals, choices, principles, etc., are all ultimately meaningless.

Bateman compensates for these insecurities through obsessive vanity and [[personal grooming]], with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Alan Flusser]] and [[Valentino SpA|Valentino suits]], [[Oliver Peoples]] glasses and [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Louis Vuitton]] and [[Bottega Veneta]] leather goods) as a means of effecting some "control" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily "understood" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.

Bateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex, and is also a prolific rapist. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers ("I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking.

==Outside ''American Psycho''==
Bateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel ''[[Glamorama]]'', with "strange stains" on the lapel of his Armani suit.

Bateman also appeared in the ''American Psycho 2000'' e-mails ([http://www.briankotek.com/psycho/movie/am2000.cfm transcribed here]), which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. ''American Psycho 2000'' served as a sort of "e-quel" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.

Bateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel ''[[Lunar Park]]'', in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing ''American Psycho'' felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost—Bateman—haunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering.  Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.

In the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', protagonist [[Dexter Morgan]], himself a serial killer, uses the alias "Dr. Patrick Bateman" to acquire [[Etorphine|M-99]] for the use of incapacitating his victims.

On March 8, 2018, the video game [[Criminal Case (game)|Criminal Case]], which often parodies real people, combined the names of Patrick Bateman and [[Christian Bale]] to introduce a character named Christian Bateman, a young sociopathic venture capitalist who becomes a suspect in a murder after a body is discovered behind a wall in his apartment, but was cleared. He later became the suspect in the murder of a male stripper who attempted to get him to invest in a new night club and also cleared. He was eventually convicted of the murder of a performance artist who he fell in love with but rejected him. The game's in house psychologist had earlier diagnosed his victim as a sociopath.

==In film and stage==
Though [[Christian Bale]] had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Brad Pitt]]. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the ''American Psycho'' DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of [[Uma Thurman]], in the 2000 documentary ''This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis''. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/21/bret-easton-ellis-speaks-out-on-the-american-psycho-sequel|title= Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out on the American Psycho Sequel|publisher=ign.com |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes with the character were shot for the 2002 [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Ellis revealed in an interview that director [[Roger Avary]] asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he "thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with [[Casper Van Dien]]. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film.

In a 2009 interview with ''Black Book'', director [[Mary Harron]] said, "We talked about how [[Martian]]-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching [[Tom Cruise]] on [[David Letterman]], and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Helen|last=Weston |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/mary-harron-reveals-inspiration-behind-patrick-bateman/|title=Christian Bale's inspiration for 'American Psycho': Tom Cruise |work=[[BlackBook]]|publisher=McCarthy LLC|location=New York City|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
*October 1962: Patrick Bateman is born.&lt;ref&gt;The month can be narrowed down by passages where he briefly muses on what it means to be a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], as well as wondering what he will receive for his birthday in October. The year is 1962, derived from the fact that the novel begins in April 1989 &lt;!-- 1987 in the movie --&gt; and Patrick mentions in the narration that he is 26 years old.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1980: Bateman graduates from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].
*1984: Bateman graduates from [[Harvard University]].
*1985: Bateman has a short discussion with his estranged brother [[Sean Bateman|Sean]] about his future.
*1986: Bateman graduates from [[Harvard Business School]].
**From the time of his graduation, through the end of ''American Psycho'', Bateman works at Pierce &amp; Pierce.
*ca. 1996: Bateman shows up at Victor's club in ''[[Glamorama]]'' with "strange stains" on his suit.
*2000: Bateman enters therapy with a Dr. M. This appears in the ''American Psycho 2000'' e-mails. In these emails, he is divorcing Jean, to whom he has been married for at least five years, and with whom he has a son. He has started his own brokerage firm and seems to be wealthier than he was in the original novel. His tastes are even more refined. His homicidal tendencies (or thoughts) seem to have cooled a little with the birth of his son and have mellowed as he has gotten older, but have not disappeared completely.
*2003: Ellis kills off Patrick Bateman by writing an account of the serial killer being trapped in a pier fire. See ''[[Lunar Park]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6908">'''Robert S. Ellwood''' (born in [[Normal, Illinois]] in 1933) is an American academic, author and expert on world religions.

He was educated at the [[University of Colorado]], [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and was awarded a PhD in History of Religions from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1967. He was Professor of World Religions at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1967 until 1997 and is now professor emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;

Robert Scott Ellwood, Jr., was born July 17, 1933, in Normal, Illinois, the son of Robert Sr. and Knola Ellwood.    Robert Sr. was a teacher in the high school affiliated with Illinois State Normal University, and a pioneer in the development of sociology as a high school subject. In 1945 the family moved to Chadron, Nebraska, where Robert Sr. became chair of the Education Department at the Nebraska State Teachers College located there. 

Robert Jr. graduated from Chadron Preparatory School in 1951, and from the University of Colorado in 1954.  He then attended Berkeley Divinity School in New Haven, CT, an Episcopal seminary now affiliated with Yale Divinity School.  He graduated and was ordained a priest in the Episcopal church in 1957.  He pastored Christ Church, Central City, NE 1957-1960.

In 1961-62 Ellwood served as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy. While stationed in Okinawa and Japan he became interested in Japanese religion, and world religions generally. Reading the works of [[Mircea Eliade]] led to an interest in Eliade's structuralist and phenomenological approach to religion as a way of understanding similarities and differences in religions. As a consequence, in 1963 he entered the University of Chicago Divinity School's history of religion program led by Eliade, receiving the Ph.D. in 1967 after a final year of study in Japan.  In 1965 he married Gracia Fay Bouwman, also a student in the U. of C. Divinity School and subsequently an instructor in Evansville College, Indiana.

They had two children, Richard Scott Lancelot (b. 1974) and Fay Elanor (b. 1977).

In 1967 Ellwood became a professor of religion at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, serving there until retirement in 1997. He mainly taught courses on Eastern religions and the history of religion. His first book, ''The Feast of Kingship'', about the ''Daijōsai'' or Japanese imperial accession ceremony, was based on his Ph.D. dissertation. Subsequently, given the tremendous spiritual ferment in California in the late 1960s, he became interested in new religious and spiritual movements in America, doing an informal survey of them in Los Angeles and publishing Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America.

He also wrote on the history of American religion in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as textbooks on world religions, religious studies, and Japanese religion. ''Cycles of Faith'' presented a theory of the comparative development of world religions. ''The Politics of Myth'' was a discussion of the controversial political histories of C.G. Jung, Mircea Eliade, and [[Joseph Campbell]]. A late series of three books offered a comparative view of mythologies. In 1988 he received a Fulbright Research Grant to study new religious movements in New Zealand, and spent six months there working in the national library in Wellington.  He also taught briefly in the Universities of Cape Town and Natal in South Africa, and after retirement at Auburn University in Alabama.  He was named Distinguished Emeritus Professor by U.S.C. in 2002, and Alumnus of the Year by the University of Chicago Divinity School in 2009. 

Ellwood's approach to comparative religion has been fundamentally structuralist, phenomenological, and empathetic. He has sought through religion's material expression in art, architecture, rite, and practices to understand empathetically its inner meaning for adherents, always allowing for an immense range of individual responses, but recognizing also that religious forms have as it were a language of their own. In Cycles of Faith he further considers that the history of individual religions may have an internal dynamic of their own, as well as responding to outer history.

In 1976 Ellwood joined the Theosophical Society in America, serving as vice president of that organization 2002-05.  He has also served as a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church, a small denomination informally affiliated with Theosophy. He offered a few books of popular spirituality through the Theosophical publishing house, Quest Books.  After retirement he and Gracia Fay moved to Krotona, a Theosophical community in Ojai, CA.

'''Rui Pedro Teixeira Mendonça''' is a Portuguese child who went missing on March 4, 1998 in [[Lousada]], [[Portugal]]. Rui Pedro was 11 years old and riding his bicycle outside near his home when he disappeared. His case remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peticaopublica.com/pview.aspx?pi=P2013N70071|title=Quanto tempo mais O RUI PEDRO TEIXEIRA DE MENDONÇA vai esperar para ser encontrado?|work=peticaopublica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://rui_pedro_teixeira_mendonca.blogs.sapo.pt/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policiajudiciaria.pt/PortalWeb/page/%7B96A80F00-8F05-45DF-8043-9AC37214BC1C%7D|title=Conteúdo Com Barra Lateral|work=policiajudiciaria.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last known activities ==
On March 4, 1998, around 2pm, Rui Pedro took his bicycle and cycled to his mother's workplace, located near the family home. He asked his mother for permission to spend the afternoon riding in a car "with his friend Afonso" (Afonso Dias), a 22 year old lorry driver. Rui Pedro's mother denied the request, and told him to go play in an abandoned lot outside her office.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://rui_pedro_teixeira_mendonca.blogs.sapo.pt/2007/06/?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lousadadigital.com.sapo.pt/desapareceu.htm|title=desapareceu|work=sapo.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="portugalresident.com"&gt;http://portugalresident.com/man-sentenced-to-jail-for-kidnapping-missing-rui-pedro&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
Rui Pedro's tutor called his parents because the child had not turned up for his 5pm lesson, and they quickly initiated a search for him. Because Rui Pedro had told his mother that he was planning to meet up with his friend Afonso, the police questioned the latter. Afonso Dias was in an emotional state while being questioned, and simply replied that he did not know the boy's whereabouts, but that the police "should close the borders".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Rui Pedro's cousin, Andre, recounted to the police that he, Rui Pedro and Afonso had had a conversation where Afonso had invited them to go meet up with a prostitute. Andre said he had not joined Rui Pedro and Afonso that afternoon because his mother would not let him leave the house.

== Sightings ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DisneylandRuiPedroMendonca.jpg|thumb|right|Rui Pedro alleged Disneyland sighting]] --&gt;

The investigation into the child's disappearance slowed down due to the lack of credible leads. Nevertheless, the case had sparked public interest to a degree that sightings of Rui Pedro were numerous over the years since his disappearance.
The prostitute Alcina Dias confirmed that Afonso Dias had taken Rui Pedro to see her on the day he disappeared. Afonso Dias allegedly drove up to see her in his car and asked her if she was working. When she assented, he offered to pay her to have sex with Rui Pedro. Alcina Dias said that Rui Pedro was extremely nervous and crying by the time he exited the vehicle, reportedly saying that Afonso had forced him to meet her. Alcina Dias added that she tried to calm the boy down and asked him if his mother knew he was there, to which the boy replied no. Rui Pedro then allegedly drove off in Afonso Dias' vehicle. Alcina Dias allegedly tried to give her deposition to the authorities, but could never identify Afonso Dias by name. In 2011, she finally identified him in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=2167870&amp;page=2|title=Prostituta confirma encontro com Rui Pedro|work=TSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=2167870&amp;page=3|title=Prostituta confirma encontro com Rui Pedro|work=TSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=2167870&amp;page=1|title=Prostituta confirma encontro com Rui Pedro|work=TSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1998, the political commentator Nuno Rogeiro traveled to Disneyland Paris with his family. During the trip, the Rogeiro family snapped several photographs whilst on a ride; one of these photos depicts a boy sitting behind the family who reportedly looks remarkably like Rui Pedro. Sat beside the boy is a man in his 40s wearing a red jacket. The Portuguese police did confiscate the photographs for further analysis, but no further progress was made regarding this sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caras.sapo.pt/famosos/2011-12-01-caso-rui-pedro-filha-de-nuno-rogeiro-e-advogada-da-familia |title=Caso Rui Pedro: Filha de Nuno Rogeiro é advogada da família |work=Caras |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418013840/http://caras.sapo.pt/famosos/2011-12-01-caso-rui-pedro-filha-de-nuno-rogeiro-e-advogada-da-familia |archivedate=2015-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RuiPedro2014AgeProgression.jpg|thumb|right|2014 age progression of Rui Pedro]] --&gt;

On September 1, 1998, 13 police forces busted an international [[child pornography]] ring known as the ''Wonderland Club''. The operative was code-named [[Operation Cathedral]] and resulted in the confiscation of 750,000 images and videos depicting 1,263 different children. Rui Pedro was among the few children (16 only) that could be identified. However, his whereabouts remain unknown. Police suspect that he was murdered by his abductors after being abused on camera for other members of the paedophile ring.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1336247/Internet-child-sex-perverts-escape-justice.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1322551/Girl-8-raped-to-order-on-the-internet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
Rui Pedro's disappearance was widely covered by the Portuguese media and the case's developments continue to make headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/pais/183469/mae-de-rui-pedro-escreve-carta-a-filho-desaparecido-ha-16-anos|title=Noticias ao Minuto - Mãe de Rui Pedro escreve carta a filho desaparecido há 16 anos|author=Notícias Ao Minuto|date=4 March 2014|work=Notícias ao Minuto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/nacional/portugal/detalhe/filomena-teixeira-o-rui-pedro-nao-foi-esquecido.html|title=Filomena Teixeira: "O Rui Pedro não foi esquecido" - Portugal - Correio da Manhã|work=xl.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prison sentence for Afonso Dias ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AfonsoDias1Rui.jpg|thumb|right|Afonso Dias in 2012]] --&gt;

Dias was acquitted in the first trial in 2012 due to a lack of evidence, but was subsequently convicted in a new trial in 2014 to three years in jail for [[statutory rape|corruption of a minor]], as a result of trying to make Rui Pedro have sex, but not for his abduction or any other charge related to the disappearance itself. Following an appeal by Rui Pedro's family. Despite Dias's appeal, this second ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Portugal]]. On October 3, 2014, Afonso Dias was sentenced to three years in prison.  On March 18, 2015, Afonso Dias was taken to prison by his lawyer, after the warrant for his detention was issued by the police.&lt;ref&gt;https://expresso.sapo.pt/caso-rui-pedro-afonso-dias-entregou-se-nervoso-e-em-baixo=f915767&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=4159527&amp;page=2 |title=Confirmada prisão para Afonso Dias no caso Rui Pedro - Portugal - DN |work=DN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143140/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=4159527&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jn.pt/justica/interior/afonso-dias-libertado-5757232.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in March 2017, having served two thirds of his sentence.

The character's childhood is the focus of ''Young Sheldon''; the series' first season is set in 1989 when 9-year-old prodigy Sheldon has skipped ahead five grades, to start high school alongside his older brother.

Sheldon is a senior [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] at [[Caltech]] and for the first ten seasons of ''The Big Bang Theory'', shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, [[Leonard Hofstadter]] ([[Johnny Galecki]]).

==Characterization==

===Early life===
Sheldon was raised in [[Galveston, Texas]]&lt;ref name="S02E09"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The White Asparagus Triangulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep26|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 24, 2008|season=2|number=9|minutes=04:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his elder brother, George Jr., and [[Twin|fraternal twin]] sister, Missy, by his mother, Mary Cooper, an overtly devout Baptist; and George Cooper, an alcoholic who was rarely around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/the-family-dynasty-part-1-sheldon-coopers-family/|title=The Family Dynasty - Part 1: Sheldon Cooper’s Family|date=2016-11-16|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon once got his father fired when he told Mr. Hinckley, a store owner, that George was stealing from the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Sales Call Sublimation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 9)#ep12|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 7, 2015|season=9|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Young Sheldon'', this is [[retcon]]ned: his father is a football coach who was fired from his coaching position in Galveston because he disclosed that other coaches were illegally recruiting players to their school, forcing the family to return to Medford. He does drink, mostly beer, but is a loving father who is trying to understand his intellectually gifted son. The only member of his family to have actively encouraged his work in science was his grandfather, whom he cherished and affectionately called "Pop-Pop", and who died when Sheldon was five years old. Pop-Pop's loss is what caused Sheldon to despise Christmas when his Christmas wish to bring Pop-Pop back didn't come true. Sheldon's closest relative is his maternal grandmother whom he affectionately calls "Meemaw", and who in turn calls him "Moon Pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/family-dynasty-part-2-sheldon-coopers-family/|title=The Family Dynasty Part 2: Sheldon Cooper’s Family|date=2016-11-16|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt also encouraged Sheldon by giving him medical equipment, "in case his work in physics failed, he'd have a 'trade' to fall back on".

Sheldon was interested in science from an early age, and was a [[child prodigy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep45|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 19, 2009|season=3|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although due to his behavioral quirks and his lack of humility about his superior intellect, he was bullied by classmates and neighbors. Sheldon entered college at the age of eleven,&lt;ref name="S01E05"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Hamburger Postulate|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep5|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 22, 2007|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at age fourteen he graduated from college ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="S03E18"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Pants Alternative|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep18|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 22, 2010|season=3|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (To this day, the college he went to for undergraduate studies has yet to be revealed, but he feels it is superior to his fellow ''Big Bang Theory'' colleagues' alma maters of Princeton (Leonard), MIT (Howard) and Harvard (Amy) - however, it is implied in "The Tam Turbulence" that Sheldon is a Caltech alumnus.) From then, he worked on his doctorate, was a visiting professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany, was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stevenson Award,&lt;ref name=1x12 /&gt; and has appeared on the cover of ''[[Journal of Physical Chemistry A]]''.&lt;ref name="S10E14"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Emotion Detection Automation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep14|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 7, 2017|season=10|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon is now a theoretical physicist doing research at [[Caltech]], although he stated in ''[[Young Sheldon]]'' that he couldn't see himself living in California due to their carefree lifestyle.

===Personality===
{{Redirect|Bazinga|the jellyfish genus|Bazinga (genus)}}
Sheldon is often described as a stereotypical "geek". He is usually characterized as being extremely intelligent, detail-oriented, eccentric, and occasionally disturbing. Despite his intelligence, he often displays childlike qualities, such as extreme stubbornness and a lack of [[common sense]]. It is claimed by Bernadette that the reason Sheldon is sometimes unpleasant is because the part of his brain that tells him it is wrong to be nasty is "getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain", although, in season 8's "The Space Probe Disintegration",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/big-bang-theory-sheldon-bloopers/|title=The Big Bang Theory Sheldon Bloopers|date=2018-01-28|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon tearfully admits to Leonard that he ''is'' aware of his peculiarities and how his behavior comes across. The first four episodes of ''The Big Bang Theory'' portray Sheldon slightly inconsistently with respect to his later characterization, in which he is depicted as rather witty and sarcastic, and slightly flirtatious towards Penny in the pilot episode: according to Prady, the character "began to evolve after episode five or so and became his own thing".&lt;ref name="squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/08/14/come-up-with-a-new-theory-sheldon-does-not-have-aspergers|title=Come up with a new theory: Sheldon does NOT have Asperger's |publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=August 14, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817125113/http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/08/14/come-up-with-a-new-theory-sheldon-does-not-have-aspergers|archivedate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also has [[hemophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)|s5 e16, The Vacation Solution]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon has difficulty coping when asked to keep a secret, when he is interrupted, or when he hears arguing.&lt;ref name="S02E01"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bad Fish Paradigm|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 22, 2008|season=2|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S02E13"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Algorithm|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 19, 2009|season=2|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S03E07"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Guitarist Amplification|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 9, 2009|season=3|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[notary public]] and uses his knowledge in law and contracts usually for his own advantage and is always distressed when challenged in a legal aspect that he cannot logically defend. In his mannerisms, Sheldon also shows symptoms associated with [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]. Whenever approaching a person's home, he must knock three times, then say the person's name, and must repeat this at least three times (where "The first one is traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on"), as a result of him walking in on his father with another woman when he was thirteen.&lt;ref name="S10E05"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Hot Tub Contamination|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 16, 2016|season=10|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering a person's home, he must select the proper seat before sitting down. When it is suggested by Penny that he "just sit anywhere", his response is "Oh, no, if only it were that simple!" This extends to his inability to accept change. His rigidity in maintaining [[homeostasis]] often causes him frustration. Because of his rigidity and stubbornness, only his mother and Bernadette&lt;ref name="S03E14"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep14|The Einstein Approximation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 1, 2010|season=3|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – both possessing strong maternal personalities – have shown the ability to order him to do things.

Like his friends, Sheldon is fond of comic books (especially the [[DC Universe]]), [[cosplay|costumes]], [[video game]]s, [[roleplaying game]]s, [[tabletop game]]s, [[collectible card game]]s, and action figures. Sheldon has [[restraining orders]] from his heroes [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Carl Sagan]], and [[Stan Lee]],&lt;ref name="S03E15"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Large Hadron Collision|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 8, 2010|season=3|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S03E16"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Excelsior Acquisition|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 1, 2010|season=3|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Vacation Solution|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep103|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 9, 2012|season=5|number=16|minutes=12:55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S02E11&gt;Season 2, episode 11: The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt; as well as television scientist [[Bill Nye]].&lt;ref name=S07E7&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proton Displacement|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep142|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 7, 2013|season=7|number=7|minutes=16:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon often wears vintage T-shirts adorned with superhero logos.  One of his shirts is emblazoned with the number 73, and in the episode "The Alien Parasite Hypothesis" he explains that 73 is the 21st prime number, its mirror, 37, is the 12th prime number and its mirror (21) is the product of multiplying 7 and 3, also in binary, 73 is 1001001, a [[palindrome]]. The boys use video games like bowling and archery for "exercise" and use the traditional sport rules.

Sheldon has sometimes shown empathy, including lending money to [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]] without expecting it back quickly (although that may just have been his logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss&lt;ref name="S02E14"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Financial Permeability|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 2, 2009|season=2|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated.&lt;ref name="S03E8"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Adhesive Duck Deficiency|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 16, 2009|season=3|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since season 10, his empathy skills have improved to the extent that he goes out of his way to pamper his fiance Amy. Sheldon admits he is overly fond of koalas munching on eucalyptus so much that he has a facial expression that he refers to as his koala face.&lt;ref&gt;"The Tiny Trinket Maneuver". ''The Big Bang Theory''.Season 5. episode 12. January 12, 2012. CBS.&lt;/ref&gt; He dislikes gifts, because the "social contract" in his view creates either a debt or burden on the receiver of the gift which will not stop until one of the two involved in the "gift-relationship" dies leaving the other either in debt or with an undue surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 15, 2008|season=2|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon also does not take drugs, not even legal ones such as caffeine, due to a promise to his mother, and is hypersensitive when he accidentally consumes them.&lt;ref name="S0218"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Work Song Nanocluster|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|season=2|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S02E01"/&gt; It has been shown, however, that alcohol often causes Sheldon to loosen up significantly,&lt;ref name="1x12" /&gt; although it will also cloud his judgment – on occasion, after drinking alcoholic drinks (both deliberately and accidentally), he has done things that he would never do while sober, such as singing out loud,&lt;ref name="S01E08"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Grasshopper Experiment|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 12, 2007|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; mooning an audience full of people,&lt;ref name="S03E18"/&gt; confronting [[Wil Wheaton]],&lt;ref name="S06E07"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Habitation Configuration|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 8, 2012|season=6|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;, leaving wildly inappropriate voicemails after "drunk dialling" [[Stephen Hawking]], and affectionately slapping Amy's rear.&lt;ref name="S07E09"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Thanksgiving Decoupling|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 21, 2013|season=7|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism from his friends that he is mentally ill, Sheldon often retorts, "I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested" – which his mother has confirmed to be true (once while wishing she had gone through with a follow-up examination).&lt;ref name="S02E16"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Cushion Saturation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 2, 2009|season=2|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S02E04"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Griffin Equivalency|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2008|season=2|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S05E06"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Rhinitis Revelation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 20, 2011|season=5|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Sheldon contrasts strongly with his family, who are neither scientists nor intellectuals. His father George died before the start of ''The Big Bang Theory'', when Sheldon was 14,&lt;ref name="S07E22"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proton Transmogrification|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 1, 2014|season=7|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother Mary is a devout born-again Christian and loving parent.

Sheldon has a maternal uncle, Edward, who is called "Stumpy" as the result of a time when he cleaned a wood chipper by hand. He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in ''Young Sheldon'' when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for “Charlene and Edward” more times than her. Sheldon had another uncle, named Carl Cooper, who was killed by a badger while cleaning a chimney and another uncle that may have done things to children that were legal in Oklahoma per "The Clean Room Infiltration".

In "The Engagement Reaction", Sheldon mentions that his aunt Ruth died a week after being infected by a pathogen she contracted in the hospital where she visited Sheldon's uncle Roger, and that their ashes are now stored in a coffee can on Sheldon's mother’s mantle.

In the ''Young Sheldon'' episode "Vanilla Ice Cream, Gentleman Callers, and a Dinette Set", it is revealed that Sheldon has children in the future.

===Relationships===
Sheldon's closest friends are [[Leonard Hofstadter]], [[Howard Wolowitz]], and [[Raj Koothrappali]]. Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and constantly [[wikt:opine|opines]] that a master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect than that of the others, who all possess science doctorates. Despite that, Sheldon has referred to Howard as a "treasured acquaintance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bozeman Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep13|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 18, 2010|season=3|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later his friend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Turbulence|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep17|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 6, 2014|season=7|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at various points. Sheldon constantly belittles Leonard and dismisses his work, yet at the same time considers Leonard his best friend, as they used to live together and can tolerate each other: in "The Space Probe Disintegration", Sheldon admits to Leonard that he is aware of how difficult he can be, and tearfully expresses his gratitude for having Leonard in his life in spite of himself, causing Leonard to break down beside him. Prady stated that "the fact that, despite everything, Leonard considers Sheldon his best friend reminds us of Sheldon's essential humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/01/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-cbs-sheldon-leonard.html|title=Having 'Big' fun on a hit comedy: A chat with 'Big Bang Theory's' Johnny Galecki|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon can only handle having a limited number of friends in his life at a time, but later shows flexibility when he accepts Bernadette and Amy as part of the social group.

It has been speculated that Sheldon may be [[Asexuality|asexual]] or [[aromantic]]. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre said: "Part of what's wonderful and unique about [Sheldon] is he has chosen not to play in the relationship game either way&amp;nbsp; – heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any sexuality."&lt;ref name="EW1"/&gt; This is referenced in "The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem", when Sheldon unknowingly attracts the attention of grad student Ramona Nowitzki, and Penny, seeing this, asks his friends what his "deal" (i.e., sexual orientation) is, to which Leonard responds, "Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no 'deal'."

[[File:Mayim Bialik and Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mayim Bialik]] (who portrays [[Amy Farrah Fowler]]) and Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013 for the TV show "Big Bang Theory"]]
In the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep63|season 3 finale]], Howard and Raj blackmail Sheldon into meeting [[Amy Farrah Fowler]], with whom they matched him on a dating website. After some obnoxious comments about the dating website, Sheldon finds that Amy agrees with him, and he grows fond of her when she says that "Any or all physical contact up to and including [[coitus]] are off the table". Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship. The two enjoy intellectual games they create, and Amy and Sheldon openly express the same type of intellectual superiority.&lt;ref name="S04E03"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep3|The Zazzy Substitution]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 7, 2010|season=4|number=03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 5, when Leonard inadvertently implies that he and Amy may have had sex after a wedding reception that they both attended, Sheldon unexpectedly reacts violently, karate-chopping Leonard's neck while telling Leonard "She is not for you... not for you!"&lt;ref name="S05E03"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Pulled Groin Extrapolation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 29, 2011|season=5|number=03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sheldon formally asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "[[The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition]]". During their relationship, Amy begins a campaign to give Sheldon more attention to increase his feelings for her by embracing his interests.&lt;ref name="S05E23"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Launch Acceleration]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 3, 2012|season=5|number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they watch Howard being launched into space in its season finale, Amy is surprised when Sheldon takes her hand for emotional support.&lt;ref name="S05E24"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Countdown Reflection]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of season 6, in "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Parking Spot Escalation]]" and "[[The Fish Guts Displacement]]", Sheldon is pushed further after seeing Amy partially exposed and taking care of her while she is ill respectively. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.

In season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy.

The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]", when he finally admits being in love with her: "I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love." In the season 8 finale, "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of "commitment".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.

In the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that "I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them". In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his ovinaphobia), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.

In season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.&lt;ref name="The Veracity Elasticity"/&gt; In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki. In the eleventh season premiere, Amy accepts his proposal, and they marry in the season finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/the-big-bang-theory/these-behind-the-scenes-big-bang-theory-wedding-details-will-shock-you/|title=These Behind The Scenes Big Bang Theory Details Will SHOCK You|last=|first=|date=2018-05-28|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]]. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to [[Brent Spiner]].&lt;ref name=S05E05&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Russian Rocket Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep5|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2011|season=5|number=5|minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon would later resume his enmity with Wheaton in season 11's "The Proton Regeneration" when they compete for the lead role in an Internet reboot of Sheldon's childhood favorite science TV series, ''Professor Proton'', and Wheaton gets the part: however, when he sees how well Wheaton plays the role and on the advice of Howard, he apologizes to him.

Parsons' portrayal of Sheldon has received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|title=The buzz: Jim Parsons as Sheldon|last=Oswald|first=Brad|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313081930/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|archivedate=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/Television/article/575764|title=Nerd herd doing a bang-up job|last=Salem|first=Rob|date=January 24, 2009|work=The Toronto Star|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/02/08/gentle_twists_on_reliable_formulas_keep_viewers_hooked/|title=Gentle twists on reliable formulas keep viewers hooked|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|date=February 8, 2009|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: "It's hard to imagine what ''The Big Bang Theory'' would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/946/946275p1.html|title="The Friendship Algorithm" Review|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' stated that "there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|title=What a Year!|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218155304/http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|archivedate=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that: "Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic".&lt;ref name="EW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20237937,00.html|title=The Big Bang Theory|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asperger syndrome===
Some viewers have asserted that Sheldon's behavior is consistent with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="av"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soraya|first=Lynne|title=Sheldony or Aspergery?: The Big Bang Theory|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/aspergers-diary/200904/sheldony-or-aspergery-the-big-bang-theory|work=Asperger's Diary (Author's Note (08/16/2009))|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers have stated that they did not use Asperger syndrome as a basis for the character, but instead thought of his actions as "Sheldony".&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=Must-Geek TV: Is the world ready for an Asperger's sitcom?|work=Slate|publisher=www.slate.com|date=February 6, 2009|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2210635/pagenum/all/#p2|accessdate=April 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210061649/http://www.slate.com/id/2210635/pagenum/all/|archivedate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series co-creator Bill Prady stated: "We write the character as the character. A lot of people see various things in him and make the connections. Our feeling is that Sheldon's mother never got a diagnosis, so we don't have one."&lt;ref name="squad"/&gt; Prady also told Alan Sepinwall of the New Jersey ''[[Star-Ledger]]'' that while Sheldon shares traits with people with Asperger's, he was uncomfortable labeling Sheldon as having Asperger's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Does Sheldon from 'Big Bang Theory' have Asperger's?|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/08/reader_mail_does_sheldon_from.html|publisher=The Star-Ledger|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Jim Parsons noted the writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon "couldn't display ''more'' traits" of Asperger's.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyford|first=Kathy|title='Big Bang Theory': Jim Parsons – 'Everybody has a little Sheldon in them'|work=Season Pass|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 13, 2008|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2008/11/big-bang-theory.html|accessdate=April 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722163909/http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2008/11/big-bang-theory.html|archivedate=July 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}} Specific video is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH2XD7KEeY Jim Parsons interview, part 5]. Question is from 03:18–3:31. Answer is from 4:36–6:00. Specific quote is from 5:15–5:20.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read [[John Elder Robison]]'s memoir ''[[Look Me in the Eye]]'' about his life with Asperger syndrome, and said that: "A majority of what I read in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon." He also stated that "the way his brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/jim-parsons,27415/|title=Jim Parsons|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When another actor on the series, [[Mayim Bialik]], who plays Amy and has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, was interviewed by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] on ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', she said of the theory that Sheldon has Asperger's: "All of our characters are in theory on the neuropsychiatric spectrum, I would say. Sheldon often gets talked about in terms of Asperger’s or OCD. He has a thing with germs, he has a thing with numbers, he’s got a lot of that precision that we see in OCD. There’s a lot of interesting features to all of our characters that make them technically unconventional socially.... And what we’re trying to show with our show is that this is a group of people who likely were teased, mocked, told that they will never be appreciated or loved, and we have a group of people who have successful careers, active social lives (that involve things like Dungeons and Dragons and video games), but they also have relationships, and that’s a fulfilling and satisfying life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Jim|title='Is Sheldon autistic?

[[Given names]] originating from the [[Slavic languages]] are most common in [[Slavic peoples|Slavic countries]].

==History of Slavic names==

In [[Polytheism|pre-Christian]] traditions, a child less than 7&amp;ndash;10 years old would bear a "substitutional name", the purpose of which was to deflect attention from the child and thereby to protect it from the curiosity of evil powers. The practice was largely the effect of the high mortality rate for young children at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zielarze.pl/slowianie_codzienne.htm#imiona/|title=Słowianie codziennie, imiona|language=pl|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302175050/http://www.zielarze.pl/slowianie_codzienne.htm#imiona/|archivedate=2010-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child who survived to 7&amp;ndash;10 years was considered worthy of care and was granted adult status and a new adult name during a ritual [[first haircut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interia360.pl/artykul/obrzedy-zwiazane-z-narodzinami,36092|title=Obrzędy związane z narodzinami|language=pl|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional names remained dominant with until the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]] converted to [[Christianity]]. Finally, the [[Council of Trent]] (1545&amp;ndash;63) decreed that every [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] should have a [[Christian name]] instead of a native one.

===Names in Poland===

After the ban on native non-Christian names imposed by the Council of Trent, the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]] (especially [[Protestantism|Protestants]]) attempted to preserve traditional names, such as [[Zbigniew]] and [[Jaroslav (disambiguation)|Jarosław]]. Ordinary people, however, tended to choose names solely from the Christian calendar, which contained only a handful of Slavic saints' names, in particular: [[Casimir|Kazimierz]] (St. Casimir), [[Stanislav (given name)|Stanisław]] (St. Stanislaus), [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wacław]] (St. Wenceslaus) and [[Vladislav|Władysław]] (St. Ladislaus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitologie.wordpress.com/imiona-slowianskie/|title=Imiona słowiańskie|language=pl|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic names that referred to God (e.g., [[Bogdan]], [[Bogomil (name)|Bogumił]]) were also permitted.&lt;ref name="zielarze.pl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zielarze.pl/slowianie_codzienne.htm#imiona|title=Imiona Słowiańskie na ziemiach polskich|language=pl|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302175050/http://www.zielarze.pl/slowianie_codzienne.htm#imiona|archivedate=2010-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names in Kievan Rus'===

[[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] names were based on common Slavic names such as [[Vladimir (name)|Volodiměrŭ]] (''Володимѣръ''), [[Sviatopolk (disambiguation)|Svętopŭlkŭ]] (''Свѧтопълкъ'') (holy regiment), [[Yaropolk (disambiguation)|Jęropŭlkŭ]] (''Ѩропълкъ''), [[Vojislav|Voislavŭ]] (''Воиславъ'') (glorious warrior), [[Borislav|Borislavŭ]] (''Бориславъ'') (glorious wrestler), [[Boris (given name)|Borisŭ]] (''Борисъ'') (fighter), [[Lubomir|Liubomirŭ]] (''Любомиръ'') (loves the world), Ratibor (war fighter), [[Vadim (name)|Vadim]], [[Yaroslav (disambiguation)|Yaroslav]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, Izyaslav, [[Mstislav (given name)|Mstislav]], [[Vsevolod (given name)|Vsevolod]]. In the 11th century, after the growing influence of the Christian Church, the tendency to use the names of saints of the Greek Church has increased and most of old Rus' names were displaced by Dmytriy, Andrey, Nikolay, Terentiy, Sergey, Anton, Kirill, Georgiy, Konstantin, Alexandr, Foma, Akakiy, etc.

===Names today===
[[File:Kresimir_(boat).JPG|thumb|Slavic origin name on the boat]]
Since [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] during 19th and 20th centuries, traditional names, especially of historical rulers and heroes, regained popularity. For example, in [[Poland]] many forgotten names were resurrected, such as [[Bronisław (disambiguation)|Bronisław]], [[Boleslaus|Bolesław]], [[Dobiesław (disambiguation)|Dobiesław]], [[Dobroslaw (name)|Dobrosław]], Jarosław, [[Mirosław (given name)|Mirosław]], [[Przemysław]], [[Radosław (disambiguation)|Radosław]], [[Sławomir]], [[Wiesław]], [[Zdzisław (given name)|Zdzisław]], and Zbigniew; and new ones created, such as Lechosław and Wieńczysław.&lt;ref name="zielarze.pl" /&gt; Today, traditional Slavic names are accepted by the [[Christianity|Christian Church]] and are given at a child's [[baptism]].

==Meaning of Slavic names==

Old Slavic names were built with one or two [[lexeme]]s:

===Single-lexeme names===

Single-lexeme names were derived from ordinary or adjectival words and were usually, though not always, borne by peasants, e.g.: Baran (ram), Szydło (awl), Kąkol (cockle), Broda (beard, chin), Żyła (vein), Uchacz (ear-man), Łopata (shovel), Żaba (frog), Rus (Ruthenian/Russian man), Cich (silent man), etc.&lt;ref name="zielarze.pl" /&gt; Many names of this kind are used today, for example:

Dithematic names are built with two lexemes. Kaleta 1995 notes that "In the case of Old Germanic and Old Slavic personal names, the dithematic name form contained a wish for the new-born child. These wishes pertained to the values that obtained in these early times".&lt;ref name="Langendonck2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7jOGz7zMnwC&amp;pg=PA83|title=Theory and Typology of Proper Names|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019086-1|pages=83–|author=Willy van Langendonck}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland alone, over 600 [[masculine name]]s, 120 [[feminine name]]s and 150 different affixes ([[lexeme]]s) are known. These have been reconstructed from place names and the (scarce) written sources such as the [[Bull of Gniezno]].&lt;ref name="zielarze.pl" /&gt; Certain names were reserved for monarchs (e.g. in Poland: Kazimierz, Władysław, Bolesław).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetadobryznak.pl/index.php?art=171|title=Od Bolesława do Kosmacza|language=pl|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are listed below. As an example of the pattern: Władysław contains the prefix ''wład'' (to rule, ruler) and the suffix ''sław'' (fame, glory). Note that feminine equivalents usually end in ''a'' (e.g. [[Bogusław (given name)|Bogusław]] - Bogusław''a'').

===Participle-built names===

These are derived either from the [[past participle]] (in the passive voice), e.g.: [[Bojan]], Chocian, Kochan, Miłowan, Pomian, Stator, Wygnan, or the [[present participle]] (in the active voice), e.g.: Cieszym, Myślim, Radzim, Borzym. Such names are repositories of perhaps the largest source of sociological data about the ancient [[Slavic people]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Podlawska, "Gramatyka historyczna języka polskiego z elementami staro-cerkwienno-słowiańskiego i dialektologii", Wydawnictwo Naukowe Akademii Pomorskiej w Słupsku, Słupsk 2003|page 156-157, {{ISBN|83-88731-23-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They have a variety of purposes, which can be listed as follows:
* names containing a good wish, e.g. Kochan ('let him be loved'), [[Milan (given name)|Milan]].
* names referring to affection for the new born child, e.g. Obiecan ('promised'), Żdan ('promised', 'expected'),
* names protecting from evil (consisting of lexemes with a negative, deterring effect) e.g. Wygnan, Mazan, Grozim.&lt;ref&gt;M.Malec "Wkład krakowskiego językoznastwa w polonistycznego do nauki o imionach osobowych" w LingVaria 2006/1, Wydział Polonistyki UJ, Księgarnia Akademicka, Kraków 2006, pages 127-131, {{ISBN|83-7188-921-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples: Poznan ('known', 'recognized'), Goszczon (being a guest at someone's place), Krszczon ('baptized'), [[Radovan (name)|Radovan]], [[Dragan]], [[Željan]], Dejan, [[Nayden]], [[Mirjana]].

===Diminutive and hypocoristic names===

[[Diminutive]] and [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] ([[Term of endearment|endearing]]) names deriving from the above-mentioned dithematic names are created by using different diminutive [[suffix]]es. Such names are very popular in everyday usage, and usually are created by replacing part of the name with the suffix ''-ek'' (masculine, predominantly West Slavic; e.g. Polish Włodzi''mierz'' &amp;ndash; Włod''ek''), ''-ko'' (masculine, predominantly South Slavic and Ukrainian), ''-ka'' (feminine; also masculine in Russian), or ''-a'': Mila, [[Luba (disambiguation)|Luba]], [[Stanislav (given name)|Staszek]], Radek, [[Vladislav|Władek]], [[Zlatan|Zlatko]], Zlata, [[Vladimir, Russia|Volodya]], [[Branislav|Bronek]], [[Leszek]], [[Dobroniega|Dobrusia]], [[Sławomir|Slavko]], [[Wojtek]], [[Mirka]], Bogusia, [[Slava]], Zdravko, [[Zbyszko]], [[Milosz|Miłosz]], [[Stanislav (given name)|Staś]], [[Przemysław|Przemek]], [[Boleslaw (given name)|Bolko]], [[Dragan|Draho]], [[Željko]], [[Borys|Borya]] (fight),Boško, Božica, Božana, Branko, Branka, Braniša, Borko, Budimka, Hvališa, Dobar, Dobra, Dragoš, Dragica, Dragi, Draga, [[Dragoş (given name)|Dragoş]], Miloš, Slavko, Slavica, [[Slavisa]], Svetlana, Wít, Zdenka, Bratko, Braco, Braca, Bato, Bata, Batica, etc.

==Popularity in non-Slavic cultures==

Some Slavic names have gained popularity in other (non-Slavic) countries, e.g.:  [[Vera (given name)|Vera]], Mila, [[Svante]], Boris, Vladimir, [[Miroslav (given name)|Mirko]], [[László (disambiguation)|Laszlo]], [[Casimir]], [[Wenzel]], [[Milena (name)|Milena]], [[Stanislav (given name)|Estanislao]], Vlad, Nadia, [[Mircea (disambiguation)|Mircea]], Bronislovas, [[Radosław (disambiguation)|Radu]], Vesna, [[Wanda (disambiguation)|Wanda]], [[Vladislav|Ladislao]], Bogdan, etc.

==Christian Saints with Slavic names==

The following list contains only [[Canonization|canonized Saints]]. [[Beatification|Beatified Saints]] with Slavic names (e.g. [[Ceslaus|Saint Ceslaus]], [[Radim Gaudentius|Saint Radim]]) are not included.

===Film===
*In ''Iron Man'' (2008), Lee, credited as "Himself", appears at a gala cavorting with three blondes, where Tony Stark mistakes him for [[Hugh Hefner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Eric|last= Goldman|title= Stan Lee's Further Superhero Adventures|publisher= IGN |date=May 4, 2007|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/785/785824p3.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140315030159/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/stan-lees-further-superhero-adventures?page=3|archivedate=March 15, 2014 |deadurl= no|accessdate=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the theatrical release of the film, Stark simply greets Lee as "Hef" and moves on; another version of the scene was filmed where Stark realizes his mistake, but Lee graciously responds, "That's okay, I get this all the time."&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' Ultimate 2-Disc Edition DVD, disc 2, ''I Am Iron Man'' documentary&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Stan Lee named this as his favorite cameo appearance to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV9TYbDBgo8|title= Stan Lee: Santa Monica, CA, July 2, 2008|publisher=AtGoogleTalks|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), Lee appears as a hapless citizen who accidentally ingests a [[soft drink]] mixed with Bruce Banner's blood, which gave him a little more kick than he is looking for while saying, "Wow." He subsequently drops it and falls ill to gamma radiation sickness, leading to the discovery of Dr. Banner's location in a bottling plant in Brazil.
*In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), during the Stark Expo, Lee, wearing suspenders and a red shirt and black and purple tie, is mistakenly greeted by Tony Stark as "[[Larry King]]".
*In ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), Lee appears among many people at the site where [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] lands on earth.

His character is credited as "Stan the Man", a nickname he had adopted in the Silver Age of Comic Books.
*In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), Lee plays a general in World War II who mistakes another man for Captain America/Steve Rogers, commenting, "I thought he'd be taller." Lee had nothing to do with the basic creation of the title character. However, Lee began his writing career in the character's original series where he created the idea of Captain America using his shield as a throwing weapon. Furthermore, he was responsible for reviving the character in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] and co-wrote most of the character's stories in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and his solo stories in that period.
*In ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), Lee's character is interviewed about the Avengers saving Manhattan. Lee's character responds, "Superheroes in New York? Give me a break", and then returns to his game of chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=May 17, 2011 |title=Stan Lee Talks Upcoming Cameo Roles |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/167299-stan-lee-talks-upcoming-cameo-roles |publisher=SuperheroHype.com |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5zxBobWWA?url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/167299-stan-lee-talks-upcoming-cameo-roles |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears in a deleted scene in which, when a waitress flirts with Steve Rogers, Lee says to him, "Ask for her number, you moron!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Couch |first=Aaron |date=August 29, 2012 |title=''Avengers'' Deleted Scene Focuses on Captain America, Features Bonus Stan Lee Cameo |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-movie-blu-ray-dvd-captain-america-chris-evans-366690 |work=The Hollywood Reporter|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130327125453/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-deleted-scene-focuses-captain-366690 |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), Lee appears as an elderly gentleman having a conversation with a significantly younger woman.

*In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), he appears as a World War II veteran who attends the Avengers' victory party.

*In ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), Lee appears as a [[FedEx]] postman, delivering a package from Steve Rogers to Tony Stark at the end of the film, mispronouncing Stark's name as "Tony Stank".
*In ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016), Lee appears as a bus rider reading [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' while laughing that what he is reading is hilarious, oblivious to a battle between [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]] and [[Kaecilius]] and his followers.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/stan-lee-holds-forth-on-his-comic-book-origins-his-secret-disney-role |title=Stan Lee Holds Forth On His Comic Book Origins &amp; His Secret Disney Role|last=Buxton|first=Marc|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=August 22, 2016|accessdate=August 22, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220132/http://www.cbr.com/stan-lee-holds-forth-on-his-comic-book-origins-his-secret-disney-role/|archivedate=September 16, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buxton"/&gt;

'''Steven Paul Novella''' (born July 29, 1964) is an American [[neurology|clinical neurologist]] and [[Professors in the United States#Assistant Professor|assistant professor]] at [[Yale University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name= physicianprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale Medical Group|url=http://yalemedicalgroup.org/services/steven_novella.profile?source=news|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novella is best known for his involvement in the [[scientific skepticism|skeptical movement]].
{{toclimit|limit=3}}  &lt;!-- This code controls max depth of TOC.--&gt;

== Professional background ==
Novella's academic specialization is in [[neurology]], including more specifically, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]], [[myasthenia gravis]] and neuromuscular disorders, [[neurophysiology]], and the treatment of hyperactive [[neurological disorders]].&lt;ref name= physicianprofile /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/ncpneuro/journal/v3/n4/authors/ncpneuro0425.html |title=About the authors: A case of inherited erythromelalgia |accessdate=2014-05-22 |journal=[Nature Clinical Practice Neurology] |volume=3 |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0425 |pages=229–234 |pmid=17410110 |issue=4 |date=April 2007 | last1 = Novella | first1 = SP | last2 = Hisama | first2 = FM | last3 = Dib-Hajj | first3 = SD | last4 = Waxman | first4 = SG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novella received his medical degree from [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]] in 1991, did a year of residency in internal medicine at Georgetown University Hospital/Washington Hospital Center, completed his residency in neurology at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]] in 1995,&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Steven P Novella MD|url=http://health.usnews.com/doctors/steven-novella-215704|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report LP|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Board certification (medicine)|board certified]] in neurology in 1998.&lt;ref name= physicianprofile2&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale Neurology|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/neurology/people/steven_novella.profile|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up, Novella did not always want to be a physician. In an interview for the ''Books and Ideas'' podcast he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I think I entertained various career ideas. When I was growing up I thought about being a lawyer for a while and then by the time I went to college, I knew I wanted to go into a science background and I did premed in undergraduate school. So certainly by then I had decided that that’s probably what I wanted to do. So I would probably say in my late teens is when I really decided to go into medicine.&lt;ref name=BooksAndIdeas&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Ginger|title=Interview with Dr. Steven Novella from The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe|url=http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/5/1/8/5185c0e4243531e7/16-booksandideas-Novella.pdf?c_id=1520737&amp;expiration=1400793346&amp;hwt=413f396a04c52befb47da9afa6a78b57|work=Books and Ideas|publisher=Pods in Print|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Skepticism and critical thinking ==

Novella is a proponent of [[scientific skepticism]], which he defines as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... one who prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid to ones that are comforting or convenient, and therefore rigorously and openly applies the methods of science and reason to all empirical claims, especially their own. A skeptic provisionally proportions acceptance of any claim to valid logic and a fair and thorough assessment of available evidence, and studies the pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves. Skepticism values method over any particular conclusion.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skepticblog.org/2008/11/17/skeptic-the-name-thing-again/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to an editorial in ''The New York Times'' in which [[Paul Davies]] concluded "until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Davies|title=Taking Science on Faith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novella said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's not actually true because science is not dependent upon faith in a naturalistic world. It just follows the methods as if it is naturalistic... it is not a system of beliefs. People often ask me and they will ask you as skeptics what do you believe? Well, it's not about belief. Do you believe in ESP? It doesn't matter if I believe in ESP. The only thing that matters is what is the evidence for ESP? ...It's very important I think to present skepticism as a method of inquiry not a set of conclusions, not a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=tokenskeptic&gt;{{cite web|last=Sturgess|first=Kylie|authorlink =Kylie Sturgess|title=Token Skeptic|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/tokenskeptic/2012/08/dr-steven-novella-on-scientific-skepticism-and-activism-nyc-skeptics|work=Patheos|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1996 Novella, his brother Bob, and [[Perry DeAngelis]] founded The Connecticut Skeptical Society.

As Evan Bernstein tells it, "One night sometime in late 1995, Perry was over [at] Steve's condo, casually flipping through a copy of SI ([[Skeptical Inquirer]]). He was reading through the list of local groups, and commented to Steve: 'There's no local skeptics group in Connecticut. We should start one.'"&lt;ref name=RememberingPerry&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Evan|title=Remembering Perry DeAngelis Today|url=http://theness.com/roguesgallery/index.php/skepticism/remembering-perry-deangelis-today/|work=The Rogues Gallery|publisher=The Rogues Gallery|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group later joined with the Skeptical Inquirers of New England (SINE) and the New Hampshire Skeptical Resource to form the [[New England Skeptical Society]] (NESS). Novella currently serves as president of the NESS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ness About Us|url=http://www.theness.com/index.php/about/|publisher=The Ness|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal investigations===
In the early days of the [[New England Skeptical Society]], Novella participated in investigations of various paranormal claims. Sometimes these were part of the screening process for the [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]] offered by the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]]. Novella investigated such claims as [[Ouija boards]] (when the couple claiming they could operate one were properly blindfolded, their powers vanished), the ability to control the flipping of a coin (the claimant turned out to be making some common logical errors in thinking), a mind reader who got zero out of 20 correct, and many [[dowsers]] (typically found to be experiencing the [[Ideomotor phenomenon]]). Novella and the NESS also examined some phenomena described by people who were not competing for the One Million Dollar prize, such as haunted houses,  the ability to communicate with the dead, and recording the voices of ghosts, known as [[electronic voice phenomenon]], or EVP.&lt;ref name=YaleBulletin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weaver|first1=Jacqueline|title='Skeptical' neurologist works to separate science from sham|url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v34.n6/story10.html|website=Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar, October 7, 2005|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe'' ===
{{main|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe}}
In May 2005, Novella started ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' (SGU) podcast with his friends [[Perry DeAngelis]] and Evan Bernstein, and his brothers Bob and Jay. DeAngelis remained with the show until his death in August, 2007. In July 2006, [[Rebecca Watson]] joined the podcast as a regular, staying through December, 2014. [[Cara Santa Maria]] joined the cast in July, 2015. 

Novella both hosts the show and does the editing and post-production. In an interview for the ''Books and Ideas'' podcast he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I am ultimately responsible for the content and prepping it and I do all the post production which I know, as you know is a lot of work. So you know, it's a good 20, 30 hours a week that I put into putting out this podcast, it is almost like having a second job. And, you know, it’s a labor of love.&lt;ref name=BooksAndIdeas /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about the purpose of the podcast Novella said, &lt;blockquote&gt;We deal primarily with controversial topics or topics on the fringe of science, although sometimes we do just straight up really interesting science news stories, whatever captures our interest. But we deal with the paranormal or conspiracy theories, or health fraud, consumer protection type of issues. And our goal is to give our listeners the tools to look at science in the news, science in society and have some way of navigating through all of the claims and all of the hype and basically have the tools to figure things out for themselves more than anything else.&lt;ref name=BooksAndIdeas /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Internet===
In 2007, Novella started a [[blog]], ''Neurologica'', "your daily fix of neuroscience, skepticism and critical thinking",&lt;ref&gt;Neurologica Blog http://theness.com/neurologicablog/&lt;/ref&gt; for which he writes three articles per week on a wide range of subjects generally related to science or skepticism. He is the executive editor of the blog ''[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]''&lt;ref name=aboutsteve3&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=222 |title=Science-Based Medicine – Editors |accessdate=2009-11-15 |work= Science-Based Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he is also a regular contributor, and he is a medical advisor to [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref name=aboutsteve1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/09Advisors/medadvbd.html |title=Quackwatch – Scientific and Technical Advisors – Medical Advisors|accessdate=2009-11-15 |work= Quackwatch |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413152947/http://www.quackwatch.org/09Advisors/medadvbd.html |archivedate= 2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Novella was one of the first 200 to sign the [[Project Steve]] petition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The List of Steves|url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves|website=NCSE|publisher=The National Center for Science Education|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tongue-in-cheek parody of the list of "scientists that doubt evolution" produced by creationists.

===E-books===
Novella is the editor of a series of [[e-book]]s composed of articles collected from the ''[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]'' blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Steven Novella|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/4196868.Steven_Novella|website=goodreads.com|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each book focuses mainly on one topic such as critical thinking, herbs, supplements and nutrition, chiropractic, vaccines, homeopathy, etc.

===Print===
Novella is an associate editor of the ''[[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]]'',&lt;ref name=aboutsteve2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/sram.html |title=Quackwatch – Publications for Sale – The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|accessdate=2009-11-15 |work= Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes the monthly ''Weird Science'' column for the [[New Haven Advocate]] newspaper.

===Television===
Novella has appeared on several television programs, including ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! s03e10: "Ghostbusters."]]'', ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'',&lt;ref name=droz&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversial Medicine: Alternative Health, Pt 1.|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-medicine-controversy-pt-1|work=The Dr. Oz Show|publisher=Harpo, Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Inside Edition]]''.&lt;ref name=insideedition&gt;{{cite web|title=INSIDE EDITION Investigates Power Bracelets|url=http://www.insideedition.com/investigative/2024-inside-edition-investigates-power-bracelets|work=INSIDE edition|publisher=Inside Edition Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he filmed a pilot for a television series called The Skeptologists&lt;ref name=skeptologists&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Series The Skeptologists|url=http://www.skeptologists.com/|website=Skeptologists|publisher=Skeptologist Partners with New Rule Productions|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]], [[Yau-Man Chan]], [[Mark Edward]], [[Michael Shermer]], [[Phil Plait]], and [[Kirsten Sanford]]. The series has not been picked up by any network.

====''The Dr. Oz Show'' appearance====
Novella appeared on ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' segment, "Controversial Medicine: Why your doctor is afraid of alternative health", where he was introduced as "an outspoken critic of alternative medicine." Novella noted that the term "alternative" creates a double-standard. "There should be one science-based common-sense standard to figure out what therapies work and are safe." Novella made the point that herbs are medicinals and have been used that way for thousands of years, but the problem is in re-branding them as alternative, marketing them as natural, and therefore arguing that they don't need evidence that they are safe and effective. "At the end of the day, the public was sold products that the evidence shows doesn't work."

On the subject of [[acupuncture]], Novella stated, "I've spent a lot of time reviewing the acupuncture literature ... and the evidence overwhelmingly shows that acupuncture, in fact, doesn't work." In response to Dr. Oz's complaint that Novella is dismissive of an idea that the "way we think [about acupuncture] in the west is that it can't be possible effective." Novella replied, "I didn't say it couldn't possibly work, I said when you look at it, it doesn't work."&lt;ref name=droz /&gt;

=== Alpha Quadrant Six ===
In late 2017, Novella and his brothers began producing a science-fiction review show, ''Alpha Quadrant Six'', which is archived on  [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]]. In the initial installments, the first season of the [[CBS All Access]] TV series ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' was reviewed each week by live streaming the review show over FaceBook immediately following each original episode's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpha Quadrant 6 (FaceBook home)|url=https://www.facebook.com/alphaquadrant6/|website=Facebook.com|publisher=Steven Novella|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpha Quadrant 6 Playlist|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ8PB8wzHiQ&amp;list=PLdrK0WjHg8nIQ1zVCnam0-xQumk7vsdph|website=Youtube.com|publisher=The Skeptics Guide|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autonomous sensory meridian response==
Novella was the first scientist to publish and publicize an opinion and reflective evaluation of the phenomenon known as [[Autonomous sensory meridian response]],&lt;ref&gt;Novella, Steven (12 March 2012). [http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ 'ASMR']. Neurologica Blog. [[New England Skeptical Society]]. Retrieved 31 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMR"&gt;Novella, Steven (12 March 2012). [http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ 'ASMR']. [http://www.skepticblog.org/ Skeptic Blog]. Retrieved 31 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; a low grade euphoria characterized by 'a combination of positive [[feeling]]s, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin', which typically begins 'on the scalp' before moving 'down the spine' to the base of the neck, sometimes spreading 'to the back, arms and legs as intensity increases', most commonly triggered by specific [[Hearing|acoustic]] and [[Visual system|visual]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] including the content of some digital videos, and less commonly by [[intention]]al [[attentional control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrat E, Davis N | year = 2015 | title = Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state | journal = [[PeerJ]] | volume = 3 | issue = | page = e851 | pmid = 25834771 | doi=10.7717/peerj.851 | pmc=4380153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24375123 | doi=10.1353/pbm.2013.0022 | volume=56 | title="It feels good to be measured": clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles | year=2013 | journal=Perspect. Biol. Med. | pages=442–51 | vauthors=Ahuja NK | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post on his blog ''Neurologica'', Novella says that he always starts his investigations of such phenomena by asking whether or not 'it is real'. Regarding [[Autonomous sensory meridian response|ASMR]], Novella says 'in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described' it with 'fairly specific details. In this way'…ASMR is similar to migraine headaches - we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.' Novella tentatively posits the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure, or another way to activate the 'pleasure response'. However, Novella draws attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ASMR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novella, Steven (12 March 2012).

In January 2010, Novella was elected as a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/sixteen_notable_figures_in_science_and_skepticism_elected_csi_fellows/ |title=Sixteen Notable Figures in Science and Skepticism Elected CSI Fellows |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Novella was appointed Senior Fellow of the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]], and Director of their Science-Based medicine project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JREF Appoints Dr. Steven Novella as Senior Fellow|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/1284-jref-appoints-dr-steven-novella-as-senior-fellow.html|publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobinick lawsuit==
On June 9, 2014, [[Edward Tobinick]] filed a civil action in Florida Southern District Court naming Novella, [[Yale University]], Society for Science-Based Medicine, Inc. and SGU Productions, LLC as defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward Lewis Tobinick, MD et al v. Novella et al |date=June 9, 2014 |work=Justia|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flsdce/9:2014cv80781/443251 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main allegations of the action are that "in violation of the [[Lanham Act]], Novella has and continues to publish a false advertisement disparaging Plaintiffs entitled 'Enbrel for Stroke and Alzheimer's', ('the 'Advertisement') and implying that the INR plaintiffs' use of etanercept is ineffective and useless;" and "The Advertisement is extremely inflammatory and defamatory in nature as it contains multiple false and misleading statements of fact regarding Plaintiffs." "The Advertisement" referred to in the action is an entry for the ''[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]'' blog that Novella wrote and posted on May 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/enbrel-for-stroke-and-alzheimers/ |date=May 8, 2013 |title=Enbrel for Stroke and Alzheimer’s |last=Novella |first=Steven |work=Science-Based Medicine |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2014, Novella's attorney, [[Marc Randazza]], filed an "Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary and Preliminary Injunctive Relief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novella Response|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/234904906/Novella-Reponse|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filing states that Tobinick is "highly unlikely to prevail in this matter . . . as Defendant's statements range from provably true to opinion," that a preliminary injunction "would impose an unlawful prior restraint of speech," and that "an injunction would result in far more harm to Defendants and the public than Plaintiffs' claimed injury." Novella posted a response to the lawsuit on ''[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]'' in which he said, "In my opinion he [Tobinick] is using legal thuggery in an attempt to intimidate me and silence my free speech because he finds its content inconvenient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Lawsuit To Suppress Legitimate Criticism – This Time SBM |date=July 23, 2014 |last=Novella |first=Steven |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/another-lawsuit-to-suppress-legitimate-criticism-this-time-sbm |work=Science-Based Medicine |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States District Judge Robin Rosenberg ordered the case closed on September 30, 2015, and found in judgement for Novella. Tobinick was unable to show that Novella had profited from his blog post or that it was in any way an advertisement. "... It is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that defendant Dr. Steven Novella ... is GRANTED.

==Adventure and role-playing games==
Novella, along with some friends, owned a local [[live action role-playing game|live action role-playing]] (LARP) game for about 5 years. It was during this time that they wrote seven d20 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url = http://www.skepticality.com/download-episode.php?thefile=traffic.libsyn.com/skepticality/252_Skepticality.mp3|title = A Skepticality Guide To The Universe|website = Skepticality|host = [[Derek Colanduno]]|date = April 21, 2015|accessdate = April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novella has coauthored several adventure gaming books including ''Twin Crowns'',&lt;ref name="twincrowns" /&gt; a naval and travel expansion for ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and ''Broadsides!'', a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) based on the [[d20 system]].&lt;ref name="broadsides" /&gt; Novella also coauthored ''Spellbound: A Codex of Ritual Magic'', which features "a complete system of magic suitable for any campaign setting" using the d20 system.&lt;ref name="spellbound" /&gt;

==Awards==
*In 2010 the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) awarded Novella the Robert P. Balles Prize for Critical Thinking for his body of work including [[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]] podcast, ''Science-Based Medicine'', ''Neurologica'', ''Skepticial Inquirer'' column ''The Science of Medicine'' and the "tireless travel and lecture schedule on behalf of skepticism".

==Topics of interest==
[[File:Science or Fiction panel at NYCC (72230).jpg|thumb|Novella leading a panel about bad science in [[science fiction]] at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2018]]
Novella often writes and speaks about a variety of topics in areas of [[alternative medicine]], the [[new age]] movement, [[parapsychology]], and [[pseudoscience]]. As a proponent of [[scientific skepticism]], his writings generally address supporting evidence and scientific consensus. Topics addressed in his writings include:

* Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Misinformation from Mayo Clinic|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/misinformation-from-mayo-clinic|work=Neurologica Blog|accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Alternative medicine]] is any practice that is put forward as having the healing effects of [[medicine]] but is not based on [[evidence]] gathered using the [[scientific method]]. It consists of a wide range of [[health care]] practices, products and therapies.&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm144657.htm |title= Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration |year= 2007 |publisher= Office of Policy and Planning, Office of the Commissioner, [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Dept. of Health and Human Services]], [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] |ref= {{harvid|FDA|2007}}}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novella has often said, "CAM is CAM because it is not science-based. If it were, it would not be 'alternative' medicine, it would be medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAM Research – Be Careful What You Wish For|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/cam-research-be-careful-what-you-wish-for|work=Neurologica Blog|accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People should know that typical homeopathic remedies are diluted to the point that no active ingredient remains, and that homeopaths invoke mysterious vibrations or implausible and highly fanciful water chemistry.

* Near-death experience – A [[near-death experience]] (NDE) refers to personal experiences associated with impending [[death]], encompassing multiple possible sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. In an article for [[ABC News]], Novella is quoted as saying, "That NDEs occur is not controversial—many people report remembering experiences around the time of cardiac arrest from which they were revived. . . the question is how to interpret them. ...The burden of proof for anyone claiming that NDEs are evidence for the survival of the self beyond the physical function of the brain is to rule out other more prosaic explanations.

* Hologram bracelets – A [[hologram bracelet]] or power bracelet is a small [[gel bracelet|rubber wristband]] fitted with a [[hologram]]. Manufacturers have said that the holograms "optimise the natural flow of [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] around the body, and so improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility".&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/8065032/Power-Balance-bracelets-source-of-energy-or-just-a-gimmick.html|title=Power Balance bracelets: source of energy or just a gimmick?|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing on an episode of the television show ''[[Inside Edition]]'' Novella was asked if he believed the claims of makers of power bracelets.

These are not, however, features specific to controlled demolition. They would be true regardless of what initiated the collapse of such structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/11 Conspiracy Debate – Part II|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/911-conspiracy-debate-part-ii|work=Neurologica Blog|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-truth - Speaking at CSIcon Las Vegas 2017, Novella described the arc of skepticism beginning which began with a focus on classic pseudoscience such as [[UFOs]] and [[psychics]] which evolved over time to science denialism and a rise in "[[alternative medicine]]". Novella stated that we now live in a post-truth world "where you don't have to defend your facts." He believes this can be countered by active skeptics, "You have to understand where people are coming from. You have to give them an alternative narrative." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/csicon_las_vegas_2017|title=CSIcon Las Vegas 2017 Conference Report|last=Frazier|first=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|date=|website=www.csicop.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book written by Steve Novella and his ''Skeptics' Guide'' co-hosts about [[scientific skepticism]] was published in October 2018. ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe#The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe book|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake]]'' was reviewed by [[Publishers Weekly]], which said: "In plain English and cogent prose, Novella makes skepticism seem mighty, necessary, and accessible all at once... Empowering and illuminating, this thinker’s paradise is an antidote to spreading anti-scientific sentiments.

[[File:WilliamBabington.jpg|thumb|William Babington]]
'''William Babington''' [[Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]] [[Geological Society of London|FGS]] (21 May 1756 – 29 April 1833) was an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] [[physician]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]].

== Life and work ==

William Babington was born in [[Portglenone]], near Coleraine, Antrim, [[Ireland]]. He was the son of Rev. Humphrey [[Babington family|Babington]], the great-great-grandson of [[Brutus Babington]] (sent to Ireland by [[James VI and I]]),&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland by Bernard Burke&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Anne (née Buttle). Apprenticed to a practitioner at Londonderry, and afterwards completed his medical education at Guy's Hospital, London, but without at that time taking a medical degree. In 1777 he was made assistant surgeon to Haslar (Naval) Hospital, and held this appointment for four years. He then obtained the position of apothecary to Guy's Hospital, and also lectured on chemistry in the medical school. He resigned the post of apothecary, and, having obtained the necessary degree of MD from the University of Aberdeen in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;A biography on William Babington, [http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/b/10ba10-1 ‘Babington, William (1756–1833)’], sourced from the college archives in King's College London.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1796 he joined [[William Saunders (physician)|Dr William Saunders]] at [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]] as his assistant and in 1802/3 (at Saunder's recommendation) replaced Saunders as head Physician.&lt;ref&gt;The European Magazine and London Review vol 72 (1817) p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

Babington was physician to [[Guy's Hospital]] from 1795 to 1811. He was a founder member of the [[Geological Society of London]] and served as [[List of Presidents of the Geological Society of London|president]] from 1822 to 1824. He was elected as a [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1805.

He was the curator for the enormous mineral collection of [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]].  When Bute died in 1792, Babington bought the collection.  The mineral [[Babingtonite]] is named after him.

William and Martha Elizabeth Babington were married before 1794, and had four sons and four daughters between 1794 and 1810. Babington died on 29 April 1833 and was buried at [[St Mary Aldermanbury|St. Mary Aldermanbury]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = William Munk | first = William | last = Munk | title = The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London | year = 1878 | publisher = Royal College of Physicians | location = London | pages = 451–455 | url = | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a son, [[Benjamin Guy Babington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Michael|last=Bevan|id=968|title=Babington, Benjamin Guy (1794–1866)|access_date=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; also physician to Guy's Hospital, and a daughter, Martha, who married the physician [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=John C.|last=Thackray|id=977|title=Babington, William (1756–1833)|access_date=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Babington by [[William Behnes]] (1795–1864) is in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London.

'''William Lyon Mackenzie King''' {{postnominals|country=CAN|OMt|CMG|PC|size=100|sep=,}} (December 17, 1874 – July 22, 1950), also commonly known as '''Mackenzie King''', was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|tenth Prime Minister of Canada]] in 1921–1926, 1926–1930 and 1935–1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history]]. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was "Help those that cannot help themselves"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/welfare-state/ |title=Welfare State |first=Allan |last=Moscovitch |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=February 7, 2006 |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King acceded to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919. Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the [[First World War]], he reconciled factions, unifying the Liberal Party and leading it to victory in [[Canadian federal election, 1921|the 1921 election]]. His party was out of office during the harshest days of the [[Great Depression in Canada]], 1930–35; he returned when the economy was on an upswing.  He personally handled complex relations with the [[Prairie Provinces]], while his top aides [[Ernest Lapointe]] and  [[Louis St. Laurent]] skillfully met the demands of [[French Canadians]]. During the Second World War, he carefully avoided the battles over conscription, patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War. Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership, he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support. Scholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=H. Blair Neatby |first=H. Blair |last=Neatby |chapter=King and the Historians |editor-last1=English |editor-first=John |editor-last2=Stubbs |editor-first2=J.O. |title=Mackenzie King: Widening the Debate |publisher=Macmillan of Canada  |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the workings of capital and labour. Keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy, he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society. A modernizing [[technocrat]] who regarded managerial mediation as essential to an industrial society, he wanted his Liberal Party to represent [[liberal corporatism]] to create social harmony. King worked to bring compromise and harmony to many competing and feuding elements, using politics and government action as his instrument. He led his party for 29 years, and established Canada's international reputation as a [[middle power]] fully committed to world order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=H. Blair |last=Neatby |title=King, William Lyon Mackenzie |volume=17 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/king_william_lyon_mackenzie_17E.html |access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bliss |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Bliss |title=Right Honourable Men: The Descent of Canadian Politics from MacDonald to Mulroney |url={{google books|tZZqy5yGyRUC|plainurl=yes|page=123}} |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1994 |pp=123–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John C. |last=Courtney |title=Prime Ministerial Character: An Examination of Mackenzie King's Political Leadership |journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science |year=1976 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pp=77–100  |doi=10.1017/S0008423900043195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's biographers agree on the personal characteristics that made him distinctive. He lacked the charisma of such contemporaries as [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill]], or [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skill; his best writing was academic, and did not resonate with the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=John |editor-last1=English |editor-first2=J.O. |editor-last2=Stubbs |title=Mackenzie King: Widening the Debate |date=1977 |publisher=Macmillan of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in [[spiritualism]] and use of [[mediumship|mediums]] to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of [[Adolf Hitler]] throughout the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. L. |last=Granatstein |title=Mackenzie King: His life and world |year=1977 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of scholars in 1997 by ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine ranked King first among all Canada's prime ministers, ahead of [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]] and [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]]. As historian [[Jack Granatstein]] notes, "the scholars expressed little admiration for King the man but offered unbounded admiration for his political skills and attention to Canadian unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=J.L. |last=Granatstein |date=2011 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/34/101034325/ |title=King, (William Lyon) Mackenzie (1874–1950) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, political scientist Ian Stewart in 2007 found that even Liberal activists have but a dim memory of him.&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life, family, and religion==
King was born in [[Berlin, Ontario]] (now known as [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]), to John King and Isabella Grace Mackenzie. His maternal grandfather was [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], first mayor of [[Toronto]] and leader of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] in 1837. His father was a lawyer, and later a professor at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]. King had three siblings.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;They were his older sister Isabel "Bella" Christina Grace (1873–1915), younger sister Janet "Jennie" Lindsey (1876–1962) and younger brother Dougall Macdougall "Max" (1878–1922). [http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/woodside/natcul/natcul2/natcul2a.aspx The King Family], courtesy of [[Parks Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Berlin Central School (now [[Suddaby Public School]]) and Berlin High School (now [[Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School]]). Tutors were hired to teach him more politics, science, math, English and French.

His father was a lawyer with a struggling practice in a small city, and never enjoyed financial security. His parents lived a life of shabby gentility, employing servants and tutors they could scarcely afford, although their financial situation improved somewhat following a move to Toronto around 1890, where King lived with them for several years in a duplex located on Beverley Street while studying at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=Stacey1976 |last=Stacey|first=C.P.|authorlink=Charles Perry Stacey|title=A Very Double Life: The Private World of Mackenzie King|year=1976|publisher=Macmillan |edition=1 |volume=46 |isbn=0-7705-1509-6}}, photo between pages 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

King became a lifelong practising [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]] with a dedication to applying Christian virtues to social issues in the style of the [[Social Gospel]]. He never favoured [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawson |first=Robert Macgregor |year=1958 |title=William Lyon Mackenzie King: A Political Biography 1874–1923|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-1083-4|ref=harv}}, Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==
[[File:King1899.jpg|thumb|upright|King in 1899]]
King earned five university degrees. He obtained three degrees from the  [[University of Toronto]]: B.A. 1895, LL.B. 1896 and M.A. 1897; he earned his LL.B. in 1896 from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Osgoode Hall, while then located close to the University of Toronto campus, was not formally associated with the University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatpast.utoronto.ca/GreatMinds/ShowBanner.asp?ID=69 |title=William Lyon Mackenzie King: Prime Minister and Graduate |publisher=University of Toronto |website=Great Past |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying in Toronto he met a wide circle of friends, many of whom became prominent.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=37–38}} He was an early member and officer of the [[Kappa Alpha Society]], which included a number of these individuals (two future Ontario Supreme Court Justices and the future Chairman of the University itself). It encouraged debate on political ideas. He also met [[Arthur Meighen]], a future political rival; the two men did not get on especially well from the start.

King was especially concerned with issues of social welfare and was influenced by the [[Settlement movement|settlement house movement]] pioneered by [[Toynbee Hall]] in London, England. He played a central role in fomenting a students' strike at the university in 1895. He was in close touch, behind the scenes, with Vice-Chancellor [[William Mulock]], for whom the strike provided a chance to embarrass his rivals Chancellor [[Edward Blake]] and President [[James Loudon]]. King failed to gain his immediate objective, a teaching position at the University, but earned political credit with Mulock, the man who would invite him to [[Ottawa]] and make him a deputy minister only five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=Robert H. |title=Mackenzie King, William Mulock, James Mavor, and the University of Toronto Students' Revolt of 1895 |journal=Canadian Historical Review |year=1988 |volume= 69 |issue=4 |pages= 490–503 |doi=10.3138/CHR-069-reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at the University of Toronto, King also contributed to the campus newspaper ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]''.

After studying at the [[University of Chicago]] and working with [[Jane Addams]] at her settlement house, [[Hull House]], King proceeded to [[Harvard University]]. He earned an M.A. in political economy from Harvard in 1898. In 1909, Harvard granted him a [[PhD]] for a dissertation on "Oriental Immigration to Canada". It was a report he had written while he was Deputy-Minister of Labour in 1908.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=198–199}} In it he argued against the immigration of Asians, saying:

==Civil servant, Minister of Labour==
[[File:KingUniform1910.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Wearing court uniform as Minister of Labour in 1910]]
King was appointed in 1900 as Deputy Minister at the head of the Canadian government's new department of Labour, and became active in policy domains from Japanese immigration to railways, notably the Industrial Disputes Investigations Act (1907) which sought to avert labour strikes by prior conciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Neatby |first=H.

{{Wikisource|The Secret of Heroism}}
In 1901, King's roommate and best friend, [[Henry Albert Harper]], died heroically during a skating party when a young woman fell through the ice of the partly frozen [[Ottawa River]]. Harper dove into the water to try to save her, and perished in the attempt. King led the effort to raise a memorial to Harper, which resulted in the erection of the [[Sir Galahad]] statue on [[Parliament Hill]] in 1905. In 1906, King published a memoir of Harper, entitled ''The Secret of Heroism''.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=129-131}}

He was first elected to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] in a 1908 [[by-election]], and then in 1909 was appointed as the first-ever [[Minister of Labour (Canada)|Minister of Labour]].

King's term as Minister of Labour was marked by two significant achievements. He led the passage of the [[Industrial Disputes Investigation Act]] and the [[Combines Investigation Act]], which he had shaped during his civil and parliamentary service. The legislation significantly improved the financial situation for millions of Canadian workers.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|ref=Hutchison|last=Hutchison|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Hutchison|title=The Incredible Canadian|year=1952|publisher=Longmans, Green and Company|asin=B0007ISXVI}}, pp. 28–33&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 general election]], which saw the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservatives]] defeat his Liberals.

==Industrial consultant==
After his defeat, King went on the lecture circuit on behalf of the Liberal Party. In June 1914 [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] hired him at the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in New York City, to head its new Department of Industrial Research. It paid $12,000 per year, compared to the meagre $2,500 per year the Liberal Party was paying.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=227–231}} He worked for the Foundation until 1918, forming a close working association and friendship with Rockefeller, advising him through the turbulent period of the 1914 strike and [[Ludlow massacre]] at a family-owned coal company in [[Colorado]], which subsequently set the stage for a new era in labour management in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |date=1998 |title=Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr. |publisher=Random House |ISBN=0-6794-3808-4 |pp=-571–586}}&lt;/ref&gt; King became one of the earliest expert practitioners in the emerging field of [[industrial relations]].

[[File:KingWriting.jpg|left|thumb|King, while writing ''Industry and Humanity'', 1917]]
King was not a pacifist, but he showed little enthusiasm for the [[World War I|Great War]]; he faced criticism for not serving in Canada's military and instead working for the Rockefellers. But he was nearly 40 years old when the war began, and was not in good physical condition. He never gave up his Ottawa home, and travelled to the United States on an as-needed basis, performing valuable service by helping to keep war-related industries running smoothly.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|loc=ch. 10}}

In 1918 King, assisted by his friend F. A. McGregor, published the far-sighted book ''Industry and Humanity: A Study in the Principles Underlying Industrial Reconstruction'', a dense, abstract work he wrote in response to the Ludlow massacre. It went over the heads of most readers, but revealed the practical idealism behind King's political thinking. He emphasized that capital and labour were natural allies, not foes, and that the community at large (represented by the government) should be the third and decisive party in industrial disputes.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=248–251}}&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Barry |title=On Reading Industry and Humanity: a Study in the Rhetoric Underlying Liberal Management |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |year=1978–1979 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=28–39 |issn= 0021-9495}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed derision for syndicates and trades unions, chastising them for aiming at the "destruction by force of existing organization, and the transfer of industrial capital from the present possessors" to themselves.&lt;ref name="Industry and Humanity"&gt;{{cite book |first=William Lyon Mackenzie |last=King |title=Industry and Humanity: A Study in The Principles Underlying Industrial Reconstruction |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=1918 |pp=494–495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quitting the Rockefeller Foundation in February 1918, King became an independent consultant on labour issues for the next two years, earning $1,000 per week from leading American corporations. Even so, he kept his official residence in Ottawa, hoping for a call to duty.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=255–265}}

==Wartime politics==
In 1917, Canada was in crisis; King supported Liberal leader [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] in his opposition to [[conscription]], which was violently opposed in the province of [[Quebec]]. The Liberal party became deeply split, with most Anglophones joining in the pro-conscription [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government, a coalition controlled by the Conservatives under Prime Minister [[Robert Borden|Sir Robert Borden]]. King returned to Canada to run in the [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 election]], which focused almost entirely on the [[conscription]] issue. Unable to overcome a landslide against Laurier, King lost in the constituency of North York, which his grandfather had once represented.

==Liberal party leader==

{{See also|Electoral history of William Lyon Mackenzie King}}

King was Laurier's chosen successor as leader of the Liberal Party, but it was deeply divided by Quebec's total opposition to conscription and the agrarian revolt in Ontario and the Prairies. Levin argues that when King returned to politics in 1919, he was a rusty outsider with a weak base facing a nation bitterly split by language, regionalism and class. He outmaneuvered more senior competitors by embracing Laurier's legacy, championing labour interests, calling for welfare reform, and offering solid opposition to the Conservative enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Allan |date=2011 |title=King: William Lyon Mackenzie King, A Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny |url={{google books|EcrpcDlKTbEC|plainurl=yes}} |location=Vancouver |publisher=Douglas &amp; MacIntyre |ISBN=1-7710-0068-6 |chapter=Ch. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Laurier died in 1919, King was elected leader in the first [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1919|Liberal leadership convention]], defeating his four rivals on the fourth ballot. He won thanks to the support of the Quebec bloc, organized by his long-time lieutenant in Quebec, [[Ernest Lapointe]] (1876–1941). King could not speak French and had minimal interest in Quebec, but in election after election for the next 20 years (save for 1930), Lapointe produced the critical seats to give the Liberals control of the Commons. He was almost co-Prime Minister with King until his death in 1941.&lt;ref name=Betcherman&gt;{{cite book |last=Betcherman |first=Lita-Rose |date=2002 |title=Ernest Lapointe: Mackenzie King's Great Quebec Lieutenant |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=175 |ISBN=978-0-8020-3575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idealizes the Prairies===
Once he became the Liberal leader in 1919 he paid closer attention to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], a fast-developing region. With a highly romanticized view he envisioned the pioneers as morally sound, hardworking individuals who lived close to nature and to God. The reform ferment in the region meshed with his self-image as a social reformer and fighter for the "people" against the "interests". Viewing a glorious sunrise in Alberta in 1920, he wrote in his diary, "I thought of the New Day, the New Social Order. It seems like Heaven's prophecy of the dawn of a new era, revealed to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/prime-ministers/william-lyon-mackenzie-king/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=7452&amp; |title=Diaries of William Lyon Mackenzie King; Item #7452 |date=October 12, 1920 |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |access-date=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism played a role as well, since his party depended for its survival on the votes of [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]] members of parliament who represented farmers in Ontario and the Prairies. He convinced many Progressives to return to the Liberal fold.&lt;ref name="Robert A. Wardhaugh 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wardhaugh |first=Robert A. |date=2000 |title=Mackenzie King and the Prairie West |publisher=University of Toronto Press |ISBN=0-8020-4733-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister: first Parliament==
[[File:KingMasseyErsme.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esme Howard|Sir Esme Howard]], King, and [[Vincent Massey]] at the Canadian Legation during a visit to Washington in 1927]]
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 election]], his party defeated [[Arthur Meighen]] and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]], and he became Prime Minister. King's Liberals originally had a bare majority position, however, since they had won 118 out of 235 seats, exactly the minimum for a majority. The Conservatives won 49, the newly formed [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]] won 58 (but declined to form the official Opposition), and the remaining ten seats went to fringe parties and Independents; most of these ten supported the Progressives.

As Prime Minister of Canada, King was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] on 20 June 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32721|page=4621|date=20 June 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn at Buckingham Palace on 11 October 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=32870|page=6817|date=12 October 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[1923 Imperial Conference]].

===Balancing act===
During his first term of office, from 1921 to 1926, King pursued a conservative domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, wartime ethnic and labour tensions. "The War is over", he argued, "and for a long time to come it is going to take all that the energies of man can do to bridge the chasm and heal the wounds which the War has made in our social life."{{sfn|Dawson|1958|loc=p. 294; Letter of May 5, 1919}} He sought a Canadian voice independent of [[London]] in foreign affairs. In September 1922 the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], appealed repeatedly to King for Canadian support in the [[Chanak crisis]], in which a war threatened between Britain and [[Turkey]]. King coldly replied that the Canadian Parliament would decide what policy to follow, making clear it would not be bound by London's suggestions; the crisis soon dissipated, but the episode led to the downfall of Lloyd George.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|pp=401–422}}

Despite prolonged negotiations, King was unable to attract the Progressives into his government, but once Parliament opened, he relied on their support to defeat [[non-confidence]] motions from the Conservatives. King was opposed in some policies by the Progressives, who opposed the high [[tariff]]s of the [[National Policy]]. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, who perceived tariffs were necessary to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] sparred bitterly in Commons debates, and the decades-long rivalry between the two was among the nastiest in the history of Canadian politics.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|loc=14, 15}}  Despite their university-days acquaintance, their personalities and working methods contrasted enormously in almost every respect.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"&gt;[[#Hutchison|Hutchison (1952)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As King's term wore on, the Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, [[Thomas Crerar]], resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid [[Robert Forke]]. Socialist reformer [[J.&amp;nbsp;S. Woodsworth]] gradually gained influence and power, and King was able to reach an accommodation with him on policy matters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hutchison|Hutchison (1952)]], pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the Progressive caucus lacked the party discipline that was traditionally enforced by the Liberals and Conservatives. The Progressives had campaigned on a promise that their MP's  would represent their constituents first. King used this to his advantage, as he could always count on at least a handful of Progressive MP's to shore up his near-majority position for any crucial vote.

===City planning===
King had a long-standing concern with city planning and the development of the national capital, since he had been trained in the settlement house movement and envisioned town planning and garden cities as a component of his broader program of social reform. He drew on four broad traditions in early North American planning: social planning, the Parks Movement, the City Scientific, and the [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]]. King's greatest impact was as the political champion for the planning and development of Ottawa, Canada's national capital. His plans, much of which were completed in the two decades after his death, were part of a century of federal planning that repositioned Ottawa as a national space in the City Beautiful style. [[Confederation Square]], for example, was initially planned to be a civic plaza to balance the nearby federal presence of Parliament Hill. The Great War monument was not installed until the 1939 royal visit, and King intended that the replanning of the capital would be the World War I memorial. However, the symbolic meaning of the World War I monument gradually expanded to become the place of remembrance for all Canadian war sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David L.A. |last=Gordon |title=William Lyon Mackenzie King, planning advocate |journal=Planning Perspectives |date=2002 |volume=17 |issue=2 |doi=10.1080/02665430110111838 |subscription=yes |pages=97–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David L.A. |last1=Gordon |first2=Brian S. |last2=Osborne |title=Constructing national identity in Canada's capital, 1900–2000: Confederation Square and the National War Memorial |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |volume=30 |issue=4 |date=October 2004 |pp=618–642 |doi=10.1016/S0305-7488(03)00041-0 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister: second and third Parliaments==

===Corruption scandals===
King called an [[Canadian federal election, 1925|election in 1925]], in which the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] won the most seats, but not a majority in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. King held onto power with the support of the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]]. A corruption scandal discovered late in his first term involved misdeeds around the expansion of the [[Beauharnois Canal]] in Quebec; this led to extensive inquiries and eventually a [[Royal Commission]], which exposed the [[Beauharnois Scandal]]. The resulting press coverage damaged King's party in the election. Early in his second term, another [[corruption]] scandal, this time in the Department of Customs, was revealed, which led to more support for the Conservatives and Progressives, and the possibility that King would be forced to resign, if he lost sufficient support in the Commons. King had no personal connection to this scandal, although one of his own appointees was at the heart of it. Opposition leader Meighen unleashed his fierce invective towards King, stating he was hanging onto power "like a lobster with lockjaw".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hutchison|Hutchison (1952)]], p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;`

===King–Byng Affair===
{{main|King–Byng Affair}}
In 1926 King, facing a House of Commons vote connected to the customs scandal that could force his government to resign,  advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng]], to dissolve Parliament and call another election, but Byng refused, the only time in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]] that the Governor General has exercised such a power. Instead Byng called upon Conservative Party leader [[Arthur Meighen]] to form a government. Meighen attempted to do so, but was unable to obtain a majority in the Commons and he, too, advised dissolution, which this time was accepted.  The episode marks a constitutional crisis that was resolved by a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. E. |last=Esberey |title=Personality and Politics: A New Look at the King-Byng Dispute |journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science |volume=6 |issue=1 |date=March 1973 |pp=37–55 |doi=10.1017/S0008423900037434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wins election===
[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|Mackenzie King (seated right) at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], which led to the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]]]]
In the ensuing [[Canadian federal election, 1926]], King appealed for public support of the constitutional principle that the Governor General must accept the advice of his ministers, though this principle was at most only customary. The Liberals argued that the Governor General had interfered in politics and shown favour to one party over another. King and his party won the election with a plurality of seats in the Commons:  116 seats to the Conservatives' 91 in a 245-member House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/compilations/electionsandridings/ResultsParty.aspx?Season=0&amp;Parliament=208ab68e-34ac-423b-abb9-1723ff5a6a2c |title=Electoral Results by Party |website=Parliament of Canada |access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extending Canadian autonomy===
The constitutional crisis of 1926 provoked a consideration of the constitutional relations between the self-governing [[dominion]]s and the British government. During the next five years the position of the Governor General of a Dominion was clarified; he ceased to be a representative of the British government and became a representative of [[The Crown]]. The independent position of the Dominions in the [[British Empire]] (later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) and in the international community was put on a firm foundation by the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], subsequently codified in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=John Herd |last2=Seager |first2=Allan |date=1985 |title=Canada 1922–1939 |publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart |ISBN=0-7710-8564-8 |volume=15 |series=[[The Canadian Centenary Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King expanded the [[Department of External Affairs (Canada)|Department of External Affairs]], founded in 1909,  to further promote Canadian autonomy from Britain. The new department took some time to develop, but over time it significantly increased the reach and projection of Canadian diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilliker |first=John |date=1990 |title=Canada's Department of External Affairs. The Early Years: 1909–1946 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |ISBN=0-7735-0751-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, Canada had relied on British diplomats who owed their first loyalty to London. King recruited many high-calibre people for the new venture, including future prime minister [[Lester Pearson]] and influential career administrators [[Norman Robertson]] and [[Hume Wrong]]. This project was a key element of his overall strategy, setting Canada on a course independent of Britain, of former colonizer [[France]], as well as of the neighbouring powerful United States.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=John |date=1989 |title=Shadow of Heaven: The Life of Lester Pearson |volume=Vol. 1 |publisher=Lester &amp; Orpen Dennys |ISBN=0-8861-9169-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extends provincial powers===

In domestic affairs King strengthened the Liberal policy of increasing the powers of the provincial governments by transferring to the governments of [[Manitoba]], [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]] the ownership of the crown lands within those provinces, as well as the subsoil rights; these in particular would become increasingly important, as petroleum and other natural resources proved very abundant. In collaboration with the provincial governments, he inaugurated a system of [[Old Age Security|old-age pensions]] based on need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=Neatby1963 |last=Neatby |first=H.

===Defeat in 1930===
His government was in power during the beginning of the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]], but was slow to respond to the mounting crisis. He felt that the crisis was a temporary swing  of the business cycle and that the economy would soon recover without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neatby1963|Neatby (1963)]], Vol. 2, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics said he was out of touch. Just prior to the election, King carelessly remarked that he "would not give a five-cent piece" to Tory provincial governments for unemployment relief.&lt;ref name=Betcherman/&gt; The opposition made this remark a catch-phrase; the main issue was the deterioration in the economy and whether the prime minister was out of touch with the hardships of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berton |first=Pierre |date=1990 |title=The Great Depression, 1929–1939 |publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart |ISBN=0-7710-1270-5 |pp=54, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liberals lost the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|election of 1930]] to the Conservative Party, led by [[Richard Bedford Bennett]].  The popular vote was very close between the two parties, with the Liberals actually earning more votes than in 1926, but the Conservatives had a geographical advantage that turned into enough seats to give a majority.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neatby1963|Neatby (1963)]], Vol. 2, Ch. 15, quote p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition leader==
After his loss, King stayed on as Opposition Leader, where it was his policy to refrain from offering advice or alternative policies. Indeed, his policy preferences were not much different from Bennett's, and he let the Conservative government have its way. Though he gave the impression of sympathy with progressive and liberal causes, he had no enthusiasm for the [[New Deal]] of American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (which Bennett eventually tried to emulate, after floundering without solutions for several years), and he never advocated massive government action to alleviate depression in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Neatby1976|last=Neatby|first=H.

==Prime Minister: fourth Parliament==
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]] the Liberals used the slogan "King or Chaos" to win a landslide victory. For the first time in his political career, King led an undisputed Liberal majority government. Promising a much-desired trade treaty with the U.S., the King government passed the 1935 Reciprocal Trade Agreement. It marked the turning point in Canadian-American economic relations, reversing the disastrous trade war of 1930–31, lowering tariffs, and yielding a dramatic increase in trade. More subtly, it revealed to the prime minister and President Roosevelt that they could work together well.&lt;ref&gt;

The worst of the Depression had passed by 1935 when King regained power. He implemented relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission. His government also made the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] a [[crown corporation]] in 1936, created Trans-Canada Airlines (the precursor to [[Air Canada]]) in 1937, and formed the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. In 1938, he transformed the [[Bank of Canada]] from a private entity to a crown corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/about/history/ |title=The Bank's History |website=Bank of Canada |access-date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1936 the prime minister lost patience when western Canadians preferred radical alternatives such as the CCF ([[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]]) and [[Social Credit]] to his middle-of-the-road liberalism. Indeed, he came close to writing off the region with his comment that the prairie dust bowl was "part of the U.S. desert area. I doubt if it will be of any real use again."&lt;ref name="Robert A. Wardhaugh 2000"/&gt; Instead he paid more attention to the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec, particularly with respect to the proposed [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] project with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

Blair |date=1972 |title=The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties |publisher=Gage |ISBN=0-7715-5661-6 |pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next fourteen years, a wide range of reforms similar to those association with the [[New Deal]] were realized during Mackenzie King's last period in office as Prime Minister. In 1939, compulsory contributions for pensions for low-income widows and orphans were introduced (although these only covered the regularly employed) while depressed farmers were subsidized from that same year onwards. In 1944, family allowances were introduced, and from 1948 the federal government subsidized medical services in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of the Welfare State'', 2nd Edition by [[Pat Thane]], published 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The various provinces were assisted by the Federal Unemployment and Agricultural Assistance Act of 1938 and the Youth Training Act of 1939 to create training programs for young persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AdhuHFvqjwC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Canada+Unemployment+and+Agricultural+Assistance+Act+1939&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z2aKbpfkjK&amp;sig=m8yk45_9jG15wW4op-RqgQQQwTI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAmoVChMI3Y28_pboyAIVxroUCh07mwMZ#v=onepage&amp;q=Canada%20Unemployment%20and%20Agricultural%20Assistance%20Act%201939&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Recreation and Leisure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an amendment to the Criminal Code (which received Royal assent in May 1939) provided against refusal to hire, or dismissal, "solely because of a person's membership in a lawful trade-union or association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH983HtDMRQC&amp;q=Canada+AN+AMENDMENT+to+the+Canadian+Criminal+Code,+which+received+Royal+assent+on+May+19,+1939,+provides+against+refusal+to+hire,+or+dismissal,+solely+because+of+membership+in+a+lawful+trade-union+or+association&amp;dq=Canada+AN+AMENDMENT+to+the+Canadian+Criminal+Code,+which+received+Royal+assent+on+May+19,+1939,+provides+against+refusal+to+hire,+or+dismissal,+solely+because+of+membership+in+a+lawful+trade-union+or+association&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI34T40vzlyAIVAVAmCh1XQwlO|title=MONTHLY LABOR REVIEW VOLUME 49: JULY TO DECEMBER 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the age for blind persons to qualify for old-age pensions was reduced to 40 in 1937, and later to 21 in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PM9RMKQqaiUC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=canada+widows+pensions+1927&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAmoVChMIusWkzbe9yAIVick-Ch2ziQeX#v=onepage&amp;q=canada%20widows%20pensions%201927&amp;f=false|title=Old Age Pensions and Policy-Making in Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and Hitler ===
In March 1936, in response to the German [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]], King had the Canadian High Commissioner in London inform the British government that if Britain went to war with Germany over the [[Rhineland]] issue, Canada would remain neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emmerson |first=James Thomas |title=The Rhineland Crisis, March 7, 1936: A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy |date=1977 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |page=144 |isbn=0-8138-1865-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1937, during an Imperial Conference of all the Dominion Prime Ministers in London, King informed British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] that Canada would only go to war if Britain were directly attacked, and that if Britain were to become involved in a continental war then Chamberlain was not to expect Canadian support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middlemas |first=Keith |author-link=Keith Middlemas |date=1972 |title=Diplomacy of Illusion: The British Government and Germany, 1937–1939 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |ISBN=0-2979-9390-9 |pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, King visited Germany and met with [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="king in berlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.05-e.html |title=Mackenzie King in Berlin |website=A Real Companion and Friend: The diary of William Lyon Mackenzie King |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031132442/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.05-e.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Possessing a religious yearning for direct insight into the hidden mysteries of life and the universe, and strongly influenced by the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] (who was also Hitler's favourite composer), King decided Hitler was akin to mythical Wagnerian heroes within whom good and evil were struggling. He thought that good would eventually triumph and Hitler would redeem his people and lead them to a harmonious, uplifting future. These spiritual attitudes not only guided Canada's relations with Hitler but gave the prime minister the comforting sense of a higher mission, that of helping to lead Hitler to peace. King commented in his journal that "he is really one who truly loves his fellow-men, and his country, and would make any sacrifice for their good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert H. |last=Keyserlingk |title=Mackenzie King's Spiritualism and His View of Hitler in 1939 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |year=1985–1986 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=26–44 |issn=0021-9495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.

In late 1938, during the great crisis in Europe over [[Czechoslovakia]] that culminated in the [[Munich Agreement]], Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top advisers like [[Oscar D. Skelton]]. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own secretary of state for external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neatby1976|Neatby (1976)]], pp. 287–293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry |first=Michael Graham |date=1999 |chapter=The British Dominions and the Munich Crisis |pp=320–325 |title=The Munich Crisis, 1938 |editor-first1=Erik |editor-last1=Goldstein |editor-first2=Igor |editor-last2=Lukes |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0-7146-4995-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic policies===
While Deputy Minister of Labour, King was appointed to investigate the causes of and claims for compensation resulting from the 1907 [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] riots in [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver's Chinatown]] and [[Japantown]]. One of the claims for damages came from Chinese [[opium]] dealers, which led King to investigate [[narcotics]] use in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. Following the investigation King reported that white women were also opium users, not just Chinese men, and the federal government used the report to justify the first legislation outlawing narcotics in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Melvyn |volume= 37 |issue=1 |date=Winter 1979 |title=A History of Narcotics Control: The Formative Years |journal=University of Toronto Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report failed to include any reference regarding the Opium Wars, the involvement of the East Indian Trading company, or the official Chinese government's resistance to the opium trade which was renewed on September 20, 1906.

Under King's administration, the Canadian government, responding to strong public opinion, especially in Quebec, refused to expand immigration opportunities for [[Jewish]] [[refugee]]s from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald J.

===Parliamentary Declaration of War===
King realized the likelihood of [[World War II]] and began mobilizing on August 25, 1939, with full mobilization on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland.  In 1914, Canada was at the war by virtue of King [[George V]]'s declaration. In 1939, the Prime Minister  asserted Canada's autonomy and convened the House of Commons on September 7, nearly a month ahead of schedule, to discuss the government's intention to enter the war, which was approved two days later.  On September 10, Prime Minister King, through his High Commissioner in London, issued a request to King George VI, asking him, in his capacity as King of Canada, to declare war against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckner |first=Phillip Alfred |title=Canada and the British Empire |url={{google books|KmXnLGX7FvEC|plainurl=yes|page=105}} |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=105–106 |isbn=0-1992-7164-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobilization===
King linked Canada more and more closely to the United States, signing an agreement with Roosevelt at [[Ogdensburg, New York]] in August 1940 that provided for the close cooperation of Canadian and American forces, despite the fact that the U.S. remained officially neutral until the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. During the war the Americans took virtual control of the [[Yukon]] and the then-British colony of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in building the [[Alaska Highway]] and major airbases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perras |first=Galen Roger |date=1998 |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Origins of the Canadian-American Security Alliance, 1933–1945: Necessary, but Not Necessary Enough |publisher=Praeger |ISBN=0-2759-5500-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King—and Canada—were largely ignored by [[Winston Churchill]], despite Canada's major role in supplying food, raw materials, munitions and money to the hard-pressed British economy, training airmen for the Commonwealth, guarding the western half of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] against German [[U-boat]]s, and providing combat troops for the invasions of [[Italy]], [[France]] and Germany in 1943–45. King proved highly successful in mobilizing the economy for war, with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output. The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly. On the political side, King rejected any notion of a government of national unity.&lt;ref name="P. Stacey, 1970"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stacey |first=C. P. |date=1970 |title=Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939–1945 |publisher=Queen's Printer |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the [[Canadian federal election, 1940]] as normally scheduled, despite the ongoing World War, unlike Britain, which formed a government of national unity and did not hold a wartime election.

To re-arm Canada he built the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] as a viable military power, while at the same time keeping it separate from Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. He was instrumental in obtaining the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] Agreement, which was signed in Ottawa in December 1939, binding Canada, Britain, [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] to a program that eventually trained half the airmen from those four nations in the Second World War.&lt;ref name="P. Stacey, 1970"/&gt;

===Expansion of scientific research===
King's government greatly expanded the role of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] during the war, moving into full-scale research in nuclear physics and commercial use of [[nuclear power]] in the following years. King, with [[C. D. Howe]] acting as point man, moved the nuclear group from [[Montreal]] to [[Chalk River, Ontario]] in 1944, with the establishment of [[Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories]] and the residential town of [[Deep River, Ontario]]. Canada became a world leader in this field, with the [[NRX]] reactor becoming operational in 1947; at the time, NRX was the only operational nuclear reactor outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Robert Bothwell |last=Bothwell |first=Robert |date=1988 |title=Nucleus: The History of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited |publisher=University of Toronto Press |ISBN=0-8020-2670-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRC also contributed to wartime scientific development in other ways during this period.

===Conscription Crisis===
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1944}}
King's promise not to impose conscription contributed to the defeat of [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] Quebec provincial government in 1939 and the Liberals' re-election in the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 election]]. But after the fall of France in 1940, Canada introduced conscription for home service. Still, only volunteers were to be sent overseas. King wanted to avoid a repeat of the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. By 1942, the military was pressing King hard to send conscripts to Europe. In 1942, King held a national [[plebiscite]] on the issue, asking the nation to relieve him of the commitment he had made during the election campaign. In the House of Commons on June 10, 1942, he said that his policy was "not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary".&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, House of Commons, June 10, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

French Canadians voted against conscription, with over 70% opposed, but an overwhelming majority – over 80% – of English Canadians supported it. French and English conscripts were sent to fight in the [[Aleutian Islands]] in 1943 – technically North American soil and therefore not "overseas" – but the mix of Canadian volunteers and draftees found that the Japanese troops had fled before their arrival. Otherwise, King continued with a campaign to recruit volunteers, hoping to address the problem with the shortage of troops caused by heavy losses in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942, in [[Italy]] in 1943, and after the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944. In November 1944, the Government decided it was necessary to send conscripts to Europe for the war. This led to a brief political crisis (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]) and a [[Terrace Mutiny|mutiny]] by conscripts posted in [[British Columbia]], but the war ended a few months later. Over 15,000 conscripts went to Europe, though only a few hundred saw combat.

===Internment of Japanese-Canadians===
Following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Japanese Canadians were categorized as enemy aliens under the [[War Measures Act]], which began to remove their personal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, Aya. "Japanese-Canadian Internally Displaced Persons:Labour Relations and Ethno-Religious Identity in Southern Alberta, 1942–1953. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on December 8, 1941, 1,200 Japanese-Canadian-owned fishing vessels were impounded as a "defence measure."&lt;ref&gt;Sunahara (1981), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order calling for the removal of male Japanese nationals between 18 and 45 years of age from a designated protected area of 100 miles inland from the British Columbia coast, enacted a ban against Japanese-Canadian fishing during the war, banned shortwave radios and controlled the sale of gasoline and dynamite to Japanese Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Sunahara (1981), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese nationals removed from the coast after the January 14 order were sent to road camps around [[Jasper, Alberta]]. 
Three weeks later, on February 19, 1942, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed [[Executive Order 9066]], which called for the removal of [[Internment of Japanese Americans|110,000 people of Japanese ancestry]] from the American coastline. A historian of internment, Ann Sunahara, argues that "the American action sealed the fate of Japanese Canadians."&lt;ref&gt;Sunahara (1981), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 24, the federal government passed order-in-council PC 1468 which allowed for the [[Japanese-Canadian internment|removal of "all persons of Japanese origin"]]&lt;ref&gt;Sugiman, Pamela. "Life is Sweet: Vulnerability and Composure in the Wartime Narratives of Japanese Canadians". Journals of Canadian Studies. Winter 2009: 186-218, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; This order-in-council allowed the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] the broad powers of removing people from any protected area in Canada, but was meant for Japanese Canadians on the Pacific coast in particular. On February 25, the federal government announced that Japanese Canadians were being moved for reasons of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Sunahara, Ann. "The Politics of Racism: The Uprooting of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War." Toronto: J, Larimer, 1981.Pg 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, some 27,000 people were detained without charge or trial, and their property confiscated. Others were deported to Japan.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi"&gt;Kobayashi, Audrey. "The Japanese-Canadian redress settlement and its implications for ‘race relations’" Canadian Ethnic Studies. Vol. 24, Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
King and his Cabinet ignored reports from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Canadian military that most of the Japanese were law-abiding and not a threat. Major General Ken Stuart told Ottawa, "I cannot see that the Japanese Canadians constitute the slightest menace to national security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sunahara |first=Ann Gomer |date=1981 |url=http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.ca/Politics_of_Racism.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Politics of Racism: The Uprooting of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War |publisher=James Lorimer |location=Ottawa |ISBN=0-8886-2413-1 |p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's political direction on this issue closely followed postulates from his 1909 doctoral thesis at Harvard.

On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] delivered an apology for the internment, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package.

===Canadian autonomy===
Throughout his tenure, King led Canada from a colony with responsible government to an autonomous nation within the [[British Commonwealth]]. King asserted Canadian autonomy against the British government's attempts to turn the Commonwealth into an alliance. His biographer asserts that "in this struggle MacKenzie King was the constant aggressor".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neatby1963|Neatby (1963)]], Vol. 2, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian High Commissioner to Britain, [[Vincent Massey]], claimed that an "anti-British bias" was "one of the most powerful factors in his make-up".&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Massey, ''What's Past is Prologue'' (London: Macmillan, 1963), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922, King refused to support the British without first consulting Parliament, while the Conservative leader, [[Arthur Meighen]], supported Britain. King wrote in his diary of the British appeal: "I confess it annoyed me. It is drafted designedly to play the imperial game, to test out centralization versus autonomy as regards European wars...No [Canadian] contingent will go without parliament being summoned in the first instance".{{sfn|Dawson|1958|p=409}} The British were disappointed with King's response but the crisis was soon resolved, as King had anticipated.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"/&gt; After Chanak, King was concerned about the possibility that Canada might go to war because of its connections with Britain, writing to [[Violet Markham]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anything like centralization in London, to say nothing of a direct or indirect attempt on the part of those in office in Downing Street to tell the people of the [[Dominion]]s what they should or should not do, and to dictate their duty in matters of foreign policy, is certain to prove just as injurious to the so-called 'imperial solidarity' as any attempt at interference in questions of purely domestic concern. If membership within the British Commonwealth means participation by the Dominions in any and every war in which Great Britain becomes involved, without consultation, conference, or agreement of any kind in advance, I can see no hope for an enduring relationship.{{sfn|Dawson|1958|p=419}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

King therefore went to the [[Imperial Conference]] of 1926 and argued for greater autonomy of the Dominions. This resulted in the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], which announced the equal status of all members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] (as it was known then), including Britain. This eventually led to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. The Canadian city of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] hosted the first Empire Games in 1930; this competition later became known as the [[Commonwealth Games]], and is held every four years.

In the lead-up to World War II in 1939, King affirmed Canadian autonomy by saying that the Canadian Parliament would make the final decision on the issue of going to war. He reassured the pro-British Canadians that Parliament would surely decide that Canada would be at Britain's side if Great Britain was drawn into a major war. At the same time, he reassured those who were suspicious of British influence in Canada by promising that Canada would not participate in British colonial wars. His Quebec lieutenant, [[Ernest Lapointe]], promised French-Canadians that the government would not introduce conscription; individual participation would be voluntary. In 1939, in a country which had seemed deeply divided, these promises made it possible for Parliament to agree almost unanimously to declare war.

King played two roles. On the one hand, he told English Canadians that Canada would no doubt enter war if Britain did. On the other hand, he and his [[Quebec lieutenant]] [[Ernest Lapointe]] told French Canadians that Canada would only go to war if it was in the country's best interests. With the dual messages, King slowly led Canada toward war without causing strife between Canada's two main linguistic communities. As his final step in asserting Canada's autonomy, King ensured that the Canadian Parliament made its own declaration of war one week after Britain.

During the war, Canada rapidly expanded its diplomatic missions abroad. However British Prime Minister Winston Churchill made all the major military and diplomatic decisions for Canada and the other dominions, with minimal consultation.  While Canada hosted two major Allied conferences in Quebec in 1943 and 1944, neither Mackenzie King nor his senior generals and admirals were invited to take part in any of the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, "Happily on the Margins: Mackenzie King and Canada at the Quebec Conferences," in David B. Woolner, ed., ''The Second Quebec Conference Revisited: Waging War, Formulating Peace: Canada, Great Britain, and the United States in 1944-1945'' (1998) pp 49-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

King's government introduced the ''[[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]]'' in 1946, which officially created the notion of "[[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizens]]". Prior to this, Canadians were considered British subjects living in Canada. On January 3, 1947, King received Canadian citizenship certificate number 0001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1947-the-first-officially-canadian-citizens |title=The first officially Canadian citizens |website=CBC Archives |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister: sixth Parliament, post-war Canada==
With the war winding down, King held a [[Canadian federal election, 1945|federal election in 1945]] and won a minority, but formed a functioning coalition to continue governing. As King was defeated in his own riding of [[Prince Albert (electoral district)|Prince Albert]], fellow Liberal [[William MacDiarmid]], who was re-elected in the [[safe seat]] of [[Glengarry (electoral district)|Glengarry]], resigned so that a by-election could be held, which was subsequently won by King.  

The main opposition party Conservatives were weak for most of the two decades after R. B. Bennett lost the 1935 election, and King had virtually unchallenged power for much of his later years; this expanded still further during the War. He promoted engineer [[C.&amp;nbsp;D. Howe]] into positions of great power and influence during the War, but was hit hard by the 1940 death of key minister and protege [[Norman McLeod Rogers]]. After this setback, and the 1941 death of his Quebec lieutenant Ernest Lapointe, King sought out the reluctant [[Louis St. Laurent]], a leading Quebec lawyer, to take over Lapointe's role, and eventually persuaded St. Laurent to serve as a top aide.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"/&gt;

King helped found the [[United Nations]] in 1945 and attended the opening meetings in San Francisco. However, he became pessimistic about the organization's future possibilities. After the war, King quickly dismantled wartime controls. Unlike World War I, press censorship ended with the hostilities. He began an ambitious program of social programs and laid the groundwork for Newfoundland's later entry into Canada.

King moved Canada into the deepening [[Cold War]] in alliance with the U.S. and Britain. He dealt with the espionage revelations of Soviet cipher clerk [[Igor Gouzenko]], who defected in Ottawa in September 1945, by quickly appointing a [[Kellock-Taschereau Commission|Royal Commission]] to investigate Gouzenko's allegations of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] Communist spy-ring transmitting top-secret documents to Moscow.  External Affairs Minister Louis St. Laurent dealt decisively with this crisis, the first of its type in Canada's history. St. Laurent's leadership deepened King's respect, and helped make St. Laurent the next Canadian Prime Minister three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutchison |first=Bruce |date=1964 |title=Mr. Prime Minister 1867–1964 |location=Toronto |publisher=Longmans Canada |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Grave of William Lyon Mackenzie King.jpg|thumb|King's grave and memorial plaque]]
On January 20, 1948, King called on the Liberal Party to hold its first national convention since 1919 to choose a new leader. The August convention chose St. Laurent as the new leader of the Liberal Party. Three months later, King retired after 22 years as prime minister. King also had the most terms (six) as Prime Minister. Sir John A. Macdonald was second-in-line, with 19 years, as the longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (1867–1873, 1878–1891). King was not charismatic and did not have a large personal following. Only eight Canadians in 100 picked him when the Canadian Gallup (CIPO) poll asked in September 1946, "What person living in any part of the world today do you admire?" Nevertheless, his Liberal Party was easily re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|election of 1945]].

King died on July 22, 1950, at Kingsmere from pneumonia, with his retirement plans to write his memoirs unfulfilled. He is buried in [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]], Toronto.&lt;ref name=Parks_Grave&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/clmhc-hsmbc/sep-gra/pms/king.aspx |website=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada – Former Prime Ministers and Their Grave Sites |title=The Right Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King |date=February 24, 2011 |publisher=Parks Canada |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102003220/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/clmhc-hsmbc/sep-gra/pms/king.aspx |archive-date=November 2, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal style and character==

King lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skills; he did not shine on the radio or in newsreels. There was scant charisma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Reardon|title=Winston Churchill and Mackenzie King: So Similar, So Different|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CL_x4bfEaIYC&amp;pg=PA381|year=2012|publisher=Dundurn|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cold and tactless in human relations, he had allies but very few close personal friends; he never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. His allies were annoyed by his constant intrigues.&lt;ref name="English"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=John |editor-last1=English |editor-first2=J.O. |editor-last2=Stubbs |title=Mackenzie King: Widening the Debate |date=1977 |publisher=Macmillan of Canada |isbn=0-77051-529-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is not remembered for great major policy innovations as prime minister. Christopher Moore says, "King had made 'Parliament will decide' his maxim, and he trotted it out whenever he wished to avoid a decision."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Moore|title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmgBsaRJbTQC&amp;pg=PA222|year=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy; he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Levine|title=King: William Lyon Mackenzie King : a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co6pBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strength was apparent when he synthesized, built support for, and passed measures that had reached a level of broad national support.  Advances in the welfare state were an example.  His successors, especially Diefenbaker, Pearson, and Trudeau built the welfare state which he had advanced during the Second World War into the modern cradle-to-grave system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Neary|author2=J. L. Granatstein|title=The Veterans Charter and Post-World War II Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcB7_y-VbvkC&amp;pg=PA294|year=1999|publisher= MQUP|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  
King kept a very candid diary from 1893, when he was still an undergraduate, until a few days before his death in 1950; the volumes, stacked in a row, span a length of over seven metres and comprise over 50,000 manuscript pages of typed transcribed text.&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaries of William Lyon Mackenzie King|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/prime-ministers/william-lyon-mackenzie-king/Pages/diaries-william-lyon-mackenzie-king.aspx|website=Library and Archives Canada|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One biographer called these diaries "the most important single political document in twentieth-century Canadian history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Stacey1985|last=Stacey|first=C.P.|authorlink=Charles Perry Stacey|title=A Very Double Life: The Private World of Mackenzie King|year=1985|publisher=Formac Publishing|edition=reprint|isbn=0-8878-0136-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; for they explain motivations of the [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canadian war efforts]] and describe other events in detail.

King's [[occult]] interests were kept secret during his years in office,&lt;ref name="mallinos"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallinos|first1=Chris|title=For King — and Laurier — and country|journal=Canada's History|date=2018|volume=97|issue=6|pages=70–71|language=English|issn=1920-9894}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only became publicized after his death when his diaries were opened. Readers were amazed. King communed with spirits, using seances with paid mediums. Thereby, he claimed to have communicated with Leonardo da Vinci, Wilfrid Laurier, his dead mother, his grandfather, and several of his dead dogs, as well as the spirit of the late President Roosevelt. Some historians argue that he sought personal reassurance from the spirit world, more than political advice. After his death, one of his mediums said that she had not realized that he was a politician. King did inquire whether his party would win the 1935 election, one of the few times politics came up during his seances. However Allan Levine argues that sometimes he did pay attention to the political implications of his seances: "All of his spiritualist experiences, his other superstitions and his multi-paranoid reactions imprinted on his consciousness, shaping his thoughts and feelings in a thousand different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Levine |title=King: William Lyon Mackenzie King: a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co6pBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 |year=2011 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |pages=2–14 |isbn=978-1-5536-5560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have seen in his [[spiritualism]] and occult activities a penchant for forging unities from antitheses, thus having latent political import. Historian [[Charles Perry Stacey|C.P. Stacey]], in his 1976 book ''A Very Double Life'' examined King's secret life in detail, argued that King did not allow his beliefs to influence his decisions on political matters. Stacey wrote that King entirely gave up his interests in the occult and spiritualism during World War II.&lt;ref name="Stacey 1976"&gt;[[#Stacey1976|Stacey (1976)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

King never married,&lt;ref name="mallinos" /&gt; but had several close female friends, including Joan Patteson, a married woman with whom he spent some of his leisure time; sometimes she served as hostess at his dinner parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Levine |title=Scrum Wars: The Prime Ministers and the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yz-rrDVKkYC&amp;pg=PA134 |year=1996 |publisher=Dundurn |location=Toronto, Ontario |page=134 |isbn=978-1-5548-8289-2 |access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not have a wife who could be the hostess all the time and handle the many social obligations that he tried to downplay. Editor Charles Bowman reports that,  "He felt the lack of a wife, particularly when social duties called for a hostess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles A. |last=Bowman|title=Ottawa Editor: The Memoirs of Charles A. Bowman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O58JAQAAIAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Gray's Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have interpreted passages in his diaries as suggesting that King regularly had sexual relations with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacey1985|Stacey (1985)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, also basing their claims on passages of his diaries, have suggested that King was in love with [[Lord Tweedsmuir]], whom he had chosen for appointment as [[Governor General]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |last1=Jarvis |first1=Ian  |last2=Collins |first2=David |date=1992 |title=Willie: Canada's Bachelor Prime Minister |url= |medium= |publisher=Butterfly Productions |location=Toronto, Ontario |accessdate= |time= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Along with [[Wilfrid Laurier]], King was the only other Canadian Prime Minister to be in office during the reigns of three [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=J. L. |last1=Granatstein |first2=Norman |last2=Hillmer |title=Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders |date=1999 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780006385639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was ranked as the greatest Canadian Prime Minister by a survey of Canadian historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. L. |last1=Granatstein |first2=Norman |last2=Hillmer |title=Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders |date=1999 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780006385639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
King's likeness is on the [[Canadian fifty-dollar note]] since 1975.

King left no published political memoirs, although his private diaries were extensively detailed. His main published work remains his 1918 book ''Industry and Humanity''.&lt;ref name="Industry and Humanity"/&gt;

Following the publication of King's diaries in the 1970s, several fictional works about him were published by Canadian writers. These included Elizabeth Gourlay's novel ''Isabel'', [[Allan Stratton]]'s play ''Rexy'' and Heather Robertson's trilogy ''Willie: A Romance'' (1983), ''Lily: A Rhapsody in Red'' (1986), and ''Igor: A Novel of Intrigue'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Diary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Diary: The Private Becomes Public: The Impact of the Diary|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1030.02-e.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20120510211453/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1030.02-e.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 May 2012|website=A Real Companion and Friend: The Diary of William Lyon Mackenzie King|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, there was controversy over King's exclusion from a memorial to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]], which was attended by King, Roosevelt, and Churchill. The monument was commissioned by the [[Quebec separatist|sovereigntist]] [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[Quebec]], which justified the decision on their interpretation that King was acting merely as a host for the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Canadian federalists, however, accused the government of Quebec of trying to advance their own political agenda.

[[OC Transpo]] has a [[Ottawa Rapid Transit|Transitway]] station named Mackenzie King due to its location on the [[Mackenzie King Bridge]]. It is located adjacent to the [[Rideau Centre]] in downtown [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]].

The bridge across the [[Rideau Canal]] in downtown Ottawa, built following World War II, is named in his honour to recognize his contributions to the land planning of the city of Ottawa.&lt;ref name="Stacey 1976"/&gt;

Part of his country retreat, now called Mackenzie King Estate, at [[Kingsmere]] in the [[Gatineau Park]], near [[Ottawa]], is open to the public. The house King died in, called "[[The Farm (Canada)|The Farm]]", is the official residence of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada]], and is not part of the park.
[[File:Home_of_Mackenzie_King_in_Gatineau.jpg|thumb|right|Home of William Lyon Mackenzie King in [[Kingsmere, Quebec]]]]

The [[Woodside National Historic Site]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] was King's boyhood home. The estate has over 4.65 hectares of garden and parkland for exploring and relaxing, and the house has been restored to reflect life during King's era. There is a MacKenzie King Public School in the Heritage Park neighbourhood in Kitchener. Kitchener was known as Berlin until 1916.

King was mentioned in the book ''[[Alligator Pie]]'' by [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]], appearing as the subject of a [[Literary nonsense|nonsensical]] children's poem,&lt;ref name="Diary"/&gt; which reads "William Lyon Mackenzie King / He sat in the middle and played with string / He loved his mother like anything / William Lyon Mackenzie King."

King is a prominent character in [[Donald Jack]]'s novel ''Me Too'', set in Ottawa in the 1920s.

A character who appeared twice in the popular 1990s Canadian television series ''[[Due South]]'' was named "Mackenzie King" in obvious reference.

==Supreme Court appointments==
King chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]:

'''Władysław Horodecki''' (born '''Leszek Dezydery Horodecki'''; {{lang-ru|Владислав Владиславович Городецкий}}; {{lang-uk|Владислав Владиславович Городецький}}; {{OldStyleDate|June 4|1863|May 23}} — January 3, 1930) was a notable architect of [[Poland|Polish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dzieje.pl/filmy/w-kijowie-zaprezentowano-film-o-polskim-architekcie-wladyslawie-horodeckim|title=Kijów: zaprezentowano film o polskim architekcie Władysławie Horodeckim|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; nationality, active in the [[Russian Empire]] and later in the [[Second Polish Republic]]. He is best known for his contributions in the urban development of [[Kiev]], with buildings such as the [[House with Chimaeras]], the [[St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral, Kiev|St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral]], the [[Karaite Kenesa, Kiev|Karaite Kenesa]], and the [[National Art Museum of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Kiev/person_architect-wc582adysc582aw_horodecki|title=Kiev Władysław Horodecki|website=www.triposo.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kiev Horodecki often worked along with a sculptor from [[Milan]], [[Emilio Sala (sculptor)|Emilio Sala]], who was an instructor at the Kiev City College.

==Biography==
[[File:POL COA Kornic.svg|100px|thumb|left|Kornic family]]

===Russian Empire===
Horodecki was born into a noble [[Poles|Polish]] [[szlachta]] family of the Kornic coat of arms in the village of Szołudki (Sholudky, now Mukhivtsi Rural Council, [[Nemyriv Raion]], [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], Ukraine). His ancestors were big landowners (''didych'') in the [[Podillya]] region. Horodecki graduated from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1890, while prior to that he finished a [[realschule]] in [[Odessa]]. After 1890 Horodecki moved to Kiev where he lived for almost 30 years.

===Poland===
As Poland regained its independence after the [[Polish-Soviet War]] in 1920, and Russia, including Kiev, fell under [[Bolshevism]], he emigrated to [[Warsaw]]. In Poland Horodecki headed an American Project Bureau "Henry Ulan &amp; Co.". Some of his designs were built including a water tower and trade rows in [[Piotrków Trybunalski]] (today in [[Lodz Voivodeship]]), a meat factory in [[Lublin]], a bath house in [[Zgierz]], and a casino building in [[Otwock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turystycznyotwock.pl/en/2-dom-uzdrowiskowy-i-park-miejski|title=Turystyczny Otwock - 2. Spa House and the Civic Park|website=www.turystycznyotwock.pl|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia===
In 1928 on the invitation of the same company Horodecki moved to Tehran, becoming a chief architect of the Syndicate on the Design of Persian Railways. He designed in particular the building of the [[Tehran railway station]]. In 1930 he died and was buried at [[Doulab Cemetery|Doulab Catholic Cemetery]] in Tehran. His epitaph is inscribed in [[Polish language|Polish]] with only the phrase ''Profesor architektury. Niech mu obca ziemia będzie lekka.'', which translates into English as "Professor of architecture. Let the foreign earth be light for him".

==Legacy==
One of Kiev's streets, designed by Horodecki,&lt;ref name="kmv_photo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmv.gov.ua/en/photonews.asp?Id=20616&amp;IdImg=793&amp;Page=1|title=Photoalbum|work=Official web-portal|publisher=[[Legal status and local government of Kiev|Kiev municipal authority]]|accessdate=2007-07-15|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; (between [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] and [[House with Chimaeras]]) was named after him in 1996 as vulytsia Arkhitektora Horodetskoho. The street had been no called ulitsa Nikolayevskaya, and in Soviet times it was known as vulytsia Karla Marksa.

'''Yuan Chonghuan''' (6 June 1584 – 10 january 1630), [[courtesy name]] '''Yuansu''' or '''Ziru''', was a politician, military general and writer who served under the [[Ming dynasty]]. Widely regarded as a patriot in Chinese culture, he is best known for defending [[Liaoning]] from [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] invaders during the [[Later Jin (1616-1636)|Later Jin]] [[Qing conquest of the Ming|invasion of the Ming]]. As a general, Yuan Chonghuan excelled as a cannoneer and sought to incorporate European cannon designs into the Ming arsenal.

Yuan's military career reached its height when he defeated the Jurchen ruler, [[Nurhaci]], and his army in the first [[Battle of Ningyuan]]. Later on, Yuan also defeated Nurhaci's son and successor, [[Hong Taiji]], and his 200,000-strong army composed of mostly [[Mongol people|Mongol]] soldiers at the second Battle of Ningyuan. Yuan met his end when he was arrested and executed by ''[[lingchi]]'' ("slow slicing") on the order of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] under false charges of treason, which were believed to have been planted against him by the Jurchens.

==Early life==
Yuan was born in [[Dongguan]], [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LH04Ad01.html|title=Cantonese cultural warriors fight back|website=Asia Times Online|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his adolescence, he spent time traveling from town to town. Although he took the [[imperial examination]] repeatedly with little success, he gained a lot of practical experience during his travels to the capital. It is said that he befriended several [[Jesuits]] during this time and spent much time working on modifying European cannons.

==Early military career==
Yuan passed the imperial examination in 1619 and was appointed as the magistrate of a remote county. In 1619, the Ming imperial army was defeated by the Jurchens in the [[Battle of Sarhu]]. Ming forces suffered successive defeats and in 1622 they were forced to retreat to [[Shanhai Pass]], abandoning all of Liaoning to the Jurchens. After a visit to the front, Yuan was appointed as a second-class secretary in the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Ministry of War]], then promoted almost immediately to full secretary and supplied with funds for enlisting troops. Yuan's rapid promotion was quite notable at the time as he did not have any formal military training at all, save for studying the [[Confucian classics]] in order to pass the imperial examination.

Yuan cooperated with the commander-in-chief [[Sun Chengzong]] in pushing the frontiers steadily northward, fortifying [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]] in 1623. The elderly Sun was an able commander but refused to bribe [[Wei Zhongxian]], an influential court eunuch under the [[Tianqi Emperor]]. Consequently, Sun was recalled in 1625 and replaced by Gao Di ({{lang|zh-Hant|高第}}), who ordered a general retreat to Shanhai Pass. However, Yuan flatly refused to leave Ningyuan.

Early in the next year, [[Nurhaci]] led the Jurchens back across the [[Liao River]]. Yuan and his deputies successfully held Ningyuan with the newly mounted and modified "[[hongyipao]]" and only 9,000 militiamen against Nurhaci's 130,000-strong army. The [[Battle of Ningyuan|victory at Ningyuan]] prevented immediate advances by the Jurchens.

Yuan was said to have studied every aspect of the cannon for it to fire accurately at the position he wanted, and this is given as the reason why Nurhaci, although well-protected by his elite guards in a safe position, was wounded by cannon fire. After the battle, Yuan sent letters to ask the well-being of Nurhaci, as traditionally done by Chinese generals, but Nurhaci returned an insult by calling him duplicitous.

As a result of this victory, the Ming imperial court in [[Beijing]] appointed Yuan as the Governor of Liaodong on 27 February 1626, with full authority to handle all forces outside the passes.

During this time, Yuan executed [[Mao Wenlong]], a Ming general regarded as ruthless but talented. Various texts have different opinions of his actions. Many stated this was a mistake since Mao could still be used against the Jurchens. However, Yuan took into account how Mao conducted his battles: Mao's tactics usually involved using civilian settlements as a shield for his troops, and during the occupation the civilians suffered tremendously. Mao also used the [[Joseon]] kingdom, Ming's ally, as a base to launch expeditions against the Jurchens. When the Jurchens entered Joseon, Mao ordered a general retreat of Ming forces. This angered many merchants in the Beijing area who traded in the [[Korean Peninsula]]. In addition, Mao was known to have bribed many corrupt eunuchs and officials. Consequently, by executing Mao, Yuan made enemies with some of the most influential people in China.

Taking advantage of Nurhaci's death later in the year, Yuan reoccupied [[Jinzhou]]. The Jurchens reappeared in June and withdrew after [[Battle of Ning-Jin|a series of indecisive battles]]. Yuan was criticised by the partisans of Wei Zhongxian, who stated that he took too long to fight off the Jurchens. Shortly thereafter Yuan was forced into retirement.

==Later military career and death==

[[File:Yuan chonghuan-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yuan Chonghuan's tomb in the [[Huashi, Beijing|Huashi]] neighborhood, near [[Beijing city fortifications#Guangqumen|Guangqumen]], in [[Dongcheng District, Beijing]].]]

In 1628, under the reign of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], Yuan was reinstated as the field marshal of all the Ming forces in the northeast. He embarked on an ambitious five-year plan for the complete recovery of [[Liaodong]]. The Chongzhen Emperor had begun his reign in 1627 at the age of 16, and in 1629 (at the age of 18) he appointed Yuan. In 1629, Yuan was granted the title of "Senior Guardian of the Heir Apparent". The emperor gave Yuan his Imperial Sword and stated that he would fully support Yuan's decisions.

This time Yuan had to face again a larger Jurchen force of over 200,000 troops under Nurhaci's successor, [[Hong Taiji]]. The Jurchens had incorporated more men into their army, including the newly surrendered Mongols and Ming rebels. They conquered various small tribes in northern China, and defeated Joseon in order to secure it as a tributary. However, the Jurchens never attacked [[Jinzhou]] or [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]] again. Instead, they bypassed Jinzhou, Ningyuan and [[Shanhai Pass]] altogether. They broke through the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] west of Shanhai Pass and reached the north of [[Beijing]] in the winter of 1629. Yuan rushed back with a selected veteran force from Ningyuan to defend the capital. He reached Beijing just days before the Jurchens. Outside the city wall of Beijing, he defeated the Jurchen [[Eight Banners]] which numbered around 100,000 men, but failed to destroy the Jurchen army. The Jurchens' surprise attack on Beijing was foiled. Despite the fact that Yuan prevented the Jurchens from even reaching the city wall, Yuan was heavily criticized when he arrived in Beijing, and some eunuchs even accused Yuan of collaborating with the enemy.

The Chongzhen Emperor ordered Yuan's arrest during an audience on 13 January 1630. Despite little evidence, Yuan was accused of collusion with the enemy and sentenced to death by ''[[lingchi]]'' ("slow slicing") at Ganshiqiao ({{lang|zh-Hant|甘石橋}}) in Beijing. When Yuan was asked for last words before his execution, he produced the following poem: "A life's work always ends up in vain; half of my career seems to be in dreams. I do not worry about lacking brave warriors after my death, for my loyal spirit will continue to guard Liaodong." ({{lang|zh-Hant|一生事業總成空，半世功名在夢中。死後不愁無將勇，忠魂依舊保遼東！}}) Imperial records showed he took half a day to die.&lt;ref&gt;計六奇. ''明季北略'', vol.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan was mourned throughout most of the country outside Beijing and even in the kingdom of [[Joseon]]. After his death, many took note of the Ming and their allies's weak position as favorable conditions for another Jurchen invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bjmem.com/bjm/bjwh/rwdl/200711/P020071117533094217342.pdf |title=程本直墓記修廣東新義園碑記 |access-date=2010-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910181517/http://www.bjmem.com/bjm/bjwh/rwdl/200711/P020071117533094217342.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said that upon hearing of his apparent "betrayal", many Beijing residents hated Yuan so much that they rushed to buy his body parts so they could eat them as soon as they were sliced off his body. He was left there after the torture, shouting for half a day before stopping.&lt;ref&gt;計六奇. ''明季北略'', vol.5&lt;/ref&gt; His head, the only recognisable part after the execution, was taken outside the Inner City Wall by a city guard, whose surname was [[She (surname)|She]] (佘), and buried in [[Huashi, Beijing|Huashi]] near [[Beijing city fortifications#Guangqumen|Guangqumen]]. The guard's family have guarded it for generations since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.southcn.com/weekend/top/200205230055.htm |title=372年守墓史曲終人散 |access-date=2010-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053309/http://www.southcn.com/weekend/top/200205230055.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb was recently renovated and renamed the Yuan Chonghuan Memorial, located at [[Longtan Park]].

==Legacy==

[[File:Yuan chonghuan-1.jpg|thumb|"Listening to the rain" (聽雨) by Yuan Chonghuan, kept at his memorial in Beijing.]]

Yuan's name was cleared nearly a century later by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], after conclusive evidence was found in old archives of the Qing imperial court supporting his innocence. The Qianlong Emperor tried to express his kindness by searching for and rewarding Yuan's direct descendants, but failed to find any.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[wuxia]]'' novel ''[[Sword Stained with Royal Blood]]'' by [[Jin Yong]], Yuan is survived by a fictional son, [[List of Sword Stained with Royal Blood characters|Yuan Chengzhi]], the protagonist of the novel. Yuan Chengzhi was saved by his father's subordinates after his father was executed and taken to the [[Mount Hua Sect]], where he learnt martial arts. Several years later, when he had grown up, he left Mount Hua and traveled around in search of adventure and to redress his father's legacy.

Celebrated as a [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] hero,&lt;ref name="asiatimes10-08-04"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cantonese cultural warriors fight back|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LH04Ad01.html|publisher=Asia Times|date=2010-08-04|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy|2010 rally]], protesters in [[Guangzhou]] used Yuan's battle cry against his Jurchen enemies during the [[Battle of Ningyuan]]: "Fuck his mom! Hit them hard!" ({{zh|t=掉哪媽! 頂硬上!|first=t|labels=no}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danwei.org/language/yuan_chonghuan_profanity.php The obscene battle-cry of a Ming Dynasty war hero]&lt;/ref&gt; as a chant.

In the 2017 [[TVB]] drama ''[[A General, a Scholar and a Eunuch]]'', Yuan Chonghuan was portrayed by [[Edwin Siu]].
