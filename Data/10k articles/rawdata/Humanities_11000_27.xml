'''Abortion in the United States''' has been, and remains, a controversial issue in [[United States]] culture and politics. Various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900.

Before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decriminalised abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the main actors in the abortion debate are most often labeled either as "[[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice]]" or "[[United States pro-life movement|pro-life]]", though shades of opinion exist, and most Americans are considered to be somewhere in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx|title=Plenty of Common Ground Found in Abortion Debate|last=Saad|first=Lydia|date=August 8, 2011|publisher=Gallup.com|accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 [[Gallup survey]] found the percentages that were pro-choice or pro-life were equal (at 48%), but more people considered abortion morally wrong (48%) than morally acceptable (43%). The poll results also indicated that Americans harbor a diverse and shifting set of opinions on the legal status of abortion in the United States. The survey found that only 29% of respondents believed abortion should be legal in all circumstances, and 50% of respondents believed that abortion should be legal under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jeffrey Jones |title=U.S. Abortion Attitudes Remain Closely Divided |url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/235445/abortion-attitudes-remain-closely-divided.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&amp;g_medium=TOPIC&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=U.S.%2520Abortion%2520Attitudes%2520Remain%2520Closely%2520Divided |publisher=Gallup |date=Jun 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent polling results also found that only 34% of Americans were satisfied with abortion laws in the United States.&lt;ref name="gallup.com3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx|title=Abortion &amp;#124; Gallup Historical Trends|date=|publisher=Gallup.com|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{Main|Abortion}}
The abortion debate most commonly relates to the "induced abortion" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician.

(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.

(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as "knowing destruction" or "intentional expulsion or removal".&lt;/ref&gt; Some also use the term "elective abortion", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one.

In medical parlance, "abortion" can refer to either miscarriage or abortion until the fetus is viable. After viability, doctors call an abortion a "termination of pregnancy".

When the United States first became independent, most states applied English [[common law]] to abortion. This meant it was not permitted after [[quickening (medical)|quickening]], or the start of [[fetal movement]]s, usually felt 15–20 weeks after conception.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Malcolm et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0632051639&amp;id=FHXtDkLzOHEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA8&amp;lpg=RA2-PA8&amp;ots=fkQG1qvn5i&amp;dq=%22quickening%22+and+obese&amp;num=100&amp;sig=-Xgmp3WR71poUh1qJ3oke-5XTOM#PRA2-PA8,M1 Essentials of Neonatal Medicine]'' (Blackwell 2000), page 8. Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortions became illegal by statute in Britain in 1803, and various anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the United States in the 1820s that codified or expanded common law. In 1821, a [[Connecticut]] law targeted [[apothecary|apothecaries]] who sold "poisons" to women for purposes of inducing an abortion, and [[New York (state)|New York]] made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor in 1829. Some argue that the early American abortion laws were motivated not by ethical concerns about abortion but by concern about the procedure's safety. However, some legal theorists point out that this theory is inconsistent with the fact that abortion was punishable regardless of whether any harm befell the pregnant woman and the fact that many of the early laws punished not only the doctor or abortionist, but also the woman who hired them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Suzanne M. |last1=Alford |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1011 |title=Is Self-Abortion a Fundamental Right? |volume=52 |journal=Duke Law Journal |pages=1011–29 |issue=5 |year=2003 |jstor=1373127 |pmid=12964572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of anti-abortion laws in the United States. [[Physicians]], who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge.  Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. Moreover, [[quickening]] was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.&lt;ref name="Mohr3536"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C. Mohr|year=1978|pages=35–36|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologically, the [[Hippocratic Oath]] and the medical mentality of that age to defend the [[sanctity of life|value of human life]] as an absolute also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion.&lt;ref name="Mohr3536"/&gt; Doctors were also influenced by practical reasons to impose [[abortion law|anti-abortion laws]]. For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these "irregulars" were considered a nuisance to public health.&lt;ref name="Mohr34"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C. Mohr|year=1978|page=34|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more formalized medical profession disliked the "irregulars" because they were competition, often at a cheaper cost.

Despite campaigns to end the practice of abortion, abortifacient advertising was highly effective in the [[United States]], though less so across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates in the United States suggest between 20-25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended in abortion.&lt;ref name="Mohr7682"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C. Mohr|year=1978|pages=76–82|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions. Before the start of the 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant [[out of wedlock]]. Out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and well over 60% of the married women already had at least one child.&lt;ref name="Mohr100101"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C. Mohr|year=1978|pages=100–101|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense that married women were now frequently obtaining abortions worried many conservative physicians, who were almost exclusively men. In the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War era]], much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning [[women's rights movement]].

Though the medical profession expressed hostility toward feminism, many feminists of the era were opposed to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Sarah Barringer.

[...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed.

Mohr|year=1978|page=110|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the "free love" wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate for abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women.&lt;ref name="Mohr112"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C. Mohr|year=1978|page=112|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195026160}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marital rape]] and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women's right to [[abstinence]].&lt;ref name="Mohr112"/&gt;

However, physicians remained the loudest voice in the anti-abortion debate, and they carried their anti-feminist agenda to state legislatures around the country, advocating not only anti-abortion laws, but also laws against birth control. This movement presaged the modern debate over women's body rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=B|title=Population control I: Birth of an ideology. |journal=International Journal of Health Services|year=1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=523–40|pmid=9285280|doi=10.2190/bl3n-xajx-0yqb-vqbx}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign was launched against the movement and the use and availability of [[contraceptive]]s.

Criminalization of abortion accelerated from the late 1860s, through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/abortionuslegal/a/abortion.htm |title=Abortion History: A History of Abortion in the United States |accessdate=2006-07-07 |last=Lewis |first=Jone Johnson |work=Women's History section of About.com|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, [[Anthony Comstock]] created the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], an institution dedicated to supervising the [[morality]] of the public. Later that year, Comstock successfully influenced the United States Congress to pass the [[Comstock Law]], which made it illegal to deliver through the U.S. mail any "obscene, lewd, or lascivious" material. It also prohibited producing or publishing information pertaining to the procurement of [[abortion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; or the prevention of [[birth control|conception]] or [[venereal disease]], even to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/anthonycomstockh00bennuoft#page/1017/mode/1up Anthony Comstock: His Career of Cruelty and Crime A Chapter from "Champions of the Church".

In 1900, abortion was a felony in every state. Some states included provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances, generally to protect the woman's life or to terminate pregnancies arising from rape or incest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/social.issues/papers/AbortGrI.html|title = A Political, Public &amp; Moral Look at Abortion|date = February 28, 2006|access-date = February 16, 2016|website = New York University|publisher = New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions continued to occur, however, and became increasingly available.

=== Sherri Finkbine ===
One notable case dealt with a woman named [[Sherri Finkbine]]. Born in the area of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Sherri had 4 very healthy children. However, during her pregnancy with her 5th child, she had found that the child had many different deformities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://advocatesaz.org/2012/08/15/sherri-finkbines-abortion-its-meaning-50-years-later/|title=Sherri Finkbine’s Abortion: Its Meaning 50 Years Later|date=2012-08-15|work=Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherri had been taking sleeping pills that contained a drug called [[Thalidomide]] which was also very popular throughout several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/thalidomide-the-connectio_b_8881702.html|title=Thalidomide: The Connection Between a Statue in Trafalgar Square, a 1960s Children's Show Host and the Abortion Debate|last=Braun|first=Whitny|date=2015-12-29|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had later learned that this specific drug was actually causing the fetal deformities and she wanted to warn the general public. Finkbine strongly wanted an abortion, however the [[abortion law]]s of Arizona limited her decision. In Arizona, an abortion could only occur if the mother's life was in danger. She met with a reporter from ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' and told her story. While Sherri Finkbine wanted to be kept anonymous, the reporter disregarded this idea. On August 18, 1962, Finkbine traveled to [[Sweden]] in order to continue with the abortion, as the laws applied for her in that location. It was later determined, during the time at which she had the abortion, that the child would have been very much deformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/body-health/reproduction/|title=Click - Debating Reproductive Rights - Reproductive Rights and Feminism, History of Abortion Battle, History of Abortion Debate, Roe v. Wade and Feminists|website=www.cliohistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherri Finkbine's story marks a turning point for women as well as the history of abortion laws occurring in the United States.  Sherri Finkbine, unlike many other women was able to afford going overseas to have the abortion. However, for the women who have pregnancies that are actually unintended, they may not be able to afford traveling, leading them to seek more [[Illegal abortion|illegal forms of abortion]].

===Pre-''Roe'' precedents===
In 1964, [[Gerri Santoro]] of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as "[[Jane Collective|Jane]]" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find "Jane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' struck down one of the remaining contraception Comstock laws in [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]]. However, Griswold only applied to marital relationships. ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' (1972) extended its holding to unmarried persons as well. Following the ''Griswold case'', the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) issued a [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy#How the Controversy Began|medical bulletin]] accepting a recommendation from 6 years earlier which clarified that conception is implantation, not fertilization; and consequently [[birth control]] methods that prevented implantation became classified as [[contraceptive]]s, not [[abortifacients]].

In 1967, [[Colorado]] became the first state to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical [[disability]] of the woman. Similar laws were passed in [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[North Carolina]]. In 1970, [[Hawaii]] became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Medicine: Abortion on Request | date=March 9, 1970 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878789,00.html | accessdate=2012-10-15}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Similar laws were soon passed in [[Alaska]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In 1970, Washington held a referendum on legalizing early pregnancy abortions, becoming the first state to legalize abortion through a vote of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/5313|title=Abortion Reform in Washington State - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law in [[Washington, D.C.]], which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman, was challenged in the Supreme Court in 1971 in ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]''. The court upheld the law, deeming that "health" meant "psychological and physical well-being", essentially allowing abortion in Washington, D. C. By the end of 1972, 13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while [[Mississippi]] allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and [[Alabama]] and [[Massachusetts]] allowed abortions only in cases where the woman's physical health was endangered. In order to obtain abortions during this period, women would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to states where it was legal. The legal position prior to ''Roe v. Wade'' was that abortion was illegal in 30 states and legal under certain circumstances in 20 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/22/charts-how-roe-v-wade-changed-abortion-rights/ |title=CHARTS: How Roe v.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. In 1966, the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]] assigned Monsignor [[James T. McHugh]] to document efforts to reform abortion laws, and anti-abortion groups began forming in various states in 1967. In 1968, McHugh led an advisory group which became the [[National Right to Life Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYZQBc9426QC&amp;pg=PA140 |page=140 |title=The Politics of Abortion and Birth Control in Historical Perspective |editor=Donald T.

===''Roe v. Wade''===
{{Main|Roe v. Wade}}
[[File:USSC justice group photo-1973 current.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[United States Supreme Court]] membership in 1973.]]
Prior to ''Roe v. Wade'', 30 states prohibited abortion without exception, 16 states banned abortion except in certain special circumstances (e.g., rape, incest, health threat to mother), 3 states allowed residents to obtain abortions, and New York allowed abortions generally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue Lessons from Before Roe: Will Past be Prologue?] The Guttmacher Policy Review, Vol. 6 Iss. 1, March 1, 2003. Retrieved 11 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. ''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion "must be considered against important state interests in regulation".&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roe'' established a "[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing "viability" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.

In deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:&lt;blockquote&gt;State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.

A central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer." Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, "the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a "compelling interest" in protecting "potential life" at the point of viability.

====''Doe v. Bolton''====
{{Main|Doe v. Bolton}}
Under ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', state governments may not prohibit [[Late termination of pregnancy|late terminations of pregnancy]] when "necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother", even if it would cause the demise of a viable fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=164|year=1973}} ("If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during [the third trimester], except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.")&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was clarified by the 1973 judicial decision ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', which specifies "that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors — physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age — relevant to the well-being of the patient".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Doe v.

====Jane Roe and Mary Doe====
"Jane Roe" of the landmark ''Roe v. Wade'' lawsuit, whose real name is [[Norma McCorvey]], became a pro-life advocate later in her life. McCorvey writes that she never had the abortion and became the "pawn" of two young and ambitious lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff who they could use to challenge the [[Texas]] state law prohibiting abortion. However, attorney Linda Coffee says she does not remember McCorvey having any hesitancy about wanting an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priestsforlife.org/testimony/mccorveycanoscheidlerinterview.htm An Interview with Norma McCorvey]. Ann Scheidler, Chicago Pro-life Action League. April 20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mary Doe" of the companion ''Doe v. Bolton'' lawsuit, the mother of three whose real name is Sandra Cano, maintains that she never wanted or had an abortion and that she is "ninety-nine percent certain that &lt;nowiki&gt;[she]&lt;/nowiki&gt; did not sign" the affidavit to initiate the suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endroe.org/media/3719/3canoaffidavit15.00.pdf Affidavit of Sandra Cano]. January 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later judicial decisions===
In the 1992 case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the Court abandoned ''Roe's'' strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion before viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to "[[strict scrutiny]]" — the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights. ''Casey'' instead adopted the lower,   [[undue burden]] standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}} ("(a) To protect the central right recognized by ''Roe v. Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.")&lt;/ref&gt; but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: "Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'."&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as "partial-birth abortion", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].

In the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions "facially" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.&lt;ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

==Current legal status{{anchor|Current_legal_situation}}==

===Federal legislation===
Since 1995, led by congressional [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of [[intact dilation and extraction]], commonly known as partial birth abortion. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined "health" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.

The [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] ("BAIPA") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A "born-alive infant" is specified as a "person, human being, child, individual". "Born alive" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.

On October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the Court's approach to abortion law.&lt;ref name="nyt-greenhouse"&gt;{{cite news | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse | work = The New York Times | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | date = April 19, 2007 | accessdate = January 3, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5-4 ruling said the ''Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act'' does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion.

The current judicial interpretation of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] regarding [[abortion]] in the [[United States]], following the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s 1973 landmark decision in ''Roe v. Wade'', and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state], LawServer&lt;/ref&gt;

The official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the [[Human Life Amendment]] (proposed by Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Thomas Eagleton]]), stated that

{{quote|Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Report, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3, 98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the [[fetus]] is "[[Fetal viability|viable]]" outside the womb as a measure of when the "life" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as "potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks. Advances over the past three decades have allowed fetuses that are a few weeks less than 24 weeks old to survive outside the woman's womb. These scientific achievements, while life-saving for premature babies, have made the determination of being "viable" somewhat more complicated.{{citation needed|reason=This controversial paragraph is unsourced.|date=December 2015}}

The legality of abortion in the United States is frequently a major issue in nomination battles for the U.S. Supreme Court. Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.

The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], commonly known as "[[Laci Peterson|Laci]] and Conner's Law" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-choice advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.

The [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Opponents of the bill reject the claims made by the bill's supporters regarding fetal development, and argue that such a restriction would endanger women's health.

==Statistics==
{{Main|Abortion statistics in the United States}}

Because reporting of abortions is not mandatory, statistics are of varying reliability. Both the [[Centers For Disease Control]] (CDC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/Data_Stats/Abortion.htm |title=CDCs Abortion Surveillance System FAQs |publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2012-11-21 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Guttmacher Institute]] regularly compile these statistics.

In the CDC graph below, much of the apparent sharp drop in abortions in 1995 is due to the fact that fewer states reported abortions to the CDC beginning in 1995.

===Number of abortions in United States===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
The annual number of legal induced abortions in the US doubled between 1973 and 1979, and peaked in 1990. There was a slow but steady decline throughout the 1990s. Overall, the number of annual abortions decreased by 6% between 2000 and 2009, with temporary spikes in 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D. Elam-Evans, Ph.D.|first=Laurie|title=Abortion Surveillance --- United States, 2000|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5212a1.htm|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, abortion rate in the nation dropped to its lowest point since the Supreme Court legalized the procedure. According to a study performed by Guttmacher Institute, long-acting contraceptive methods had a significant impact in reducing unwanted pregnancies. There were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women of child-bearing age. That was a 13%-decrease from 2008's numbers and slightly higher than the rate in 1973, when the Supreme Court's ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision legalized abortion. The study indicated a long-term decline in the abortion rate. The rate has dropped significantly from its all-time high in 1981, when there were roughly 30 abortions for every 1,000 women of reproductive age. The overall number of abortions also fell 13% from 2008 to nearly 1.1 million in 2011. In 2013, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] also reported a decline in abortion rates.&lt;ref name=Somashekhar&gt;{{cite news|last=Somashekhar|first=Sandhya|title=Study: Abortion rate at lowest point since 1973|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/study-abortion-rate-at-lowest-point-since-1973/2014/02/02/8dea007c-8a9b-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html?hpid=z2|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moon&gt;{{cite news|last=Moon|first=Angela|title=U.S. abortion rate hits lowest level since 1973: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/02/us-abortionrate-decline-idUSBREA110NV20140202|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite news|last=Bassett|first=Laura|title=U.S. Abortion Rate Hits Lowest Point Since 1973|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/02/abortion-rate-_n_4704986.html|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jayson&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|title=Abortion rate at lowest level since 1973|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/02/abortion-recession-medication/5087945/|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though abortion is legal these days, it can carry heavy social stigma; incidence of abortions may be difficult to measure because in medicine, they can be reported variously as miscarriage, "induced miscarriage", "menstrual regulation", "mini-abortion", and "regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation".&lt;ref name=Pandemic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/lancet_paper/en/

===Medical abortions===
A [[Guttmacher Institute]] survey of abortion providers estimated that early [[medical abortion]]s accounted for 17% of all non-hospital abortions and slightly over one-quarter of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones|first1=Rachel K.|last2=Kooistra|first2=Kathryn|date=March 2011 |title=Abortion incidence and access to services in the United States, 2008 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=43|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1363/4304111|pmid=21388504|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4304111.pdf}} 94% of non-hospital medical abortions used [[mifepristone]] and [[misoprostol]]—6% used [[methotrexate]] and [[misoprostol]]—in the United States in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical abortions voluntarily reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] by 34 reporting areas (excluding Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and published in its annual [[Abortion statistics in the United States|abortion surveillance reports]] have increased every year since the September 28, 2000 [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval of [[mifepristone]] (RU-486): 1.0% in 2000, 2.9% in 2001, 5.2% in 2002, 7.9% in 2003, 9.3% in 2004, 9.9% in 2005, 10.6% in 2006, 13.1% in 2007, 15.8% in 2008, 17.1% in 2009 (25.2% of those at less than 9 weeks gestation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pazol|first1=Karen|last2=Creanga|first2=Andreea A.|last3=Zane|first3=Suzanne B.|last4=Burley|first4=Kim D.|last5=Jamieson|first5=Denise J|last6=Division of Reproductive Health|date=November 23, 2012|title=Abortion surveillance - United States, 2009 |journal=MMWR Surveillance Summaries|volume=61|issue=8|pages=1–44|pmid=23169413|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6108.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical abortions accounted for 32% of first-trimester abortions at [[Planned Parenthood]] clinics in the United States in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fjerstad|first1= Mary|last2=Trussell|first2=James|last3=Sivin|first3=Irving|last4=Lichtenberg|first4=E.

===Abortion and religion===
Abortion is common among religiously identified women. According to the Guttmacher Institute, "more than 7 in 10 U.S. women obtaining an abortion report a religious affiliation (37% protestant, 28% Catholic, and 7% other), and 25% attend religious services at least once a month. The abortion rate for protestant women is 15 per 1,000 women, while Catholic women have a slightly higher rate, 22 per 1,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Rachel K|title=Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|date=June 2011|volume=117|issue=6|pages=1358–1366|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31821c405e|url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2011/06000/Changes_in_Abortion_Rates_Betweeen_2000_and_2008.14.aspx|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortions and ethnicity===
Abortion rates tend to be higher among minority women in the U.S. In 2000-2001, due to lower access to health care and contraception, the rates among black and Hispanic women were 49 per 1,000 and 33 per 1,000, respectively, vs. 13 per 1,000 among non-Hispanic white women. Note that this figure includes all women of reproductive age, including women that are not pregnant. In other words, these abortion rates reflect the rate at which U.S. women of reproductive age have an abortion each year.&lt;ref&gt;Guttmacher.org{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/characteristics.html |title=Get "In the Know": Questions About Pregnancy, Contraception and Abortion |accessdate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311171704/http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/characteristics.html |archivedate=2008-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While White women obtain 60% of all abortions, African American women are three times more likely to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108052648/http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html |date=January 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, New York City reported abortions (31,328) outnumber live births (24,758) for black children.

===When women have abortions (by gestational age)===
According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2011, most (64.5%) abortions were performed by ≤8 weeks' gestation, and nearly all (91.4%) were performed by ≤13 weeks' gestation. Few abortions (7.3%) were performed between 14–20 weeks' gestation or at ≥21 weeks' gestation (1.4%). From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of all abortions performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation increased 6%.

Leading up to the 40th anniversary of the ''[[Roe v.

[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] notes that abortion attitudes are shifting. Gallup declared in May 2010 that more Americans identifying as "pro-life" is "the new normal", while also noting that there had been no increase in opposition to abortion. It suggested that political polarization may have prompted more Republicans to call themselves "pro-life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saad |first=Lydia |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128036/New-Normal-Abortion-Americans-Pro-Life.aspx |title=The New Normal on Abortion: Americans More "Pro-Life" |publisher=Gallup |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "pro-choice" and "pro-life" do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life". The same poll found that 56% of Americans were in favor of legal access to abortion in all or some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By circumstance or reasons===
According to Gallup's long-time polling on abortion, the majority of Americans are neither strictly Pro-Life or Pro-Choice; it depends upon circumstances. Gallup polling from 1996 to 2009 consistently reveals that when asked the question, "Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances?", Americans repeatedly answer 'legal only under certain circumstances'. According to the poll, in any given year 48-57% say legal only under certain circumstances (for 2009, 57%), 21-34% say legal under any circumstances (for 2009, 21%), and 13-19% illegal in all circumstances (for 2009, 18%), with 1-7% having no opinion (for 2009, 4%).&lt;ref name="gallup1"/&gt;

According to the aforementioned poll,&lt;ref name="gallup1"/&gt; Americans differ drastically based upon situation of the pregnancy, suggesting they do not support unconditional abortions. Based on two separate polls taken May 19–21, 2003, of 505 and 509 respondents respectively, Americans stated their approval for abortion under these various circumstances:

&lt;CENTER&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Poll Criteria !! Total !! Poll A !! Poll B
|-
| When the woman's life is endangered || 78% || 82% || 75%
|-

|-
| When the child would be born with a life-threatening illness || 54% || 60% || 48%
|-
| When the child would be born mentally disabled || 44% || 50% || 38%
|-
| When the woman does not want the child for any reason || 32% || 41% || 24%
|}
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Another separate trio of polls taken by Gallup in 2003, 2000, and 1996,&lt;ref name="gallup1"/&gt; revealed public support for abortion as follows for the given criteria:

&lt;CENTER&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| When the woman or family cannot afford to raise the child || 35% || 34% || 32%

&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Gallup furthermore established public support for many issues supported by the Pro-Life community and opposed by the Pro-Choice community:&lt;ref name="gallup1"/&gt;

&lt;CENTER&gt;

| A law requiring that the husband of a married woman be notified if she decides to have an abortion || 64% || 72% || 70% || 73%
|}
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

An October 2007 [[CBS News]] poll explored under what circumstances Americans believe abortion should be allowed, asking the question, "What is your personal feeling about abortion?" The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="pollingreport" /&gt;

* A June 2000 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' survey found that, although 57% of polltakers considered abortion to be murder, half of that 57% believed in allowing women access to abortion. The survey also found that, overall, 65% of respondents did not believe abortion should be legal after the first trimester, including 72% of women and 58% of men. Further, the survey found that 85% of Americans polled supported abortion in cases of risk to a woman's physical health, 54% if the woman's mental health was at risk, and 66% if a congenital abnormality was detected in the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Allisa J.

* A January 2003 [[ABC News]]/''[[The Washington Post]]'' poll also examined attitudes towards abortion by gender. In answer to the question, "On the subject of abortion, do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases?", 25% of women responded that it should be legal in "all cases", 33% that it should be legal in "most cases", 23% that it should be illegal in "most cases", and 17% that it should be illegal in "all cases". 20% of men thought it should be legal in "all cases", 34% legal in "most cases", 27% illegal in "most cases", and 17% illegal in "all cases".&lt;ref name="publicagenda1"&gt;Public Agenda Online.

* An April 2006 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris]] poll on ''Roe v. Wade'', asked, "In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states' laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?", to which 49% of respondents indicated favor while 47% indicated opposition. The Harris organization has concluded from this poll that, "49 percent now support Roe vs. Wade".&lt;ref&gt;Harris Interactive, (2006-05-04).

===Partial birth abortion===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
"Partial-Birth abortion" is [[nomenclature]] for a procedure called [[intact dilation and extraction]] generally used by those who oppose the procedure. A [[Rasmussen Reports]] poll four days after the Supreme Court's opinion in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' found that 40% of respondents "knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures." Of those who knew of the decision, 56% agreed with the decision and 32% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2007/April%20Dailies/partialBirthAbortion.htm Most Who Know of Decision Agree With Supreme Court on Partial Birth Abortion] ''Rasmussen Reports''.

The abortion debate has also been extended to the question of who pays the medical costs of the procedure, with some states using the mechanism as a way of reducing the number of abortions. The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility, timing, and type of procedure. In 2005, a non-hospital abortion at 10 weeks' gestation ranged from $90 to $1,800 (average: $430), whereas an abortion at 20 weeks' gestation ranged from $350 to $4,520 (average: $1,260). Costs are higher for a medical abortion than a first-trimester surgical abortion.

===Medicaid===
The [[Hyde Amendment]] is a federal legislative provision barring the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except for rape and incest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hyde Amendment | publisher = National Committee for a Human Life Amendment | date = April 2008 | url = http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-01-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091116133030/http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf | archivedate = 2009-11-16 | df =}} text and history&lt;/ref&gt; The provision, in various forms, was in response to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976, and represented the first major legislative success by the [[pro-life movement]]. The law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Based on the federal law:
* 32 states and D. C. fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. SD covers abortions only in the cases of life endangerment, which does not comply with federal requirements under the Hyde Amendment. IN, UT, and WI have expanded coverage to women whose physical health is jeopardized, and IA, MS, UT, and VA also include fetal abnormality cases.
* 17 states (AK, AZ, CA, CT, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA, WV) use their own funds to cover all or most "medically necessary" abortions sought by low-income women under Medicaid, 13 of which are required by State court orders to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=Francis Roberta W.|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|work=Equal Rights Amendment|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private insurance===
* 5 states (ID, KY, MO, ND, OK) restrict insurance coverage of abortion services in private plans: OK limits coverage to life endangerment, rape or incest circumstances; and the other four states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment.
* 12 states (CO, IL, KY, MA, MS, NE, ND, OH, PA, RI, SC, VA) restrict abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees, with CO and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any circumstances.
* U.S. laws also ban federal funding of abortions for federal employees and their dependents, Native Americans covered by the Indian Health Service, military personnel and their dependents, and women with disabilities covered by Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/3269-02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Women's Health Policy Facts |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |publisher=The Henry J.

==Positions of U.S. political parties==
Though members of both major political parties come down on either side of the issue, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is often seen as being [[pro-life]], since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers unborn children to have an inherent right to life. [[Republicans for Choice]] represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 9% of Republicans favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances.&lt;ref name="zogby1"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603220555/http://www.zogby.com/search/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1060 |date=June 3, 2008 }} (archived from [http://www.zogby.com/search/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1060 the original] on 2008-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt; Of Republican National Convention delegates in 2004, 13% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 38% believed that it should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 17% of all Republican voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 38% believed that it should not be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/politics/20040829_gop_poll/2004_gop_results.pdf |title=The New York Times/CBS News Poll 2004 Republican National Delegate Survey (Q29)|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] platform considers abortion to be a woman's right. [[Democrats for Life of America]] represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 74% of Democrats favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances.&lt;ref name="zogby1"/&gt; However, a [[Zogby International]] poll in 2004 found that 43% of all Democrats believed that abortion "destroys a human life, and is manslaughter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zogby.com/soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=6982 |work=Zogby International |title=New National Abortion Poll Shows Majority of Americans are Pro-Life |date=16 January 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205031117/http://www.zogby.com/Soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=6982 |archivedate=2004-12-05 |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Democratic National Convention delegates in 2004, 75% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 2% believed that abortion should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 49% of all Democratic voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 13% believed that it should not be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/politics/20040724poll/20040724_delegates_poll_results.pdf |title=The New York Times/CBS News Poll 2004 Democratic National Delegate Survey (Q29)| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] of the United States supports legal abortion as a woman's right.

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] platform (2012) states that "government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lp.org/platform National Platform of the Libertarian Party, 1.4 Abortion], adopted in Convention, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is a [[libertarian perspectives on abortion|contentious issue]] among Libertarians, and the Maryland-based organization [[Libertarians for Life]] opposes the legality of abortion in most circumstances.

In the United States the abortion issue has become deeply politicized: in 2002, 84% of state [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] platforms supported the right to having an abortion while 88% of state [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] platforms opposed it. This divergence also led to [[Christian Right]] organizations like [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Moral Majority]] having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act: in 1973 [[Jesse Helms]] introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas, and in 1984 the [[Mexico City Policy]] prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions. The "Mexico City Policy" was revoked by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] and subsequently reinstated by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]]. President [[Barack Obama]] overruled this policy by Executive Order on January 23, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09012010.html|title=Obama to Immediately Abolish Mexico City Policy, Likely Fund Embryo Research, Aides Confirm|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-21|author=Gilbert, Kathleen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203653/http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/jan/09012010.html| archivedate= 22 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was reinstated on January 23, 2017, by President Donald Trump.

==Effects of legalization==
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Winter 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The 2013 winter issue of ''[[Ms. magazine]]'' was about abortion rights ]]
The risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since legalization in 1973, due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="BeforeAfter" /&gt; From 1940 through 1970, deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from nearly 1,500 to a little over 100.&lt;ref name="BeforeAfter"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490220075032 |title=Induced Termination of Pregnancy Before and After Roe v Wade: Trends in the Mortality and Morbidity of Women |year=1992 |last1=Coble |first1=Yank D. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=268 |issue=22 |page=3231}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of women who died in 1972 from illegal abortion was thirty-nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lilo T. |last1=Strauss |first2=Joy |last2=Herndon |first3=Jeani |last3=Chang |first4=Wilda Y. |last4=Parker |first5=Sonya V. |last5=Bowens |first6=Suzanne B. |last6=Zane |first7=Cynthia J. |last7=Berg |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |pmid=15562258 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5309a1.htm |year=2004 |last8=Berg |first8=CJ |title=Abortion surveillance--United States, 2001 |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roe effect]] is an hypothesis which suggests that since supporters of abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having fewer children, the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion. The [[legalized abortion and crime effect]] is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime, because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals.

Since Roe v Wade, there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision. In the 2011 election season, Mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion. The personhood amendment defined personhood as "every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof". If passed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in the state.&lt;ref name="Mississippi and Personhood"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/08/mississippi-personhood-amendment_n_1082546.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Mississippi 'Personhood' Amendment Vote Fails | date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2012, a Mississippi federal judge ordered an extension of his temporary order to allow the state's only abortion clinic to stay open. The order will stay in place until U.S. District Judge [[Daniel Porter Jordan III]] can review newly drafted rules on how the Mississippi Department of Health will administer a new abortion law. The law in question came into effect on July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Rich|title=Judge lets Mississippi's only abortion clinic stay open -- for now|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended live birth==
Although it is uncommon, women sometimes give birth in spite of an attempted abortion.&lt;ref name=RCOG_Term&gt;{{cite journal|title=Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality|journal=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|quote=" Live birth following medical termination of pregnancy before 21+6 weeks of gestation is very uncommon. Nevertheless, women and their partners should be counselled about this unlikely possibility and staff should be trained to deal with this eventuality. Instances of recorded live birth and survival increase as gestation at birth extends from 22 weeks. In accordance with prior RCOG guidance, feticide should be routinely offered from 21+6 weeks of gestation.Where the fetal abnormality is not compatible with survival, termination of pregnancy without prior feticide may be preferred by some women. In such cases, delivery management should be discussed and planned with the parents and all health professionals involved and a written care plan agreed before termination takes place. Where the fetal abnormality is not lethal and termination of pregnancy is being undertaken after 22 weeks of gestation, failure to perform feticide could result in live birth and survival, an outcome that contradicts the intention of the abortion. In such situations, the child should receive the neonatal support and intensive care that is in the child's best interest and its condition managed within published guidance for neonatal practice."|date=May 2010|page=30|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/terminationpregnancyreport18may2010.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guttmacher_Survival&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollander|first1=D.|title=For Second-Trimester Abortion, Women Given Misoprostol Vaginally Report the Greatest Satisfaction|quote="...Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of women in the vaginal misoprostol group, and a marginally higher proportion of those in the oral misoprostol group, than of those in the intra-amniotic prostaglandin group had a live birth (20%, 15% and 5%, respectively)...."|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, a publication of the Guttmacher Institute: Digests|date=May 2004|volume=36|issue=3|page=133|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3613304a.html|accessdate=26 October 2015|doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2004.tb00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopper|first1=Tristin|title=Birth of a legal quandry[sic]: Live-birth abortions a perilous grey zone in Canada's criminal code|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/born-alive-dead-in-moments-grey-zone-of-live-birth-abortions-a-deep-divide-between-mps-and-physicians|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=National Post|date=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada_Letter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vellacott|first1=Maurice|title=Letter to RCMP Commissioner Rob Paulson|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/563648/jan-23-letter-to-rcmp-request-to-investigate.pdf|website=www.straight.com|accessdate=26 October 2015|archiveurl=https://www.straight.com/blogra/348316/three-conservative-mps-beg-rcmp-examine-late-term-abortions-homicides|archive-date=31 January 2013|format=Letter|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Associated Press|title=Doctor loses license over live-birth abortion|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/doctor-loses-license-live-birth-abortion-article-1.392630|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeffries_1981&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Liz|title=Abortion|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-OCONNOR/pdf/GPO-CHRG-OCONNOR-5-5.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=2 August 1981|archiveurl=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/GPO-CHRG-OCONNOR/GPO-CHRG-OCONNOR-5-5|archivedate=9 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wyldes&amp;Tonks&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyldes|title=Termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly: a population-based study 1995 to 2004.|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|date=May 2007|volume=114|pages=639–642|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01279.x|pmid=17355269|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01279.x/full|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting of livebirth after attempted abortion may not be consistent from state to state, but 38 were recorded in one study in upstate New York in the two-and-a-half years before Roe v.

'''Administratium''' is a well-known [[in-joke]] in [[science|scientific]] circles and is a [[parody]] both on the [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s. 

In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]], making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spoof article was written by [[William DeBuvitz]] in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315075433/http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers; many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor's situation.

A similar joke concerns '''Administrontium''' which was referenced in print in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation on the same joke is '''Bureaucratium'''. A commonly heard description describes it as "having a negative [[half-life]]". In other words, the more time passes, the more massive "Bureaucratium" becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate, and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5057">The '''annual cycle of sea level height''' (or seasonal cycle or annual harmonic) describes the variation of sea level that occurs with a period of one year. Historically, analysis of the [[annual cycle]] has been limited by locations with tide gauge records, i.e., coastlines and some islands in the deep ocean, and by sparse records in the Southern Hemisphere. Since 1992, [[Altimeter#6|satellite-based altimeters]] have provided near global coverage of sea level variability, allowing for a more thorough understanding of the annual cycle both in the deep ocean and in coastal margins.

==Tide Gauge Era==
Prior to the introduction of satellite-based altimeters, sea level was measured by a network of tide gauges located along continental coastlines and some deep ocean islands. The first analysis of the annual cycle of sea level height on a global scale was done in 1955 by Pattullo ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Pattullo, J., W. Munk, R. Revelle, and E. Strong, 1955: The seasonal oscillation in sea level. ''[[Journal of Marine Research]]'', '''14''', 1, 88-113.&lt;/ref&gt; An update to this initial study was completed by Tsimplis and Woodworth in 1994&lt;ref name=tsimplis&gt;Tsimplis, M.N., and P.L. Woodworth, 1994: The global distribution of the seasonal sea level cycle calculated from coastal tide gauge data. ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', '''99''', 16031-16039.&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the satellite altimetry era. In general, [[amplitude]]s of the annual cycle are less than 150mm (6 inches) and are typically larger in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. Annual amplitudes also vary within ocean basins and along stretches of coastline. On the European side of the North Atlantic Ocean annual amplitudes generally increase from south to north, in contrast with the American side where annual amplitudes generally decrease from south to north. Similarly, on the American side of the North Pacific Ocean annual amplitudes generally increase from south to north (with increased amplitudes in the north likely linked to meteorological forcing), while the western side of the Pacific generally sees annual amplitudes decrease with increasing latitude.&lt;ref name=tsimplis/&gt;

Determining the exact cause of the annual cycle is difficult as there are several factors that influence the amplitude and timing of the annual cycle along the coast including winds, water temperature and salinity, local [[bathymetry]], coastal geometry, ocean currents, land movements, and river outflows.&lt;ref name=tsimplis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vinogradov, S.V., and R.M. Ponte, 2011: Low-frequency variability in coastal sea level from tide gauges and altimetry. ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', '''116''', C07006, doi:10.1029/2011JC007034.
&lt;/ref&gt; The largest amplitudes in the annual cycle are generally noted near areas with large river outflow such as along the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], and the [[Uruguay River|Rio Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=tsimplis/&gt;

==Satellite Altimetry Era==
Beginning in 1992 with the [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] mission (and continuing with [[Jason-1]] and [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission|Jason-2]]),&lt;ref&gt;NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 2012. ''Missions: TOPEX/Poseidon''. [online] Available at: http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/topex/&gt; [Accessed 14 November 2012].
&lt;/ref&gt; satellite based radar altimetry has been utilized to measure sea level height, enabling sea level height variability in the open ocean to be analyzed for the first time. As a result, it has been shown that there are significant differences in the phase and amplitude of the annual cycle between the deep ocean and coastal waters (less than 200m).&lt;ref name=vino2010&gt;Vinogradov, S.V., and R.M. Ponte, 2010: Annual cycle in coastal sea level from tide gauges and altimetry. ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', '''115''', C04021, doi:10.1029/2009JC005767.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, large amplitudes of the annual cycle occur near the coast, except in the vicinity of strong western boundary currents. The difference between coastal areas and the deep ocean is suggested to be the result of several physical factors including local and remote atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes, sharp gradients in wind and moisture along land/sea boundaries, and land motions with an annual oscillatory component from tidal or atmospheric loading.&lt;ref name=vino2010/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">{{For|the company Applied Semantics|AdSense#History}}'''Applied semantics''' is the study and application of [[semantics]] which have many uses, e.g. advertising, [[content analysis|text analysis]], web traffic of search engines, web page rankings, and the indexation of words. The term 'applied semantics' is widely considered to be first coined by Plantinga, where he distinguished the differences between "pure" and "applied" semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Copeland|first=B.J.|date=1983|title=Pure Semantics and Applied Semantics|url=|journal=Topoi|volume=2|pages=197-204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure semantics is defined as semantics in the purely theoretical (sometimes referred to as mathematical) sense, whereas applied semantics is defined as the practical use of semantics, such as assigning meanings to words or deducing entailments. Dummet summarizes the distinction by terming pure semantics as "the merely algebraic notion of logical consequence" and applied semantics as "the semantic notion of logical consequence properly so called".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dummett|first=M.A.E.|date=1973|title=The Justification of Deduction|url=|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|volume=59|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party''' (spelled "Ba'th" or "Baath", "resurrection" or "renaissance"; {{lang-ar|حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي}} ''Ḥizb Al-Ba'aṯ Al-'Arabī Al-Ištirākī''), also referred to as the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath movement, is a [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] [[political party]] which was headquartered in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] until 2003. It is one of two parties (with identical names) which emerged from the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état|1966 split]] of the original [[Ba'ath Party]].

In 1966, the original Ba'ath Party was split in half; one half was led by the [[Damascus]] leadership of the Ba'ath Party which [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|established a party in Syria]] and the other half with its leadership in Baghdad. Both Ba'ath parties retained the same name and maintained parallel structures in the [[Arab world]], but became so antagonistic that Syria—led by its [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]]—became the only Arab state to support [[Iran]] against Iraq during the bloody [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The Ba'athists [[Ramadan Revolution|seized power]] in Iraq for the first time in 1963, but were [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état|deposed]] several months later. The party's regional organisation governed Iraq between 1968 and 2003, for many years under the leadership of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region]] was banned in 2003 by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

===Organization===
Following the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]], which overthrew the Aflaqite faction led by [[Michel Aflaq]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], [[Munif al-Razzaz]] and others, the [[Ba'ath Party|original Ba'ath Party]] split into Iraqi-dominated and [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|a Syrian-dominated ba'ath movements]]. The two movements established separate National Commands; the National Command was in theory the highest party body in both movements and controlled their respective ba'athist movements. However, in both countries the National Command was under the control of its respective Regional Command. In the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath movement, all National Command members came from their regional branch—for instance, there was always a member representing the Ba'ath Party branch in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Metz, Helen Chapin |  pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=X4bt8oiR_50C&amp;pg=PA191 191–192] | title = Iraq: A Country Study  | location = | publisher = [[Kessinger Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4191-2671-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the National Command was the highest party organ between national congresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ali, Tariq |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=GKwJ7RhON3sC&amp;pg=PA106 106] | title = Bush in Babylon: The Recolonisation of Iraq | volume = | publisher = [[Verso Paper|Verso]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-84467-512-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the power to control the affairs of Regional Commands in other regions (countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Iraq|first1=Edmund A.|last1=Ghareeb|first2=Beth K.|last2=Dougherty|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Ltd|year=2004|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RIB5qT9sGnwC&amp;pg=PA192 192]|isbn= 978-0-8108-4330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates to a National Congress elected the members of the National Command, who were eligible for reelection. While the National Command had few ''[[de facto]]'' powers, many of its leading members also held seats in the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Regional Command]] and the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Iraq|first1=Edmund A.|last1=Ghareeb|first2=Beth K.|last2=Dougherty|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Ltd|year=2004|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RIB5qT9sGnwC&amp;pg=PA169 169]|isbn= 978-0-8108-4330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aflaq was elected Secretary-General of the National Command at the Ninth National Congress, held in February 1968 in Beirut, Lebanon, by the Iraqi-dominated  Ba'ath Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kostiner, Joseph | title = Conflict and Cooperation in the Gulf Region | publisher = VS Verlag | year = 1998 | isbn = 3-531-16205-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YQb1Ilj2U7EC&amp;pg=PA36 36]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his post until his death in 1989, when he was succeeded by [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moubayed, Sami M. |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC–xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347] | title = Steel &amp; Silk: Men and Women who shaped Syria 1900–2000 | publisher = Cune Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-885942-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Saddam was executed on 30 December 2006, [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]] became ''de facto'' leader of the Ba'ath Party on 3 January 2007. As Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, he is the highest-ranked surviving member of the former Ba'ath party.

===Egypt===
{{main|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Egypt Region}}
The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Egypt Region ({{lang-ar|حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي- مصر}} ''Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-Arabi Al-Ishtiraki – Misr'') is an active branch in Egypt.

The party supports the removing of [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria, although calls for no foreign intervention in the [[Syrian Civil War|conflict]], whether by Israel, Turkey or Iran, as the party believes all such countries have ulterior motives and seek to undermine Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The statement of the Arab Baath Socialist Party of Egyptian on the aggression against Syria |url=http://www.aladhwaa.net/?ac=3&amp;no=6445&amp;d_f=10&amp;t_f=0&amp;t=5&amp;lang_in=Ar |newspaper=Aladhwaa |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was outlawed in the early 1990s and two Iraqi Intelligence Officials were detained on 14 April 1991 with $38,000 in their possession, money which the Egyptian authorities claimed was to be used to fund sabotage operations in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Iraqi Plotters Detained |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19910414&amp;id=GsFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VZADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4831,5537593 |newspaper=New Strait Times |date=15 April 1991 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Egyptian Ba'athists, including the poet [[Muhammad Afifi Matar]], were also detained in April 1991 on suspicion of involvement in an Iraqi terrorist plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mickolus |first=Edward F. |title=The Terrorist List: The Middle East, Volume 1 A-K |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dj_UiuHRT1IC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;dq=afifi+matar#v=onepage&amp;q=afifi%20matar&amp;f=false Edward Mickolus, 2009 |accessdate= |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location= |isbn= |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ba'athist organizations emerged in the leadership of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in the 1970s, with pro-Baghdad and pro-Damascus groups competing for political dominance over the front. This split contributed to the downfall of the ELF and the emergence of the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] as the dominant liberation movement.&lt;ref name="Weldemichael2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Awet Tewelde Weldemichael|title=Third World Colonialism and Strategies of Liberation: Eritrea and East Timor Compared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4ctMMpBfFkC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03123-4|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key pro-Iraqi Ba'athist was Abdel Gadir Jeilani, who became the leader of the ELF-PLF-Revolutionary Council in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Waal1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander De Waal|title=Evil Days: Thirty Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcVFXUwraxsC&amp;pg=PA252|year=1991|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=978-1-56432-038-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
{{main|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region}}
In Iraq, the Ba'ath party remained a civilian group and lacked strong support from the military. The party had little impact and the movement split into several factions after 1958 and again in 1966. The movement was reported to have lacked strong popular support,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]], London, 24–30 June 1978, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; but through the construction of a strong party apparatus the party succeeded in gaining power. The Iraqi-based party was originally committed to pan-Arabism (like its Syrian counterpart). After taking power in 1968, the party adopted [[Iraqi nationalism]] and encouraging [[Iraqis]] to identify themselves as cultural heirs of Mesopotamia with a medieval-Islamic identity.&lt;ref name="Motyl"&gt;Alexander J. Motyl. ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism: Leaders, Movements, and Concepts, Volume II''. Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam Hussein sought to be seen as leader of a great, neo-Mesopotamian Iraqi nation by having himself compared to [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and [[Hammurabi]].&lt;ref name="Motyl"/&gt;

In June 2003, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) banned the Ba'ath party. The additional step the CPA took—banning all members of the top four tiers of the Ba'ath Party from the new government, [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] and colleges—was criticized for blocking too many experienced people from participation in the new government. Thousands were removed from their positions, including doctors, professors, schoolteachers and bureaucrats. Many teachers lost their jobs, sparking protests at schools and universities. Under previous Ba'ath-party rule, one could not reach a high position in the government or a school without becoming a party member and party membership was a prerequisite for university admission. While many Ba'athists joined for ideological reasons, many more were members because it was a way to better their options. Following pressure by the United States, the policy of [[de-Ba'athification]] was addressed by the Iraqi government in January 2008 with its controversial [[Accountability and Justice Act]]. This purported to ease the policy, but many feared it would lead to further dismissals.&lt;ref name='Washington Post 2008-01-12'&gt;{{cite news | first=Amit R. | last=Paley |author2=Joshua Partlow | title=Iraq's New Law on Ex-Baathists Could Bring Another Purge | date=23 January 2008 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/22/AR2008012203538.html | pages = | accessdate = 26 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba'ath Party is led by Saddam's former deputy [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]].

Since the establishment of the authoritarian political systems in Iraq and Syria, the popularity of the Ba'ath Party has waned, but Ba'athist ideology remains popular.&lt;ref name="baathbaathismjordan"/&gt; The reason being that both Ba'ath parties (the pro-Iraqi and the pro-Syrian) have replaced ideology with blind allegiance to [[Saddamism|Saddamist discourse]] or the [[al-Assad family|al-Assad rule]].&lt;ref name="baathbaathismjordan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=05AMMAN7597&amp;q=baath |title= The Baath Party In Jordan: Short On Funds And Members Madaba |publisher=[[Cablegate]] |date=22 September 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jordanese academic, talking to the American embassy in Amman, Jordan, said that "there are far more real Baathists outside the party than inside", noting that the present party is downplaying (and even replacing) ideological components to get more followers.&lt;ref name="baathbaathismjordan"/&gt;

The party was able to gain some support in the 1990s because of its status as a Ba'ath Party branch and it was able to help finance thousands of scholarships to Iraqi universities.&lt;ref name="baathbaathismjordan"/&gt; However, with the 2003 invasion of Iraq the party was nearly forced into bankruptcy and lost most of its followers when it failed to finance the return of students from Iraq.&lt;ref name="baathbaathismjordan"/&gt;

In a 1995 poll, 16.8 percent of Jordanians said they were aware that the Iraqi Ba'ath branch existed, making the Ba'ath branch the third-best-known political party in Jordan (surpassing the [[Ba'ath Arab Progressive Party]], the Syrian Ba'athist branch, by over 10 percent in the poll).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Staff writer]] |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=v49mVUoTHMoC&amp;pg=PA120 120] | title = Jordan in Transition | location = | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-312-29538-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 it was estimated that the party had less than 200 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=03AMMAN2989&amp;q=ba-th |title= Jordan's Political Parties: Islamists, Leftists, Nationalists And Centrists |publisher=[[Cablegate]] |date=20 May 2003 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Cablegate]] document dating back to 2007, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party figure Ahmed Al Dmour was considered one of the biggest threats to [[Islamic Action Front]] dominance on the political scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=07AMMAN3162&amp;q=ba-ath |title=Jordanian Municipal Elections: The Islamist - Government Showdowns In Irbid, Karak, And Madaba |publisher=[[Cablegate]] |date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is presently known as the Socialist Arab Lebanon Vanguard Party ({{lang-ar|حزب طليعة لبنان العربي الاشتراكي|rtl=yes}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|Hizb Al-Taliyeh Lubnan Al-'Arabi Al-Ishtiraki}}).

However, the existence of the pro-Iraqi Lebanese branch of the Ba'ath party has much longer roots.

Kabry Ould Taleb Jiddou, the party's leader, was awarded the office of Secretary of State by the newly elected government because of his electoral campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Banks, Arhur S. |author2=Muller, Thomas |author3=Overstreet, William |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXU_CplFBLYC&amp;q=%22baathist%22+Pag&amp;dq=%22baathist%22+Pag&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kQjQTofcFcnk4QSX8LlV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA 848] | title = Political Handbook of the World 2008  | volume = | publisher = [[CQ Press]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-87289-528-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The branch supports full [[Arabisation]] of the country, a view considered racist by critics. Ould Haidalla introduced an anti-ba'athist policy which continued under his successor, [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]]. However, the Mauritanian government supported Iraq during the [[Gulf War]] and Iraq–Mauritania relations became so close that (inaccurate) rumours circulated internationally that Saddam's family had taken refuge in the country following the American invasion. Repression against the ba'athists has not been reduced. In 2003, several ba'athists were jailed on suspicion of trying to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name="ME"&gt;{{cite book | author = Seddon, David |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qmYMy1Ls8ucC&amp;pg=PA87 87] | title = A Political and Economic Dictionary of the Middle East  | volume = | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-85743-212-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for the close relationship between Iraq and Mauritania was the strength of the Mauritanian ba'athist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas, Caroline |author2=Wilkin, Peter |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8MrsaMgILsC&amp;pg=PA114 114] | title = Globalization, Human Security, and the African Experience  | volume = | publisher = [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-55587-699-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was banned in 1999 following the restoration of bilateral relations with [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=East, Roger |author2=Thomas, Richard |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz–fXRsedPMC&amp;pg=PA345 345] | title = Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders  | volume = | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85743-126-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Vanguard Party was accused of developing plans in collaboration with the Iraqi government to foment unrest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Banks, Arhur S. |author2=Muller, Thomas |author3=Overstreet, William |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?ei=7_bPTouNCqzQ4QSe8uQf&amp;ct=result&amp;id=vXU_CplFBLYC&amp;dq=%22national+vanguard+party%22+mauritania+baath&amp;q=%22national+vanguard+party%22#search_anchor 848] | title = Political Handbook of the World 2008  | volume = | publisher = [[CQ Press]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-87289-528-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Ould Abdellahi Ould Eyye, the party's leader, was arrested in 2003 after a large anti-government protest demanding that the government break off relations with Israel and the United States and aid Saddam Hussein.

A disorganised pro-Iraqi Ba'ath guerilla movement existed before the establishment of the [[Arab Liberation Front]] (ALF).&lt;ref name="alrazzaz"&gt;{{cite book | author = Anderson, Bette Signe |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=HXNnEkLRtSoC&amp;pg=PA203 203] | title = Nationalist Voices in Jordan: The Street and the State  | volume = | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-292-70625-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ALF was established in 1969 at a National Congress of the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath Party to weaken the hold [[al-Sa'iqa]], the pro-Syrian Ba'ath organisation in Palestine had over the ba'athist movement. In contrast to al-Sa'iqa, the ALF never had access to a large recruitment pool. There were few Palestinians in Iraq, and the Palestinians living in Iraq were generally well-educated. Because of this, ALF could not and would never have the same degree of influence over the Palestinian movement as al-Sa'iqa did. This caused the ALF to be controlled by the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement, thus weakening its effectiveness and influence, but saving it from infighting between [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinianists]] and Ba'athists (a problem in al-Sa'iqa). However, the ALF's influence weakened periodically during its history due to infighting in the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement. Because of the control the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement had over the ALF, the ALF always held a pro-Iraqi position in the [[Palestinian Liberation Front]] (PLO). The ALF was a founding member of the [[Rejectionist Front]] in 1974, rejecting the [[PLO's Ten Point Program]]. Abdel-Wahhab Kayyali (a member of the [[Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO Executive Committee]]) froze his seat on the committee&lt;!--What does this mean?--&gt; in protest, instead of following the example (resignation) of the Rejectionist Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cobban, Helena |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=wwntdx2IFAEC&amp;pg=PA163 163] | title = The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power, and Politics  | volume = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-521-27216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Palestinians generally believe in [[pan-Arabism]], [[Arab nationalism]] and [[socialism]] (principles of the ALF), they have generally opted for the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cobban, Helena |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=wwntdx2IFAEC&amp;pg=PA164 164] | title = The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power, and Politics  | volume = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-521-27216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[invasion of Iraq]] toppled the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath Party, headquartered in Baghdad. This weakened the movement and since the [[Iraqi military]] coordinated much of the ALF's activities the ALF has also been considerably weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Baracskay, Daniel |  page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=UIJDreLroswC&amp;pg=PA58 58] | title = The Palestine Liberation Organization: Terrorism and Prospects for Peace in the Holy Land  | volume = | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-313-38151-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALF's first leader was Zaid Haydar from the Jordanian Ba'ath branch. Other leaders include [[Munif al-Razzaz]], Abd al-Rahim Ahmad and Mahmud Isma'il. Most recently, it was led by [[Rakad Salem]] and headquartered in [[Ramallah]], [[West Bank]]. [[Israeli Defence Forces]] arrested Salem in October 2002.&lt;ref name="ALFleader"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Matter, Philip |author2=Fischbach, Michael |  pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA51 51–52] | title = Encyclopedia of the Palestinians  | volume = | publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8160-5764-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahir Abu Shahut, former leader of the Jordanian Ba'ath branch, led the Ba'ath branch in Palestine from 1970 to 1975 from Baghdad.&lt;ref name="alrazzaz"/&gt;

===Sudan===
{{Main|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Region of Sudan}}
The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Country of Sudan is the regional branch of the Ba'ath Party in Sudan. Kamal Bolad was the Regional Secretary in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lain, Donald Ray |pages=58–60 |title=Dictionary of the African Left: Parties, Movements and Groups |publisher=[[Dartmouth College Press|Dartmouth]] |year=1989 |isbn=1-85521-014-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taiseer Mutassir was the Regional Secretary in 1990.&lt;ref name="baathsudanbaath"/&gt; While the branch has always been small, accounting for an estimated 1,000 members in 2003, it has been able to have a bigger impact than what its meager membership numbers would suggest, mostly due to Iraqi financing of the branch.&lt;ref name="baathreturniraq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=03KHARTOUM374&amp;q=ba-ath |title= Return Of Sudanese Ba'athists |publisher=[[Cablegate]] |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After collaborating with the Arab nationalist Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990—this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-mBF9tAeGQC&amp;pg=PA210 210]|title= Darfur and the International Community: The Challenges of Conflict Resolution in Sudan|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|author=Barltrop, Richard|isbn= 978-1-84511-977-5|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in [[Ba'athist Iraq]].&lt;ref name="baathsudanbaath"/&gt; The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, was opposed to the [[National Islamic Front]] and was staunchly [[secularism|secularist]].&lt;ref name="baathsudanbaath"/&gt; Members have historically been torn between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the [[Sudanese Communist Party|Sudanese communists]].&lt;ref name="baathsudanbaath"/&gt; Because of Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]], the body ruling Sudan, the Ba'ath branched was oppressed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="baathsudanbaath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=90KHARTOUM3477&amp;q=baath |title= Sudan And The Arabs: Possibly Step-sisters; Certainly Not Brothers |publisher=[[Cablegate]] |date=1 April 1990 |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in [[Khartoum]] after a failed military coup.&lt;ref name="baathreturniraq"/&gt; In 2002, a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein broke away from the branch and established the independent [[Sudanese Ba'ath Party]], which has no affiliation with neither the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement nor the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudanvisiondaily.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1100 |title=Wide Reactions to Jadein Group Statement by Baathists |work=Sudan Vision Daily |accessdate=26 February 2012 |date=April 10, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118112036/http://www.sudanvisiondaily.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1100 |archivedate=18 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, after the invasion of Iraq 80 Sudanese Ba'athists return to Sudan under the condition that they would stay out of politics.&lt;ref name="baathreturniraq"/&gt;

===Tunisia===
{{main|Tunisian Ba'ath Movement}}
The first Ba'athist branch in Tunisia, then under the [[Ba'ath Party|unified Ba'ath Party]], was established in 1955, but the Ba'ath Party was outlawed under [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]]. Following the [[Tunisian Revolution]],&lt;ref name="founding"/&gt; the Tunisian Ba'ath Movement ({{lang-ar|حركة البعث التونسي}} ''Haraket Al-Ba'ath Al-Tounisi''; [[French language|French]]: ''Mouvement Baath tunisien'') was established at its First Congress on 3–5 June 2011 and legally registered on 22 January 2011.&lt;!--Should this be 2012?--&gt; However, ba'athists have been active in underground politics since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="underground"/&gt; The Ba'ath Movement celebrated the fifth anniversary of the [[execution of Saddam Hussein|death]] of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Omar Othman Belhadj, Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of the Ba'ath Movement, said that "Hussein’s execution was symbolic, they did not kill a person but rather the ideas he represented and fought for. Hussein was killed for being against colonization and for being a defender of Arab unity and independence of Arab countries". He further noted that he did not support killing [[Muammar Gaddafi]], saying that Gaddafi had a right to a fair trial like anyone else.&lt;ref name="underground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/01/04/tunisian-baath-party-celebrates-5th-anniversary-of-saddam-husseins-death/|publisher=Tunisia-live.net|title=Tunisian Baath Party Celebrates 5th Anniversary of Saddam Hussein’s Death|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=19 February 2012|author=Ajmi, Sana|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310042933/http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/01/04/tunisian-baath-party-celebrates-5th-anniversary-of-saddam-husseins-death/|archive-date=2012-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee predicted that the Syrian ambassador's expulsion would militarise the conflict, mobilising Arab opinion against the government and leading to military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201202062108.html|publisher=AllAfrica.com|title= Tunisia: Baath Party Condemns President's Decision to Expel Syrian Ambassador|author=Ajmi, Sana|date=5 February 2012|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution, the Arab Democratic Vanguard Party emerged as second "Iraqi" Baathist Party in Tunisia.

The party carried out clandestine political activity until 1990 and was registered as the National Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party on 10 February 1997. It had initially sought to register as the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1995, but that name was given by the authorities to the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Yemen Region|pro-Syria Ba'athist party]].&lt;ref name="nic"&gt;{{cite web| author = [[Staff writer]] | publisher= National Information Center.

The party contested the [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 1993|1993 parliamentary election]] in alliance with the pro-Syrian Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, winning seven seats. After the election, relations between the two Ba'athist groups soured and they contested further elections separately. The party contested the [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]] (failing to win any seats) and called for a boycott of the [[Yemeni presidential election, 1999|1999 presidential election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''Björn Ambrosiani''' (born 8 March 1928) is a Swedish archaeologist and former civil servant. He worked at the [[Swedish History Museum]] and the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]], as a research director among other positions.

Ambrosiani led a number of excavations at different sites. In the 1960s he led the excavations at Henriksdalsberget, and from 1969–71 and again from 1990–95 he was responsible for excavations of the Viking-age trading center [[Birka]]. The first project was the first at Birka since that led by [[Hjalmar Stolpe]] in the 1870s.

'''Cacaxtla''' ({{IPA-nah|kaˈkaʃtɬaːn}}) is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site located near the southern border of the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Tlaxcala]]. It was a sprawling palace containing vibrantly colored murals painted in unmistakable Maya style. The nearby site of Xochitecatl was a more public ceremonial complex associated with Cacaxtla. Cacaxtla and Xochitecatl prospered 650-900 CE, probably controlling important trade routes through the region with an enclave population of no more than 10,000 people.

==History==
Cacaxtla was the capital of region inhabited by the [[:es:Olmeca-xicalanca|Olmeca-Xicalanca]] people.  The origins of the Olmeca-Xicalanca are not known with certainty, but they are assumed to come from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] region, and were perhaps [[Maya civilization|Maya]] settlers who arrived in this part of central Mexico around 400 CE.

The term "Olmeca-Xicalanca"  was first mentioned by Tlaxcalan historian [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]] at the end of the 16th century. This historian described Cacaxtla as the principal settlement of the “Olmeca”, although what we today refer to as the Olmec culture ended ~400 [[Common Era|BCE]], that is, almost 800 years earlier.

After the fall of the nearby city [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] (ca. 650 - 750) — in which the ''Cacaxtlecas'' might have been involved — Cacaxtla became the hegemonic power in this part of the Tlaxcala&amp;ndash;Puebla valley. Warriors from Cacaxtla appear to have taken over Cholula for a time, but they were ultimately expelled by the Toltecs. Its ascendancy came to an end around 900 CE and, by 1000, the city had been abandoned.

===Modern history of the site===
The site was rediscovered in 1974 by looters, but quickly came to the attention of archaeologists that same year.
Archaeologists Eduardo Merlo Juárez, Diana Lopez-Sotomayor and Daniel Molina-Feal dedicated over six years of their life excavating the site. The first work to be done in the area consisted on clearing the original tunnel opened by the looters, Archeologist Diana Lopez-Sotomayor, later appointed project manager, recalled her first view of the life-sized characters depicted in the murals as an overwhelming experience. As further figures appeared on the mural, the area of excavation had to be enlarged and several constructive stages were discovered. The first area to be excavated was the main mural, known as the "Gran Basamento", and the immediate purpose of the work was to protect and secure the murals and other structures from the weather and looters.

==The Site==
[[File:Cacaxtla pyramid mound no. 1.jpg|thumb|Cacaxtla pyramid mound no. 1]]

The centre of the city of Cacaxtla was the 200-metre-long, 25-metre-high ''Gran Basamento''  &amp;ndash; a natural platform offering a fine defensive position and commanding views over the surrounding terrain. The city's main religious and civil buildings were located on this platform, as were the residences of the priest class. Several other smaller pyramids and temple bases stand in the vicinity of the main platform.

Because Cacaxtla's main ''basamento'' was not excavated until the 1980s, many of the original coloured wall decorations have been preserved and can be appreciated [[in situ#Archaeology|in situ]] by visitors to the site. Of particular interest is the fact that most of the murals seem to combine the symbology of  [[Altiplano]] cultures with influences from the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], making Cacaxtla unique in this regard.

==Battle Mural (Mural de la Batalla)==
The most famous of Cacaxtla's preserved paintings is the "Battle Mural", or ''Mural de la batalla'', located in the northern plaza of the ''basamento''. Dating from prior to 700, it is placed on the sloping limestone wall of  a temple base and is split in two by a central staircase. It depicts two groups of warriors locked in battle: 
on the one side are jaguar warriors, armed with spears, obsidian knives, and round shields, who are locked in battle with an army of bird warriors (some of whom are shown naked and in various stages of dismemberment).

[[File:Cacaxtla Battle Mural (right).jpg|center|thumb|500px|Cacaxtla Battle Mural (right)]]

==Priestly Attire (Vestidos de Sacerdotes)==
Cacaxtla conserves the oldest mural painting featuring a human figure and symbols from other cultures (Teotihuacan, Maya, Mixtec and Totonac). These paintings portray the bird man and the feline man, possibly ruler - priests of the Olmecs Xicalancas who inhabited Cacaxtla between the years 600 and 900 AD. The bird man is associated with Quetzalcoatl, the generous deity who taught people the arts and agriculture. The feline man is associated with the rains that fertilize the earth.

[[File:VestidosDeSacerdotes(Hombre-Felino).jpg|thumb|150px|Feline Man (Hombre - felino)]]

==Venus Temple (Templo de Venus)==
The Venus Temple that is also located underneath the roof contains two murals on two columns of two figures. On the right column, there is a male figure with a mask covering his face. He wears a skirt with the Venus symbol on the front and has a scorpion tail. On the left, a fragment of the other figure is visible, probably representing a woman with a skirt also bearing a Venus symbol. The presence of Venus on the garments of the figures and their representation around both of them indicate that the murals allude to some astronomical phenomenon or calendrical data associated with the planet Venus, which at that time was related to warfare and sacrifice.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Mural del Templo Rojo==
The Mural del Templo Rojo is located at the Governors' Room (Las Habitactiones de los Gobernantes). It is located in the staircase leading to the room, and only one side is visible to the public. The other side of the staircase is not facing a public walkway, but is displayed as a reproduction in the corresponding museum building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20538">{{about|the musical genre|Robert Wyatt album|Comicopera}}
'''Comic opera''' denotes a sung dramatic work of a light or comic nature, usually with a happy ending.

Forms of comic opera first developed in late 17th-century Italy. By the 1730s, a new operatic genre, ''[[opera buffa]]'', emerged as an alternative to ''[[opera seria]]''. It quickly made its way to France, where it became ''[[opéra bouffon]]'', and eventually, in the following century, [[Operetta#Operetta in French|French ''operetta'']], with [[Jacques Offenbach]] as its most accomplished practitioner.

The influence of the Italian and French forms spread to other parts of Europe. Many countries developed their own genres of comic opera, incorporating the Italian and French models along with their own musical traditions. Examples include Viennese ''operetta'', German ''[[singspiel]]'', Spanish ''[[zarzuela]]'', Russian comic opera, English ''[[ballad opera]]'', and ''[[Savoy Opera]]''.

==Italian comic opera==
{{See also|Opera buffa}}

In late 17th-century Italy, light-hearted musical plays began to be offered as an alternative to weightier ''opera seria'' (17th-century Italian opera based on [[classical mythology]]). ''[[Il Trespolo tutore]]'' (1679) by [[Alessandro Stradella]] (1639&amp;ndash;1682) was an early precursor of ''opera buffa''. The opera has a farcical plot, and the characters of the ridiculous guardian Trespolo and the maid Despina are prototypes of characters widely used later in the ''opera buffa'' genre.

The form began to flourish in Naples with [[Alessandro Scarlatti]]'s ''Il trionfo dell'onore'' (1718). At first written in Neapolitan dialect, these works became "Italianized" with the operas of Scarlatti, [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] (''[[La serva padrona]]'', 1733), [[Niccolò Piccinni|Piccinni]] (''[[La Cecchina]]'', 1760), [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]] (''[[Nina (opera)|Nina]]'', 1789), [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]] (''[[Il matrimonio segreto]]'', 1792), and then the great comic operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and, later, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]].

At first, comic operas were generally presented as intermezzi between acts of more serious works. Neapolitan and then Italian comic opera grew into an independent form and became the most popular form of staged entertainment in Italy from about 1750 to 1800. In 1749, thirteen years after Pergolesi's death, his ''La serva padrona'' swept Italy and France, evoking the praise of such [[French Enlightenment]] luminaries as [[Rousseau]].

In 1760, [[Niccolò Piccinni]] wrote the music to ''[[La buona figliuola|La Cecchina]]'' to a text by the great Venetian playwright, [[Carlo Goldoni]]. That text was based on [[Samuel Richardson]]'s popular English novel, ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740). Many years later, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] called ''La Cecchina'' the "first true Italian comic opera" &amp;ndash; that is to say, it had everything: it was in standard Italian and not in dialect; it was no longer simply an intermezzo, but rather an independent piece; it had a real story that people liked; it had dramatic variety; and, musically, it had strong melodies and even strong supporting orchestral parts, including a strong "stand-alone" overture (i.e., you could even enjoy the overture as an independent orchestral piece). Verdi was also enthusiastic because the music was by a southern Italian and the text by a northerner, which appealed to Verdi's pan-Italian vision.

The genre was developed further in the 19th century by [[Gioachino Rossini]] in his masterpieces such as ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' (1816) and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (1817).

== French ''opéra comique'' and ''opérette''==
{{See also|Opéra comique|operetta}}
French composers eagerly seized upon the Italian model and made it their own, calling it ''opéra comique''. Early proponents included [[François-Adrien Boïeldieu]] (1775&amp;ndash;1834), [[Daniel-François-Esprit Auber|Daniel François Auber]] (1782&amp;ndash;1871) and [[Adolphe Adam]] (1803&amp;ndash;1856). Although originally reserved for less serious works, the term ''opéra comique'' came to refer to any opera that included spoken dialogue, including works such as [[Cherubini|Cherubini's]] ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]'' and [[Bizet|Bizet's]] ''[[Carmen]]'' that are not "comic" in any sense of the word.

[[Hervé (composer)|Florimond Hervé]] (1825&amp;ndash;1892) is credited as the inventor of French ''[[opéra bouffe]]'', or ''[[opérette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/french/operette001.html Operette001] at Theatrehistory.com, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same model, Jacques Offenbach (1819&amp;ndash;1880) quickly surpassed him, writing over ninety [[operetta]]s. Whereas earlier French comic operas had a mixture of sentiment and humour, Offenbach's works were intended solely to amuse. Though generally well crafted and full of humorous satire and grand opera parodies, plots and characters in his works were often interchangeable. Given the frenetic pace at which he worked, Offenbach sometimes used the same material in more than one opera.  Another Frenchman who took up this form was [[Charles Lecocq]] (1832&amp;ndash;1918).

== German ''singspiel'' and Viennese ''operetta'' ==
{{See also|Singspiel|operetta}}

The [[singspiel]] developed in 18th-century Vienna and spread throughout Austria and Germany. As in the French ''opéra comique'', the ''singspiel'' was an opera with spoken dialogue, and usually a comic subject, such as [[Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail ]]'' (1782). Later ''singspiels'', such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] ''[[Fidelio]]'' and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', retained the form, but explored more serious subjects.

19th century Viennese ''[[operetta]]'' was built on both the ''singspiel'' and the French model. [[Franz von Suppé]] (1819&amp;ndash;1895) is remembered mainly for his ''overtures''. [[Johann Strauss II]] (1825&amp;ndash;1899), the "waltz king", contributed ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' (1874) and ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'' (1885).  [[Carl Millöcker]] (1842–1899) a long-time conductor at the [[Theater an der Wien]], also composed some of the most popular Viennese operettas of the late 19th century, including ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'' (1882), ''[[Gasparone]]'' (1884) and ''Der arme Jonathan'' (1890).

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Franz Lehár]] (1870&amp;ndash;1948) wrote ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1905); and [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] (1870&amp;ndash;1954) supplied ''[[Ein Walzertraum]]'' ("A Waltz Dream", 1907) and ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1908).

== Spanish ''zarzuela'' ==
{{See also|Zarzuela}}

Zarzuela, introduced in [[Spain]] in the 17th century, is rooted in popular Spanish traditional musical theatre.  It alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating dances, with chorus numbers and humorous scenes that are usually duets.  These works are relatively short, and ticket prices were often low, to appeal to the general public.   There are two main forms of zarzuela: Baroque zarzuela (c. 1630–1750), the earliest style, and Romantic zarzuela (c. 1850–1950), which can be further divided into the two subgenres of ''género grande'' and [[género chico]].

[[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] was the first playwright to adopt the term zarzuela for his work entitled ''El golfo de las sirenas'' ("The Gulf of the Sirens", 1657).  [[Lope de Vega]] soon wrote a work titled ''La selva sin amor, drama con orquesta'' ("The Loveless Jungle, A Drama with Orchestra").  The instruments orchestra was hidden from the audience, the actors sang in harmony, and the musical composition itself was intended to evoke an emotional response.  Some of these early pieces were lost, but ''Los celos hacen estrellas'' ("Jealousies Turn Into Stars") by [[Juan Hidalgo de Polanco|Juan Hidalgo]] and Juan Vélez, which premiered in 1672, survives and gives us some sense of what the genre was like in the 17th century.

In the 18th century, the Italian operatic style influenced Zarzuela.  But beginning with the reign of Bourbon King Charles III, anti-Italian sentiment increased.  Zarzuela returned to its roots in popular Spanish tradition in works such as the sainetes (or Entr'actes) of Don Ramón de la Cruz. This author's first work in this genre was ''Las segadoras de Vallecas'' ("The Reapers of Vallecas", 1768), with music by [[Antonio Rodríguez de Hita|Rodríguez de Hita]].

Single act zarzuelas were classified as género chico (the "little genre" or "little form") and zarzuelas of three or more acts were género grande (the "big genre" or "big form"). Zarzuela grande battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, but with little success and light attendance. In spite of this, in 1873 a new theater, the [[Teatro Apolo (Madrid)|Teatro Apolo]], was opened for zarzuela grande, which shared the failures of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, until it was forced to change its program to género chico.

== English light opera ==
{{See also|Ballad opera|Savoy opera}}

England traces its light opera tradition to the [[ballad opera]], typically a comic play that incorporated songs set to popular tunes. [[John Gay|John Gay's]] ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' was the earliest and most popular of these. [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Brinsley Sheridan's]] ''[[The Duenna]]'' (1775), with a score by [[Thomas Linley the younger|Thomas Linley]], was expressly described as "a comic opera".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/henry/music/duenna.htm "The Duenna"], Mary S. Van Deusen, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-musop.html "The Origins of Comic Opera"] at the stagebeauty website, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 19th century, the London musical stage was dominated by [[pantomime]] and [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], as well as bawdy, badly translated continental operettas, often including "ballets" featuring much prurient interest, and visiting the theatre became distasteful to the respectable public, especially women and children.  Mr. and Mrs. [[Thomas German Reed]], beginning in 1855, and a number of other Britons, deplored the risqué state of musical theatre and introduced [[German Reed Entertainment|short comic operas]] designed to be more family-friendly and to elevate the intellectual level of musical entertainments.  [[Jessie Bond]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder....  A first effort to bridge the gap was made by the German Reed Entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html Introduction to Jessie Bond's ''Reminiscences''] reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 7 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, an 1867 production of Offenbach's ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (seven months after its French première) ignited the English appetite for light operas with more carefully crafted librettos and scores, and continental European operettas continued to be extremely popular in Britain in the 1860s and 1870s, including ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', ''[[Madame Favart]]'' and others into the 1880s, often adapted by [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]].&lt;ref name=Gillan/&gt;  [[F. C. Burnand]] collaborated with several composers, including [[Arthur Sullivan]] in ''[[Cox and Box]]'', to write several comic operas on English themes in the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], one of the impresarios aiming to establish an English school of family-friendly light opera by composers such as [[Frederic Clay]] and [[Edward Solomon]] as a countermeasure to the continental operettas, commissioned Clay's collaborator, [[W. S. Gilbert]], and the promising young composer, [[Arthur Sullivan]], to write a short one-act opera that would serve as an afterpiece to Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''.  The result was ''[[Trial by Jury]]''; its success launched the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] partnership. "Mr. R. D'Oyly Carte's Opera Bouffe Company" took ''Trial'' on tour, playing it alongside French works by Offenbach and [[Alexandre Charles Lecocq]].  Eager to liberate the English stage from risqué French influences, and emboldened by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte formed a syndicate in 1877 to perform "light opera of a legitimate kind".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm "Richard D'Oyly Carte",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan were commissioned to write a new comic opera, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', starting the series that came to be known as the [[Savoy Operas]] (named for the [[Savoy Theatre]], which Carte later built for these works) that included ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', which became popular around the world.  The [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] continued to perform Gilbert and Sullivan almost continuously until it closed in 1982.

The Gilbert and Sullivan style was widely imitated by their contemporaries (for example, in ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''), and the creators themselves wrote works in this style with other collaborators in the 1890s.  None of these, however, had lasting popularity, leaving the Savoy Operas as practically the sole representatives of the genre surviving today.  Only recently, some of these other English light operas have begun to be explored by scholars and to receive performances and recordings.

== Russian comic opera ==
The first opera presented in [[Russia]], in 1731, was a comic opera (or "commedia per musica"), ''[[Calandro]]'', by an Italian composer, [[Giovanni Alberto Ristori]]. It was followed by the comic operas of other Italians, like [[Baldassare Galuppi|Galuppi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]], and also the [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]]/[[List of French composers|French]] composer [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry|Grétry]].

The first Russian comic opera was ''[[Anyuta]]'' (1772). The text was written by [[Mikhail Vasilyevich Popov|Mikhail Popov]], with music by an unknown composer, consisting of a selection of popular songs specified in the libretto. Another successful comic opera, ''Melnik &amp;ndash; koldun, obmanshchik i svat'' ("The Miller who was a Wizard, a Cheat and a Match-maker"', text by [[Alexander Ablesimov]], [[Moscow]], 1779), on a subject resembling [[Rousseau]]'s ''Devin'', is attributed to [[Mikhail Matveyevich Sokolovsky|Mikhail Sokolovsky]]. [[Ivan Kerzelli]], [[Vasily Pashkevich]] and [[Yevstigney Fomin]] also wrote a series of successful comic operas in the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Russian comic opera was further developed by [[Alexey Verstovsky]] who composed more 30 opera-vaudevilles and 6 grand operas (most of them with spoken dialogue).  Later, [[Modest Mussorgsky]] worked on two comic operas, ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'' and ''[[Zhenitba]]'' ("The Marriage"), which he left unfinished (they were completed only in the 20th century). [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] wrote a comic opera, ''[[Cherevichki]]'' (after [[Nikolai Gogol]], 1885, 1887 [[Moscow]]). [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] composed ''[[May Night]]'' 1878&amp;ndash;1879 and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'' 1906&amp;ndash;1907.

In the 20th century, the best examples of comic opera by Russian composers were [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951), [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' (1919) and ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'' (1940&amp;ndash;1941), and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (1928, staged 1930). Simultaneously, the genres of light music, operetta, musical comedy, and later, [[rock opera]], were developed by such composers as [[Isaak Dunayevsky]], [[Dmitri Kabalevsky]], Dmitri Shostakovich (Opus 105: ''[[Moscow, Cheryomushki]]'', operetta in 3 acts, (1958)), [[Tikhon Khrennikov]], and later by [[Gennady Gladkov]], [[Alexey Rybnikov]], and [[Alexander Zhurbin]].

The 21st century in Russian comic opera began with the noisy premieres of two works whose genre could be described as "opera-farce":

''Tsar Demyan'' (''Царь Демьян'') &amp;ndash; ''A frightful opera performance''.  A collective project of five authors wrote the work: [[Leonid Desyatnikov]] and Vyacheslav Gaivoronsky from [[St. Petersburg]], Iraida Yusupova and Vladimir Nikolayev from [[Moscow]], and the creative collective "Kompozitor", which is a pseudonym for the well-known music critic Pyotr Pospelov.  The libretto is by Elena Polenova, based on a folk-drama, ''Tsar Maksimilyan'', and the work premiered on June 20, 2001, at the [[Mariinski Theatre]], St Petersburg. Prize "Gold Mask, 2002" and "Gold Soffit, 2002".

''[[The Children of Rosenthal]]'' (''Дети Розенталя''), an opera in two acts by [[Leonid Desyatnikov]], with a libretto by [[Vladimir Sorokin]].  This work was commissioned by the Bolshoi theatre and premiered on March 23, 2005. The staging of the opera was accompanied by juicy scandal; however it was an enormous success.

== North American operetta ==
{{See also|Musical theatre|operetta}}

In the United States, [[Victor Herbert]] (1859&amp;ndash;1924) was one of the first to pick up the family-friendly style of light opera that Gilbert and Sullivan had made popular, although his music was also influenced by the European operetta composers. His earliest pieces, starting with ''Prince Ananias'' in 1894, were styled "comic operas," but his later works were described as "musical extravaganza", "musical comedy", "musical play", "musical farce", and even "opera comique." His two most successful pieces, out of more than half a dozen hits, were ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903) and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/herbert_victor/victorherbert.html "Victor Herbert"] at the Musical Theatre Guide, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who wrote in a similar vein included [[Reginald de Koven]] (1859&amp;ndash;1920), [[John Philip Sousa]] (1854&amp;ndash;1932), [[Sigmund Romberg]] and [[Rudolf Friml]].  The modern American [[musical theatre|musical]] incorporated elements of the British and American light operas, with works like ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' that explored more serious subjects and featured a tight integration among book, movement and lyrics.

In Canada, [[Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann]] and [[George Frederick Cameron]] composed in the Gilbert and Sullivan style of light opera. ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]'' was performed for the first time on 11 July 1889 at Martin's Opera House in [[Kingston, Ontario]].

The line between light opera and other recent forms is difficult to draw.  Several works are variously called operettas or musicals, such as ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', depending on whether they are performed in opera houses or in theaters.  In addition, some recent American and British musicals make use of an operatic structure, for example, containing recurring motifs, and may even be sung through without dialogue.  Those with orchestral scores are usually styled "musicals", while those played on electronic instruments are often styled [[rock opera]]s.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}
'''Deadpan''', '''dry humor''' or '''dry wit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Mary Ann|title=Writing humor|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2959-4|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBsC3ItxoYQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22dry+wit%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y2tJT83UMIaAOoiwzewN&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dry%20wit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate display of a lack of or no emotion, commonly as a form of [[Comedy|comedic]] delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, [[ironic]], [[laconic]], or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term ''deadpan'' first emerged as an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] in the 1920s, as a [[compound word]] combining "dead" and "pan" (a [[slang]] term for the face). The oldest usage recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comes from ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1928), which defines the term as "playing a role with expressionless face".&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. [http://oed.com/view/Entry/47677 "dead-pan, adj., n., adv., and v."] Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. accessed 17 February 2012. First published in ''A Supplement to the OED I'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' in which a [[gangster]] tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to "give it a dead pan" (with the emphasis on "pan"), so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say. The usage of deadpan as a [[verb]] ("to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan") is recorded at least as far back as 1942.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of deadpan comedians}}

Early in his vaudeville days, [[Buster Keaton]] developed his deadpan expression.  Keaton realized that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|title=Deadpan: the comedy of Buster Keaton|work=[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=17 April 1964|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'' was performed almost entirely in deadpan.&lt;ref name="MIL"&gt;{{cite news| last=Dudek| first=Duane| title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, including ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''. More recent examples are [[Andre Braugher]] as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', [[Jennette McCurdy]] as Sam Puckett in ''[[iCarly]]'', and [[Louis C.K.]] in ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. Another example is the comedy of [[Steven Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=E.C. | title=The Everything Big Book of Jokes: Hundreds of the Shortest, Longest, Silliest, Smartest, Most Hilarious Jokes You've Never Heard! | publisher=Adams Media | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4405-7698-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zrsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | access-date=June 29, 2017 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry humor is often confused with [[highbrow]] or [[egghead]] humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and [[Context (language use)|context]]. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny. However, the term "deadpan" itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.

The vast and sparsely populated regions of northern and western Alaska are primarily inhabited by [[Alaska Natives]], who are also numerous in the southeast. Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other parts of south-central and southeast Alaska have many White Americans of [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[Western Europe|western]] [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] ancestry. The [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]]-[[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]] area has many residents of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry and the [[Aleutian Islands]] contain a large [[Filipino American|Filipino]] population. The vast majority of the state's African American population lives in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Also, Alaska has the largest percentage of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] of any state. Some of the Alaska Natives absorbed the small 1700s Russian-era settlement.

==Languages==
According to the 2005-2007 American Community Survey, 84.7% of people over the age of five speak only [[English language|English]] at home. About 3.5% speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at home. About 2.2% speak an [[Indo-European language]] other than Spanish or English at home and about 4.3% speak an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]] at home. And about 5.3% speak other languages at home.

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 22 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]], known locally as "native languages".  These languages belong to two major language families: [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] and [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené]].  As the homeland of these two major language families of North America, Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent, providing evidence for the recent settlement of North America via the [[Bering land bridge]].

Alaska's relatively large [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] population is notable. The large Eastern Orthodox population (with 49 parishes and up to 50,000 followers) is a result of early [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] which centered on Alaska, and the missionary work among Alaska Natives.  In 1795, the first [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was established in [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]]. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, a number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.  Many are members of the [[Orthodox Church in America]] while others are members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]].

Alaska also has the largest [[Quaker]] population (by percentage) of any state. 

Also, as of 1994, there were 3,060 [[Judaism|Jews]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/10557/edition_id/202/format/html/displaystory.html|title=j. - Alaskan Jews trying to connect, says study&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=jewishsf.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] stands at a little less than 2,400.  Estimates for the number of [[Muslim|Alaskan Muslims]] range from 1,000 to 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitynews.net/index.php/main/more/alaskan_muslims_avoid_conflict/ Alaskan Muslims Avoid Conflict] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113085537/http://www.humanitynews.net/index.php/main/more/alaskan_muslims_avoid_conflict/ |date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
At 34 years old, Elizabeth Gilbert was educated, had a home, a husband, and a successful career as a writer. She was, however, unhappy in her marriage and initiated a divorce. She then embarked on a rebound relationship that did not work out, leaving her devastated and alone. After finalizing her difficult divorce, she spent the next year traveling the world.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/books/review/26egan.html |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Egan |first=Jennifer |date=February 26, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent four months in Italy, eating and enjoying life ("Eat"). She spent three months in India, finding her [[spirituality]] ("Pray").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2261|title=''Eat, Pray, Love'' (review)|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207001706/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2261|archivedate=December 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended the year in [[Bali, Indonesia]], looking for "balance" of the two and fell in love with a Brazilian businessman ("Love").&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/09/AR2006020901684.html |title=Heart and Soul |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Lichtenstein |first=Grace |date=February 12, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Jennifer Egan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gilbert's prose as "fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible", but said that the book "drags" in the middle. She was more interested in "the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out", noting that Gilbert omits the "confusion and unfinished business of real life", and that "we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] enjoyed the book, and devoted two episodes of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to it.&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

Maureen Callahan of the ''[[New York Post]]'' heavily criticized the book, calling it "[[narcissistic]] [[New Age]] reading", and "the worst in [[Orientalism|Western fetishization]] of Eastern thought and culture, assured in its answers to existential dilemmas that have confounded intellects greater than hers." In addition, she was critical of Oprah's focus on the book, as well as Oprah's fans who enjoy the book, asking why her fans are "indulging in this silliness", and why they aren't "clamoring for more weight when it comes to Oprah's female authors".&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

[[Katie Roiphe]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' agreed with Egan about the strength of Gilbert's writing. However, she described the journey as too fake: "too willed, too self-conscious". She stated that given the apparent artificiality of the journey, her "affection for ''Eat, Pray, Love'' is ... furtive", but that "it is a transcendently great beach book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2007/07/summer_reading.html |title=Summer Reading: Should you read the best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love? |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Roiphe |first=Katie |date=July 3, 2007 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s Grace Lichtenstein stated that "The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie."&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt;

Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', however, praised the spiritual aspect of the book, stating that "To read about her struggles with a 182-verse Sanskrit chant, or her (successful) attempt to meditate while being feasted on by mosquitoes, is to come about as close as you can to enlightenment-by-proxy." He did, however, agree with Roiphe that her writing occasionally seems to be "trying too hard to be liked; one feels the belabored mechanism of her jokes".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1161222,00.html |title=The Year of Living Happily |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Grossman |first=Lev |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Leibovich of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] agreed with several other reviewers about the strength of Gilbert's story telling. She agreed with Egan as well that Gilbert seems to have an unlimited amount of luck, saying "her good fortune seems limitless", and asking "Is it possible for one person to be this lucky?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/02/23/gilbert |title=Lost and found |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Leibovich |first=Lori |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Jessica Shaw said that "Despite a few cringe-worthy turns ... Gilbert's journey is well worth taking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1160265,00.html |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Shaw |first=Jessica |date=February 17, 2006 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Lattin of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' agreed with Egan that the story was weakest while she was in India, and questioned the complete veracity of the book.&lt;ref name="SFGate.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/reviews/books/EAT,_PRAY,_LOVE.DTL |title=Pilgrim wants it all in Italy, India, Indonesia |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Lattin |first=Don |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Fisher of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' also praised Gilbert's writing, stating that "she describes with intense visual, palpable detail. She is the epic poet of ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/02/19/short_takes_boston_globe |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Fisher |first=Barbara |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the feminist magazine ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' published a critical review and social commentary called "Eat, Pray, Spend". Authors Joshunda Sanders and Diana Barnes-Brown wrote that "''Eat, Pray, Love'' is not the first book of its kind, but it is a perfect example of the genre of priv-lit: literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, [[existential]], or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women's hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial." The genre, they argued, positions women as inherently and deeply flawed, and offers "no real solutions for the astronomically high tariffs—both financial and social—that exclude all but the most fortunate among us from participating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/article/eat-pray-spend "Eat, Pray, Spend"]. ''BitchMagazine.com''. Retrieved June 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody==

[[Andrew Gottlieb]], an American comedy writer and producer, wrote a parody of Gilbert's Book, titled ''Drink, Play, Fuck: One Man's Search for Anything Across Ireland, Vegas and Thailand''. Gottlieb, in a 2010 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', said, "I was mystified by the success of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' and I felt that the book, and its Oprah-sanctioned ubiquity, needed to be made fun of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/08/the-exchange-andrew-gottlieb.html "The Exchange: Andrew Gottlibe"].

A '''flower brick''' is a type of [[vase]], cuboid-shaped like a building [[brick]], and designed to be seen with the long face towards the viewer.&lt;ref name="p01pm6m5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01pm6m5|title=BBC One - Antiques Roadshow, Series 36, Sainsbury Centre Norwich 1, English Delftware flower bricks|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O21382/flower-brick-unknown/|title=Flower brick|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional flower bricks are made of a [[ceramic]] material. The top surface has a large hole into which water is poured, and a number of smaller holes into which flower stems are inserted, so that the flowers are kept in position.  They are a sub-type of the [[boughpot]] or [[tulipiere]], which have more rounded shapes.

In the ''New York Post'', [[Bill McKibben]] wrote that ''Gandhi the Man'' "seems at first glance like pure hagiography, most notable for the wonderful photographs it contains. But it isn't a picture book - in fact,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
in very few words, it comes closer to giving some sense of how Gandhi saw his life than any other account I have read. From the outside, his life looked like a political drama... But from the inside, Easwaran argues quite persuasively, it looked quite different. Gandhi mastered his own life - took charge of his mind and his body. As a result he knew no fear, only great and undifferentiated love for the rest of creation. And so he was able to powerfully affect that creation."&lt;ref name=mckibben89/&gt;{{rp|4}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Eknath Easwaran}}
In ''The History Teacher'' Donald Cody wrote that "the book's uniqueness lies in the effective interspersing of some six dozen pictures throughout the relatively short text [...which] itself is biographical only in a very general way; the author's major goal is to reveal the spiritual dimensions of Gandhi's life.... Teachers and college students, in particular, will find the two or three hours spent with this book a rare inspirational experience. Even high school students who appreciate works with a spiritual focus will be affected by its profound message."&lt;ref name=cody81/&gt;{{rp|269}}
Cody also wrote that "while the author describes [the] political struggle in considerable detail, he is more interested in showing that Gandhi did not see achieving India's freedom as his primary goal. In fact, had he not believed that British rule was particularly injurious to the Indian lower classes, he might not have involved himself in the independence movement at all."&lt;ref name=cody81/&gt;{{rp|269}}

In the ''[[Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society]]'', Tonya Emeigh suggested that ''Gandhi the Man'' could be used for teaching humane attitudes towards farm animals.&lt;ref

The publisher quoted influential religion scholar [[Huston Smith]] as stating that "This book belongs in every public library in the English-speaking world."&lt;ref name=hsmith11&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_73lbc6t8cYC&amp;pg=PA217 Back cover of 2011 edition] of ''Gandhi the Man'', {{ISBN|978-1-58638-055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global justice''' is an issue in [[political philosophy]] arising from the concern about unfairness. It is sometimes understood as aform of internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/doi/10.1111/raju.12153/full|title=Responsibility and  Global Justice|last=Risse|first=Mathias|date=2017|website=Wiley Online Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Henrik Syse]] argues that global ethics and international justice in western tradition is part of the tradition of [[natural law]]. It has been organized and taught within Western culture since Latin times of Middle Stoa and Cicero and the early Christian philosophers Ambrose and Augustine. Per Syse "This early natural-law theorizing teaching centered around the idea of a ius naturale, i.e., a system of right which is natural and as such common to all people, available to humankind as a measuring stick of right and wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Natural Law to Human Rights — Some Reflections on Thomas Pogge and Global Justice|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-3142-4_13|publisher = Springer Netherlands|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-1-4020-3141-0|pages = 229–237|series = Studies in Global Justice|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-3142-4_13|first = Henrik|last = Syse|editor-first = Andreas|editor-last = Follesdal|editor-first2 = Thomas|editor-last2 = Pogge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Per the American political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]] "A widely accepted philosophical view continues to hold that the scope of obligations of justice is defined by membership in a common political community. On this account, people have obligations of justice only to other people with whom they live together under a common constitution, or whom they recognize as belonging to the same nation as themselves." English philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] agreed, that obligations only apply to people living together or that are part of the same Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = RESPONSIBILITY AND GLOBAL JUSTICE: A SOCIAL CONNECTION MODEL|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0265052506060043|journal = Social Philosophy and Policy|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1471-6437|pages = 102–130|volume = 23|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0265052506060043|first = Iris Marion|last = Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What we owe one another in the global context is one of the questions the global justice concept seeks to answer.&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Global Justice|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/justice-global/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Gillian|last = Brock|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are positive and negative duties which may be in conflict with ones moral rules.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Cosmopolitanism|Cosmopolitans]], reportedly including the ancient Greek [[Diogenes of Sinope]], have described themselves as ''citizens of the world''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, 'Life of Diogenes' in ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' trans. C.D. Yonge. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldiogenes.htm], accessed 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ín 1976, [[William Godwin]] a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] thinker and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] argued that everyone has an impartial duty to do the most good he or she can, without preference for any one human being over another.&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin, ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' ed. Isaac Kramnick. London: Penguin, 1976 [1793].&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader political context of the debate is the longstanding conflict between more and less local institutions: tribes against states, villages against cities, local communities against empires, nation-states against the [[United Nations|UN]]. The relative strength of the local versus the global has waxed and waned over recorded history. From the [[early modern period]] until the twentieth century, the preeminent political institution was the [[Sovereign state|state]], which is [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], territorial, claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in its territory, and exists in an international system of other sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Van Creveld, ''The Rise and Decline of the State''. Cambridge: CUP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, and relatedly, political philosophers' interest in [[justice]] focused almost exclusively on [[Domestic policy|domestic]] issues: how should states treat their subjects, and what do fellow-[[citizen]]s owe one another? Justice in relations between states, and between individuals across state borders was put aside as a secondary issue or left to [[international relations]] theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders''. Oxford: OUP, 2006. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[World War I|First World War]], however, the state system has been transformed by [[globalization]] and by the creation of [[International organization|supranational]] political and economic institutions such as the [[League of Nations]], the United Nations, and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;David Held, 'The Transformation of Political Community' in Ian Shapiro ed., ''Democracy's Edges''. Cambridge: CUP, 1999: 84-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, and especially since the 1970s, global justice became an important issue in political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Onora O'Neill, 'Transnational Economic Justice' in ''Bounds of Justice''. Cambridge: CUP, 2000: 115-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary global justice debate, the general issue of impartiality centers on the moral significance of borders and of shared citizenship. [[Realism in international relations|Realist]]s, [[Epistemological particularism|particularist]]s, [[nationalist]]s, members of the [[society of states tradition]], and cosmopolitans take contesting positions in response to these problems.

==Central questions==
Three related questions, concerning the scope of justice, justice in the [[distribution of wealth]] and other goods, and the institutions responsible for justice, are central to the problem of global justice. When these questions are addressed in non ideal circumstances, they are part of the "ethics of process," a branch of [[political ethics]].

===Scope===
Are there, as the moral universalist argues, objective ethical standards that apply to all humans regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[nationality]] or other distinguishing features?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moral Relativism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Spring 2012 Edition)|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/|website = plato.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or do ethical standards only apply within such limited contexts as [[culture]]s, [[nations]], communities, or voluntary associations?

A Moral Conception of Social Justice is only Universalistic if: 
* It subjects all persons to the same system of fundamental moral principles
* These principles assign the same fundamental moral benefits and burdens to all: and
* These fundamental benefits and burdens do not privilege or disadvantage certain groups arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Poverty and Human Rights - Thomas Pogge|url = http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/|website = Thomas Pogge|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 9780745641447|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150919070037/http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/|archivedate = 2015-09-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Further|Moral universalism|Moral relativism}}

===Distributive equality===
[[Gillian Brock]] asks "Do we have an obligation to ensure people have their basic needs met and can otherwise lead “decent” lives, or should we be more concerned with global socio-economic equality?".&lt;ref name=platojustice&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Justice - What Global Duties Do We Have?|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-global/#WhaGloDutDoWeHav|website=Stanford|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1.1 billion people &amp;mdash; 18% of humanity &amp;mdash; live below the [[World Bank]]'s $2/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Xavier |last=Sala-i-Martin |title=The Disturbing "Rise" of Global Income Inequality |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 8904 |date=April 2002 |doi=10.3386/w8904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is this distribution of wealth and other goods just? What is the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the [[world economy]]? [[John Rawls]] has said that  international obligations are between states as long as "states meet a minimal condition of decency" where as [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Problem of Global Justice|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1088-4963.2005.00027.x/abstract|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|date = 2005-03-01|issn = 1088-4963|pages = 113–147|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1088-4963.2005.00027.x|first = Thomas|last = Nagel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Singer argues in [[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]] that the rich have a moral obligation to give their money away to those who need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|url = http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|website = www.utilitarian.net|accessdate = 2015-09-14|first = Pablo|last = Stafforini}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Institutions===
What ''institutions''—[[Sovereign state|states]], communes, [[Federalism|federal]] entities, global financial institutions like the [[World bank|World Bank]], international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], [[multinational corporations]], [[International judicial institutions|international courts]], a [[World government|world state]]—would best achieve the ideal of global justice?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountability and global governance: challenging the state-centric conception of human rights {{!}} Lafont {{!}} Ethics &amp; Global Politics|url = http://www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net/index.php/egp/article/view/5507|website = www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; How might they gain our support, and whose responsibility is it to create and sustain such institutions? How free should movement between the jurisdictions of different territorial entities be?

Thomas Pogge says that States can not achieve global justice by themselves "It has never been plausible that the interests of states—that is, the interests of governments—should furnish the only considerations that are morally relevant in international relations."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Real World Justice - Thomas Pogge|url = http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|website = Thomas Pogge|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 978-1-4020-3142-7|publisher = |last = Follesdal|first = A|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150912020643/http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|archive-date = 2015-09-12|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like the World Trade Organization have advocated free trade but allow protectionism in affluent developed countries to this point according to Pogge and Moellendorf.&lt;ref name="Brock"/&gt;

===Minimum criteria===

==== Nayef Al-Rodhan ====

Philosopher [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] argues in his 2009 book, ''Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph'', that [[well-being|human well-being]] is dependent on the preservation and promotion of [[human dignity]] and that human dignity is directly linked to global justice. In order to achieve global justice, eight minimum criteria must be met. These are 1) [[dialogue]], 2) effective and representative [[Multilateralism|multilateral institutions]], 3) representative [[Decision-making processes|decision-making]] structures, 4) fair treatment, 5) [[empathy]], 6) [[accountability]], 7) [[Government transparency|transparency]], and 8) adherence to [[international law]].
Because interconnectedness between peoples and geo-cultural domains is becoming increasingly common, Al-Rodhan maintains that the fate of one geo-cultural domain will affect the fate of others. [[Justice]] is central to human dignity, individual geo-cultural triumph, and the overall well-being of human [[civilization]]. Thus, according to Al-Rodhan, meeting the minimum criteria of global justice is a prerequisite to the triumph of human civilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Global justice is the paramount to global security, because [[injustice]] can lead to feelings of [[anger]], [[humiliation]], and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional [[Psychological egoism|self-interest]] and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people feel that they have been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, [[justice]] and not just [[Armed forces|military power]], is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current [[status quo]] are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Al-Rodhan therefore recommends that [[Social justice|fairness]] in terms of the participants in [[dialogue]] is a prerequisite for the promotion of universal justice. Similarly, he argues that diplomacy must be based on [[openness]] to hearing and acknowledging the concerns and positions of others. Empathy and an acknowledgement of the grievances and past pains of others are crucial, as is giving all stakeholders a voice in the [[decision-making process]]. Finally, Al-Rodhan argues that all states, no matter how powerful, must be bound by international law and its obligations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Al-Rodhan, Nayef R.F., Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph, LIT, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thomas Pogge ====

[[Thomas Pogge]] has contended that an "institutional order can not be just if it fails to meet the minimal human rights standard". That standard is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2017}} Mathias Risse has argued that an injustice is not present, "While indeed 1.2 billion people in 1998 lived below the poverty line of $1.08 PPP 1993 per day, it is also true that there is now less misery than ever before," Less Misery is his standard for justice. He wrote in 2005, that "progress made over the last 200 years is miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do We Owe the Global Poor Assistance or Rectification?|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0892679400003580|journal = Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date = 2005-03-01|issn = 1747-7093|pages = 9–18|volume = 19|issue = 01|doi = 10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00485.x|first = Mathias|last = Risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main positions==
Five main positions&amp;mdash;realism, particularism, nationalism, the society of states tradition, and cosmopolitanism (in two forms) &amp;mdash; have been taken by contributors to the global justice debate.

===Realism===
{{Main|Realism in international relations}}
Realists, such as [[Charles Yeo]], [[Hashim Tilab]] argue that there are no global ethical standards, and that to imagine that there are is a dangerous fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Realism and neoliberalism: International relations theory and Southeast Asian security|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09512749508719123|journal = The Pacific Review|date = 1995-01-01|issn = 0951-2748|pages = 5–24|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/09512749508719123|first = Sheldon W.|last = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are the main actors in an [[Anarchy in international relations|international anarchy]], and they either will or should always attempt to act rationally in their own interests. So, in response to the three central questions above: moral universalism is either false, or merely says that nothing is forbidden to any state in pursuit of its interests. There is no obligation to help the poor, unless doing so helps to further a state's strategic aims. And the state system is taken as the fundamental and unchallengeable global institutional arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''REALPOLITIK AND WORLD PEACE'', by Gordon L. Anderson, International Journal on World Peace, Vol. 26, No. 4 (DECEMBER 2009), pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particularism===
Particularists, such as [[Michael Walzer]] and [[James Tully (legal theorist)|James Tully]], argue that ethical standards arise out of shared meanings and practices, which are created and sustained by discrete cultures or societies. Moral and social criticism is possible within the boundaries of such groups, but not across them. If a society is [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], for instance, its citizens can be morally wrong, and can meaningfully criticise each other, if they do not live up to their own egalitarian ideals; but they cannot meaningfully criticise another, [[caste]]-based society in the name of those ideals. "A given society is just if its substantive life is lived in a certain way&amp;mdash;that is, in a way faithful to the shared understandings of [its] members."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''Spheres of Justice''. New York: Basic Books, 1983. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unjust if not. Each society has its own, different standards, and only those inside it are bound by those standards and can properly criticise themselves. So, moral universalism is false, because objective ethical standards vary between cultures or societies. We should not apply the same criteria of distributive justice to strangers as we would to compatriots. [[Nation state|Nation-states]] that express their peoples' shared and distinctive ethical understandings are the proper institutions to enable local and different justices.

For [[Charles Blattberg]], however, there exists a particularist approach to global justice, one based upon what he calls a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2034932|title=Social Science Research Network (SSRN) |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Communitarianism|Cultural relativism|Multiculturalism}}

=== Nationalism ===
{{Main|Nationalism}}
Nationalists, such as [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]] and [[Yael Tamir]], argue that demanding mutual obligations are created by a particular kind of valuable association, the [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;David Miller, ''On Nationality''.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; We may have [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] duties to aid the particularly badly off worldwide, but these are much less stringent and pressing than our duties to our fellow-[[citizen]]s.  Nationalism has traditionally included this assumption of differing moral obligations to those within and those outside the nation, reflected for example in the fact that the benefits of the [[welfare state]] are not available to citizens of other countries. So, moral universalism is too simple, because the ethical standards that apply between compatriots differ from those that apply between strangers (although some nationalists argue for the universal ethical standard that nations should have their own states).  Distributive justice is an issue within nations but not necessarily between them. And a world-system of nation-states is the appropriate organiser of justice for all, in their distinct associational groups.

=== Society of states ===
In the society of states tradition, states are seen as individual entities that can mutually agree on common interests and rules of interaction, including moral rules, in much the same way as human individuals can. Often, this idea of agreement between peers is formalised by a [[social contract]] argument.

One prominent exemplar of the tradition is [[John Rawls]]. In ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'', Rawls extends the method of his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' to the question of global justice. His argument is that we can justify a global regime by showing that it would be chosen by representatives of Peoples in an imagined [[original position]], which prevents them knowing which particular People they represent.  This decision-in-ignorance models fairness because it excludes selfish bias.  When Rawls applied this method in the case of domestic justice, with parties in the original position representing individual members of a single society, he argued that it supported a [[Income redistribution|redistributive]], egalitarian liberal politics. In contrast, Rawls argues that when his method is applied to global justice, it supports a quite traditional, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian international ethics: duties of states to obey treaties and strict [[Just war|limits on warmaking]], but no global repossession of private property.  So, different justices apply to the domestic and international cases.  Even if justice requires egalitarianism within states, it does not do so between them.  And a system of cooperating but independent states is the just global institutional arrangement.  Rawls describes this ideal as a 'realistic utopia'.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''The Law of Peoples''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[John Rawls|Rawls]], other notable exponents of this position include [[Hedley Bull]].

=== Cosmopolitanism ===
{{See also|Cosmopolitanism}}
[[Image:John Gower world Vox Clamantis detail.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Gower]], ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'' detail (c. 1400): the world]]
Cosmopolitans argue that some form of moral universalism is true, and therefore that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, fall within the scope of justice.  Their arguments typically appeal to consistency, as follows:
# The moral standing of individuals is based on some morally significant characteristics.
# These characteristics are shared by ''all'' humans (and not only by the members of some nation, culture, society, or state).
# Therefore, ''all'' humans have moral standing (and the boundaries between nations, cultures, societies and states are morally irrelevant).&lt;ref&gt;Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cosmopolitans differ, however, over ''which'' shared human characteristics are morally significant.

[[Consequentialism|Consequentialist]] cosmopolitans, amongst whom [[Peter Singer]] is prominent, argue that the proper standard of moral judgement for actions, practices or institutions is their consequences, and that the measure of consequences is the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of humans (or even of all [[Sentience|sentient]] creatures).  The capacity to experience welfare and suffering is therefore the shared basis for moral standing. This means that the fact that some people are suffering terrible deprivations of welfare, caused by poverty, creates a moral demand that anyone who is able to help them do so.  Neither the physical distance between the rich and the poor, nor the fact that they are typically citizens of different countries, has any moral relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer ‘Famine, Affluence, and Morality’, ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 1(1972): 229-243. Online version listed under External links.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights defender]]s of cosmopolitanism, such as [[Thomas Pogge]] and [[Simon Caney]], argue that all humans have rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = CANEY|first1 = SIMON|title = Cosmopolitan Justice, Responsibility, and Global Climate Change|journal = Leiden Journal of International Law|date = 9 January 2006|volume = 18|issue = 04|pages = 747|doi = 10.1017/S0922156505002992|url = http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/FACULTY/RARNESON/phil267fa12/CANEYcosmop.pdf|accessdate = 6 March 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510005322/http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/phil267fa12/CANEYcosmop.pdf|archive-date = 10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World Poverty and Human Rights|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00484.x|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps those set out in the [[UN Declaration of Universal Human Rights|UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  It may be argued that these rights create a [[positive duty]] of the rich to provide what they guarantee (security, a livelihood, etc.); or, alternatively, it may be argued that the rich are currently violating their [[negative duty]] not to impose a global order that systematically violates rights of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Pogge, ''World Poverty and Human Rights''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others defend neoconservative [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] from a view of cosmopolitanism for the added benefits to human rights that such intervention could bring. Some defended the 2003 invasion of Iraq from this motive due to the human rights abuses Saddam had inflicted on countless members of the Kurdish and Shiite communities.

Individual cosmopolitans also differ considerably in how they understand the requirements of distributive justice and the legitimacy of global institutions. Some, for instance [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]], endorse world government; others, such as [[Simon Caney]], do not. The extent to which cosmopolitans advocate global redistribution of resources also varies. All cosmopolitans, however, believe that individuals, and not states, nations, or other groups, are the ultimate focus of universal moral standards.

==Demands==
None of the five main positions described above imply complete satisfaction with the current world order. Realists complain that states that pursue [[utopian]] moral visions through intervention and [[humanitarian aid]], instead of minding their own strategic interests, do their subjects harm and destabilise the international system.&lt;ref&gt;for instance E.H. Carr, ''The Twenty Years Crisis 1919-1939''. London: Macmillan, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularists object to the destruction of traditional cultures by cultural [[colonialism]], whether under the guise of economic [[liberalism]] or defence of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;for instance James Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity''. Cambridge: CUP, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nationalists deplore the fact that so many people are [[Stateless person|stateless]] or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Miller, ''On Nationality''.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the society of states are concerned about [[rogue state]]s and about the [[Imperialism|imperial]] ambitions of the powerful.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Rawls, ''The Law of Peoples''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders''.&lt;/ref&gt; It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.

'''H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil''' is the oldest [[bookshop]] in [[Tórshavn]] and [[Faroes|Faroe]]. It is also one of the oldest shops still in business in the [[Faroe Islands]] today.

The bookshop was established on [[St. Olaf]]s day on 29 July 1865 by [[bookbinder]] '''Hans Nicolai Jacobsen'''. He was the father of [[Jakob Jakobsen]] (1864-1918), who is one of the most important Faroese [[philologist]]s.

H. N. Jacobsen was one of the initiators of a public meeting in [[Tórshavn]] in 1888, aiming at public support for “the protection and preservation of the [[Faroese language]] and [[tradition]]s”, as the notice announcing the meeting said. This is considered as the official start of the Faroese National Movement.

The original book shop was in the old main street "Gongin", but 1918 it was moved to the Market Square "Vaglið", at the start of Niels Finsens gøta, where it still stands today.

With its characteristic Faroese grass roof and big [[maple trees]] in the foreground, it is a [[landmark]] in Tórshavn.  
In addition, a section of H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil operates an antiquarian bookshop.

==History==
The handscroll format originated with ancient Chinese text documents.&lt;ref name=npm&gt;[http://www.npm.gov.tw/english/exhbition/ehan0101/ehan0101.htm "Famous Handscroll Paintings and Calligraphic Works"] {{en icon}} or [http://www.npm.gov.tw/exhbition/chan0101/chan0101.htm "手卷名品展"] {{Zh icon}}.  Taipei: National Palace Museum. Retrieved 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-481 BCE) through the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE - 220 CE), [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo or wooden slips]] were bound together and used to write texts on.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of [[paper]] and [[silk]] in the handscroll format became more common.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; The handscroll was the one of the main formats for texts up until the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Since the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280), the handscroll became a standard format for paintings.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; New styles were developed over time.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

==Description==
A handscroll has a backing of protective and decorative silk (包首) usually bearing a small title label (題籤) on it.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; In Chinese art, the handscroll usually consists of a frontispiece (引首) at the beginning (right side), the artwork (畫心) itself in the middle, and a colophon section (拖尾) at the end for various inscriptions.&lt;ref name=delbanco/&gt;&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;&lt;ref name=artchicago&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Scrolls|url=http://www.artic.edu/taoism/diag-scrolls.php|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the scroll, where the frontispiece was located, is known as the "heaven" (天頭).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Vertical strips (隔水) are sometimes used to separate the different sections.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Most handscrolls contain only one painting, although several short paintings can also be mounted on the scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; At the beginning of the scroll is a wooden stave (天杆), which serves as a support.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A silk cord (帶子) and a fastener (別子) is attached to the stave and used to secure the rolled-up scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A wooden roller (木杆) is attached at the very end, around which the scroll is rolled.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

The phrase '''Her Majesty's Government''' (''His Majesty's Government'' during the reign of a male monarch) is a formal term referring to the [[government]] of a [[Commonwealth realm]] or one of constituent provinces, states or territories. In use since at least the height of the [[British Empire]], the phrase has been inherited and integrated into the countries that emerged from that polity.

==History==
In the [[British Empire]], the term ''His (or Her) Majesty's Government'' was originally only used by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|imperial government]] in [[London]]. As the Empire developed into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the former [[Dominion]]s came to be seen as realms of the sovereign equal in status to the [[United Kingdom]], and, from the 1920s and 1930s, the form ''His Majesty's Government in...'' began to be used by the United Kingdom and Dominion governments to differentiate between independent jurisdictions, such as [[His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name=Walshe&gt;{{Citation| last=Walshe| first=Joseph P.| author-link=Joe Walshe| title=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy &gt; Despatch from Joseph P. Walshe (for Patrick McGilligan) to L.S. Amery (London) (D.5507) (Confidential) (Copy)| publisher=Royal Irish Academy| date=29 August 1927| url=http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1927/831.htm| accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial, state, and provincial governments, on the other hand, continued to use the lesser title ''Government of [region/territory]'', and eventually the phrase used in the former Dominions altered to mirror that of the UK, becoming, for example, ''Her Majesty's Australian Government''.

==Usage==
[[File:HM Government.png|thumb|right|The [[Wordmark (graphic identity)|wordmark]] for the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], showing the abbreviation ''HM'' for ''Her Majesty's'']]
The term is employed in order to signify that the government of a Commonwealth realm or,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1367 |last=Government of Canada |authorlink=Government of Canada |title=Speech From the Throne &gt; Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309072021/http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1367 |archivedate=9 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; less commonly, a division thereof, belongs to the reigning sovereign, and not to the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or [[prime minister]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Cox| first=Noel| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| volume=9| issue=3| page=12| publisher=Murdoch University| location=Perth| date=September 2002| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |date=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; though individual governments (also known as [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministries]]) may be identified by reference to the prime minister who chairs the cabinet at the time; the ''[[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government'' or ''[[Michael Manley|Manley]] government'', for example.

Today, however, most Commonwealth realm governments, other than that of the UK (where the abbreviation ''HMG'' is frequently used), have reverted to predominantly using the form ''Government of [region]'', with ''Her Majesty's Government'' being typically employed in formal circumstances. Within federations, such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], disambiguation between federal, provincial, or state governments is sometimes required—for instance, a 1989 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] decision refers to "Her Majesty's Government for the Province of [[Nova Scotia]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court| url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989rcs2-796/1989rcs2-796.html| litigants=Mackeigan v. Hickman| vol=2| reporter=S.C.R.| opinion=796| court=Supreme Court of Canada| date=5 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;—while in foreign affairs a national qualifier can be employed to differentiate between the governments of different monarchies; ''Her Britannic Majesty's Government'' for example.

'''Howard Fine''' is an American acting teacher, theater director, and author. He is the founder of the Howard Fine Acting Studio in [[Hollywood]] and in [[Melbourne]], Australia

==Early life==
Fine was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], he is the youngest of five children. His parents, Max, an American [[G.I. (military)|GI]], and Nelly, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, were married in Shanghai before returning to the U.S. Due to a fluke scheduling conflict between French and German classes, Fine ended up taking his first theater class in high school. Fine's drama teacher spotted his directing talent and entrusted him with his first play to direct, [[Edward Albee]]'s ''The Sandbox'', at the age of 16. He was first introduced to the work of his mentor, [[Uta Hagen]], while in high school. Fine's high school drama teacher taught from Hagen's first book, ''[[Respect for Acting]]'', and would eventually take his class to New York City to watch classes at Hagen's studio. Howard never studied with Uta as an actor, and by the time they met they were each established teachers in their field. Their mutual love of teaching led to a close friendship between them which lasted until Hagen's death in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-13|title=Uta Hagen|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uta_Hagen&amp;oldid=810192964|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Fine completed his BA in Communication/Theater at Rhode Island College. After completing graduate school in [[Boston]], Fine moved to New York City, where he landed his first teaching job at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]]. After one semester of teaching, he was promoted to head of the Acting Department at the age of 24, making him the youngest head in the studio’s history. It was here that he developed a year-long training program known as "The Foundation", a version of which he still teaches at his studios in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Australia]].

===Acting teacher===
In 1985, Fine moved to Los Angeles with his best friend, Voice coach [http://davidcoury.com/ David Coury]. Fine began his career in Los Angeles by privately coaching students in his living room, but in 1988, he had to expand to accommodate his growing classes. His studio relocated four times since this 1980's before occupying its present location, 317 N. La Brea Ave at Beverly Blvd. Fine received national recognition for his teaching in 2006 when named "Best Acting Teacher in Los Angeles" in ''Back Stage West''{{'s}} "Best of Los Angeles" issue.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.backstage.com/news/best-of-los-angeles/|title=Best of Los Angeles &amp;#124; Backstage|last=|first=|date=July 20, 2006|website=backstage.com|publisher=backstage.com|accessdate=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fine is still a full-time acting teacher and coach, and throughout the year he teaches his 9-week Foundation course, as well as several sections of ongoing scene study. His techniques are mostly derivative of [[Uta Hagen]]'s teachings, and offer actors a practical approach of working in all media: whereas most acting schools focus on either imagination or hyper-realism, Fine believes actors need both. The Howard Fine Acting Studio is home to a unique Speech &amp; Singing for Actors program, various intensives for actors of all experience levels, and a monthly series of entertainment industry talks made available to the public. He also offers annual masterclasses in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and at his studio in [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Australia]]. Howard is an adjunct faculty member for the University of Texas Austin's Theater &amp; Dance Department &lt;ref&gt;http://theatredance.utexas.edu/event/2017-bfa-actor-showcase&lt;/ref&gt;, and teaches students visiting from various college/conservatory programs at his Los Angeles studio. Fine has a list of students spanning decades which include working actors, celebrity singers, professional athletes, and artists who have gone on to win [[Tony Award|Tony]], [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], and [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.havenhurstmedia.com/books|title=hbooks|website=hbooks|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater director===
In addition to being an acting coach, Fine is also an accomplished theater director. He directed [[Michael Chiklis]] in his Broadway debut in Rob Becker's ''Defending the Caveman,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/search.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831092404/http://www.ibdb.com/search.asp |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his more notable credits include directing [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Ally Sheedy]], and [[Rachel Dratch]] in [[David Lindsay-Abaire]]'s ''That Other Person'' as part of the best of the 24-hour plays on Broadway.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Three One-acts: Crazy Eights, Baby Food, and That Other Person|author=Lindsay-Abaire, D.|date=2006|publisher=Dramatists Play Service|isbn=9780822221661|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVZbSVpmMyUC|page=36|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a Drama-logue award and received an Ovation Award nomination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/news/the-1997-theatre-la-ovation-awards/|title=The 1997 Theatre LA Ovation Awards|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his direction of [[Billy Campbell]]l in ''Fortinbras''.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/02/entertainment/ca-38284?pg=1|title='Ragtime' Sets a Record for Ovation Nominations - latimes|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Fine offers specifics on his technique as well as practical exercises designed to help actors in all levels of the industry. ''Fine on Acting'' is required reading for all prospective students at his studios. The book features a foreword by actor [[Michael Chiklis]] who writes, "His philosophy and approach to the craft of acting are the most helpful, encouraging and practically applicable I’ve ever encountered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.havenhurstmedia.com/books|title=hbooks|website=hbooks|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine also occasionally contributes to a [http://howardfine.com/blog/ blog] containing teaching insights, expanded thoughts from topics covered in his book, and new thoughts for actors in the ever-changing landscape of show business.

'''''In the Solitude of Cotton Fields''''' ({{lang|fr|Dans la solitude des champs de coton}}) is a two-character play by the French dramatist and writer [[Bernard-Marie Koltès]] (1948–1989) in 1985.

==Plot==
The play is performed in one act without intermission. Its two characters are nameless, identified as the Client and the Dealer. The author's instructions do not mention the location and time of day.

The exchanges between the two characters are crafted to avoid specifics and the audience remains unaware of the subject of their negotiations, though it is clear that the stakes are high. They appear to encounter one another by chance when the Dealer approaches the Client with an offer: "Tell me what you want that I can supply, and I will supply it." In the exchanges that follow they at times argumentative, even threatening, and often deliver lengthy monologues to one another. The conversation is intense, includes "animal imagery and oblique, hostile warnings", and has been described as "high-octane, sexually charged".&lt;ref name=jz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zinoman |first1=Jason |title=A Seller and a Buyer in a Puzzling Exchange |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/theater/reviews/in-the-solitude-of-cotton-fields-by-radoslaw-rychcik.html |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=New York Times |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience, in the words of one critic, is invited to consider: "Who are these characters with their talk of light and darkness, life and death, goodness and evil, peace and war? Are they individuals, social classes, races, nations? Is the deal life itself and the Client's walk life's journey? Is the Dealer's offer not sex or illicit substances but the promise and peril of human existence, a transaction that carries with it an inescapable conclusion?"&lt;ref name=lvg&gt;{{cite news |last1=Van Gelder |first1=Lawrence |title=Over at Grand Central, Questions, Questions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/05/theater/theater-review-over-at-grand-central-questions-questions.html |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=New York Times |date=5 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and reception==
The play premiered in January 1987 at the Théâtre Nanterre-Amandiers. It was presented on television in 1999 and that version was released on video in 1999.

The play was performed in its original French at the Edinburgh Festival. Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', Paul Taylor said that despite his initial misgivings and prejudices--he anticipated "howling boredom"--he was won over by "a staging of impressive intensity", notably the "palpable magnetism between [[Pascal Greggory]]'s tall, shaven-headed, vehemently fastidious Client and [[Patrice Chereau]]'s smaller, dishevelled, professionally pleading Dealer" and the "formal stateliness and a verbal elaboration" at odds with the setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Paul |title=Edinburgh Festival : Dans la solitude des champs de coton, Drill Hall, Edinburgh |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival-dans-la-solitude-des-champs-de-coton-drill-hall-edinburgh-1598883.html |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=The Independent |date=1 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was sent an English translation weeks before the performances and the staging, recognized as "potentially the riskiest Festival venture", was a "stunning success" with audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Villers |first1=Sara |title=That was Edinburgh that was: the highs and lows of an unrivalled feast for dedicated followers of theatre. Hitting the dizzy heights |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12088785.That_was_Edinburgh_that_was__the_highs_and_lows_of_an_unrivalled_feast_for_dedicated_followers_of_theatre______________Hitting_the_dizzy_heights/ |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=The Scotsman |date=4 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The play toured the UK in a production by the Actors Touring Company. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michael Billington said it had "a certain visceral power" in the original French but found the English-language production "like a piece of incredibly prolix underground theatre". He thought the play used a style and rhetoric specifically French and best suited to performance in its original language, far removed from traditional British theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Billington |first1=Michael |title=In the Solitude of Cotton Fields |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/sep/26/theatre.artsfeatures |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=25 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The play has been performed in an English translation by Jeffrey Wainwright.&lt;ref name=lvg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= In the Solitude of Cotton Fields (Modern Plays) | date=2001 | isbn= 978-0413771773| first=Bernard-Marie | last=Koltes | translator-first=Jeffery | translator-last= Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt; One New York production used a Polish text with English supertitles.&lt;ref name=jz/&gt;

The play was co-produced in Montreal by two theatre companies, "Sibyllines" and "Creation", from January 23 to February 10, 2018, at the Montreal theatre, Usine C. It was directed by Brigitte Haentjens and starred Hugues Frenette and Sebastien Ricard.

The '''Institute of Human Origins''' (IHO) is a [[non-profit]], multidisciplinary research organization dedicated to the recovery and analysis of the fossil evidence for [[human evolution]]. It was founded by the team of [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] that discovered [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], and became affiliated with [[Arizona State University]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institute of Human Origins|url=https://iho.asu.edu/sites/iho-dev.asu.edu/files/iho_newsletter_may_1997.pdf|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IHO received the single largest grant dedicated to the research of [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|human origins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/asu-air091714.php|accessdate=8 April 2016|agency=American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|publisher=EurekAlert: The Global Source for Science News|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asu-institute-receives-single-largest-investment-human-origins-research|website=Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, graduate student Chalachew Seyoum discovered the lower mandible known as [[LD 350-1]], the oldest fossil from the human genus [[Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery pushed back evidence of the human genus [[Homo]] to 2.8 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of 2.8-million-year-old jaw sheds light on early humans Date:|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304141454.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; ago, nearly a half-million years earlier than perviously known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing IHO field work in [[Hadar, Ethiopia]], where [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] was found in 1974, addresses the evolution and ecology of [[Australopithecus]] (3.0–3.4 million years ago) and the origin of Homo and stone-tool making (2.3 million years ago). 
In 2007, the field project opened ASU’s Hadar Field School, which educates American study abroad students in field methods in human origins research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Paleoanthropology Field School|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kreed/Classes.htm|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Emergence of Modern Humans in Africa===
Since joining IHO in 2001, [[Curtis Marean]] has directed the organization's [[Pinnacle Point]] fieldwork, which is currently working to produce and integrate a climate, environment, and paleoanthropological sequence for the final stage in human evolution. The focus of the Pinnacle Point excavations has been at [[Pinnacle Point|Cave 13B (PP13B)]], where the fieldwork team has discovered early evidence of [[symbolic behavior]]. In 2009, the examination of worked silcrete stone from [[Pinnacle Point]] indicated that it was heat-treated, and is the oldest known example of such technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Treatment Makes Better Stone Tools|url=http://www.becominghuman.org/node/news/heat-treatment-makes-better-stone-tools|website=Becoming Human}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle Point also represents the oldest known occurrence of human consumption of [[shellfish]], as well as an early use of [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|last2=Bar-Matthews|first2=M|last3=Bernatchez|first3=J|last4=Fisher|first4=E|last5=Goldberg|first5=P|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|issue=7164|pages=905-U11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features indicate a sophisticated level of modern behaviors that had previously been associated with Upper Paleolithic of Europe. The discoveries here are key pieces of evidence supporting the early florescence of modern human behaviors in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Evolutionary Foundations of Human Uniqueness===
The IHO Templeton Research Program is a collaborative inquiry into the evolutionary foundations of human uniqueness. The $4.9 million, three-year grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] is the largest of its type for human origins research, and will support 11 linked investigations of where, when, and how unique human capacities for complex cognition, cumulative culture, and large-scale cooperation emerged.&lt;ref name="IHO Templeton Research Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=IHO Templeton Research Program|url=https://iho.asu.edu/research/iho-templeton-research-program|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">'''Isaac Mendes Belisario''' (1795 – 1849) was a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] artist of [[History of the Jews in Jamaica|Jewish]] descent. He was active in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] around the time of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|Emancipation]]. His painting and printing work provides an eye-witness document of life in Jamaica of the time. He is one of the earliest artists who took a Jamaica-centric approach to the island's culture. His portfolio includes the lithograph ''Sketches of Character, In Illustration of the Habits, Occupation, and Costume of the Negro Population in the Island of Jamaica'', which was published in collaboration with the lithographer [[Adolphe Duperly]] in 1837–38, documents activities of the former slaves immediately after the emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Barringer]], Gillian Forrester, Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz (eds), ''Art and Emancipation in Jamaica: Belisario and his Worlds'', Yale Center for British Art, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prints are the earliest visual representation of the masquerade of [[John Canoe]].

[[File:JohnnyPanic.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Faber and Faber]])]]
'''''Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams''''' is a collection of short stories by [[Sylvia Plath]]. It was [[wikt:Special:Search/posthumous|posthumously]] published in 1977 as a collection of thirteen short stories, including the title story.

As more of Plath's work was unearthed down the years, a second edition was published with many new stories. The second edition is split into four parts, and includes many new stories, some of which were very personal to Plath. As Plath's husband at the time of her death in 1963, fellow poet and writer [[Ted Hughes]] managed the publication and distribution of all her unpublished works, including her poetry.

The English Band [[Tears for Fears]] has [[Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams (song)|a song named after this work]].

'''Men's studies in the Caribbean''' is an emerging interdisciplinary field that has its roots in family studies programs of the 1950s and 60s, and in feminine studies programs of the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name=Barrow&gt;Barrow, Christine. (1998). "Caribbean Gender Ideologies: Introduction and Overview". In Christine Barrow (Ed.), Caribbean Portraits: essays on Gender Ideologies and Identities, pp.xi-xxxviii. Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Caribbean]], [[gender studies]] have concentrated primarily on "retrieving Caribbean women from historical 'invisibility'",&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Downes, Aviston, D. (2004). "Boys of the Empire: Elite Education and the Construction of Hegemonic Masculinity in Barbados, 1875-1920". In Rhoda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.105-136. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press&lt;/ref&gt; but [[men's studies]] is also becoming increasingly popular.

== History ==
In 1991 Barry Chevannes formed Fathers Incorporated, a group catering largely to working-class Jamaican men. The group aimed to counter negative stereotypes of men in the region and to install a sense of responsibility in men towards their children and society. Since 1997, Fathers Incorporated has presented an annual "Model Father" award to recognize fathers who "love, nurture, and provide for their families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fathers Incorporated - Jamaica | work=The Communication Initiative Network| url =http://www.comminit.com/en/node/118995| accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for Gender and Development Studies, established by the University of the West Indies (UWI) in 1993, contributes to the scholarship on Caribbean masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fathers Incorporated - Jamaica | work=The Communication Initiative Network| url =http://gender.uwichill.edu.bb/| accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses on men's studies have been introduced on all three campuses of the university.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; Scholarship on Caribbean masculinity began with a focus on male marginalization within both the education system and the family.

== Male marginalization within the family ==
The Caribbean family has been the subject of continuing scholarly attention since the 1930s, likely due to the seemingly matrifocal family structure.&lt;ref name=Morrissey&gt;Morrissey, Marietta. (1998). "Explaining the Caribbean Family: Gender Ideologies and Gender Relations". In Christine Barrow (Ed.), Caribbean Portraits: essays on Gender Ideologies and Identities, pp.78-90. Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  On average, the woman-headed family would earn less than a male-headed family.  Marietta Morrissey noted that male migration was often a factor in these women-headed families and that it was not unusual for men to be absent for years.  These men would send back money whenever possible to support their families.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Although men did not always reside with their families, they did maintain influence, causing Morrissey to comment that, “male authority embodied in the patriarchal family is often an ideal in so-called matrifocal societies.”&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Caribbean societies are not strictly matrifocal because families move in and out of matrifocality. They try to establish nuclear families, sometimes successfully, but may return to a matrifocal structure if the attempt ends in failure.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Age can be a factor in whether or not a nuclear family structure is established because older men are often in better positions to support women and children.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;

Despite claims of objectivity from anthropologists in the 1950s, early Caribbean anthropology showed marked ethnocentrism in labeling non-nuclear family structures "incomplete". It also failed to recognize visiting unions, regardless of the duration of a couple’s relationship or the presence of children in the union.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;

According to the male marginalization theory, men are peripheral to the family.  The familial roles of men are perceived as being limited to providing economic support and occasional discipline,&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; yet men are commonly seen to be inadequate even in these limited roles. Although the stereotype of the breadwinner is particularly prevalent in Caribbean masculinity, little employment is available to men and they must migrate elsewhere to provide for their families.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;   Christine Barrow challenges the idea of male marginalization in the family and suggested that Caribbean men show strong bonds to their mothers.  Males commonly lived with, and assumed responsibility for, their mothers well into adulthood, a task they saw as natural reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; In addition, they often took responsibility for their siblings, and more rarely for their nieces and nephews.

== Male academic underachievement ==
Mark Figueroa wrote that the "decline of male, relative to female, academic performance in the Caribbean… has captured the attention of professionals."&lt;ref name=Figueroa&gt;Figueroa, Mark. (2004). "Male Privileging and Male "Academic Underperformance" in Jamaica". In Rhonda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.137-166. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the common entrance examination, the first level of testing, Jamaican females achieve a higher number of places than males.  This includes discriminatory practices employed in some Caribbean territories, which favor male students to redress the balance.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;  The imbalance in academic performance continues at the university level.  By the end of 1992, 70% of graduates from the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies were female, and Odette Parry's sample of Jamaican schools revealed that there is less than one male teacher for every four female ones.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;Parry, Odette. (2004). "Masculinities, Myths and Educational Underachievement: Jamaica, Barbados, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines". In Rhonda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.167-184. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the theory of male marginalization, introduced by Miller, is popularly held, it has been suggested that male academic underperformance is rooted in male privileging and gender socialization.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt; At home, boys are “expected to misbehave while girls are expected to conform to a rigid code.  If a boy misbehaves it is essentially expected, but if a girl does so it is a serious matter.”&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;&lt;!--   Males inherently have more freedom in society and as a result may not have the same success in the academic system because they have not developed essential skills as females, who are required to adhere to a code of behaviour.  These skills include the ability to sit still and listen, and the ability to follow what others say rather than one’s own aims.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;
 --&gt;
Research has also indicated that male academic under-performance is misleading and that it is actually a matter of differential gender performance. Within Caribbean academia, traditional patterns of study exist.  Boys have identified English and reading as "too girlish" for males,&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt; and Parry's study indicated that even female teachers perceived English and grammar as being women's subjects.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt; Female dominance can be explained in certificate programs because "their male counterparts do not need further qualifications to get ahead."&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;

Jamaica's recent statistics on education have indicated that females now outperform males at all levels and in a wide range of disciplines, including some formerly dominated by males.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;  Women have been the majority among Jamaican students since 1974-75 across all three campuses of UWI. In 1974 women made up nearly 80% of students in the arts and education disciplines but less than 40% of students in law, medicine, and natural sciences.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;

Research has also indicated an anti-academic male sex/gender identity.  Parry wrote that “according to teachers, males are sexually rejected by their female peers”.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37567">'''Martial arts''' are codified systems and traditions of [[combat]] practiced for a number of reasons such as [[self-defense]], [[war|military]] and [[law enforcement]] applications, physical, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's [[intangible cultural heritage]].

Although the term ''[[:wikt:martial art|martial art]]'' has become associated with the fighting arts of [[East Asia]], it originally referred to the combat systems of [[Europe]] as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from [[Latin (language)|Latin]] and means "arts of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]", the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clements |first=John |title=A Short Introduction to Historical European Martial Arts |journal=Meibukan Magazine |date=January 2006 |issue=Special Edition No. 1 |pages=2–4 |url=http://meibukanmagazine.org/Downloads/MMSpecialEdition1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318130111/http://www.meibukanmagazine.org/Downloads/MMSpecialEdition1.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that '''fighting arts''' or '''fighting systems''' would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never "martial" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] and P'ng Chye Khim | title=Shaolin Lohan Kung-fu |year=1979 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young boxers fresco, Akrotiri, Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The martial art of [[boxing]] was practiced in the ancient [[Santorini|Thera]].]]

==Variation and scope==
Martial arts may be categorized along a variety of criteria, including:
*Traditional or historical arts vs. contemporary styles of [[folk wrestling]] and modern [[hybrid martial arts]].
*Techniques taught: Armed vs. [[unarmed combat|unarmed]], and within these groups by type of weapon ([[swordsmanship]], [[stick fighting]] etc.) and by type of combat ([[grappling]] vs. [[Strike (attack)|striking]]; [[stand-up fighting]] vs. [[ground fighting]])
*By application or intent: [[self-defense]], [[combat sport]], [[choreographed fight|choreography]] or demonstration of forms, [[physical fitness]], [[meditation]], etc.
*Within [[Chinese tradition]]: [[External martial arts|"external"]] vs. [[Neijia|"internal"]] styles

===By technical focus===
;Unarmed
Unarmed martial arts can be broadly grouped into focusing on [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], those focusing on [[grappling]] and those that cover both fields, often described as [[hybrid martial arts]].

'''[[Strike (attack)|Strikes]]'''
* '''[[Punch (combat)|Punching]]''': [[Boxing]], [[Wing Chun]], [[Karate]]
* '''[[Kick]]ing''': [[Taekwondo]], [[Capoeira]], [[Savate]]
* Others using strikes: [[Muay Thai]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Pencak Silat]]

'''[[Grappling]]'''
* '''[[Throw (grappling)|Throwing]]''': [[Hapkido]], [[Judo]], [[Sumo]], [[Wrestling]], [[Aikido]]
* '''[[Joint lock]]'''/'''[[Chokeholds]]'''/'''[[Submission holds]]''':[[Judo]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]
* '''[[Pinning hold|Pinning Techniques]]''': [[Judo]], [[Wrestling]], [[Aikido]]

;Armed

The traditional martial arts, which train [[armed combat]], often encompass a wide spectrum of [[melee weapons]], including [[bladed weapon]]s and [[polearms]]. Such traditions include [[eskrima]], [[silat]], [[kalaripayat]], [[Okinawan kobudo|kobudo]], and [[historical European martial arts]], especially those of the [[German Renaissance]]. Many [[Chinese martial arts]] also feature weapons as part of their curriculum.

Sometimes, training with one specific weapon will be considered a style of martial arts in its own right, which is especially the case in [[Japanese martial arts]] with disciplines such as [[kenjutsu]] and [[kendo]] (sword), [[bojutsu]] (staff), and [[kyudo]] (archery). Similarly, modern martial arts and sports include [[modern fencing]], stick-fighting systems like [[canne de combat]] and [[jogo do pau]], and [[modern competitive archery]].

===By application or intent===
;Combat-oriented
{{main|Combat sport|Self-defense}}
;Health-oriented
Many martial arts, especially those from [[Asia]], also teach side disciplines which pertain to medicinal practices. This is particularly prevalent in traditional [[Asian martial arts]] which may teach [[bone-setting]], herbalism, and other aspects of traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiflow.com/html/gas_kungfu.htm |title=Internal Kung Fu |publisher=Chiflow.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{anchor|Spirituality}}Spirituality-oriented
Martial arts can also be linked with religion and spirituality. Numerous systems are reputed to have been founded, disseminated, or practiced by monks or nuns.

Throughout Asia, meditation may be incorporated as part of training. In those countries influenced by Hindu-Buddhist philosophy, the art itself may be used as an aid to attaining enlightenment.

[[Japan]]ese styles, when concerning non-physical qualities of the combat, are often strongly influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhist philosophy. Concepts like "empty mind" and "beginner's mind" are recurrent. [[Aikido]], for instance, can have a strong philosophical belief of the flow of energy and peace fostering, as idealised by its founder [[Morihei Ueshiba]].

Traditional [[Korea]]n martial arts place emphasis on the development of the practitioner's spiritual and philosophical development. A common theme in most Korean styles, such as [[taekkyeon]] and [[taekwondo]], is the value of "inner peace" in a practitioner, which is stressed to be only achieved through individual meditation and training. The Koreans believe that the use of physical force is only justified through defense.

[[Systema]] draws upon breathing and relaxation techniques, as well as elements of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought, to foster self-conscience and calmness, and to benefit the practitioner in different levels: the physical, the psychological and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianmartialart.com/main.php?page=philosophy |title=Philosophy aspects of Systema |publisher=Russian Martial Art - Systema Headquarters |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some martial arts in various cultures can be performed in [[dance]]-like settings for various reasons, such as for evoking ferocity in preparation for battle or showing off skill in a more stylized manner. Many such martial arts incorporate music, especially strong percussive rhythms. (See also [[war dance]].)

[[Chinese martial arts]] originated during the legendary, possibly apocryphal, [[Xia Dynasty]] more than 4000 years ago. It is said the [[Yellow Emperor]] Huangdi (legendary date of ascension 2698&amp;nbsp;BC) introduced the earliest fighting systems to [[China]]. The Yellow Emperor is described as a famous [[general]] who before becoming [[China]]'s leader, wrote lengthy treatises on medicine, [[astrology]] and martial arts. One of his main opponents was [[Chi You]] who was credited as the creator of jiao di, a forerunner to the modern art of [[Chinese wrestling]].

The foundation of modern [[Asian martial arts]] is likely a blend of early [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] and [[Indian martial arts]]. During the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]] (480-221&amp;nbsp;BC) extensive development in martial philosophy and strategy emerged, as described by [[Sun Tzu]] in ''[[The Art of War]]'' (c. 350&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonshi.com/why.html |title=Sun Tzu Biography and Introduction: Sun Tzu The Art of War and Strategy Site by |publisher=Sonshi. Com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legendary accounts link the origin of [[Shaolinquan]] to the [[spread of Buddhism]] from [[ancient India]] during the early 5th century AD, with the figure of [[Bodhidharma]], to [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Howard and Croucher, Michael.

In Europe, the earliest sources of martial arts traditions date to [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Ancient Greek Boxing|Boxing]] (''pygme'', ''pyx''), [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] (''pale'') and [[pankration]]  were represented in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] produced [[Gladiator|gladiatorial combat]] as a public spectacle.

A number of historical [[combat manual]]s have survived from the European [[Middle Ages]]. This includes such styles as [[Historical fencing|sword and shield]], [[two-handed swordfighting]]  and other types of [[melee weapons]] besides unarmed combat. Amongst these are transcriptions of [[Johannes Liechtenauer]]'s mnemonic poem on the longsword dating back to the late fourteenth century. Likewise, Asian martial arts became well-documented during the medieval period, [[Japanese martial arts]] beginning with the establishment of the [[samurai]] nobility in the 12th century, [[Chinese martial arts]] with [[Ming dynasty|Ming era]] treatises such as [[Ji Xiao Xin Shu]], [[Indian martial arts]] in medieval texts such as the [[Agni Purana]] and the [[Malla Purana]], and [[Korean martial arts]] from the [[Joseon]] era and texts such as [[Muyejebo]] (1598).

European swordsmanship always had a sportive component, but the [[duel]] was always a possibility until [[World War I]]. Modern [[fencing|sport fencing]] began developing during the 19th century as the French and Italian military academies began codifying instruction. The Olympic games led to standard international rules, with the Féderation Internationale d'Escrime founded in 1913.  Modern boxing originates with [[Jack Broughton]]'s rules in the 18th century, and reaches its present form with the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]] of 1867.

===Folk styles===
{{main|Folk wrestling}}
Certain traditional combat sports and fighting styles exist all over the world, rooted in local culture and folklore. The most common of these are styles of [[folk wrestling]], some of which have been practiced since antiquity and are found in the most remote areas. Other examples include forms of [[stick fighting]] and boxing. While these arts are based on historical traditions of folklore, they are not "historical" in the sense that they reconstruct or preserve a historical system from a specific era. They are rather contemporary regional sports that coexist with the modern forms of martial arts sports as they have developed since the 19th century, often including cross-fertilization between sports and folk styles; thus, the traditional Thai art of [[muay boran]] developed into the modern national sport of [[muay Thai]], which in turn came to be practiced worldwide and contributed significantly to modern hybrid styles like [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]]. [[Singlestick]], an English martial art can be seen often utilized in [[morris dancing]]. Many European dances share elements of martial arts with examples including Ukrainian [[Hopak]], Polish Zbójnicki (use of [[ciupaga]]), the Czech dance [[odzemek]], and the Norwegian [[Halling (dance)|Halling]].

===Modern history===
{{further|Modern history of East Asian martial arts}}
;Late 19th to early 20th century
The mid to late 19th century marks the beginning of the history of martial arts as modern sports developed out of earlier traditional fighting systems. In Europe, this concerns the developments of [[boxing]] and [[fencing]] as sports. In Japan, the same period marks the formation of the modern forms of [[judo]], [[jujutsu]], [[karate]], and [[kendo]] (among others) based on revivals of [[koryu|old schools]] of [[Edo period]] martial arts which had been suppressed during the [[Meiji Restoration]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Modern [[muay Thai]] rules date to the 1920s. In China, the modern history of martial arts begins in the [[Nanjing decade]] (1930s) following the foundation of the [[Central Guoshu Institute]] in 1928 under the [[Kuomintang]] government.

Western interest in [[Asian martial arts]] arises towards the end of the 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the United States with China and Japan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Relatively few Westerners actually practiced the arts, considering it to be mere performance. [[Edward William Barton-Wright]], a railway engineer who had studied [[jujutsu]] while working in Japan between 1894 and 1897, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic style named [[Bartitsu]] which combined [[jujutsu]], [[judo]], wrestling, boxing, savate and [[stick fighting]].

[[Fencing]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] was included in the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].
[[FILA Wrestling World Championships]] and [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics]] were introduced in 1904.
The tradition of awarding [[championship belt]]s in wrestling and boxing can be traced to the [[Lonsdale Belt]], introduced in 1909.

The [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|International Boxing Association]] was established in 1920. [[World Fencing Championships]] have been held since 1921.

As Western influence grew in Asia a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan and South Korea during World War II and the [[Korean War]] and were exposed to local fighting styles. Jujutsu, judo and karate first became popular among the mainstream from the 1950s-60s. Due in part to Asian and Hollywood [[martial arts movies]], most modern American martial arts are either Asian-derived or Asian influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Martial Arts as Moneymakers|publisher= The New York Times|date=1988-08-28|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/business/the-martial-arts-as-moneymakers.html?scp=84&amp;sq=chuck%20norris&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-12-04|first=David|last=Berreby}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term [[kickboxing]] (キックボクシング) was created by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a variant of muay Thai and karate that he created in the 1950s. [[American kickboxing]] was developed in the 1970s, as a combination of boxing and karate. [[Taekwondo]] was developed in the context of the [[Korean War]] in the 1950s.

The later 1960s and 1970s witnessed an increased media interest in [[Chinese martial arts]], influenced by martial artist [[Bruce Lee]]. Bruce Lee is credited as one of the first instructors to openly teach [[Chinese martial arts]] to Westerners.&lt;ref name="absolutedefense.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://absolutedefense.net/html/jeet_kune_do.html|title=Jeet Kune Do|publisher=absolutedefense.net|accessdate=2014-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717143650/http://absolutedefense.net/html/jeet_kune_do.html|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Judo Championships]] have been held since 1956, [[Judo at the Summer Olympics]] was introduced in 1964. [[Karate World Championships]] were introduced in 1970.

Following the "kung fu wave" in [[Hong Kong action cinema]] in the 1970s, a number of mainstream films produced during the 1980s contributed significantly to the perception of martial arts in western [[popular culture]]. These include ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'' (1984) and ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' (1988). This era produced some [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] action stars with martial arts background, such as [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and [[Chuck Norris]].

Also during the 20th century, a number of martial arts were adapted for [[self-defense]] purposes for military [[hand-to-hand combat]]. [[World War II combatives]], [[KAPAP]] (1930s) and [[Krav Maga]] (1950s) in Israel, [[Systema]] in Soviet-era Russia, and [[Sanshou]] in the People's Republic of China are examples of such systems. The [[US military]] de-emphasized hand-to-hand combat training during the [[Cold War period]], but revived it with the introduction of [[LINE (combat system)|LINE]] in 1989.

;1990 to present
During the 1990s [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] became popular and proved to be effective in mixed martial arts competitions such as the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] and [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]].&lt;ref name=UNCstyles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.Styles |title=fighting art used in the UFC |publisher=Ufc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523232346/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.Styles |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the first [[Pancrase]] event was held.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/3/29/5560430/origins-history-rules-early-days-old-pancrase-mma-bas-rutten-shamrock-japanese|title=The origins, history and rules from the early days of Pancrase circa 1993 - Bloody Elbow|publisher=bloodyelbow.com|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[K-1]] rules of kickboxing were introduced based on 1980s [[Seidokaikan]] karate.

[[Jackie Chan]] and [[Jet Li]] are prominent movie figures who have been responsible for promoting Chinese martial arts in recent years.

With the continual discovery of more [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] fighting manuals, the practice of [[Historical European Martial Arts]] and other [[Western Martial Arts]] are growing in popularity across the United States and Europe.

November 29, 2011, [[UNESCO]] inscribed [[taekkyeon]] onto its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00452|title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reviving of lost martial arts ===
Many martial arts which originated in [[South India|Southern India]] were banned by the government of the [[British Empire|British Raj]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; few of them which barely survived are [[Kalaripayattu]] and [[Silambam]]. These and other martial arts survived by telling the British government it was a form of dance. [[Varma kalai]], a martial arts concentrating on vital points, was almost dead but is gradually being revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Testing and competition==
Testing or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. Students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement, such as a different [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or [[sparring]].
[[File:Steven Ho Martial Arts Kick.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Ho (martial artist)|Steven Ho]] executing a Jump Spin [[Hook Kick]]]]
Various forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments. Some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules, these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions. Rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into ''light-contact'', ''medium-contact'', and ''full-contact'' variants, reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent.

===Light- and medium-contact===
These types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent, in the case of light sparring this is usually to 'touch' contact, e.g. a punch should be 'pulled' as soon as or before contact is made. In medium-contact (sometimes referred to as semi-contact) the punch would not be 'pulled' but not hit with full force. As the amount of force used is restricted, the aim of these types of sparring is not to [[knock out]] an opponent; a point system is used in competitions.

A referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match, while judges mark down scores, as in boxing. Particular targets may be prohibited, certain techniques may be forbidden (such as headbutting or groin hits), and fighters may be required to wear [[Personal protective equipment|protective equipment]]&lt;!-- We need a better article than this to link to --&gt; on their head, hands, chest, groin, shins or feet. Some grappling arts, such as aikido, use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact.

In some styles (such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring), competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee, whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match, award a point, then restart the match. Alternatively, sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges. Some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness. Lighter-contact sparring may be used exclusively, for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate (such as beginners), medium-contact sparring is often used as training for full contact.

===Full-contact===
{{further|Full-contact}}
Full-contact sparring or competition, where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies, has a number of tactical differences from light and medium-contact sparring. It is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.straightblastgym.com/aliveness101.html|title= Aliveness 101|accessdate= 2008-11-03|publisher= Straight Blast gym|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090107052738/http://www.straightblastgym.com./aliveness101.html|archivedate= 2009-01-07|df= }} – An essay on contact levels in training&lt;/ref&gt;

In full-contact sparring, the aim of a competitive match is to [[knock out]] the opponent or to force the opponent to [[submission wrestling|submit]].
Where scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure, only used if no clear winner has been established by other means; in some competitions, such as the [[UFC 1]], there was no scoring, though most now use some form of judging as a backup.&lt;ref name=UFC1&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AuvUi2TrSN_ILBVsuNLmsjk9Eo14?slug=dm-earlyufc111207&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns|title= First UFC forever altered combat sports |accessdate=2008-11-03 |publisher= Yahoo! Sports |date =November 12, 2007|author = Dave Meltzer, }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these factors, full-contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character, but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment, or limit the techniques allowed.

Nearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Pancrase]], [[Shooto]] use a form of full-contact rules as do [[Professional Boxing|professional boxing]] organizations and [[K-1]]. [[Kyokushin]] [[karate]] requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate ''gi'' and groin protector. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by the [[World Taekwondo Federation#Sparring|World Taekwondo Federation]] requires the use of [[Headgear (martial arts)|Headgear]] and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body, and win by [[knockout]] is possible.

===Martial sport===
{{see also|Combat sport}}
[[File:050907-M-7747B-002-Judo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Several martial arts, such as [[judo]], are [[Olympic sports]].]]
Martial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of [[sparring]] become competitive, becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while [[Wushu (sport)|Chinese wushu]] recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as [[kickboxing]] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as [[aikido]]  generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.

The question of "which is the best martial art" has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations. This was the origin of the first [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] tournament (later renamed [[UFC 1|UFC 1: The Beginning]]) in the U.S. inspired by the [[Brazil]]ian [[Vale tudo]] tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions, most notably those from Japan such as [[Shooto]] and [[Pancrase]], have evolved into the [[combat sport]] of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

Some martial artists compete in non-sparring competitions such as [[Breaking (martial arts)|breaking]] or choreographed routines of techniques such as [[poomse]], [[kata]] and [[aka (burmese)|aka]], or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance-influenced competitions such as tricking. Martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport-like for political purposes; the central impetus for the attempt by the People's Republic of China in transforming Chinese martial arts into the committee-regulated sport of [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] was suppressing what they saw as the potentially [[subversion (politics)|subversive]] aspects of martial training, especially under the traditional system of family lineages.&lt;ref name="Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fu |first=Zhongwen | title=Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan |origyear=1996|year=2006 |publisher=Blue Snake Books |location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and fitness benefits==
Martial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees, such as their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-5391.2010.01107.x/abstract|title=Effects of martial arts on health status: A systematic review | doi=10.1111/j.1756-5391.2010.01107.x | volume=3|issue=4|journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine|pages=205–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through systematic practice in the martial arts a person's [[physical fitness]] may be boosted (strength, stamina, speed, flexibility, movement coordination, etc.) as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
Beyond contributing to physical fitness, martial arts training also has benefits for [[mental health]], contributing to [[self-esteem]], [[self-control]], [[emotional]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] well-being. For this reason, a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects, de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self-defense or combat completely.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to [[Bruce Lee]], martial arts also have the nature of an [[art]], since there is emotional communication and complete emotional expression.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Self-defense, military and law enforcement applications==
{{Main|Hand-to-hand combat|Self-defense}}
[[File:ArmyMilCombativesChokehold.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[U.S. Army]] Combatives instructor [[Matt Larsen]] demonstrates a [[chokehold]].]]
Some traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training. Perhaps the most recent example of this is [[point shooting]] which relies on [[muscle memory]] to more effectively utilize a [[firearm]] in a variety of awkward situations, much the way an [[iaido]]ka would master movements with their sword.

During the World War II era [[William E. Fairbairn]] and [[Eric A. Sykes]] were recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to teach their martial art of [[defendu]] (itself drawing on Western boxing and jujutsu) and pistol shooting to UK, US, and Canadian special forces. The book ''Kill or Get Killed'', written by Colonel [[Rex Applegate]], was based on the defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn's ''Get Tough'' and Appelgate's ''Kill or Get Killed'' became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.

Traditional hand-to-hand, knife, and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today's wars. Examples of this include European [[Unifight]], the [[US Army]]'s [[Combatives]] system developed by [[Matt Larsen]], the [[Israeli army]]'s [[KAPAP]]  and [[Krav Maga]], and the [[US Marine Corps]]'s ''[[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]]'' (MCMAP). Unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of [[Fiore dei Liberi]] and the [[Codex Wallerstein]] were integrated into the U.S. Army's [[training manual]]s in 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

and continue to influence today's systems along with other traditional systems such as [[eskrima]] and [[silat]].

The rifle-mounted [[bayonet]] which has its origin in the [[spear]], has seen use by the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Marine Corps]], and the [[British Army]] as recently as the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1464411/British-battalion-attacked-every-day-for-six-weeks.html |title= British battalion 'attacked every day for six weeks'|accessdate= 2008-12-11 |author= Sean Rayment|date= 2004-06-13|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher= [[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many martial arts are also seen and used in Law Enforcement hand to hand training. For example, the [[Tokyo]] Riot Police's use of [[aikido]].&lt;ref name="Twigger1997"&gt;Twigger, R. (1997): ''Angry White Pyjamas''. London: Phoenix. ({{ISBN|978-0-7538-0858-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial arts industry==
Martial arts since the 1970s has become a significant industry, a subset of the wider [[sport industry]] (including [[martial arts films|cinema]] and [[sports television]]).

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide practice some form of martial art.
Web Japan (sponsored by the [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]) claims there are 50&amp;nbsp;million karate practitioners worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/e16_martial_art.pdf |format=PDF |title=Martial Arts : Fact Sheet |publisher=Web-japan.org |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The South Korean government in 2009 published an estimate that taekwondo is practiced by 70&amp;nbsp;million people in 190 countries.&lt;ref name="Kim2009"&gt;Kim, H.-S. (2009): [http://www.mcst.go.kr/english/issue/issueView.jsp?pSeq=1401 Taekwondo: A new strategy for Brand Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723160119/http://www.mcst.go.kr/english/issue/issueView.jsp?pSeq=1401 |date=2011-07-23 }} (21 December 2009). Retrieved on 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wholesale value of martial arts related sporting equipment shipped in the [[United States]] was estimated at 314&amp;nbsp;million USD in 2007; participation in the same year was estimated at 6.9&amp;nbsp;million (ages 6 or older, 2% of US population).&lt;ref&gt;Jack W. Plunkett, ''Plunkett's Sports Industry Almanac 2009'', {{ISBN|978-1-59392-140-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
R. A. Court, CEO of Martial Arts Channel, stated the total revenue of the US martial arts industry at USD 40&amp;nbsp;billion and the number of US practitioners at 30&amp;nbsp;million in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FtwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;hl=fr&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Black Belt Magazine] September 2003, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
Martial arts equipment can include that used for conditioning, protection and [[List of martial arts weapons|weapons]]. [[Hojo undō|Specialized conditioning equipment]] can include [[breaking board]]s, dummy partners such as the [[Muk Yan Jong|wooden dummy]], and targets such as [[punching bag]]s and the [[makiwara]]. [[Personal protective equipment|Protective equipment]] for sparring and competition includes [[boxing gloves]] and [[Headgear (martial arts)|headgear]].

===Martial arts fraud===
{{anchor|martial arts fraud}}
[[Asian martial arts]] experienced a surge of popularity in the west during the 1970s, and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools. Fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies, this led to the [[ninja craze]] of the 1980s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Black Belt Magazine]], June 1999, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs, inserted into comic books circa the 1960s and 1970s, which were read primarily by adolescent boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/the-deadliest-ads-alive/ |title=The Deadliest Ads Alive! &amp;#124; Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the martial arts came to the United States in the seventies, lower ranks ([[kyu]]) began to be given colorful belts to show progress.  This proved to be commercially viable and colored-belt systems were adopted in many martial arts [[degree mill]]s (also known as ''McDojos'' and ''Belt Factories'') as a means to generate additional cash. This was covered in ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' [[List of Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! episodes#Season 8: 2010|episode "Martial Arts"]] (June 2010).

[[File:Piccinni L'Avaro.jpg|thumb|A detail from ''L'Avaro'', a print by [[Antonio Piccinni]] (1878)]]

A '''miser''' is a person who is reluctant to spend, sometimes to the point of forgoing even basic comforts and some necessities, in order to hoard money or other possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/miser|title=miser - definition of miser in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the word is sometimes used loosely to characterise anyone who is mean with their money, if such behaviour is not accompanied by taking delight in what is saved, it is not properly miserly.

Misers as a type have been a perennial object of popular fascination and a fruitful source for writers and artists in many cultures.

==Accounting for misers==
One attempt to account for miserly behaviour was [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[anal retentiveness]], attributing the development of miserly behaviour to [[toilet training]] in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m1UQI4QpVsC&amp;pg=PT232 |title=Foundations of psychology |author=Nicky Hayes |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this explanation is not accepted by modern evidence-based psychology.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{cite book |last = Berger |first = Kathleen |title = The Developing Person |publisher = Worth Publishers |year = 2000 |location = New York |pages = 218 |isbn = 1-57259-417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Christian West the attitude to those whose interest centred on gathering money has been coloured by the teachings of the Church. From its point of view, both the miser and the [[usury|usurer]] were guilty of the cardinal sin of [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|avarice]] and the two were often confounded.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Newhauser, The Early History of Greed: The Sin of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature, Cambridge 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to the parable of [[the Elm and the Vine]] in the quasi-Biblical [[Shepherd of Hermas]], the rich and the poor should be in a relationship of mutual support. Those with wealth are in need of the prayers of the poor for their salvation and can only earn them by acts of charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/002/0020024.htm|title=Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol II: THE PASTOR OF HERMAS: Similitude Second.  As the Vine is Supported by the Elm, So is the Rich Man Helped by the Prayer of the Poor.|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical late example of Christian doctrine on the subject is the Reverend [[Erskine Neale]]'s ''The Riches that Bring No Sorrow'' (1852), a moralising work based on a succession of biographies contrasting philanthropists and misers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/richesthatbring00nealgoog#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The Riches that Bring No Sorrow|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running parallel has been a disposition, inherited from Classical times, to class miserly behaviour as a type of [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]]. Accounts of misers were included in such 19th century works as G. H. Wilson's four-volume compendium of short biographies, ''The Eccentric Mirror'' (1807).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/eccentricmirror03wilsgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=The Eccentric Mirror:: Reflecting a Faithful and Interesting Delineation of ...|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such books were put to comic use by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (serialised 1864/5), with its cutting analysis of Victorian capitalism. In the third section of that novel, Mr Boffin decides to cure his ward Bella Wilfer of her obsession with wealth and position by appearing to become a miser. Taking her with him on a round of the bookshops,
:Mr Boffin would say, 'Now, look well all round, my dear, for a Life of a Miser, or any book of that sort; any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers.'  .... The moment she pointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages, Anecdotes of strange characters, Records of remarkable individuals, or anything to that purpose, Mr Boffin's countenance would light up, and he would instantly dart in and buy it.'&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/883/883-h/883-h.htm#link2HCH0038 Gutenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following chapter, Mr Boffin brings a coachload of the books to his premises and readers are introduced to a selection of typical titles and to the names of several of the misers treated in them. Among the books appear [[James Caulfield]]'s ''Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons'' (1794-5);&lt;ref&gt;Various volumes appear in [https://books.google.com/books?id=csZMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22%5B%5BJames%20Caulfield%5D%5D%20%22%20Characters&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%5B%5BJames%20Caulfield%5D%5D%20%22%20Characters&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kirby's Wonderful Museum of Remarkable Characters'' (1803);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQpekaJh-WIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kirby's Wonderful and Scientific Museum|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Henry Wilson's ''Wonderful Characters'' (1821);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Daniel+Dancer%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Wonderful Characters:|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and F. Somner Merryweather's ''Lives and Anecdotes of Misers or The Passion of Avarice displayed in the parsimonious habits, unaccountable lives and remarkable deaths of the most notorious misers of all ages'' (1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/livesandanecdot00merrgoog#page/n4/mode/2up|title=Lives and anecdotes of misers|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the misers are 18th century characters, with [[John Elwes (politician)|John Elwes]] and [[Daniel Dancer]] at their head. The first account of Elwes' life was [[Edward Topham]]'s ''The Life of the Late John Elwes: Esquire'' (1790), which was initially published in his paper ''The World''. The popularity of such accounts is attested by the seven editions printed in the book's first year and the many later reprintings under various titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MK9bAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+elwes%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Life of the Late John Elwes|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies of Dancer followed soon after, at first in periodicals such as the ''Edinburgh Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;"Anecdotes of the late Daniel Dancer Esq", [https://books.google.com/books?id=fnAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22Daniel%20Dancer%22&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Daniel%20Dancer%22&amp;f=false 1794, pp.399-40]&lt;/ref&gt; and the
''[[Sporting Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Anecdotes of the Late Daniel Dancer" [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ0aAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Daniel+Dancer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gT8PUuyNBIaK0AXvgYHoDw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Daniel%20Dancer%22&amp;f=false 1795]&lt;/ref&gt; then in the compendiums ''Biographical Curiosities'' (which also included Elwes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALFVAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Biographical Curiosities; or, Various pictures of human nature. Containing ...|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Strange and Unaccountable Life of Daniel Dancer, Esq. ... with singular anecdotes of the famous Jemmy Taylor, the Southwark usurer'' (1797), which was often to be reissued under various titles.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Bearden-White, ''How the Wind Sits; Or, The History of Henry and Ann Lemoine, Chapbook Writers and Publishers of the Late Eighteenth Century'', Southern Illinois University 2007 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cZyRBNmFHkYC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22Daniel%20Dancer%22&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Daniel%20Dancer%22&amp;f=false pp.55-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cooper Dancer.jpg|thumb|A pencil drawing of [[Daniel Dancer]] by [[Richard Cooper Jr]], 1790s]]
Jemmy Taylor's name also appears in the list of notable misers that Mr Boffin ennumerates. He is coupled with the banker [[Jemmy Wood]] of Gloucester, a more recent miser about whom Dickens later wrote an article in his magazine [[All The Year Round]].&lt;ref&gt;April 10, 1869 [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_jVAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=miser%20%22Jemmy%20Wood%22%20Gloucester&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=miser%20%22Jemmy%20Wood%22%20Gloucester&amp;f=false pp.454-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Others include John Little (who appears in Merryweather), Reverend Mr Jones of Blewbury (also in Merryweather) and Dick Jarrel, whose surname was really Jarrett and an account of whom appeared in the [[Annual Register]] for 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOcxAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;ots=bSFXxRUOxs&amp;dq=Dick%20Jarrett%20miser&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q=Dick%20Jarrett%20miser&amp;f=false|title=Annual Register|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many volumes of this publication also figured among Mr Boffin's purchases.

Two more of the misers mentioned made their way into other literary works. John Hopkins, known as Vulture Hopkins, was the subject of a scornful couplet in the third of [[Alexander Pope]]'s Moral Essays, "Of the Use of Riches":
::When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend	
::The wretch who living saved a candle's end.&lt;ref&gt;An account of him was given in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' for 1788, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xKZJAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA510&amp;ots=pQ5lTxHS48&amp;dq=Vulture%20Hopkins&amp;pg=PA510#v=onepage&amp;q=Vulture%20Hopkins&amp;f=false pp.510-11]&lt;/ref&gt; 
John Overs, with a slight change to his name, became the subject of a three-act drama by [[Douglas William Jerrold]], ''John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry'' (1828), roughly based on an incident when he feigned death to save expenses and was killed by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dramatic Magazine'' 1, 1829 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDY5AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;ots=39rWgZ8kKB&amp;dq=%22'John%20Overy%22%20%20%22The%20dramatic%20magazine%22&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=%22'John%20Overy%22%20%20%22The%20dramatic%20magazine%22&amp;f=false pp.78-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another public source of information about misers, in Scotland at least, was the prose [[broadside (printing)|broadside]]. One example concerns Isobel Frazer or Frizzle, who died in [[Stirling]] on 26 May 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/broadside.cfm/id/15938|title=Broadside entitled 'Female Miser'|work=nls.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the broadside is taken up with detailing the contents of her three rooms, into which she had let no one enter. Not more than £8 in currency was discovered there, but she had bought and hoarded many articles of dress over the years, although rarely wearing them. She had also carefully picked up every pin that fell in her way, till she nearly filled one hundred pincushions. In addition to much other [[bric-a-brac]], there were a great number of buttons, which had been cut off old coats. This makes her sound more like a [[compulsive hoarding|compulsive hoarder]] than the "Female Miser" that she is called in the report. The title was more deserved by Joseph MacWilliam, who was found dead of a fire on 13 June 1826. A servant whose home was a damp [[Edinburgh]] cellar without either bed, chair or table, his colleagues and neighbours claimed to have seen him in the same threadbare clothes for 15 years. After his death, property to the value of more than £3,000 was found in the cellar, some in the form of property deeds, and more in bank receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/broadside.cfm/id/15466|title=Broadside entitled 'Miser'|work=nls.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 19th century there were small regional publications dealing with single individuals of local interest. Examples of such works include Frances Blair's 32-page ''Memoir of Margery Jackson, the Carlisle miser and misanthrope'' (Carlisle 1847)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/memoirofmargeryj00blai#page/12/mode/2up|title=Memoir of Margery Jackson, the Carlisle miser &amp; misanthrope|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States the 46-page ''Lochy Ostrom, the maiden miser of Poughkeepsie; or the love of a long lifetime. An authentic biography of Rachel Ostrom who recently died in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., aged ninety years, apparently very poor, but really wealthy'' (Philadelphia 1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022051514#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Lochy Ostrom, the maiden miser of Poughkeepsie; or, The love of a long lifetime.

One trait of misers arising out of the accounts about them was their readiness to incur legal expenses where money was involved.

==Misers in literature==

===Fables===
There were two famous references to misers in ancient Greek sources. One was [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Miser and his Gold]]" which he had buried and came back to view every day. When his treasure was eventually stolen and he was lamenting his loss, he was consoled by a neighbour that he might as well bury a stone (or return to look at the hole) and it would serve the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/225.htm|title=THE MAN AND HIS GOLD|work=mythfolklore.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was a two-line epigram in the [[Greek Anthology]], once ascribed to [[Plato]]. In this a man, intending to hang himself, discovered hidden gold and left the rope behind him; on returning, the man who had hidden the gold hanged himself with the noose he found in its place.&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek Anthology'' III, London 1917, [https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology03newyuoft#page/24/mode/2up pp.25-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Both these stories were alluded to or retold in the following centuries, the most famous versions appearing in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] as ''L'avare qui a perdu son trésor'' (IV.20)&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Fables of Jean de La Fontaine'', translated by Norman Shapiro, University of Illinois 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xWnR0pCxH9UC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=the+miser+who+lost+his+treasure++norman+shapiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=75jzxDWbmR&amp;sig=akkaCECwbcP3C1HtqE6nPz7eFIE&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20miser%20who%20lost%20his%20treasure%20%20norman%20shapiro&amp;f=false p.101]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Le trésor et les deux hommes'' (IX.15)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/20012 |title=Jean de La Fontaine's Fable Poem: The Treasure And The Two Men |work=readbookonline.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415014611/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/20012 |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Yet another of La Fontaine's fables was the late addition, ""The miser and the monkey" (XII.3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta12.html#damismonkey|title=Jean de La Fontaine Fables|work=nvg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a cautionary tale for financiers. Here a man keeps his hoard in a sea-encircled tower until a pet monkey amuses itself one day in throwing the coins out of the window.

In Asia misers were the butt of humorous folklore. One very early cautionary tale is the ''Illisa Jataka'' from the Buddhist scriptures. This includes two stories, in the first of which a rich miser is miraculously converted to generosity by a disciple of the Buddha; following this, the Buddha tells another story of a miser whose wealth is given away when the king of the gods impersonates him, and when he tries to intervene is threatened with what will happen if he does not change his ways.&lt;ref&gt;Tale 78, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1081.htm Sacred texts online]&lt;/ref&gt; Two 16th century stories concerning misers are included among the witticisms attributed to [[Birbal]] during Mughal times. In one he extracts from a casuistical miser a fee for a poem written in his praise.&lt;ref&gt;Anindya Roy, ''Akbar-Birbal Jokes'', New Delhi 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gc1UP05XUKYC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Miser+poem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PrTKUdrgC4ew0QW074GgBQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Miser%20poem&amp;f=false "The Miser's Misery", pp. 125–6]&lt;/ref&gt; In the other the miser is forced to reward a merchant who rescued his hoard from a fire with the whole of it.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Sawhney, ''50 Wittiest Tales Of Birbal'', Bangalore 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJX694hcntAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A question of 'like'", pp. 47–9]&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs similarly made extensive use of misers in their literature. The most famous being the 600 page collection of anecdotes called ''Kitab Al Bukhala'' or Book of Misers by [[Al-Jahiz|Al-Jāḥiẓ]]. He lived in 800 CE during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Basra]], making this the earliest and largest known work on the subject in [[Arabic literature]].

When there was renewed European interest in Aesop during the early [[Renaissance]], the [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poet [[Laurentius Abstemius]] wrote two collections of original fables, among which appeared ''Avarus et poma marcescentia'' (The miser and the rotten apples, fable 179), published in 1499. This was eventually translated into English by [[Roger L'Estrange]] and published in his fable collection of 1692.&lt;ref&gt;''Fable'' 458, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OE5AAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA430&amp;ots=BqR4nSRKpW&amp;dq=%22There%20was%20a%20Stingy%2C%20Narrow-hearted%22&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q=%22There%20was%20a%20Stingy,%20Narrow-hearted%22&amp;f=false p. 430]&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns a miser who cannot bring himself to eat the apples in his orchard until they start to go rotten. His son invites in his playmates to pick the fruit but asks them not to eat the rotten ones since his father prefers those. The 18th century French fabulist [[Claris de Florian]] was to adapt the story in his "L'avare et son fils" (The miser and his son, IV.9). In this version the miserly father hoards his apples and only eats those going rotten. His son, upon being caught raiding them, excuses himself on the grounds that he was confining himself to eating just the sound ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables de Florian'', Paris 1846, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yg8tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=L'Avare%20et%20son%20fils&amp;f=false p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Blake Miser&amp;Plutus.jpg|thumb|A print of John Gay's "The Miser and Plutus" by [[William Blake]], 1793]]
In 18th century Britain, when there was a vogue for creating original fables in verse, a number featured misers. [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]]'s "Tale of the Miser and the Poet" was included among others in her 1713 Miscellany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/finch/1713/mp-miser.html|title=A Tale of the Miser and the Poet|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There an unsuccessful poet meets [[Mammon]] in the guise of a miser digging up his buried gold and debates with him whether the life of wit and learning is a better calling than the pursuit of wealth. Eventually the poet is convinced that keeping his talent hidden until it is better regarded is the more prudent course. It was followed by [[John Gay]]'s "The Miser and Plutus", published in his collection of fables in 1737.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immortalpoetry.com/The_Miser_and_Plutus|title=The Miser and Plutus|work=Immortal Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; A miser frightened for the security of his hoard denounces gold as the corruptor of virtue and is visited by the angry god of wealth, who asserts that not gold but the attitude towards it is what damages the personality.

While these are more or less original interpretations of the theme, French fabulist [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]] harks back to the light hearted approach of the Greek Anthology in "The Miser and Minos", first published in his fables of 1719.&lt;ref&gt;Fable XIX, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a4hdAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;ots=oKC4MkOZ8u&amp;dq=de%20la%20motte%20%20%22L'avare%20et%20minos%22&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20la%20motte%20%20%22L'avare%20et%20minos%22&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Descending to the Classical underworld at his death, the miser is brought before the judge of the dead and is given the extreme punishment of returning to earth to witness how his wealth is now being spent. The Scottish poet [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] adapted this into dialect two years later,&lt;ref&gt;''Poems'' vol. 2 (1761) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5UYgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Miser%20poem&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=Miser%20poem&amp;f=false pp. 37–9]&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles Denis provided a version in standard English in his ''Select Fables'' (1754), reversing the title to "Minos and the Miser".&lt;ref&gt;Fable XC [https://books.google.com/books?id=JW5bAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=f6od9QToF9&amp;dq=Fables%20%20Denis&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=Minos&amp;f=false p. 326]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
Misers are frequent figures of fun in the epigrams of the [[Greek Anthology]].&lt;ref&gt;A group of eight in Book XI are numbered [https://archive.org/stream/greekanthology04newyuoft#page/150/mode/2up 165-73]&lt;/ref&gt; It is charged of them that they are not masters of their own money if they do not spend it. Niarchus tells of one who does not commit suicide because of the cost of the rope to do so; Lucillius tells of another who dies because funeral expenses are cheaper than calling in a doctor. Elsewhere in the anthology is another epigram by Lucillius of a miser's encounter with a mouse that assures him he only wants lodging, not board.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek anthology for schools, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7u4pAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Greek%20Anthology%20miser&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek%20Anthology%20miser&amp;f=false poem 29]&lt;/ref&gt; In one more, a miser dreams that he is in debt and hangs himself.&lt;ref&gt;Poems of the Orient [https://books.google.com/books?id=YRJKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Greek%20Anthology%20miser&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek%20Anthology%20miser&amp;f=false p.323]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin writer [[Horace]] put miserly behaviour at the centre of the first poem in his first collection of satires, dealing with extremes of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;''Satires, Epistles and Ars Poetica'', Loeb edition translated by H. Rushton Fairclough, London 1942 [https://archive.org/stream/satiresepistlesa00horauoft#page/4/mode/2up p.5 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; In writing an imitation of it, an English poet who provides only his surname, Minshull, was to emphasise this by titling his work ''The Miser, a Poem'' (London, 1735).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Kupersmith |first = William |year = 2007 |title = English Versions of Roman Satire in the Earlier Eighteenth Century |location = Cranbury, NJ |publisher = [[Associated University Presses]] |page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=imPB3_3EPxYC&amp;pg=PA95 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri{{'}}s]] ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', misers are put in the fourth circle of hell, in company with [[spendthrift]]s as part of their mutual punishment. They roll weights representing their wealth, constantly colliding and quarreling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnhlOrCgf-UC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Dark Way to Paradise |author=Jennifer Doane Upton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, [[emblem books]] began using an illustration of [[an ass eating thistles]] as symbol of miserly behaviour, often with an accompanying poem. They appeared in various European languages, among them the illustrated [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]] by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], dating from about 1630, on which an ass laden with rich foods is shown cropping a thistle, surrounding which is the quatrain:
::::The Asse which dainty meates doth beare
::::And feedes on thistles all the yeare
::::Is like the wretch that hourds up gold
::::And yet for want doth suffer cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=213402&amp;objectId=1527520&amp;partId=1|title=British Museum - Image gallery: Scenes from Aesop's Fables|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third book of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Edmund Spenser]] created a portrait of a man trapped between conflicting desires in Malbecco, who appears in cantos 9-10. He is torn between his miserliness and love for his wife Hellenore. Wishing to escape with a lover, she sets fire to his storeroom and forces him to choose between them:
::::Ay when to him she cryde, to her he turnd,
::::And left the fyre; love money overcame:
::::But when he marked how him money burnd,
::::He left his wyf; money did love disclame.&lt;ref&gt;III.10, stanza 15&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually losing both, he becomes the embodiment of frustrated jealousy.

The 18th century, so culturally rich in miser lore, furnished some notable poetic examples. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]]'s “Last speech of a wretched miser” dates from 1728 and is written in modified [[Scots language|Scots dialect]]. The miser bids farewell to his riches in a comic monologue and details some of his shifts to avoid expense.&lt;ref&gt;''The Poems of Allan Ramsay'', London 1800, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wyg6AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;ots=oR-CaLNnUO&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CLast%20speech%20of%20a%20wretched%20miser%E2%80%9D%20Ramsay&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CLast%20speech%20of%20a%20wretched%20miser%E2%80%9D%20Ramsay&amp;f=false pp.304-11]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]] created another masterly portrait in the character of Cotta in his ''[[Moral Essays|Epistle to Bathurst]]'' (1733). Reluctance to spend confines this aristocrat to his ancestral hall, where he refuses to engage with the world.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Essays III, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2278&amp;chapter=216010&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 lines 177-196]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the century another Scottish poet, Dr William Stevenson (1719–83), included nine satirical epitaphs on misers among his collected works, of which the last begins: 
::::A miser rots beneath this mould'ring stone,
::::Who starv'd himself through spleen to skin and bone,
::::Lest worms might riot on his flesh at last
::::And boast, what he ne'er could, a full repast.&lt;ref&gt;''Original Poems on Several Subjects'' Volume 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ollHAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Miser%20poem&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q=Miser%20poem&amp;f=false p.280]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetic titles from the 19th century include the Irish Arthur Geoghegan's ''The Old Miser and Mammon: an Incident Poem'' (Newry 1818) and Frederick Featherstone's ''New Christmas Poem entitled The Miser's Christmas Eve'' (1893). There was also an anonymous didactic poem titled ''The Miser'' (London 1831). Although miserly behaviour is referenced during the course of its 78 pages, the real focus there is the attraction of money in all its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/miserapoem00misegoog#page/n4/mode/2up|title=The miser: a poem|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Miser ballad.gif|thumb|The broadside ballad of "The Old Miser", early 19th century]]
In the realm of popular poetry, there were a range of narrative [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] ballads concerning misers from the 17th century onward. Some of the earliest deal with the grain speculators who caused such suffering to the poorest.  A representative example is "The Wretched Miser" (1682), prefaced as "a brief Account of a covetous Farmer, who bringing a Load of Corn to Market, swore the Devil should have it before he would take the honest Market price". The devil closes with the bargain and on accounting day carries off the farmer as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/21994/xml University of California]&lt;/ref&gt; The social message is carried by the refrain that follows each stanza: "O Farmers, covetous Farmers,/ why would you pinch the Poor?" The religious aspect is dealt with in the contemporary "A Looking-glass for a covetous Miser" by [[Thomas Jordan (poet)|Thomas Jordan]]. Here a West Country entrepreneur and a poor husbandman debate the respective merits of anxious profit-making and contentment.  The miser laments the current low price of grain and resolves not to sell or plant more until the price rises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/33461/xml English Broadside Ballad Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme continued into the early 19th century, where a farmer is again the subject of "The life and awful death of a rich miser ".&lt;ref&gt;James G. Hepburn, ''A Book of Scattered Leaves: Poetry of Poverty in Broadside Ballads'' Bucknell University 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SlhlFB07kqIC&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;ots=o-6ou-BObb&amp;dq=broadside%20ballad%20%20%20%22miser%22&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q=broadside%20ballad%20%20%20%22miser%22&amp;f=false  p.201]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common subject of these ballads was the dilemma of the miser's daughter unable to marry the man of her choice and the stratagems employed to overcome her father. In "Bite Upon the Miser", printed in the late 18th century, a sailor dresses up as the devil and scares the miser and the parson he intended as her husband into allowing the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.library.yale.edu/walpoleweb/oneitem.asp?imageId=lwlpr25361|title=Lewis Walpole Library Digital Collection|work=yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much the same situation occurs in "The Politic Lovers or the Windsor Miser Outwitted", where it is a butcher who impersonates the devil and scares the miser into handing over his riches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/static/images/sheets/20000/15693.gif Bodleian Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1800 there appeared an English broadside ballad called “The old miser” which was to serve as basis for what grew into a [[Folk music|folk song]] with multiple versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vwml.org/roudnumber/3913|title=Vaughan Williams Memorial Library - Welcome to the English Folk Dance and Song Society|work=vwml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene is set in London, where a miser’s daughter is courted by a sailor and the father arranges for him to be press-ganged to get him out of the way. As well as persisting in England, there are also versions in the USA and [[Tristan de Cunha]].&lt;ref&gt;Folk Songs of the Catskills, State University of New York, 1982, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IEmkHeB35XEC&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Catskills%20miser&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=Catskills%20miser&amp;f=false pp.187-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Misers were notorious tricksters, so ingenuity transcending barely credible impersonations was generally needed. "Bite upon bite or the miser outwitted by the country lass" (1736–63) does not feature the miser's daughter but another sort of damsel in distress. A girl bears a child out of wedlock and is advised by her mother to name it Maidenhead and offer it for sale. A rich miser closes the bargain and is eventually forced to support the child by the magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlet Bowen, ''The Politics of Custom in Eighteenth-Century British Fiction'', London 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XZvGAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;ots=pDJm1dceu-&amp;dq=%22Bite%20upon%20bite%22%20ballad&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bite%20upon%20bite%22%20ballad&amp;f=false footnote on p.185]&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another ballad theme was the privations of the miser’s servant, a comic situation in drama and fiction also, and here principally concerned with how little food the household has to live on. One example is "The Miser's Man (dating from between 1863-85).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/static/images/sheets/05000/03336.gif Bodleian Library]&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the 19th century, the theme had figured as an episode in [[Robert Anderson (poet)|Robert Anderson]]'s "Croglin Watty". A simple-minded countryman down from the fells, Watty was hired by the real-life [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] miser Margery Jackson (1722–1812) and served her for a [[Calendar year#quarter|quarter]]. The ballad mixes sung verses with prose description, both in Cumberland dialect: 
::Neist my deame she e'en starv'd me, that niver liv'd weel;
::Her hard words and luiks wou'd ha'e freeten'd the deil:

::She hed a lang beard, for aw t' warl leyke a billy goat, wi' a kil-dried frosty feace: and then the smawest leg o' mutton in aw Carel market sarrad the cat, me, and hur for a week.&lt;ref&gt;''The Songs and Ballads of Cumberland'', George Routledge &amp; Sons, 1866, [https://archive.org/stream/songsballadsofcu00gilprich#page/330/mode/2up/search/Croglin pp. 330–3]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dame Margery is not named in the poem because at the time of writing (1805) she was still alive and known to be litigious. We know that it is meant to be her from the fact that in William Brown's painting of the ballad, "Hiring Croglin Watty at Carlisle Cross", it is she who figures in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/margery-jackson-17221812-hiring-croglin-watty-at-carlisle-cross|title=BBC – Your Paintings – Margery Jackson (1722–1812), Hiring Croglin Watty at Carlisle Cross|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1811, just before her death, Brown had already devoted another painting to her alone as she tramped through the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/margery-jackson-the-carlisle-miser|title=BBC - Your Paintings - Margery Jackson, the Carlisle Miser|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; That she is still amusedly remembered there is witnessed by the modern ''Miser!

===Drama===
Misers were represented onstage as comic figures from Classical times. One of the earliest appears in the comic [[Phlyax play]]s developed in the Greek colonies in Italy during the 4th century BCE, which are known only from rare fragments and titles. They were also popularly represented on Greek vases, often with the names of the characters written above them. In one of these by [[Asteas]] two men are depicted robbing a miser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phlyax_scene_on_a_calyx_krater_by_Asteas_Antikensammlung_Berlin_F3044_5.jpg|title=File:Phlyax scene on a calyx krater by Asteas Antikensammlung Berlin F3044 5.jpg|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the centre the miser Charinos has settled for sleep on top of his  strongbox in the comfort of two blankets.

[[Ben Jonson]] adapted elements from Plautus for his early comedy ''[[The Case is Altered]]'' (c. 1597).&lt;ref&gt;The text is [http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1811case.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; The miser there is the Milanese Jaques de Prie, who has a (supposed) daughter, Rachel. [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Samuel Coster]] followed with their very popular Dutch comedy ''Warenar'' (1617). The play is named from the miser, whose daughter is Claartje. Molière adapted Plautus' play into French as ''L'Avare'' ([[The Miser]], 1668) while in England [[Thomas Shadwell]] adapted Molière's work in 1672&lt;ref&gt;Albert S.

There were also independent dramatic depictions of misers, some of them being variations of the Pantaleone figure in 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell’arte]]. He is represented as a rich and miserly Venetian merchant, later to become the father of [[Columbina]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre'',[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb-OAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;ots=lgk4pP0SDp&amp;dq=Pantaleone%20%20%22miser%22&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q=Pantaleone%20%20%22miser%22&amp;f=false Pantaloon entry, p.374]&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian characters who reappear in English drama include the Jewish moneylender [[Shylock]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1598) and the title character of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]'' (1606). In [[Aubrey Beardsley]]'s title page for the latter, Volpone is shown worshiping his possessions, in illustration of the lines from the play, "Dear Saint, / Riches, the dumb god that giv'st all men tongues."&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Volpone Beardsley.jpg|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scene takes place in the second act of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s short tragedy ''Skupoi rytsar'' (1836). This concerns a son, Albert, kept short of funds by his father, the Baron. Under the title [[The Miserly Knight]], it was made an opera by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;There is a complete performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9HvGV7Kg-k YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; In the corresponding act in the latter, the Baron visits his underground storehouse, where he gloats at a new addition to his coffers and moodily contemplates the extravagance of his son during a 15-minute solo.

Following on from the continuing success of Molière's ''L'Avare'', there was a spate of French plays dealing with misers and their matrimonial plans over the next century and a half. What complicates matters is that several of these had the same title but were in fact separate plays written by different authors. ''L'Avare Amoureux'' (The Miser in Love) by Jean du Mas d' Aigueberre (1692–1755) was a one-act comedy acted in Paris in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5m0Rcp94K8C&amp;dq=l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Les trois spectacles, ou Polixene,|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the anonymous one-act comedy of the same title published in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7MWAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=L'Avare amoureux|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of plays borrows a title from the Italian dramatist [[Carlo Goldoni]], who was working in France at the end of his life. He had already produced a one-act comedy titled ''L'avaro'' (The Miser) in Bologna in 1756. In 1776 he produced in France the five-act ''L' avare fastueux'' (The Spendthrift Miser).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Copping, ''Alfieri and Goldoni: Their Lives and Adventures'', London 1857, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bss5AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%22avare%20fastueux%22%20Goldoni&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q=%22avare%20fastueux%22%20Goldoni&amp;f=false p.259]&lt;/ref&gt; The same title was used by L. Reynier for his five-act verse drama of 1794&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UU6AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=L' avare fastueux|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Claude Baron Godart d'Aucourt de Saint Just (1769-1826) for his three-act verse drama of 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVJUAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=La fille de l'avare|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 19th century saw misers become the subject of the musicals then fashionable in France. [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Germain Delavigne]] collaborated on
''L'avare en goguette'' (The miser's spree) in 1823,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4MUAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=L'avare en goguettes|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jean-François Bayard]] and [[Paul Duport]] collaborated on the two-act ''La fille de l'avare'' (The Miser's Daughter) in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVJUAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=la+fille+de+l%27avare+-Moliere&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=La fille de l'avare|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter play
was freely adapted in 1835 by [[John G. Millingen]] under the title of ''The Miser’s Daughter''. Two further adaptations of the French play were to follow later: ''Love and Avarice'' (1859) by J. V. Bridgeman (1819-89), and [[John Palgrave Simpson]]'s ''Daddy Hardacre'' in 1857. Meanwhile, [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s period novel  ''[[The Miser's Daughter]]'' (first serialised in 1842) was spawning a fresh crop of dramas of that title. Two were played in 1842 and a further adaptation called ''Hilda'' in 1872. A similarly titled play was the five-act comedy partially in verse, ''The Miser's Daughter or The Lover's Curse'' of 1839, a schoolboy indiscretion of the future controversial churchman, Rev.[[John Purchas]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Monthly Magazine'' 1839 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LdwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Miser%20poem&amp;pg=PA583#v=onepage&amp;q=Miser%20poem&amp;f=false p.583]&lt;/ref&gt; And on the other side of the Atlantic there was a stage production of ''Julietta Gordini:The Miser's Daughter'', a verse play in five acts, which claimed to derive its plot 'from an Italian story'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qb09AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Julietta Gordini|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas William Jerrold]]'s ''John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry'', (1828)  also brings in a daughter whom the miser attempts to sell off as a mistress to her disguised lover.&lt;ref&gt;The Dramatic Magazine 1, 1829 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDY5AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;ots=39rWgZ8kKB&amp;dq=%22'John%20Overy%22%20%20%22The%20dramatic%20magazine%22&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=%22'John%20Overy%22%20%20%22The%20dramatic%20magazine%22&amp;f=false p.79]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Jerrold had written a one-act farce, ''The Smoked Miser or The Benefit of Hanging'' (1823), in which a miser tries to marry off his ward to advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://victorian.worc.ac.uk/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol58xivSmoked.pdf Text at Victorian Plays project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080516/http://victorian.worc.ac.uk/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol58xivSmoked.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another farce produced in Canada, Major John Richardson's ''The Miser Outwitted'' (1841), had an Irish theme and dealt with a plot to trick a miser out of his money.&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Research in Canada'', [http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/tric/article/view/7403/84627.1, Spring 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Thomas Peckett Prest]]'s ''The Miser of Shoreditch or the Curse of Avarice'' (1854) was based on a [[penny dreadful]] story by him; later he adapted it as a two-act romantic drama set in time of Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://victorian.worc.ac.uk/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol18xiiMiser.pdf Victorian Plays project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017130216/http://victorian.worc.ac.uk/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol18xiiMiser.pdf |date=2014-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of these theatrical misers is evident from the number of paintings and drawings based on them, many of which were then adapted as prints. In 18th-century England, it was Fielding's "The Miser" that attracted most attention. [[Samuel Wale]]'s drawing of the second act was also made into a print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=279279&amp;objectId=748809&amp;partId=1|title=British Museum - Image gallery: drawing|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was principally depictions of various actors in the character of Lovegold, the play's anti-hero, which attracted artists.  [[Samuel De Wilde]] pictured [[William Farren]] in the role at the [[Theatre Royal, Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/william-farren-as-lovegold-in-the-miser-by-henry-fielding-228483|title=BBC - Your Paintings - William Farren as Lovegold in 'The Miser' by Henry Fielding|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other works became plates in one or another book dedicated to English drama. James Roberts II  (1753 – c. 1810) executed a pen and ink watercolour of [[Edward Shuter]] in character which was adapted as a print for the six-volume play collection, ''Bell's British Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=1243799&amp;objectId=3482300&amp;partId=1|title=British Museum - Image gallery: Mr Shutter in the Character of Lovegold|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Reuben Ryley]] made a print of Thomas Ryder in the role for ''Lowndes' British Theatre'' (1788),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3504942&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Miser&amp;page=1|title=British Museum - Mr Ryder in the character of Lovegold|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; while  [[Thomas Parkinson (painter)|Thomas Parkinson]]'s painting of [[Richard Yates (actor)|Richard Yates]] as Lovegold was adapted for the 1776 edition of that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3511028&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Miser&amp;page=1|title=British Museum - Mr Yates in the character of Lovegold|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century, Thomas Charles Wageman's dramatic head and shoulders drawing of [[William Farren]] as Lovegold illustrated [[William Oxberry]]'s collection of texts, ''The New English Drama'' (1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=1238006&amp;objectId=3466137&amp;partId=1|title=British Museum - Image gallery: Mr W.

Molière's ''L'Avare'' was not altogether eclipsed in England by the work adapted from it. A drawing by [[William Hogarth]] of the play's denouement was included as a print in the translation of Molière's work&lt;ref&gt;P.J.De Voogd, ''Henry Fielding and William Hogarth'', Amsterdam NL 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EXBb9xiowoEC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=77pJtiv9UU&amp;dq=Hogarth%20%20%22L'Avare%22&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=Hogarth%20%20%22L'Avare%22&amp;f=false pp.38-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and prints based upon it were made by various other engravers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O182837/h-beard-print-collection-print-hogarth|title=H Beard Print Collection|work=vam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Powell Frith]] devoted one of his theatrical paintings to a scene from L'Avare in 1876&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://19thcenturybritpaint.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/william-powell-frith-ctd.html|title=Victorian British Painting|author=rfdarsie|work=19thcenturybritpaint.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the French actor [[Grandmesnil (actor)|Grandmesnil]] in the role of Harpagon was painted by [[Jean-Baptiste François Desoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artflakes.com/en/products/the-actor-grandmesnil#show-zoom?__affiliate=webgains&amp;__siteid=54264|title=The Actor Grandmesnil, picture art prints and posters by Jean Baptiste Francois Desoria - ARTFLAKES.COM|work=artflakes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the challenging and complex part of Shylock was favoured by English artists. [[Johann Zoffany]] painted [[Charles Macklin]] in the role that had brought him fame at [[Royal Opera House|the Covent Garden Theatre]] (1767–68)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/merchant-of-venice/photo-shylock.html|title=The Merchant of Venice|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Gray portrayed a confrontation between Shylock and his daughter Jessica (1868).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Shylock&amp;Jessica.JPG|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Character portraits of other actors in Shylock's role have included Henry Urwick (1859–1931) by Walter Chamberlain Urwick (1864-1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/henry-urwick-18591931-as-shylock-54952|title=BBC - Your Paintings - Henry Urwick (1859–1931), as Shylock|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] by [[Charles Buchel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/merchant-of-venice/photo-shylock-2.html|title=The Merchant of Venice|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Bourchier]], also by Buchel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/arthur-bourchier-18631927-as-shylock-54890|title=BBC - Your Paintings - Arthur Bourchier (1863–1927), as Shylock|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Séraphin Poudrier, the central figure in [[Claude-Henri Grignon]]'s ''Un Homme et son péché'' (1933). This French-Canadian novel was translated into English as "The Woman and the Miser" in 1978. Set at the end of the 19th century, the novel broke with the convention of extolling rural life and depicts a miser who mistreats his wife and lets her die because calling in a doctor would cost money. There have been adaptations for stage, radio, TV and two films, of which the most recent was ''Séraphin: un homme et son péché'' (2002), titled [[Séraphin: Heart of Stone]] in the English-language version.

There were beside many other prolific and once popular novelists who addressed themselves to the subject of miserliness. For the most part theirs were genre works catering to readers in the [[Public library#Origins as a social institution|circulating libraries]] of the 19th century. Among them was the [[gothic novel]] ''The miser and his family'' (1800) by [[Eliza Parsons]] and [[Catherine Hutton]]'s ''The miser married'' (1813). The latter was an [[epistolary novel]] in which Charlotte Montgomery describes her own romantic affairs and in addition those of her mother, an unprincipled spendthrift who has just married the miser of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/misermarriednove03hutt|title=The miser married : a novel.

Bennett (1813–99), set her ''The Gipsy Bride or the Miser's Daughter'' (1841) in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REFWAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Gipsey Bride: Or, the Miser's Daughter. By the Author of Jane Shore ...|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]]'s [[Aurora Floyd]] (1863) was a successful [[sensation novel]] in which banknotes rather than gold are the object of desire and a motive for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/aurorafloydnovel00brad#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Aurora Floyd. A novel|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dramatised the same year and later toured the US; in 1912 it was made a silent film. Later examples include [[Eliza Lynn Linton]]'s ''Paston Carew, Millionaire and Miser'' (1886); ''Miser Farebrother'' (1888) by [[Benjamin Leopold Farjeon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MN_HhLbRqxkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Miser Farebrother: A Novel (Complete)|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dollikins and the Miser'' (1890) by the American Frances Eaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/dollikinsandmis00eatogoog|title=Dollikins and the Miser : Frances Eaton : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 [[Jerome K. Jerome]] created ''Nicholas Snyders, The Miser of Zandam'' in a sentimental story of the occult in which the Dutch merchant persuades a generous young man to exchange souls with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/869/869-h/869-h.htm|title=The Soul of Nicholas Snyders, Or the Miser Of Zandam, by Jerome K.

==Misers in art==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 050.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Death and the Miser]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] in 1494]]

Mediaeval art works of Christian origin take a clear moral stance on the sin of avarice in its various manifestations. The frieze on the west wall of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] depicts the torments of Hell visited on those guilty of this sin,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Carving on exterior of Lincoln Cathedral (1).JPG|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sassetta]] made "The Blessed Ranieri showing the friars the soul of the Miser of Citerna carried to hell by demons" a panel of an altarpiece (now in the [[Louvre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sassetta_-_Damnation_of_the_Soul_of_the_Miser_of_Citerna_-_WGA20866.jpg|title=File:Sassetta - Damnation of the Soul of the Miser of Citerna - WGA20866.jpg|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But the bracketing of the miser and the usurer as equally culpable types, mentioned earlier, makes it difficult to interpret the subject of later moralistic paintings, since they may represent either a hoarder, a money lender or even a tax collector.

Such paintings cluster into recognisable genres, all of which point to the sinful nature of preoccupation with money for its own sake. [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s panel of [[Death and the Miser]], dating from the 1490s, started a fashion in depicting this subject among [[Low Countries]] artists. Bosch shows the miser on his deathbed, with various demons crowding about his possessions, while an angel supports him and directs his attention to higher things. The link between finance and the diabolical is also drawn by another Fleming, [[Jan Matsys]], in his portrayal of the man of affairs being assisted in his double bookkeeping by a demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-miser-218879|title=BBC - Your Paintings - The Miser|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same connection is made in "The devil and the usurer" in the Valenciennes [[:fr:Musée des beaux-arts de Valenciennes|Musée des beaux-arts]], formerly attributed to [[Pieter Bruegel the Younger]], in which two devils pluck at the sleeve of a poorly dressed moneylender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0039/m063804_0000636_p.jpg French Government arts site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel [[Parable of the Rich Fool]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/luke/12-20.htm|title=Luke 12:20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'|work=bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; lies behind another series of paintings which stem ultimately from mediaeval illustrations of the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]. There a skeleton compels those from all walks of life, but particularly types of the rich and the powerful, to join him in his dance to the grave. In 1538 [[Danse Macabre#Hans Holbein's Woodcuts|Hans Holbein the Younger]] initiated a popular treatment of this subject in which each type is separately illustrated, of which there were many imitations in succeeding centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodedans.com/Eholbein28.htm|title=Hans Holbein's dance of death, Rich man / Miser|work=dodedans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the depictions is a man starting up in protest behind a table piled with wealth on which a skeleton is laying hands. In his print of 1651, [[Wenceslas Hollar]] makes the connection with the parable clear by quoting from it in the frame.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Wenceslas Hollar - Miser (State 2).jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A variation is provided by [[Jan Provoost]]'s 16th century diptych in which death confronts the man of affairs with his own account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Provoost_-_Death_and_the_Miser_-_WGA18447.jpg|title=File:Jan Provoost - Death and the Miser - WGA18447.jpg|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, [[Frans Francken the Younger]]  treats the theme twice, in both versions of which a skeleton serenades a luxuriously dressed greybeard sitting at a table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niceartgallery.com/Frans-II-Francken/Death-and-the-Miser.html|title=Death and the Miser|work=NiceArtGallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another curious variation occurs in [[Pieter Quast]]'s print of "The Miser and Death" (1643). Here the man sits at table clasping his money bags while contemplating a skull wearing a plumed hat, beside which is an [[hour-glass]]. The visitation of death is carried forward in the 19th century in similarly titled works. They include a portrayal by Franz Häussler (1845-1920) of an old man standing at his desk who peers round fearfully as he glimpses a skull reflected in a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Glaspalast_M%C3%BCnchen_1891_025a.jpg|title=File:Glaspalast München 1891 025a.jpg|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charcoal and watercolour drawing by the Austrian Albert Plattner (1869–1919) is more ambiguous and has the figures facing away from each other in a cramped space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/albert-plattner/der-geizhals-und-der-tod-f15vfVIiAM5EPoDj8NkMdw2|title=Der Geizhals und der Tod|work=artnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another genre was the Allegory of Avarice, of which one of the earliest examples is [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s painting of a naked old woman with a sack of coins (1507).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Albrecht Dürer 004.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes the point that age comes to all and confiscates all consolations. A woman is chosen as subject because the Latin ''avaritia'' is of the feminine gender. Low Countries artists who took up the allegorical theme added the variation of making the woman examine a coin by the light of a candle or lantern, as in the paintings by [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/h/honthors/2/03oldwom.html|title=Web Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1000-1900)|work=wga.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Mathias Stomer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0370/m099404_3j01415_p.jpg French Government cultural site]&lt;/ref&gt; In his own allegorical treatment, [[Paulus Moreelse]] made the link with the dance of death genre by introducing a young boy slyly fingering the coins while keeping a wary eye on the woman to see if she has noticed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/full.php?ID=75789 The Athenaeum]&lt;/ref&gt; These Dutch variations were mostly painted during the 1620s, when [[Rembrandt]] too borrowed the imagery, but his candlelit examiner of a coin is male and the piece is variously titled "The Money Changer" or "The Rich Fool", in reference to the parable already mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Rembrandt - Der reiche Narr.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Steen]], on the other hand, makes his subject very obviously a miser who hugs a small sack of coins and holds one up for intent inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryimages.org/baroque/jan-steen/flat |title=arthistoryimages.org |work=arthistoryimages.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018064313/http://www.arthistoryimages.org/baroque/jan-steen/flat |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hieronymus Bosch ''Death and the Miser'', the pull between spirituality and materialism is highlighted by making the deathbed a scene of conflict between the angel and demons. Quentin Matsys suggests the same polarity in his ''The moneylender and his wife'' (1514).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Quentin Massys 001.jpg|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Here the woman is studying a religious book while her husband is testing coins by weight. In the hands of the later [[Marinus van Reymerswaele]] the contrast disappears. The wife of his moneylender is shown helping with the bookkeeping and leaning sideways, as mesmerised as her husband by the pile of coins.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Marinus Claesz. van Reymerswaele 001.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gillis van Tilborch]]'s painting of much the same scene is titled ''The Misers'' and again demonstrates the ambivalent targets of the moral message. The only difference is that the couple engaged in inspecting their money are old, as was the case in all the allegories of avarice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/musee/diaporama/1/7081/musee-de-la-cour-d-or/5/32363/les-avares|title=Les avares|work=linternaute.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Teniers the Younger]] depicted a couple similarly engaged in 1648 which was later engraved in France by [[Pierre-François Basan]] under the title ''Le plaisir des vieillards'' (the pleasures of old age). Verses as the bottom underline the moral: "Why do you make/ such piles of gold?/ Soon you’ll grow old/ and Death takes all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.famsf.org/pierre-fran%C3%A7ois-basan/le-plaisir-des-vieillards-19633029254|title=Le Plaisir Des Vieillards|work=FAMSF Explore the Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of ambivalence centres on the kind of clothes worn by the so-called misers. The subject of [[Hendrik Gerritsz Pot]]'s painting from the 1640s in the [[Uffizi]] is fashionably dressed and wearing a ring. He may be inspired by the wealth and jewelry piled on his table, but he obviously has no objection to advertising his well-to-do status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/art/p/pot/themiser.jpg Web Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''Miser Casting His Accounts'' presented by [[Jan Lievens]] is poorly dressed and his interest in hoarding is indicated by the way he gloats on the key that will lock his money away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/a-miser-casting-his-accounts-171333|title=BBC - Your Paintings - A Miser Casting His Accounts|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same dichotomy occurs in later centuries. [[Jean-Baptiste Le Prince]]'s miser is also richly robed as he sits surrounded by his possessions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/leprince.php|title=Jean Baptiste Leprince.  Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert art appraisals - Art Experts|work=artexpertswebsite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Theodore Bernard Heuvel's miser sits on the chest containing his hoard and looks anxiously over his shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niceartgallery.com/Theodore-Bernard-Heuvel/The-Miser.html|title=The Miser|work=NiceArtGallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Gavarni]]'s miser shows much the same apprehension as he leans on the table where his money is piled and glances round suspiciously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0532/m501104_09-580238_p.jpg French government arts site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Gripus plundered.jpg|thumb|left|Old Gripus plundered by his young wife (1773) © Trustees of the British Museum]]

A sub-theme of this kind of contrast occurred in [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s "The Miser and his Mistress". There a young woman in luxuriant Renaissance dress stands behind an ugly miser, reaching across him to take coins from the money bags he clutches to his chest, while he looks up at her, crying out with a grimace and trying to push away her hand. An updated version by [[Philip Dawe]] was published as a print in 1773 under the title of ''The Scramble, or Old Gripus plunder'd by his Young Wife''. Underneath is a verse commentary: 
::How hard is the conflict, yet claims ridicule,
::When doting and avarice possess an old fool!
::His wife while she plunders with smiles and caresses,
::At once cools his love and his avarice distresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=818426&amp;objectId=1639559&amp;partId=1|title=British Museum - Image gallery: The Scramble, or Old Gripus plunder'd by his Young Wife|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Literary manifestations of the theme of the mismatched couple include the Malbecco episode in "The Faerie Queene" and Catherine Hutton's novel "The Miser Married".

English depictions of misers in the 18th century begin as genre paintings. [[Gainsborough Dupont]]'s poorly dressed character clutches a bag of coin and looks up anxiously in the painting in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-miser-141941|title=BBC - Your Paintings - The Miser|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cranch (1751-1821) pictures two armed desperadoes breaking in on his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-miser-95743|title=BBC - Your Paintings - The Miser|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is in the realm of satirical prints that the most inventiveness is found. [[James Gillray]] does not neglect the moral dimension either in his "The miser's feast" (1786). He is pictured seated at a table eating a meager meal, attended by Death in the guise of an emaciated and naked manservant holding in his right hand a tray with a bone on it and behind him, in his left hand, the dart of death. Famine, a withered hag naked to the waist, is also in attendance wearing a large hat and fashionable skirt. These characters are identified by the verse at the bottom: "What else can follow  but destructive fate,/When Famine holds the cup and Death the plate?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00132/AN00132769_001_l.jpg British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other details in Gillray's crowded print is a fashionably dressed prostitute coming through the door. Lechery was supposed to be an attribute of some misers, exposing them to a contest between satisfying this weakness and their overmastering passion to save expense, as exemplified in the Old Gripus print. [[Thomas Rowlandson]] points to one solution of his dilemma in a print showing a miser engaged with two nude prostitutes whom has hired for the price of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eroti-cart.com/thomas-rowlandson-c-53_57/the-miser|title=The Miser|author=Mike Hannon|work=eroti-cart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another Rowlandson revisits the theme of the meager feast, depicting his miser crouched by an empty grate and keeping himself warm by hugging his money-bags. A hag enters, bringing a tiny portion to eat on a plate which a famished cat scrambles to reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amica.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/AMICO~1~1~60064~92549:The-Miser?sort=INITIALSORT_CRN%2COCS%2CAMICOID&amp;qvq=q:AMICOID%3DFASF.7611%2B;sort:INITIALSORT_CRN%2COCS%2CAMICOID;lc:AMICO~1~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1|title=The Miser|work=davidrumsey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One more dichotomy explored by Rowlandson appears in his watercolour of "The spendthrift and the miser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/full/382cc4ee81fb319c2eb8bdf38af78e1ca362392a.html?ixsid=KPmk7RQ17Iy|title=A&amp;A - The Spendthrift and the Miser|work=artandarchitecture.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drunken young man alarming the miser there is probably his son, taking up a literary theme to be found, among other places, in Allan Ramsay's comic monologue. It will be remembered too that the thriftless ne'er-do-well of ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' inherited his money from a miserly father.

By the end of the 19th century the theme of the miser was distancing itself from the simply moralities of journeyman painters and becoming a subject for aristocratic amateurs. The Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]]'s miser of 1890 handles a small strongbox.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Maria Fyodorovna-Miser.jpg|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian [[Raja Ravi Varma]] paints a Jewish character type for his miser, dated 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberkerala.com/rajaravivarma/ravivarma-painting-59.htm|title=Raja Ravi Varma Oil Painting 59 - The Miser|work=cyberkerala.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Hungarian nobleman [[Ladislav Medňanský]] titles his humanised study "Shylock" (1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Medny%C3%A1nszky_Shylock.jpg|title=File:Mednyánszky Shylock.jpg|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from them, there is an etching by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] which emphasises the essential isolation of such figures. His enigmatic "The Miser" of 1860 pictures an individual of indeterminate gender seated with its back to the viewer in the corner of a bare room next to the window. He is looking down as if examining something and the room behind him is spartanly furnished with just a table and bench, while a broadsheet is tacked to the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etchings.arts.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/etchings/image/?filename=K0690303|title=Whistler Etchings :: Image of Impression|work=gla.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Museum Planning''' is the creation of documents to describe a new [[museum]]’s vision, the visitor experience and an organizational plan for a new institution, or one undergoing a major expansion or change in focus.

[[Museum]] plans may include some or all of the following:
* A review of institutional resources, assets and [[Collection (museum)|collections]]
* A review of local attractions and museums
* A new or updated mission and vision
* [[Collection (museum)|Collections]] objectives of the new institution
* Educational objectives of the new institution
* Experience objectives of the new institution
* Potential visitor and other audience and user groups
* [[Interpretive planning|Interpretive Plan]]
* [[Exhibition]] storylines
* Visitor flow diagrams
* Thematic treatments
* Preliminary [[exhibition]] layout
* Style Boards
* Exhibition Renderings
* Space Needs Analysis
* [[Site selection]]
* Architectural Concepts
* Preliminary staffing plan
* Preliminary project schedule
* Preliminary project budget

Plans are created by a [[museum]] planning team, that includes; [[museum]] staff and volunteers, members of the [[board of directors]], community members, and representatives of city and state planning agencies working together with a museum planner, architects, exhibit designers, economists, and other specialist consultants. The objective of a [[Museum]] Plan is to create a clear and concise “road map” for the creation of new institution and a sustainable long term museum vision.

Museum planning may also refer to the designing of [[museum]] galleries, spaces, or new wings and buildings. The goal of a well-designed museum space is that it accents the collection, and puts the patron at ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many features of galleries that must be considered when organizing and planning a new space. Some of those aspects are '''circulation, density, lighting, backgrounds, arrangement, and labels.'''

The '''circulation''' of the space indicates the layout and direction of flow for visitors. This can be done by numbering objects, or the layout of displays. Poor circulation can result in the patron missing some galleries or displays or viewing objects in an order other than what the curator intended. Circulation should feel natural and logical; the patron may feel herded and become resentful.

'''Density, clarity, and emphasis''' are other aspects to consider when planning a new space. Galleries and individual objects should be placed so that everything appears to have equal value and importance. Then within displays, objects should not be overcrowded or cluttered. '''Lighting''' is extremely important and cannot be overlooked when planning new galleries. Natural light is ideal, but it must be filtered, and not too intense. It also should be consistent throughout the day – northern and southern exposure is ideal. 

'''Backgrounds''' can refer to a number of things: props, panels, or a simple painted wall can serve as a background to an object or display.  These must be subdued enough that they do not detract from the object on display, but they should be complimentary. The specific '''position, arrangement, and display''' of an object is important to consider. Height of the display case, order in which objects are placed or hung, and the grouping of certain objects are all major factors in how patrons interpret objects. 

'''[[Museum label]] and explanatory accessories''' are essential to a patron’s experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron feels as if they understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels at the start of each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object’s use, medium, creator, and dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pekalongan''' ({{lang-jv|ꦦꦼꦏꦭꦺꦴꦔꦤ꧀}}) is a city of [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. It was formerly the seat of [[Pekalongan Regency]] on the northern coast of the province, but is now an independent municipality within the province. The city is Central Java's most important port, and is known for its [[batik]]. Since December 2014, Pekalongan is a member of UNESCO’s World’s Creative Cities Network. Pekalongan is the first Indonesian city and first South East Asian city listed as member of UNESCO’s World’s Creative Cities Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wonderful Indonesia - Pekalongan:  first Indonesian city included in  UNESCO’s World Creative Cities Network|url = http://www.indonesia.travel/en/news/detail/1497/pekalongan-first-indonesian-city-included-in-unesco-s-world-creative-cities-network|website = www.indonesia.travel|accessdate = 2015-08-16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034718/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/news/detail/1497/pekalongan-first-indonesian-city-included-in-unesco-s-world-creative-cities-network|archivedate = 2015-09-24|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch name of the city is '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''Pacalongan'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto van de haven van Pekalongan TMnr 60034240.jpg|thumb|left|Pekalongan harbour (ca.1933-40)]]
The coastal area around Pekalongan was part of the ancient Holing ([[Kalingga]]) kingdom. The 7th century [[Sojomerto inscription]], discovered in neighboring [[Batang Regency]], Central Java, is linked with Kalingga as well as the ancestor of the [[Sailendra]]s. The exact location of the Kalingga capital is unclear however, that it was suggested lies somewhere between Pekalongan and Jepara. However it is most likely that Kalingga was located in Pekalongan instead of Jepara, since there is similarity of names between Kalingga and Pekalongan. The name probably slightly shifted over centuries, from Kalingga, Kaling, Kalong, and later added with ''pe- -an'' circumfix forming "Pekalongan".

The history of Pekalongan dated back to the early 12th century. A book written in 1178 by a [[Song dynasty]] official already had record of Pekalongan, then known to Chinese merchants as "Pukalong", it was then a seaport of Java (then known as Dvapa); the king of Java lived at Pukalong, knotted his hair at the back of his head, while his people wore short hair and wrapped their body with colorfully weaved cloth.&lt;ref&gt;this means that the people of Pugalong  had already batik in 12th century&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese merchant ship set sail from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] during November, with the aid of fair wind sailed nonstop day and night, arrived at Pukalong in about one month. The people made wine from coconuts, produced very delicious red and white cane sugar, the kingdom made coins out of bronze and copper, 60 copper coins exchanged for one tael of gold. Local produces included [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[clove]], [[sandalwood]], [[eaglewood]] and white  round [[cardamom]].&lt;ref&gt;Song dynasty Zhou Qufei: Ling Wai Dai Da (Reports from Beyong the Southern Mountains) in Chinese  {{ISBN|7-101-01665-0}}. Unfortunately no English translation available, the above paragraph is my GFDL translation&lt;/ref&gt;

Pekalongan became a part of the empire of the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] through treaty and [[marriage]] alliances by the early 17th century. The area was on the geographic periphery of the empire, which was based in interior central [[Java (island)|Java]]. However, it was a wealthy area, and by the end of the 17th century, the substantial money and produce it sent to the center made it a key part of Mataram's realm. The area went into economic decline during the 18th century, and the [[Dutch East India Company]] began to gain substantial influence over the area's political and economic life. The Dutch built a fort in the city in 1753; this fort still stands.

From the 1830s, the Pekalongan area became a major producer of [[sugar]]. Sugarcane had been grown in the area since early 12th century, as recorded in Chinese history books, but production expanded substantially during the mid-19th century due to Dutch efforts. Initially, production was boosted through compulsory ''[[corvée]]'' labor; the Dutch colonial government took advantage of longstanding Javanese expectations that the peasantry contributes a part of their labor to the state. Between the 1860s and the 1890s, this system was phased out, and workers were paid directly. The colonial sugar industry collapsed during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but sugar remains a key export of the area in independent Indonesia.

On October 8, 1945, an anti "Swapraja"/anti feudalism movement called Three Regions Movement/"Gerakan Tiga Daerah" was established in Tegal, Pekalongan, and Brebes. The goal of this movement was to replace the blue blood regents (related to the kings from Jogyakarta and Surakarta) with ordinary people. According to the leaders of this movement, the old regents had cooperated with Japanese during World War II and sent people to the Japanese slave labor camps.

The main leader of this movement was Sarjiyo who became the new regent of Pekalongan. Other leaders of this movement were Kutil, K. Mijaya, and Ir. Sakirman. Ir Sakirman was the local leader of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).

The old regents were arrested, stripped naked, and dragged into the prisons. Other government officials and police officers were kidnapped and massacred at Talang bridge. This movement also started a racial riot against ethnic Chinese in Brebes.

The government of Republic of Indonesia (RI) in Jogyakarta disagree with this movement and declared it as an illegal movement.

On November 4, 1945, the movement attacked Indonesian army HQ and the regent office in Pekalongan. The rebels were defeated by Indonesian army in a fierce battle on December 21, 1945. Most leaders of this movement were arrested and thrown into the prisons. This rebellion is called '''Three Regions Affair'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2467">'''Pigres''' ({{lang-el|Πίγρης}}), a native of [[Halicarnassus]], either the brother or the son of the celebrated [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], satrap of [[Caria]]. He is spoken of by the ''[[Suda]]'' as the author of the ''[[Margites]]'' and the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'' π 1551. The author of the lemma "Pigres", however, makes the mistake of conflating this Artemisia, the advisor of Xerxes in the ''Histories'' of [[Herodotus]], with another Artemisia, the wife of [[Mausolus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter poem is also attributed to him by [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'' '''43'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was probably his work. One of his feats was a very singular one, namely, inserting a [[pentameter]] line after each hexameter in the [[Iliad]], thus: —

:{{lang|grc|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος.}}
:{{lang|grc|Μοῦσα· σὺ γὰρ πάσης πείρατ᾽ ἔχεις σοφίης.}}

:''Sing, goddess, of the ruinous wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus.
:''Muse, for you possess the means of all wisdom.

Bode (''Gesch. der Hellen. Dichtkunst''. i. p. 279) believes that the ''Margites'', though not composed by Pigres, suffered some alterations at his hands, and in that altered shape passed down to posterity. Some suppose that the [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] lines, which alternated with the [[hexameter]]s in the ''Margites'', were inserted by Pigres. He was the first poet, apparently, who introduced the iambic [[trimeter]]. (Fabric. ''Bibl. Graec.'' i. p. 519, &amp;c.)

==In Literature==

Pigres is one of the many historical characters featured in Gore Vidal's novel "Creation". In Vidal's depiction, Pigres was Artemisia's brother - excluded by her from succession to their father's throne, living in fear of her and taking up comic poetry as a refuge.

As of the 24 October 2011 census, its population was 639,951.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/iran-gilan.php?cityid=010505 |title=Rasht, Gilan, Iran |website=citypopulation.de |access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasht is the largest city on Iran's [[Caspian Sea]] coast. It is a major trade center between [[Caucasus|Caucasia]], [[Russia]] and Iran using the port of [[Bandar-e Anzali]]. Rasht is also a major tourist center with the resort of [[Masouleh]] in the adjacent mountains and the beaches of Caspian as some of the major attractions.

Historically, Rasht was a major transport and business center which connected Iran to Russia and Europe, and because of this was known as the "Gate of [[Europe]]". The city has a history that goes back to the 13th century but its modern history dates back to the [[Safavid]] era during which Rasht was a major silk trade center with numerous textile workshops.

Rasht was first mentioned in historical documents in 682 CE, but it is certainly older than this and appears on the [[Peutinger Map]] of [[late antiquity]]. It has seen the [[Sassanid]] era, the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and later Russian rulers, and British colonialism. The people of Rasht also played a major role in the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran]].

The name Rasht comes most plausibly from the verb ''reshtan'', weaving. Rasht has, along with regions around Tabriz and Tehran, one of the earliest industry plants during the last quarter of the 19th century, prominently in fields such as fishing, caviar production, the Caspian sea oil pipeline construction and textiles. During the 20th century, until the mid-70s, Gilan and the Rasht region was the third-ranking industrial city in Iran by number of workers and per capital productivity. It lost its cultural and industrial status to a large extent after the 1970s.

The people of Rasht played a prominent role in instigation and radicalization of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905–1907). Rasht is the birthplace of [[Mīrzā Kūchak Khān]], one of the leading figures of the Constitutional Revolution. His own movement in [[Gilan]], which went by the name of [[Jangalihã|Jangalis]], represented a pro-modern and social democratic program for reformation of Muslim rituals and traditions. Mirza established the short-lived [[Persian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1920 after the defeat of the constitutional forces and in coalition with Iranian communists. The republic had the support of the newly established Russian Red Army. The Soviet Government, after a turn of military and political strategy proposed by Trotsky, withdrew its support and the republic itself was tormented by the inner conflicts between the newly established [[Iranian Communist Party]] (1919) and the Jangalis and other factions. The republic was finally defeated by the Iranian army under the command of Reza Shah.

The first national library of Iran was established in Rasht under the [[Qajar dynasty]]. Furthermore, Nasim e Shomal as the first modern newspaper of Iran after the constitutional revolution has been published in Rasht, but later moved its headquarters to [[Qazvin]]. First Public Library of Iran was built in Rasht City.&lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090124144356/http://nlai.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=466]&lt;/small&gt; First Branch of the First Iranian Bank (Sepah Bank) was located in Rasht City.[http://www.banksepah.ir/default.aspx?tabid=160]&lt;/small&gt; First branch of 24/7 pharmacy (Karoon pharmacy) was built in Rasht City. First school for girls and first fire station in Iran were also built in Rasht City.

===Modern day===
[[File:Municipality of Rasht.jpg|1000px|thumbnail|center]]
Rasht is growingly turning into an industrialized town like most of the Iranian large cities and province capitals. Enjoying the Kadus International Hotel and hundreds of tourist attractions, Rasht receives thousands of foreign tourists annually, mostly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries like [[Senegal]] and [[Cameroon]] as well as countries from [[Oceania]] like [[Micronesia]]. Rasht is known for its famous building of municipality located in a square called the Square of Municipality which was constructed circa 1900 but being renovated each year. Due to the high amount of humidity in Rasht which damages and destroys the aged buildings, the native, older architectural texture of Rasht is gradually being replaced with the modern skyscrapers and apartments.

[[File:Panorama of boosar neighberhood in Rasht.tif|1000px|thumbnail|center]]

The culture of [[consumerism]] is prevalent among the people of Rasht as a cultural and urban center which is historically engaged in close commercial and political ties with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]] and [[France]]. Due to this background which makes the inhabitants much familiar with the industrial, cultural and political developments of the west, the finance and credit institutions are more willing to open representative offices and bureaus in Rasht and it has made the city a center of various banks and financial organizations. There are many commercial centers, malls and financial institutions in Rasht including one branch of the Exports Development Bank of Iran which is an international bank dealing with the Iranian exports. The organizers and directors of national Iranian or non-Iranian banks afford to spend considerable amounts of budgets to construct attractive and modern buildings for their offices in Rasht.

Since the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 in Iran, there have always been requests on behalf of Russian, [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Azeri]] banks to open branches in Rasht and that is why the city is endowed as the "gate of Europe" in Iran. The head consulate of the [[Russian Federation]] government is located in Rasht and some of the other [[Caspian region]] countries are also keen to establish representative headquarters in Rasht alongside their embassies in [[Tehran]]. Some evidences are the [[University of Gilan]] which was constructed jointly by the governments of [[Iran]] and [[West Germany]] about 40 years ago, the building of [[IRIB]] representatives in Rasht which was constructed jointly by the Iranian and [[Belgium|Belgian]] engineers.

==Climate==
Rasht has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''), bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), with warm summers and cool winters sometimes with snow that is one of the wettest in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=407190&amp;cityname=Rasht%2C+Gilan%2C+Iran&amp;units=|title=Rasht, Iran Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also relatively continental with cooler winters and higher seasonal temperature variation than in much of Iran, despite its marine position. The average humidity is 81.2%, contrasting heavily with cities in many other parts of Iran. Sunshine hours, averaging roughly 1,520 per year, are lower than in most places in Iran and also compared to most places at this latitude. Rasht is also known as "The City of Rain".

==Demography==
===Language===
The people of Rasht speak [[Gileki]] as their mother tongue and [[Persian language]] as of the official language of Iran. [[Gileki]] is spoken by more than 3 million people.

The Iranian languages form a top-level constituent of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Gileki is closely related to [[Mazanderani language|Mazanderani]] and is subdivided into two main dialects: Bie-pas and Bie-pish. Bie-pas dialect is mainly spoken in west of Sepidroud including Rasht and Fuman while Bie-pish dialect belongs to eastern part of Gilan including Lahijan and Langrud.

In some rural areas near the Rasht, school teachers give their courses in [[Gileki]] rather than Persian.

They spend the leisure times going to cinemas, art exhibitions, music concerts and international book fairs that are being held in the city most of times in a year.

Following football, [[wrestling]], [[judo]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] are the most popular sports of youth in Rasht and that is due to the enchanting appearance of Iranian wrestlers and weightlifters in the international competitions like [[Olympics]]. The outstanding figure of world weightlifting and the two-time olympics Gold medal winner [[Hossein Rezazadeh]] is a main inspirer of Rasht youth to try [[Olympic weightlifting|Weightlifting]] as their professional job. [[Asghar Ebrahimi]] who was the squad captain of Iranian weightlifting team at the [[2008 Olympics]] is from Rasht and a successful example of those youth from Rasht who tried this national field of sport after [[Hossein Rezazadeh]].

[[File:Rosa 'Rose de Rescht' IMG 0167.jpg|thumb|Rosa 'Rose de Rescht']]
Like many old garden roses, it presents an interesting historical background story. 
This cultivar, originating in Iran, was reported at the end of 19th century in England, but it was then forgotten. 
It was rediscovered near the Iranian provincial capital of Rascht by Miss Nancy Lindsay in 1945, and was brought back to the United Kingdom, where it was re-introduced around 1950.
Today it is shown in the Victorian Class, winning many trophies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scvrs.homestead.com/RoseDeRescht.html History of Rose de Rescht Rose]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert B Suda''' (A.k.a. '''Suda Balázs Róbert''', born 16 June 1978) is a London-based theatre director, playwright and producer who has a BA and two MAs in cultural management (Janus Pannonius University of Pecs - 2000), theatre project management (University of Pecs 2002) and advanced theatre studies (Theatrology – University of Pannonia 2006). Since 1997, he has directed and produced numerous shows on stage, which have been highly acclaimed by both critics and audiences. He also has significant experience in producing for stage and for TV.
He was both educated in and employed Constantin Stanislavski’s method of psychological realism [[Theatrical realism]] and the directing technique of Bertold Brecht [[Epic theatre]]. His works are also highly influenced by neo-expressionism, constructivism and minimalism. In his productions he has combined these techniques with elements of physical theatre, dance, pantomime and minimalist architectural set design both in prose and musical productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.covershow.hu/data/nepszw2.html |title= Dráma, diszkó életre-halálra |accessdate=2014-09-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He worked in long-term artistic collaboration with Veronika Karsai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pantomim.hu/?main=eletrajz |title= Karsai Veronika és társulatainak honlapja |accessdate=2014-09-26 |work=Karsai Veronika}}&lt;/ref&gt; pantomime artist and physical-theatre director. During their teamwork they developed and staged two productions (Cursed Cows, richard2nixon) establishing their own theatrical form of expression. Suda’s another long-term collaborative artistic colleague was Attila Galambos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.galambosattila.hu/galambos-attila/ |title= Galambos Attila honlapja |accessdate=2014-09-26 |work=Galambos Attila}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom they not only have written mainstream musicals (That’s Enough!, Covershow, Better Than Sex), but Galambos, as an actor, was a part of many of Suda’s productions (The Dumb-waiter, Cursed Cows, Covershow, moNOporno).
In 2005, he was selected as one of the best young playwrights of the year by the Young Writers’ Association, Hungary, (FISz)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fiatalirok.blog.hu/2012/01/06/fisz_taglista#S |title= FISZ taglista |accessdate=2014-09-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his play Cursed Cows, which he both wrote and directed. The script was published by the Association in 2006.&lt;ref name="hübners"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whoiswho-verlag.ch/versionnew/ungarn/verlag/63.php?txt_Language=HU&amp;real_str_PersID=49004199&amp;uniqueID=e6d342f7-390a-4e4e-9e66-71a49d1c07a8 |title= Who is Who |accessdate=2014-09-26 |work= Hübners }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fiatalirok.blog.hu/2011/06/02/az_eddigi_fisz_kiadvanyok_listaja#more2946498 |title= Az eddigi FISZ-kiadványok listája|accessdate=2014-09-26 |work= FISZinfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
While he was working on different stage productions, Mr Suda was a theatre columnist of Musical&amp;Operetta magazine between2003 and 2005 where he published many articles and interviews regarding Hungarian and international musical productions. Mr Suda was commissioned by MUSICALITAS School for Musical and Drama (Budapest) to undertake the role of the drama, musical and theatre history teacher of school for a year term from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musicalitas.hu|title= Musicalitas |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Writers' Association(FISz) published his first collection of dramas in 2007 including the award-winner play Cursed Cows (ÁtkozottTehenek) and the highly successful political play, richard2nixon, co-written by Elod P Csirmaz for the Thalia Theatre, Budapest.&lt;ref name="hübners" /&gt;

== References ==
{{reflist}}

&lt;!-- “The FISZ award-winner director’s greatest feat is—who has staged contemporary plays and mainstream musicals—that he was able to integrate the exciting, unruly personality of the rock-star, Miss Pasztor and the songs of her band into the texture of the show. The projected road-movie scenes on the white canvases of the set, the video installations and the elements of virtual reality are the imprints of a mind-blowing amuck which not only delivers deeply multi-layered meaning but also gives a mainstream style to the whole show.” – KultutPart, V.M.R. on MoNOporno, or Miss Julie

“Suda has staged a disco-era Greek Tragedy in the Belvarosi Theatre… and has this ground-breaking twentieth-century antique tragedy played in a most pleasing manner.”
– Tamas Tarjan, Nepszava on CoverShow – The Musical

'''Río Bec''' is a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located in what is now southern portion of the [[Mexican state]] of  [[Campeche]]. The name also refers to an  [[architecture|architectural]] style (Río Bec Style) that first appeared at Río Bec and subsequently spread to other nearby sites.  The Río Bec Style is closely related to the [[Chenes]] architectural style found northwest of the Río Bec region.

== The archaeological site ==
[[File:Rio Bec B.jpg|left|thumb|The main building of group Rio Bec B]]The Río Bec site was first mentioned by [[Austria]]n [[explorer]] [[Teoberto Maler]] at the end of the 19th century, though he never visited the site.  The [[France|French]] explorer Maurice de Perigny was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] to visit and report on the Río Bec.  The site is now being excavated and restored by a group of French [[archaeologist]]s from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] headed by Dominique Michelet. They have located several architectural groups and their surveys and maps of several square kilometers give us a better understanding of the ancient settlement. Excavation of the principal building at Río Bec A, a building with three towers and several rooms, is now underway.

== The Rio Bec architectural style ==
Río Bec temple pyramids are located in the central [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lowlands.  The temple-pyramids are characterized by a unique architectural style that began to appear during the seventh century A.D. and continued into the early twelfth century A.D.  The temple-pyramids consist of a range-type building with typically two nonfunctional solid masonry towers on both ends of the range-type building [http://www.mayaruins.com/becan/m3_048a.html].   
The twin-towers narrow with ascension in order to give an [[illusion]] of greater height.  The twin-towers appear to have stairs along their faces leading to the [[temple]] that rests atop them.  However, the steps are only a design motif that creates the illusion of functional stairs.  Even if the steps were functional, the towers rise at steep vertical angles that would make ascending them difficult.
The temples, which are located on the platform at the top of the Río Bec towers are inoperative as well.  The temples are solid masses with no interior rooms.  Pseudo-doorways, which have been built into niches in the fronts of the temples, give the appearance of a functional door [https://web.archive.org/web/20040822231216/http://www.mexicoweb.com/travel/zcamruni.html].
Despite their nonfunctional components, the Río Bec towers hold the typical decorations of a [[pyramid]] and its upper temple and at first glance are taken as functional pyramids. The purpose of the Río Bec temple-pyramids is unknown, but they do resemble the twin-tower complexes of [[Tikal]].

'''Semantic holism''' is a [[philosophical theory|theory]] in the [[philosophy of language]] to the effect that a certain part of language, be it a term or a complete sentence, can only be understood through its relations to a (previously understood) larger segment of language.   There is substantial controversy, however, as to exactly what the larger segment of language in question consists of. In recent years, the debate surrounding semantic holism, which is one among the many forms of [[holism]] that are debated and discussed in contemporary philosophy, has tended to centre on the view that the "whole" in question consists of an entire language.

==Background==
Since the ''[[pragmatics|use]]'' of a linguistic expression is only possible if the speaker who uses it understands its ''meaning'', one of the central problems for analytic philosophers has always been the question of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]. What is it? Where does it come from? How is it communicated? And, among these questions, what is the smallest unit of meaning, the smallest fragment of language with which it is possible to communicate something? At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, [[Gottlob Frege]] and his followers abandoned the view, common at the time, that a word gets its meaning in isolation, independently from all the rest of the words in a language. Frege, as an alternative, formulated his famous [[context principle]], according to which it is only within the context of an entire sentence that a word acquires its meaning. In the 1950s, the agreement that seemed to have been reached regarding the primacy of sentences in semantic questions began to unravel with the collapse of the movement of [[logical positivism]] and the powerful influence exercised by the philosophical investigations of the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]. Wittgenstein wrote in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', in fact, that "comprehending a proposition means comprehending a language". About the same time or shortly after, [[W. V. O. Quine]] wrote that "the unit of measure of empirical meaning is all of science in its globality"; and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], in 1967, put it even more sharply by saying that "a sentence (and therefore ''a word'') has meaning only in the context of a (whole) language".

==Problems==
If semantic holism is interpreted as the thesis that any linguistic expression ''E'' (a word, a phrase or sentence) of some natural language ''L'' cannot be understood in isolation and that there are inevitably many ties between the expressions of ''L'', it follows that to understand ''E'' one must understand a set ''K'' of expressions to which ''E'' is related. If, in addition, no limits are placed on the size of ''K'' (as in the cases of Davidson, Quine and, perhaps, Wittgenstein), then ''K'' coincides with the "whole" of ''L''.

The many and substantial problems with this position have been described by [[Michael Dummett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Ernest Lepore]] and others. In the first place, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of ''L'' can acquire knowledge of (learn) the meaning of ''E'', for any expression ''E'' of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or Italian or German) language, even on the assumption that languages are static and immutable entities (which is false). Therefore, if one must understand all of a natural language ''L'' to understand the single word or expression ''E'', then language learning is simply impossible.

Semantic holism, in this sense, also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how communication is even possible between them. Given a sentence ''P'', since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and ''P'' is related to the sentences in each part differently, the result is that ''P'' means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence ''P'' derives its meaning from the relations it entertains with the totality of sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence  ''P','' the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of ''P''. As this is a very common phenomenon, the result is that ''P'' has two different meanings in two different moments during the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of what I rejected and what I accepted are completely different, and therefore I cannot change my opinions regarding the same sentences.

==Holism of mental content==
These sorts of counterintuitive consequences of semantic holism also affect another form of holism, often identified with but, in fact, distinct from semantic holism: the holism of [[mental content]]. This is the thesis that the meaning of a particular [[propositional attitude]] (thought, desire, belief) acquires its content by virtue of the role that it plays within the web that connects it to all the other propositional attitudes of an individual.  Since there is a very tight relationship between the content of a mental state ''M'' and the sentence ''P'', which expresses it and makes it publicly communicable, the tendency in recent discussion is to consider the term "content" to apply indifferently both to linguistic expressions and to mental states, regardless of the extremely controversial question of which category (the mental or the linguistic) has priority over the other and which, instead, possesses only a ''derived'' meaning.  So, it would seem that semantic holism ties the philosopher's hands. By making it impossible to explain language learning and to provide a unique and consistent description of the meanings of linguistic expressions, it blocks off any possibility of formulating a theory of meaning; and, by making it impossible to individuate the exact contents of any propositional attitude—given the necessity of considering a potentially infinite and continuously evolving set of mental states—it blocks off the possibility of formulating a theory of the mind.

==Confirmation holism==
The key to answering this question lies in going back to Quine and his attack on logical positivism.
The logical positivists, who dominated the philosophical scene for almost the entire first half of the twentieth century, maintained that genuine knowledge consisted in all and only such knowledge as was capable of manifesting a strict relationship with empirical experience. Therefore, they believed, the only linguistic expressions (manifestations of knowledge) that had meaning were those that either directly referred to observable entities, or that could be reduced to a vocabulary that directly referred to such entities. A sentence S contained knowledge only if it possessed a meaning, and it possessed a meaning only if it was possible to refer to a set of experiences that could, at least potentially, verify it and to another set that could potentially falsify it. Underlying all this, there is an implicit and powerful connection between [[epistemology|epistemological]] and semantic questions. This connection carries over into the work of Quine in ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''.

Quine's holistic argument against the neo-positivists set out to demolish the assumption that every sentence of a language is bound univocally to its own set of potential verifiers and falsifiers and the result was that the epistemological value of every sentence must depend on the entire language. Since the epistemological value of every sentence, for Quine just as for the positivists, was the meaning of that sentence, then the meaning of every sentence must depend on every other. As Quine states it:

: All of our so-called knowledge or convictions, from questions of geography and history to the most profound laws of atomic physics or even mathematics and logic, are an edifice made by man that touches experience only at the margins. Or, to change images, science in its globality is like a force field whose limit points are experiences...a particular experience is never tied to any proposition inside the field except indirectly, for the needs of equilibrium which affect the field in its globality.

For Quine then (although Fodor and Lepore have maintained the contrary), and for many of his followers, [[confirmation holism]] and semantic holism are inextricably linked. Since confirmation holism is widely accepted among philosophers, a serious question for them has been to determine whether and how the two holisms can be distinguished or how the undesirable consequences of ''unbuttoned holism'', as Michael Dummett has called it, can be limited.

==Moderate holism==
Numerous philosophers of language have taken the latter avenue, abandoning the early Quinean holism in favour of what Michael Dummett has labelled ''semantic molecularism''. These philosophers generally deny that the meaning of an expression ''E'' depends on the meanings of the words of the entire language ''L'' of which it is part and sustain, instead, that the meaning of ''E'' depends on some subset of ''L''. These positions, notwithstanding the fact that many of their proponents continue to call themselves holists, are actually intermediate between holism and atomism.

Dummett, for example, after rejecting Quinean holism (holism ''tout court'' in his sense), takes precisely this approach. But those who would opt for some version of moderate holism need to make the distinction between the parts of a language that are "constitutive" of the meaning
of an expression ''E'' and those that are not without falling into the extraordinarily problematic analytic/synthetic distinction.  Fodor and Lepore (1992) present several arguments to demonstrate that this is impossible.

===Arguments against molecularism===
According to Fodor and Lepore, there is a quantificational ambiguity in the molecularist's typical formulation of his thesis: someone can believe P only if she believes a sufficient number of other propositions. They propose to disambiguate this assertion into a ''strong'' and a ''weak'' version:

: (S) &lt;math&gt; \forall p \exists q \ne p \Box (B(x,p) \rightarrow B(x,q)) &lt;/math&gt;
: (W) &lt;math&gt; \Box (B(x,p) \rightarrow \exists q \ne p (B(x,q)) &lt;/math&gt;

The first statement asserts that there are other propositions, besides ''p'', that one must believe in order to believe that ''p''. The second says that one cannot believe that ''p'' unless there are other propositions in which one believes. If one accepts the first reading, then one must accept the existence of a set of sentences that are necessarily believed and hence fall into the analytic/synthetic distinction. The second reading is useless (too weak) to serve the molecularist's needs since it only requires that if, say, two people believe the same proposition ''p'', they also believe in at least one other proposition. But, in this way, each one will connect to ''p'' his own inferences and communication will remain impossible.

[[Carlo Penco]] criticizes this argument by pointing out that there is an intermediate reading Fodor and Lepore have left out of count:

: (I) &lt;math&gt; \Box (B(x,p) \land B(y,p) \rightarrow \exists q \ne p (B(x,q) \land B(y,q)) &lt;/math&gt;

This says that two people cannot believe the same proposition unless they also both believe a proposition different from ''p''.  This helps to some extent but there is still a problem in terms of identifying how the different propositions shared by the two speakers are specifically related to each other.  Dummett's proposal is based on an analogy from logic. To understand a logically complex sentence it is necessary to understand one that is logically less complex. In this manner, the distinction between logically less complex sentences that are ''constitutive'' of the meaning of a logical constant and logically more complex sentences that are not takes on the role of the old analytic/synthetic distinction. "The comprehension of a sentence in which the [[logical constant]] does not figure as a principal operator depends on the comprehension of the constant, but does not contribute to its constitution." For example,  one can explain the use of the conditional in &lt;math&gt; (a \lor \lnot b) \rightarrow c &lt;/math&gt; by stating that the whole sentence is false if the part before the arrow is true and c is false. But to understand &lt;math&gt; a \lor \lnot b &lt;/math&gt; one must already know the meaning of "not" and "or." This is, in turn, explained by giving the rules of introduction for simple schemes such as &lt;math&gt; P \lor Q &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lnot Q &lt;/math&gt;.
To comprehend a sentence is to comprehend all and only the sentences of less logical complexity than the sentence that one is trying to comprehend.
However, there is still a problem with extending this approach to natural languages. If I understand the word "hot" because I have understood the phrase "this stove is hot", it seems that I am defining the term by reference to a set of stereotypical objects with the property of being hot. If I don't know what it means for these objects to be "hot", such a set or listing of objects is not helpful.

==Holism and compositionality==
The relationship between [[compositionality]] and semantic holism has also been of interest to many philosophers of language. On the surface it would seem that these two ideas are in complete and irremediable contradiction. Compositionality is the principle that states that the meaning of a complex expression depends on the meaning of its parts and on its mode of composition. As stated before, holism, on the other hand, is the thesis that the meanings of expressions of a language are determined by their relations with the other expressions of the language as a whole. [[Peter Pagin]], in an essay called ''Are Compositionality and Holism Compatible'' identifies three points of incompatibility between these two hypotheses. The first consists in the simple observation that while, for holism, the meaning of the whole would seem to ''precede'' that of its parts in terms of priority, for compositionality, the reverse is true, the meaning of the parts ''precedes'' that of the whole. The second incoherence consists in the fact that a necessity to attribute "strange" meanings to the components of larger expressions would apparently result from any attempt to reconcile compositionality and holism. Pagin takes a specific holistic theory of meaning – [[inferential role semantics]], the theory according to which the meaning of an expression is determined by the inferences that it involves – as his paradigm of holism. If we interpret this theory holistically, the result will be that ''every'' accepted inference that involves some expression will enter into the meaning of that expression. Suppose, for example, that Fred believes that "Brown cows are dangerous". That is, he accepts the inference from "brown cows" to "dangerous." This entails that this inference is now part of the meaning of "brown cow." According to compositionality then, "cow implies dangerous" and "brown implies dangerous" are both true because they are the constituents of the expression "brown cow." But is this really an inevitable consequence of the acceptance of the holism of inferential role semantics? To see why it's not assume the existence of a relation of inference ''I'' between two expressions ''x'' and ''y'' and that the relation applies just in case ''F'' accepts the inference from ''x'' to ''y''.  Suppose that in the extension of ''I'', there are the following pairs of expressions ("The sky is blue and leaves are green", "the sky is blue") and ("brown cow", "dangerous").

There is also a second relation ''P'', which applies to two expressions just in case the first is part of the second. So, ("brown, "brown cow") belongs to the extension of ''P''. Two more relations, "Left" and "Right",  are required:

: &lt;math&gt; L(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \leftrightarrow P(\alpha,\beta) \land I(\beta,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; R(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \leftrightarrow P(\alpha,\gamma) \land I(\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

The first relation means that ''L'' applies between α,β and γ just in case α is a part of β and ''F'' accepts the inference between β and γ. The relation ''R'' applies between α, β, and γ just in case α is a part of γ and ''F'' accepts the inference from β to γ.

The Global Role, G(α), of a simple expression ''α''
can then be defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; G(\alpha) = ([(\beta,\gamma) : L(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)], [(\beta,\gamma) : R(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)]) \;&lt;/math&gt;

The global role of &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; consists in a pair of sets, each one composed of a pair of sets of expressions. If ''F'' accepts the inference from &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a part of &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, then the couple &lt;math&gt; (\beta,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt; is an element of the set which is an element of the right side of the Global Role of α. This makes Global Roles for simple expressions sensitive to changes in the acceptance of inferences by ''F''.
The Global Role for complex expressions can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; G(\beta) = [G(\alpha_1)...G(\alpha_n)] \;&lt;/math&gt;

The Global Role of the complex expression β is the n- tuple of the global roles of its constituent parts.
The next problem is to develop a function that assigns meanings to Global Roles. This function is generally called a homomorphism and says that for every syntactic function ''G'' that assigns to simple expressions α1...αn some complex expression β, there exists a function ''F'' from meanings to meanings:

:&lt;math&gt; h(G(\beta)) = h([G(\alpha_1)...G(\alpha_n)]) = F(h(G(\alpha_1))...h(G(\alpha_n))). \;&lt;/math&gt;

This function is one to one in that it assigns exactly one meaning to every Global Role.  According to Fodor and Lepore, holistic inferential role semantics leads to the absurd conclusion that part of the meaning of "brown cow" is constituted by the inference "Brown cow implies dangerous."
This is true if the function from meanings to Global Roles is one to one. In this case, in fact, the meanings of "brown", "cow" and "dangerous" all contain the inference "Brown cows are dangerous"!! But this only true if the relation is one to one. Since it is one to one, "brown" would not have the meaning it has unless it had the global role that it has. If we change the relation so that it is many to one (h*), many global roles can share the same meaning. So suppose that the meaning of "brown "is given by M("brown"). It does not follow from this that L("brown", "brown cow", "dangerous") is true unless all of the global roles that h* assigns to M("brown") contain ("brown cow", "dangerous"). And this is not necessary for holism. In fact, with this many to one relation from Global Roles meanings, it is possible to change opinions with respect to an inference consistently. Suppose that B and C initially accept all of the same inferences, speak the same language and they both accept that "brown cows imply dangerous." Suddenly, B changes his mind and rejects the inference. If the function from meanings to Global Role is one to one, then many of B's Global Roles have changed and therefore their meanings. But if there is no one to one assignment, then B's change in belief in the inference about brown cows does not necessarily imply a difference is the meaning of the terms he uses. Therefore, it is not intrinsic to holism that communication or change of opinion is impossible.

==Holism and externalism==
Since the concept of semantic holism, as explained above, is often used to refer to theories of meaning in natural languages but also to theories of mental content such as the hypothesis of a [[language of thought]], the question often arises as to how to reconcile the idea of semantic holism (in the sense of the meanings of expressions in mental languages) with the phenomenon called [[externalism]] in [[philosophy of mind]]. Externalism is the thesis that the propositional attitudes of an individual are determined, at least in part, by her relations with her environment (both social and natural). [[Hilary Putnam]] formulated the thesis of the ''natural'' externalism of mental states in his ''The Meaning of "Meaning"''. In it, he described his famous [[thought experiment]] involving [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earths]]: two individuals, Calvin and Carvin, live, respectively, on the real earth (E) of our everyday experience and on an exact copy (E') with the only difference being that on E "water" stands for the substance &lt;math&gt; H_2O &lt;/math&gt;  while on E' it stands for some substance macroscopically identical to water but which is actually composed of XYZ. According to Putnam, only Calvin has genuine experiences that involve water, so only his term "water" really refers to water.

[[Tyler Burge]], in ''Individualism and the Mental'', describes a different thought experiment that led to the notion of the ''social'' externalism of mental contents. In Burge's experiment, a person named Jeffray believes that he has arthritis in his thighs and we can correctly attribute to him the (mistaken) belief that he has arthritis in his thighs because he is ignorant of the fact that arthritis is a disease of the articulation of the joints. In another society, there is an individual named Goodfrey who also believes that he has arthritis in the thighs. But in the case of Goodfrey the belief is correct because in the counterfactual society in which he lives "arthritis" is defined as a disease that can include the thighs.

The question then arises of the possibility of reconciling externalism with holism.  The one seems to be saying that meanings are determined by the external relations (with society or the world), while the other suggests that meaning is determined by the relation of words (or beliefs) to all the other words (or beliefs). [[Frederik Stjernfelt]] identifies at least three possible ways to reconcile them and then points out some objections.

The first approach is to insist that there is no conflict because holists do not mean the phrase "determine beliefs" in the sense of individuation but rather of attribution. But the problem with this is that if one is not a "realist" about mental states, then all we are left with is the attributions themselves and, if these are holistic, then we really have a form of hidden ''constitutive holism'' rather than a genuine ''attributive holism''. But if one is a "realist" about mental states, then why not say that we can actually individuate them and therefore that instrumentalist attributions are just a short-term strategy?

Another approach is to say that externalism is valid only for certain beliefs and that holism only suggests that beliefs are determined only ''in part'' by their relations with other beliefs. In this way, it is possible to say that externalism applies only to those beliefs not determined by their relations with other beliefs (or for the part of a belief that is not determined by its relations with other parts of other beliefs), and holism is valid to the extent that beliefs (or parts of beliefs) are not determined externally. The problem here is that the whole scheme is based on the idea that certain relations are constitutive (i.e. necessary) for the determination of the beliefs and others are not. Thus, we have reintroduced the idea of an analytic/synthetic distinction with all of the problems that that carries with it.

A third possibility is to insist that there are two distinct ''types'' of belief: those determined holistically and those determined externally. Perhaps the external beliefs are those that are determined by their relations with the external world through observation and the holistic ones are the theoretical statements. But this implies the abandonment of a central pillar of holism: the idea that there can be no one to one correspondence between behavior and beliefs. There will be cases in which the beliefs that are determined externally correspond one to one with perceptual states of the subject.

One last proposal is to carefully distinguish between so-called narrow content states and broad content states. The first would be determined in a holistic manner and the second non-holistically and externalistically. But how to distinguish between the two notions of content while providing a justification of the possibility of formulating an idea of narrow content that does not depend on a prior notion of broad content?

These are some of the problems and questions that have still to be resolved by those who would adopt a position of "holistic externalism" or "externalist holism".

==In Antiquity==

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] takes the bull-form known as Taurus in order to win [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Taurus is also associated with [[Aphrodite]] and other goddesses, as well as with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]]. The face of Taurus "gleams with seven rays of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', v.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chaldean Oracles]] of the 2nd century CE feature the seven rays as purifying agents of [[Helios]], symbolism featured in [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] liturgy as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ow0VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chaldean+Seven+Rays&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=08IwTY6kLMG88gaB-MGdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaldean%20Seven%20Rays&amp;f=false "The Chaldean oracles: text, translation, and commentary" by Julianus (the Theurgist.), Ruth Dorothy Majercik, ed., p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 4th century, [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian Saturnalia]] composed a ''Hymn to the Solemn Sun'', and in his ''Hymn to the Mother of the Gods'' spoke of "unspeakable mysteries hidden from the crowd such as Julian the Chaldean prophesied concerning the god of the seven rays."  In Greek Gnostic magic of the same era, colored gemstones were often used as [[amulet|talisman]]s for medicine or healing; they were often engraved with a symbol borrowed from the Egyptian deity [[Chnuphis]]: a hooded serpent or great snake. The snake was shown with a lion's head, from which emanated either twelve or seven rays. The twelve rays represented the [[zodiac]], and the seven rays represented the planets, usually with the seven Greek vowels engraved at the tips of the seven rays. The reverse sides of the talismans were engraved with a snake twisting around a vertical rod. These were known as "Gnostic [[amulet]]s" and were sometimes also engraved with the names ''Iao Sabao'' ([[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]]).&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science|author=Lynn Thorndike |publisher=Columbia University Press |year= 1958 |pages=317–318, 379 |isbn= 0-231-08794-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gnostic gems with [[Abraxas]] also featured the seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/gar31.htm#page_218 "Part III.

[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]] is an oil painting by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436. The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the Son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38). In a prominent element of the complex iconographic work, the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg39/gg39-49.0.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art|quote=The Holy Spirit descends to her on seven rays of light.

The Italian [[secret society]] of the late 17th century, [[Knights of the Apocalypse]], was founded with the professed aim to defend the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] against the expected [[Antichrist]], though it was accused of having political motives as well.

==In Hindu scripture==
[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|The seven-armed Agni with his wife.]]
[[Agni]] is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]] depicted in three forms: fire, lightning and the sun. In Hindu art, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads, and three legs. In each head, he has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. His attributes are an axe, a torch, prayer beads and a flaming spear. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and his beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair. Seven rays of light emanate from his body.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana]], a [[vedas|post-vedic]] scripture, describes how [[Vishnu]] "enters into the seven solar rays which dilate into seven suns." These are the "seven principal solar rays," the source of heat even to the planet Jupiter, and the "seven suns into which the seven solar rays dilate at the consummation of all things..."&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

20th century Hindu scholar, poet and mystic, [[Sri Aurobindo]], described the Vedic seven rays of knowledge, or [[Agni]], as "the seven forms of the Thought-principle" and wrote that "the seven brilliant horses of the sun and their full union constitutes the seven-headed Thought of Ayasya by which the lost sun of Truth is recovered. That thought is again established in the seven rivers, the seven principles of being divine and human, the totality of which founds the perfect spiritual existence."&lt;ref name="Aurobindo"/&gt;

==Syncretistic interpretations==

Egyptologist [[Gerald Massey]] wrote in 1881 of what he described as connections between Vedic scripture, ancient Egyptian mythology and the Gospel stories.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey Collection-Upper Norwood Joint Library&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that [[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]], the "Seven-rayed Sun-God of the Gnostic-stones" was also the "Serpent Chnubis," and "the Second Beast in the Book of Revelation."&lt;ref name="massey-genesis"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural Genesis |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Black Classic Press |year= 1998 |edition=from original published circa 1881 |pages=366, 369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he elaborated further, describing the unity of "the seven souls of the Pharaoh," "the seven arms of the Hindu god [[Agni]]," "the seven stars in the hand of the Christ in Revelation," and "the seven rays of the Chaldean god Heptaktis, or Iao, on the Gnostic stones."&lt;ref name="massey-lectures"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gerald Massey's Lectures |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year= 1992 |edition=from original published posthumously circa 1900 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Fales Dunlap, wrote in 1894:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moses was of the race of the Chaldeans. The Chaldean Mithra had his Seven Rays, and Moses his Seven Days. The other planets which circling around the sun lead the dance as round the King of heaven receive from him with the light also their powers; while as the light comes to them from the sun so from him they receive their powers that he pours out into the Seven Spheres of the Seven Planets of which the sun is the centre.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dunlap wrote that the idea of spirit as the ultimate cause is present in all of the great religions of the East (which in the terminology of his time included the area now known as the Near East or Middle East), and that this idea can be found in "the Seven Rays of the Chaldaean [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithra]] and the Seven Days of Genesis. From the Sun came fire and spirit." According to Dunlap, "this was the astronomical religion of the Chaldeans, Jews, Persians, Syrians, Phoenicians and Egyptians."&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithra mysteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap | publisher=G Redway &amp; JW Bouton |year= 1894 |pages=reface, iii-vi |edition=Original from the University of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunlap compared the [[Halo (religious iconography)#Ancient Greek world|nimbus]] of [[Apollo]] to the seven rays of [[Dionysus]], presiding over the orbits of the seven planets. The seven rays are found also in the Chaldean mystery of "the God of the Seven Rays, who held the Seven Stars in his hand, through whom (as Chaldaeans supposed) the souls were raised." Prior to the Christian era, this deity was known as Iao (the first birth) or  [[Sabaoth]] (the Sun), and later described as "Christos of the Resurrection of Souls."&lt;ref name="dunlap2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithramsyteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap |publisher=G.

In the late 1940s, art historian and writer [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] was curator in the department of Asiatic Art at the Boston [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and built the first large collection of Indian art in the United States. His writings in the field of [[perennial philosophy]] and the [[Traditionalist School]] included complex essays collating symbols of ancient wisdom and metaphysics from widely diverse cultures including Indian, Islamic, Chinese, Hellenic, and Christian sources. He wrote that the seven rays of the sun appear in both Hindu and Christian symbolism, representing similar concepts, and in particular the symbolism of the seventh ray that "corresponds to the distinction of transcendent from immanent and of infinite from finite." He added that of "our Axis of the Universe ([[Stambha|skambha]], divo dharuna, etc.) and Islamic [[Qutb]] ..... The seventh ray alone passes through the Sun to the suprasolar Brahma worlds, "where no sun shines" ('all that is under the Sun being in the power of Death, and all beyond immortal')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Door in the Sky: Coomaraswamy on Myth and Meaning |author=Ananda K.

==In Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Syncretism is one of the core principles of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a religious philosophy originating with [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] from the 1870s, and the seven rays appear repeatedly in the related writings. Theosophy holds that all [[religion]]s are attempts by the "[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]" to help humanity in evolving to greater perfection, and that each religion therefore has a portion of the truth.

Blavatsky wrote in the first book of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' of an " analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism" and that the "seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones" represent the seven large stars of the Egyptian "Great Bear" constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu "seven Rishis." She stated that the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu represent the same concept as the "astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists," and that the seven emanations of the lower seven [[sephirot]]h are the "primeval seven rays," and "will be found and recognized in every religion."&lt;ref name="doctrine1-129"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 1, p 129–130, 523, 573–4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky discusses the "seven nervous plexuses of the body" and the seven rays they radiate, stating that this principle is found in the [[Rig Veda]], in the mythology of [[Ahura Mazda]], in the beliefs of the Incas, the Chinese Yao, and the Egyptian Osiris, who "when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes seven Rays with him." She describes the "seven wise ones" of the Veda as "the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre".&lt;ref name="doctrine2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 143, 191 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky summarizes the syncretistic principle of her doctrine as it relates to the seven rays:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a key which reveals to us on indisputable grounds of comparative analogy... the Indian phœnix, the emblem of cyclic and periodical time, the "man-lion" Singha, of whose representations the so-called "gnostic gems" are so full. Over the seven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet AEHIOYW, testifying to the Seven Heavens. This is the Solar lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as Garuda is that of the great cycle, the "Maha-Kalpa" co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of the Sun, and Solar cycle. ... As well remarked by C. W. King: — "Whatever the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels) it was probably imported in its present shape from India, that true fountain head of gnostic iconography." (Gnostics, p. 218)&lt;ref name="Doctrine 2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 564–5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the third volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', published posthumously, Blavatsky described the "Seven Primeval Rays" as a group of celestial beings also known as "Gods" or "[[Deva (New Age)|Angels]]" or "Powers". She stated that this symbolism was "adopted later on by the Christian Religion as the 'Seven [[Angel of the Presence|Angels of the Presence]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Occultism Of The Secret Doctrine  |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year= 2004 |edition=originally published in 1897 |isbn= 1-4179-1104-2 |page=art I, page 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theosophy, the seven rays are said to be seven major types of ''Light-Substance'' (spirit/matter) (waves/particles) that compose the created universes. These are also believed to convey "Divine Qualities".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Reed. [http://www.blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm ''Blavatsky' Foreknowledge of The Wave/Particle Duality of Light''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044457/http://blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm |date=2006-09-27 }} 1997. "It would also be incorrect to claim light is fully explained as a particle. Rather it has a dual nature possessing the properties of both [[wave]] and [[Elementary particle|particle]]. In general, [[electromagnetic radiation]] acts more like waves in the [[radio wave]] end of the [[spectrum]], more like particles in the [[x-ray]] end of the spectrum, and usually (but not always) like a wave in the "middle" light area of the spectrum in our everyday experience. Her ambiguity, then, reflects a fact in nature, the wave/particle duality of nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===C.W. Leadbeater===

[[C.W. Leadbeater]] gave a list showing the characteristic type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for each ray. This list indicates what he regarded as the most compatible type of magic to be performed by persons on each ray (although anyone of any ray can do any of these various types of magic).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--The Theosophical Publishing House. Chart on P. 229 lists Characteristic Magic of each Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;

* First ray: Magic of [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] of [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]
* Second ray: Magic of [[Raja Yoga]] (Development of Mind)
* Third ray: Magic of [[Astrology]] (Natural Magnetic Forces)
* Fourth ray: Magic of [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]] (physical development)
* Fifth ray: Magic of [[Alchemy]] (Manipulation of Material Substances)
* Sixth ray: Magic of [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]] (Selfless Service and Altruistic Love; [[agape]])
* Seventh ray: [[Ceremonial magic]] (Invocation of Elementals, and [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]])

==New Age teachings==

According to [[Alice A. Bailey]], each person has a ''soul ray'' that remains the same through all their incarnations, and a ''personality ray'' that is different for each incarnation. Each ray is also correspondent with certain Masters of Wisdom, and with particular planets, cycles, nations, etc. The seven rays are the basis for what Alice A. Bailey called ''New Age Psychology''—she divides everyone in the human race into these seven [[psychological type]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Seven Rays of Life'' New York: 1995—Lucis Publishing Co. Compilation from all the [[Alice A. Bailey]] books of material about the seven rays.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey stated that the seven rays that reach us on [[Earth]] locally originate within the "Solar Logos," i.e., the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Sun]]. According to Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]], the seven rays are focused to the Solar Logos, through [[Sirius]], the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], and the seven major stars of the [[Pleiades]] form the "Galactic Logos," (the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]), and have their ultimate origin within the mind of [[God]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On the local planetary level, it is believed that the seven rays are transmitted from the Solar Logos through the God of our planet, [[Sanat Kumara]], then through the spiritual hierarchy of our planet which includes the "Masters of Wisdom" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;(Some writings term them the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] or the [[Great White Brotherhood]]).

Each of the seven rays is believed to be associated with a different kind of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult energy]], and a different [[color]].

===Qualities of the seven rays===
The ''seven rays'' are listed below:

[[Alice A. Bailey]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] assign different colors and in some cases different Masters to each of the seven rays. In ''Letters on Occult Meditation'', Alice Bailey indicates that there is no simple correspondence between the rays and these colors. The colors, Masters, and Retreats indicated here are those indicated by both Alice Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant.

According to Alice A. Bailey the Masters live in immortal bodies at a ''residence'' on the [[physical plane]] at the indicated location (although a given Master may physically travel extensively incognito to various locations, become [[Invisibility|invisible]], [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] to various locations, and walk through walls, as well as influence humans [[telepathy|telepathically]] and travel on the [[Plane (metaphysics)|inner planes]], as required by the demands of his spiritual work).

According to the Church Universal and Triumphant, and other ''[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]]'', each Master is believed to serve at a ''Retreat'' on the physical or [[etheric plane]] at the geographical location shown after their name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Prophet, Elizabeth Clare (Compiled and edited by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press "The Retreats of the Ascended Masters" Pages 395-492&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Gifts of the Holy Spirit" of the Church Universal and Triumphant for each ray are shown. For both Alice A. Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant, each ray has a [[Gemstone|jewel]] which is believed to focus the energy of that ray, which is indicated.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, as the [[New Age]] movement gained in popularity, the concept and imagery of the seven rays appeared in a variety of settings.

In [[esoteric astrology]], the seven rays are considered to be split into three groups: the first two rays represent Will and Wisdom, respectively, and the remaining five rays together form the group that represents Activity.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt; In a style of Reiki adapted by Carolyn E. Jackson the student passes through a sequence of levels by mastering the "key" to each level. The key for the second level is known as the key of "oneness" and is attained by passing through each of the seven rays.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; This, however, is not part of traditional [[Reiki]] or other versions of the Reiki system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascensionreiki.com/Usui%20Reiki%20Manual.pdf The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reiki Sourcebook |author=Bronwen &amp; Frans Steine|publisher=O Books |year= 2003|isbn= 1-903816-55-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[psychic]] counselor Samantha Stevens, an individual can use [[affirmative prayer|affirmations]], candles, [[Chromotherapy|color therapy]], vibrational medicines and other methods to contact "archangels," which she defines as the "seven rays," based on Buddhist and Christian theories: "The Rays or Divine Flames (as they are sometimes called) represent elements in the perfectly integrated human being - one whose heart is aligned with their will and inspired by the Divine Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Rays: A Universal Guide to the Archangels |author=Samantha Stevens |publisher=Insomniac Press |year= 2003|isbn= 1-894663-49-7 |page=22 et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light therapy|Light therapist]] and [[Radionics]] Practitioner Primrose Cooper writes that in using light as a healing modality, she finds it helpful to use the seven rays as defined in Theosophy to assist her clients in finding "psychological insight into their soul's purpose."&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

In recent years, there was the creation of a secretive group named "The Keepers of the Seven Rays". Their philosophy is the human being has seven emanations in which it finds itself, or connects with the Higher Self. These emanations are extensions of the Higher Self or otherwise called the Higher Will. These emanations reach out like arms and grasp onto the knowledge(of all types) needed for the full development of the individual into his/her Higher Potential. All a human has to do to use these emanations is to know basic moral law, what their body and/or psyche can and cannot handle, and listen.

Metaphysical philosopher Gurdjieff writes frequently of his "Seven Rays of Creation".   According to Gurdjieff, the Seven Rays of Creation are the seven manifestations of Energy in our Universe. The first Ray contains all things (THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE) and all things obey the laws inherent in the First Ray. The First Ray then manifests itself in the 2nd Realm, the realm of Galaxies. From Galaxies to Solar Systems, Solar Systems to Planets. From Planets to Organisms on the planets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/ Gurdjieff Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
;Music
* The [[progressive rock]] band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] performed a song entitled "The Seven Rays." The lyrics of the song center around the philosophies associated with the seven rays concepts popular with the new age movement, with much focus on the colors associated with each ray.
* Another progressive rock band, [[Hawkwind]], have a song about the seven rays titled ''Seven by Seven''.
* [[Mike Pinder]] of [[The Moody Blues]] refers heavily to the "seven rays" and the "Light of Seven" in his solo album "The Promise".
* The pop band [[Erasure]] refers to the Violet Flame through the title of their 2014 album, ''[[The Violet Flame]]''.

;Literature

* [[S.M. Stirling]]'s fictionalized and changed [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] believes that the "Light of the Seven Rays" has become stronger since The Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=S.M.

==Activism and philanthropy==
In addition to her work as a legal scholar and academic endeavors in research, publication, and social activism, Álvarez assists people with immigration-related issues, including visa requirements, judicial and legal translations, and procedures for obtaining different types of visas for legal residence.  Conjointly, Álvarez endeavors as a columnist at [[Univision]] and [[Huffington Post]] where she portrays her research on the ethnic realities of Latinos and the U.S. legal system, and illustrates the importance of key issues, such as representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/temas/sofia-espinoza-alvarez|title=Sofía Espinoza Álvarez: Últimas noticias, videos y fotos de Sofía Espinoza Álvarez - Univision|website=Univision.com|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/sof%C3%ADa-espinoza-%C3%A1lvarez|title=Sofía Espinoza Álvarez|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vested in positive social transformation, since 2013, Álvarez has been working with migrants traveling to the U.S. through Mexico, seeing first-hand the global dynamics of immigration, and thus prompting her to start a non-profit organization, the Empower Global Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofiaalva.com/actividadessociales/|title=Actividades Sociales/Fundaciónes|date=14 April 2016|website=Sofiaalva.com|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fundacionjaff.mx/en/about-us/contact/ |title=Fundación Jaff &amp;#124; Contact |website=Fundacionjaff.mx |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political participation==
Álvarez has been a part of pro-society and pro-migrant associations, such as Operation Monarca. She was an organizer of the human wall that took place along the US-Mexico border in February 2017 in solidarity with the migrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/02/17/1147014&lt;/ref&gt;

Being involved in social movements and not being a militant of any political party, she was invited by the movement pro-independent candidates in Mexico, to work as state coordinator of the Movimiento Ola 365, for local and federal Mexican elections of 2018. Ola 365's central objective is to position 365 independent candidates, in an attempt to "refresh" the Mexican political system. &lt;ref&gt;http://despertarmexico.com/ola365-la-resistencia-antisistema/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2190">'''Syledis''' ('''SY'''stem '''LE'''ger pour mesure la '''DIS'''tance) was a terrestrial [[radio navigation]] and locating system. The system operated in the [[UHF]] segment of 420-450 MHz. It was manufactured in France by Sercel S.A. and was operational during the 1980s and until about 1995, providing positioning and navigational support for the petroleum sector in the [[North Sea]] and to other scientific projects. Syledis has been replaced by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]].

==Functioning==
Determination of the position of mobile vehicles, like f.e. [[Watercraft|vessels]], using Syledis is accomplished by measurement of [[Ergodic theory|transit time]] of [[radio waves]] between mobiles and [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]] at known points. There are two modes of operation, ''active range mode'' and ''passive pseudo-range mode''.

===Further explanation of the functioning of the Syledis positioning system===
A vessel is equipped with a transmitter that transmits a coded signal to at least three [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] each placed at a known point. The beacons send the code back to the transmitter. The returned coded signal is placed in a [[timeslot]] to determine the origin of the returned code. Therefore in an earlier stage a specified timeslot is connected to a specific beacon.

The elapsed time is proportional to twice the distance between the transmitter and the beacons. After the distance to the beacons is derived the position of the vessel can be calculated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7696">'''TopoFlight''' is a three-dimensional [[flight planning]] software for [[photogrammetric]] flights.

Originally conceived by a team of experts in the mapping industry, it has been in use since 2003.  The program is used to facilitate the planning of flight lines with the help of a [[Digital terrain model|Digital Terrain Model]] (DTM), to document the flight plan and transfer it into the flight management system of the camera (for instance SoftNav, TrackAir, ASCOT or CCNS4), to calculate the costs of [[photogrammetric]] flight and subsequent photogrammetric products with the aid of [[Microsoft Excel]] as well as flight parameters, and to complete the post checking of a flight (flying height, length overlap, and side lap).  Coordinates that have been calculated can be exported to be used during flight. TopoFlight is able to work with frame, line, and [[LIDAR]] sensors.

{{as of|2017 }} the software is at version 10.5.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=December 13, 2016 &amp;#124; Today we released Version 10.5.3|url=https://www.topoflight.com/news/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History from 2003–2015==

*Released in April 2015

The TopoFlight Mission Planner has been upgraded to version 9.5. TopoFlight does use the edge of the image to calculate side overlap and length overlap. It actually calculates over the whole covered area by photos.
It is easier now to plan the flights with cameras, sensors and LiDAR systems.
Maps can be directly downloaded from Google into TopoFlight with user selectable resolution.

Due to a change in Google’s API, the Google Maps Tool in the TopoFlight Program had to be adapted. Improvements, like enhanced calculation of side lap, importing from TIFF DTM, importing of XYZOPK files for quality control and many other features have been completed. Large flight plans in fairly flat areas can be computed much faster now by switching OFF the ‘Precise Calculation' option.

'''Version 7'''

*Released in May 2009
*In 2008 at the International Congress on [[Geomatic]] and Surveying Engineering in Valencia, Spain, Professor Jorge Delgado (specializing in [[cartographic]] engineering, geodesy and photogrammetry) from the University of Jaen in Spain as well as Klaus Budmiger (of Flotron AG) et al. presented an oral presentation concerning the TopoFlight flight planning system (''see contribution 22 at the International Congress on Geomatic and [[Surveying]] Engineering'')

'''Version 6'''

* Version 6 moved from a [[32-bit|32 bit]] to a [[64-bit|64 bit]] system.  Version 6 Beta was released for testing in January 2008.  It was available to existing users for testing in February.  By April of that year, it was still not fully operational.  There were issues with the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] with respect to measurements in feet that had to be corrected.  Eventually v.6 would allow for constant latitude calculations as well as: [[Google Earth]] export, more data formats, new projection management, faster calculation of overlap between strips, use of .prj files, LIDAR [[flight planning]], automatic checking over the internet if a new version is available, and downloading it, licensing with [[USB]] hardlocks (Aladdin), and coordinate grid display.  By May 2008 the full version was operational and being distributed.

'''Version 5'''
* 2007 saw the advent of Version 5 of TopoFlight.  It allowed for projections to be made using the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM).  DTM importing functions began to be addressed with this version as it was not possible to import DEM data without reprojecting it as DTM first. Version 5 could only plan in projected coordinates but could output the flight lines and image centers to lat/long.  Input required a text file with projected coordinates (like UTM).  These issues were going to be changed for v.6.
* Another issue that was encountered in v. 5 that needed to be addressed was the impossibility to perform flight planning by filling a "horseshoe shaped" area of interest.  The break line tool had to be used line per line to modify the new lines to the desired area of interest manually. After this, an enumeration could be performed.

'''Version 4'''
* Version 4 was the first version available for sale to the public.

'''Version  1'''
* In 2003 the first version of TopoFlight was created mainly for internal use by specialized, technical professionals.

==File formats==
TopoFlight works with multiple layers.  The generated flight plans are stored in the widely used "shape format" (ESRI/ARC VIEW).

Additional maps can be attached as reference files.  These maps include:

*[[Topographic]] maps
*Project area
*Existing control points
*Flight navigation maps

The reference files can be in the following formats:

*SHAPE from [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]
*DXF from [[AutoCAD]]
*DGN from Mirostation
*TIFF with tfw- header for all raster files

==Features==
'''Best fit flying height''' – Calculation of the best flying height to achieve the desired image scale as well as minimum and maximum image scales for given flying height.

'''Coordinate transformations''' – Transformation of the coordinates from the local grid to another system (such as [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]).

'''Calculation of image centers''' – calculation of coordinates of each image with image scales and overlap.

'''Calculation of the effective covered area by the images of each strip'''

'''Area of side lap''' – Calculation of the side lap between two neighboring flight lines.

'''Calculation of costs''' – Calculation of costs of flight and photogrammetric products which can be transferred into Excel.  Custom forms can be later defined.

'''List of coordinates''' – Transfer of the flight parameters to Excel.  Custom forms can later be defined.

'''Ground control points''' – The coordinates of existing [[Air traffic control|ground control]] points can be imported and annotated.  They can also be placed with a mouse click to show the surveyor where to paint and measure a new ground control point.

'''Exporting the flight plan''' – The plot can be exported either through SHAPE files, DXF format,  or in TIFF format with a TFW header file.

'''Transfer to flight management system''' – coordinates can be exported to ASCOT, CCNS, or TrackAir.

'''Check overlap for aerial triangulation''' – Check if the minimal overlap is achieved over the whole strip area.

'''Create image indexes''' – The coordinates of image centers, stored in a text file can be read by TopoFlight.

==Users==
TopoFlight is currently in use in 19 countries including the United States, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Austria, Italy and others.

'''Tucson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|s|ɒ|n|,_|t|uː|ˈ|s|ɒ|n}}) is a city and the county seat of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], [[Arizona]], United States,&lt;ref name="GR6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home to the [[University of Arizona]]. The [[2010 United States Census]] put the population at 520,116,&lt;ref name="FactFinder"/&gt; while the 2015 estimated population of the entire Tucson [[United States metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) was 980,263.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qedfinancialsystems.com/tucson-a-fast-growing-az-city/|title=Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas|last=|first=|date=|website=Qedfinancialsystems.com|accessdate=Feb 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Tucson MSA''' forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales [[List of Combined Statistical Areas|combined statistical area]] (CSA), with a total population of 1,010,025 as of the 2010 Census. Tucson is the second-largest populated city in Arizona behind [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], both of which anchor the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]]. The city is located {{convert|108|mi}} southeast of Phoenix and {{convert|60|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[U.S.–Mexico border]].&lt;ref name="GR6" /&gt; Tucson is the [[List of United States cities by population|33rd largest]] city and the [[List of metropolitan areas of the United States|58th largest]] metropolitan area in the United States (2014).

Major incorporated suburbs of Tucson include [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]] and [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]] northwest of the city, [[Sahuarita, Arizona|Sahuarita]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-sahuarita-s-name-may-be-misspelling/article_08a0bf43-860f-5be1-bc24-a718f6fdcdb2.html David Leighton,"Street Smarts: Sahuarita's name may be misspelling", ''Arizona Daily Star'', February 8, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; south of the city, and [[South Tucson, Arizona|South Tucson]] in an enclave south of downtown. Communities in the vicinity of Tucson (some within or overlapping the city limits) include [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]], [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]], [[Midvale Park]], [[Tanque Verde, Arizona|Tanque Verde]], [[Tortolita, Arizona|Tortolita]], and [[Vail, Arizona|Vail]]. Towns outside the Tucson metro area include [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]] to the southeast, [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]] and [[Oracle, Arizona|Oracle]] to the north, and [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]] to the south.

The Spanish name of the city, ''Tucsón'' {{IPA-es|tukˈson|}}, is derived from the [[O'odham language|O'odham]] ''Cuk Ṣon'' {{IPA-azc|tʃʊk ʂɔːn|}}, meaning "(at the) base of the black [hill]", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]], also known as "A" Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/tucson-oddity-what-s-with-crater-on-edge-of-a/article_d306b1d1-1519-510d-b926-4b3eb3e703e3.html|title=Tucson Oddity: What's with crater on edge of 'A' Mountain?|author=Tom Beal |newspaper=The Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucson is sometimes referred to as "The Old Pueblo".

Tucson was probably first visited by [[Paleo-Indians]], known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] have located a village site dating from 2100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=J. Homer|last2=Diehl|first2=Michael W.|title=Cultural History of the Tucson Basin and the Project Area|url=https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/pdf/rn/rio_nuevo_ch03.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the [[Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest|Early Agricultural Period]], circa 1200 BC to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting. The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the [[Hohokam]] lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hohokam|url=http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/plan-a-visit/mesa-grande/the-hohokam|website=Arizona Museum of Natural History|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mabry|first1=Jonathan B.|last2=Thiel|first2=J.

[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692, and founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700 about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|"A" mountain]]. [[Hugo Oconór|Hugo O'Conor]], the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón]]'', on August 20, 1775 (near the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]]).  During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by [[Apache]]s. Eventually the town came to be called "Tucson" and became a part of the state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Tucson was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]] during the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846-1848,  but soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke continued his mission westward establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California.  Tucson was not included originally in the [[Mexican Cession]] and Cooke's road through Tucson became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Arizona, south of the [[Gila River]], was obtained via treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854.  Tucson became a part of the United States of America, although the American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In 1857, Tucson became a stage station on the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]] and in 1858 became 3rd division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] until the line shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running, however, following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

From August 1861 to mid-1862, Tucson was the western capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Arizona Territory]], the eastern capital being [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]]. In 1862, the [[California Column]] drove the Confederate forces out of Arizona. Tucson and all of what is now Arizona were part of [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1863, when they became part of the new [[Arizona Territory]]. From 1867 to 1877, Tucson was the capital of the Arizona Territory. Tucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of [[stagecoach]] robberies.

By 1900, 7,531 people lived in the city. The population increased gradually to 13,913 in 1910.  At about this time, the U.S. [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] had begun construction on the present Veterans Hospital. Many veterans who had been [[chemical weapons|gassed]] in World War I, and were in need of [[respiratory therapy]], began coming to Tucson after the war, because of the clean dry air.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Over the following years, the city continued to grow, with the population increasing to 20,292 in 1920 and 36,818 in 1940.

During the territorial and early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial center, while Phoenix was the seat of state government (beginning in 1889) and agriculture. The establishment of Tucson Municipal Airport increased its prominence. Between 1910 and 1920, Phoenix surpassed Tucson in population, and has continued to outpace Tucson in growth. In recent years, both Tucson and Phoenix have experienced some of the highest growth rates in the United States.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], as of 2010, the City of Tucson has a land area of {{convert|226.71|sqmi}}.

The city's elevation is {{convert|2643|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level (as measured at the Tucson International Airport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/TUS |title=KTUS Tucson International Airport Tucson, Arizona, USA |publisher=Airnav.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucson is situated on an [[alluvial plain]] in the [[Sonoran desert]], surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains: the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] and the [[Tortolita Mountains]] to the north, the [[Santa Rita Mountains]] to the south, the [[Rincon Mountains]] to the east, and the [[Tucson Mountains]] to the west. The high point of the Santa Catalina Mountains is {{convert|9157|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Mount Lemmon]], the southernmost ski destination in the continental U.S., while the Tucson Mountains include {{convert|4687|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} Wasson Peak. The highest point in the area is [[Mount Wrightson]], found in the Santa Rita Mountains at {{convert|9453|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.

[[File:Carnegiea gigantea-3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|During wintertime, snow may fall in Tucson on rare occasions.]]

Tucson is located {{convert|118|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Phoenix and {{convert|60|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[United States - Mexico border]]. The 2010 United States Census puts the city's population at 520,116 with a metropolitan area population at 980,263. In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States. A major city in the Arizona Sun Corridor, Tucson is the largest city in southern Arizona, the second largest in the state after Phoenix. It is also the largest city in the area of the Gadsden Purchase.  As of 2015, The Greater Tucson Metro area has exceeded a population of 1 million.

The city is located on the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]], formerly a perennial river, but now a dry river bed for much of the year that floods during significant seasonal rains.

[[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]] runs northwest through town, connecting Tucson to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in the northwest (on the way to its western terminus in [[Santa Monica, California]]) and to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] and [[El Paso, Texas]] in the southeast (towards its eastern terminus in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]). [[Interstate 19 (Arizona)|I-19]] runs south from Tucson toward [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] and the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses "kilometer posts" instead of "[[milepost]]s", although the speed limits are marked in miles per hour and kilometers per hour.

===Neighborhoods===

====Downtown and Central Tucson====
[[File:Tuscon 19thCentury Adobe.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century adobe house in the Armory Park neighborhood]]

Similar to many other cities in the [[Western U.S.]], Tucson was developed on a [[grid plan]] starting in the late 19th century, with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. While this intersection was initially near the [[Centroid|geographic center]] of Tucson, that center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east, development to the west being effectively blocked by the Tucson Mountains. An expansive city covering substantial area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods.

Tucson's earliest neighborhoods, some of which are now covered by the [[Tucson Convention Center]], or TCC, include:
* El Presidio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tucsonpresidiotrust.org/PDF/Presidio_map.pdf Tucsonpresidiotruste.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110515/http://www.tucsonpresidiotrust.org/PDF/Presidio_map.pdf |date=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucson's oldest neighborhood

* Barrio El Jardín, named for an early recreational site, Levin's Gardens
* Barrio El Hoyo, named for a lake that was part of the gardens. Before the TCC was built, El Hoyo (Spanish for pit or hole) referred to this part of the city, which was inhabited mainly by Mexican-American citizens and Mexican immigrants.
* [[Barrio Santa Rosa (Tucson, Arizona)|Barrio Santa Rosa]], dating from the 1890s, now listed as a historic district on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]

As one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center. The shopping center was designed by local architect [[Josias Joesler]] and sits at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road. The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown, the university, and the Lost Barrio just East of downtown, also have many unique and popular stores. Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus. The [[El Con Mall]] is also located in the eastern part of midtown.

Tucson's largest park, [[Reid Park]], is located in midtown and includes [[Reid Park Zoo]] and [[Hi Corbett Field]]. Speedway Boulevard, a major east-west arterial road in central Tucson, was named the "ugliest street in America" by [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] in the early 1970s, quoting Tucson Mayor [[Jim Corbett (politician)|James Corbett]]. Despite this, Speedway Boulevard was awarded "Street of the Year" by ''[[Arizona Highways]]'' in the late 1990s. According to David Leighton, historical writer for the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, Speedway Boulevard derives its name from an old horse racetrack, known as [[Harlem River Drive#History|"The Harlem River Speedway,"]] more commonly called "The Speedway," in New York City. The street was called "The Speedway," from 1904 to about 1906 before the word "The" was taken out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-speedway-s-sports-racing-roots/article_f7b451ec-214a-5017-818c-ef3c6dae3dd5.html|title=Street Smarts: Speedway's sports racing roots|author=David Leighton|newspaper=The Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Tucson]] is actually the name of an independent, incorporated town of {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, completely surrounded by the city of Tucson, located just south of downtown. South Tucson has a colorful, dynamic history. It was first incorporated in 1936, and later reincorporated in 1940. The population consists of about 83% Mexican-American and 10% Native American residents. South Tucson is widely known for its many Mexican restaurants and the architectural styles which include bright outdoor murals, many of which have been painted over due to city policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091104015232/http://www.arizonaguide.com/places-to-visit/tucson-southern-arizona/south-tucson Arizonaguide.com], Retrieved December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.groundspeak.com/waymarking/display/e3756840-2734-4364-aade-05974e8c5729.JPG IMG.groundspeak.com], Retrieved December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/sotucson CMS3.tucsonaz.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206051411/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/sotucson |date=December 6, 2010 }}, Retrieved December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of [[urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] development, the West Side is generally defined as the area west of [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]]. Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and the foothills of the [[Tucson Mountains]], and includes the International Wildlife Museum, [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]], and the [[JW Marriott Hotels|Marriott Starr Pass Resort &amp; Spa]], located in the wealthy enclave known as Starr Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-starr-pass-blvd-has-telegraph-line-link/article_ed43b3c5-5d48-55ae-a7c8-483c8747778f.html|title=Street Smarts: Starr Pass Blvd. has telegraph-line link|author=David Leighton|newspaper=The Arizona Daily Star|access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving past the Tucson Mountains, travelers find themselves in the area commonly referred to as "west of" Tucson or "Old West Tucson".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldwesttucson.com Old West Tucson].

On Sentinel Peak (also known as "'A' Mountain"), just west of downtown, there is a giant "A" in honor of the [[University of Arizona]]. Starting in about 1916, a yearly tradition developed for freshmen to whitewash the "A", which was visible for miles. However, at the beginning of the [[Iraq War]], [http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/squirmin-on-the-mount/Content?oid=1072015 anti-war activists] painted it black. This was followed by a paint scuffle where the "A" was painted various colors until the city council intervened. It is now red, white and blue except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election. Because of the three-color paint scheme often used, the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable from the rest of the peak. The top of Sentinel Peak, which is accessible by road, offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward. A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night.

====Northern Tucson====
North Tucson includes the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]]. Usually considered the area north of Fort Lowell Road, North Tucson includes some of Tucson's primary commercial zones ([[Tucson Mall]] and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many of the city's most upscale [[boutiques]], restaurants, and art galleries are also located on the north side, including St. Philip's Plaza. The Plaza is directly adjacent to the historic St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church (built in 1936).

Also on the north side is the suburban community of [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], located in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of the city limits. This community includes among the area's most expensive homes, sometimes multimillion-dollar estates.

Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), and Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley) are all masterplanned communities located in the Northwest, where thousands of residents live.

The community of [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]] is also on the Northwest Side, with the distinction of being Tucson's first suburb, established in the late 1940s. Casas Adobes is centered on the historic [[Casas Adobes Plaza]] (built in 1948). Casas Adobes is also home to [[Tohono Chul Park]], which is now within the town of Oro Valley, (a nature preserve) near the intersection of North Oracle Road and West Ina Road.  The [[2011 Tucson shooting|attempted assassination]] of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Gabrielle Giffords]], and the murders of chief judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|U.S. District Court for Arizona]], [[John Roll]] and five other people on January 8, 2011, occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes.  The [[Foothills Mall (Arizona)|Foothills Mall]] is also located on the northwest side in Casas Adobes.

Many of the Tucson area's golf courses and resorts are located in this area, including the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton El Conquistador Golf &amp; Tennis Resort]] in Oro Valley, the [[Omni Hotels|Omni Tucson National Resort &amp; Spa]], and Westward Look Resort. The [[Ritz Carlton|Ritz Carlton at Dove Mountain]], the second Ritz Carlton Resort in Arizona, which also includes a golf course, opened in the foothills of the [[Tortolita Mountains]] in northeast Marana in 2009. [[Catalina State Park]] and [[Tortolita Mountains|Tortolita Mountain Park]] are also located in the Northwest area.

Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In [http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm 1891], the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In [http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm 1900], three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to [http://oldfortlowellneighborhood.org/chronology.htm Harvey Adkins] in 1928.

==Climate==
Tucson has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), with two major seasons, a very hot summer and mild winter. Tucson averages {{convert|11.8|in|mm|1}} of precipitation per year, concentrated mostly in the summer monsoon season.

Summer is characterized by daytime temperatures that exceed {{convert|100|°F|0}} and overnight temperatures between {{convert|66|and|85|°F|°C|0}}. Early summer is characterized by low humidity and clear skies; mid-summer and late summer are characterized by higher humidity, cloudy skies and frequent rain. Like most desert climates, the sun is intense in Tucson during part of the year, and significant protection is needed for those who spend time outdoors. Recent studies show the rate of skin cancer in Arizona is at least three times higher than in more northerly regions. Additional intense heating is a risk to hikers and others who seek to hike canyons and exposed areas. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11568742 | doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.114742 | volume=45 | issue=4 | title=Trends in the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers in southeastern Arizona, 1985-1996 | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | pages=528–36 | last1 = Harris | first1 = RB | last2 = Griffith | first2 = K | last3 = Moon | first3 = TE| year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause [[flash floods]]. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes.

Tucson typically averages one hard freeze per winter season, with temperatures dipping to the mid or low-20s (−7 to −4&amp;nbsp;°C), but this is typically limited to only a very few nights. Although rare, snow has been known to fall in Tucson, usually a light dusting that melts within a day. The most recent snowfall was on February 20, 2013 when 2.0 inches of snow blanketed the city, the [https://weatherspark.com/history/30063/1987/Tucson-Arizona-United-States largest snowfall] since 1987.

Its presence, as well as the presence of the US Army Intelligence Center ([[Fort Huachuca]], the largest employer in the region in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of a significant number of high-tech industries, including government contractors, in the area. The city of Tucson is also a major hub for the Union Pacific Railroad's Sunset Route that links the Los Angeles ports with the South/Southeast regions of the country.

One of the major annual attractions is the [[Tucson Gem and Mineral Show]], and its associated shows, all held generally in the first two weeks of February.  These associated shows (such as gems, jewelry, beads, fossils) are held throughout the city, with 43 different shows in 2010.  This makes Tucson's the largest such exposition in the world.

In addition to vacationers, a significant number of winter residents, or "[[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]", are attracted by Tucson's mild winters and contribute to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase [[Vacation property|second homes]] in Tucson and nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base.

There are also a number of middle-class and upper-class [[Sonora]]ns and [[Sinaloa]]ns who travel from Mexico to Tucson to purchase goods that are not readily available in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

There are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and late March/early April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering place for [[hippies]], and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores to attract customers before the holidays.

These days, the street fair has grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others.

===Nicknames===
Tucson is commonly known as "The Old Pueblo".  While the exact origin of this nickname is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to Mayor [[Robert N. Leatherwood|R. N. "Bob" Leatherwood]].  When [[railroad|rail service]] was established to the city on March 20, 1880, Leatherwood celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Pope]], announcing that the "ancient and honorable pueblo" of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside world.  The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated it as "A. and H. Pueblo".  This in turn transformed into the current form of "The Old Pueblo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/history-and-culture/life-in-the-old-pueblo-here-s-how-tucson-came/article_8bf4391f-1499-5e71-bdd8-178e3c52b96d.html|title=Life in the Old Pueblo: Here's how Tucson came to own its charming nickname|author=Jim Turner|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tucson Saguaros]] of the independent [[Pecos League]] started play in 2016 and play at [[Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium]].  They won the league in their inaugural season.  The [[Tucson Padres]] played at [[Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium]] from 2011 to 2013. They served as the AAA affiliate of the [[San Diego Padres]]. The team, formerly known as the Portland Beavers, was temporarily relocated to Tucson from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] while awaiting the building of a new stadium in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Finley, Patrick |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/tucson-padres-new-california-stadium-deal-looks-unlikely/article_8ee8ffec-3254-11e1-85ad-001871e3ce6c.html |title=Tucson Padres owner to look at selling team |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=2011-12-29 |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Trotto, Sarah|url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/baseball/professional/mlb/tucson-padres-notebook-moorad-kino-may-be-a-long-term/article_dcf103af-640e-558f-b448-550b3ebe84fb.html#ixzz1kCCYAMFN |title=TUCSON PADRES NOTEBOOK: Moorad: Kino may be a long-term option|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal issues derailed the plans to build the Escondido stadium, so they moved to [[El Paso, Texas]] for the 2014 season. Previously, the [[Tucson Sidewinders]], a triple-A affiliate of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], won the [[Pacific Coast League]] championship and unofficial AAA championship in 2006. The Sidewinders played in [[Tucson Electric Park]] and were in the Pacific Conference South of the PCL. The Sidewinders were sold in 2007 and moved to [[Reno, Nevada]] after the 2008 season. They now compete as the Reno Aces.

The [[Springfield Falcons]] of the [[American Hockey League]] relocated to Tucson following the 2015-2016 season to become the [[Tucson Roadrunners]]. They play in the AHL's Pacific division, and are affiliated with the [[Arizona Coyotes]].

===Parks and recreation===
The city has more than 120 parks, from small and local to larger parks with ballfields, natural areas, lakes, 5 public golf courses, and [[Reid Park Zoo]]. "The Loop" is a popular system of walking/running/bicycling/horseback trails encircling the city primarily along washes, and it is usually well separated from traffic.  Several scenic parks and points of interest are also located nearby, including the [[Tucson Botanical Gardens]], [[Tohono Chul Park]], [[Saguaro National Park]], [[Sabino Canyon]], and [[Biosphere 2]] (just north of the city, near the town of [[Oracle, Arizona|Oracle]]).
[[File:Shop in SummerhavenAZ.JPG|thumb|right|The general store in [[Summerhaven]]]]
[[Mt. Lemmon]] is {{convert|25|mi|km}} north (by road) and over {{convert|6700|ft|m}} above Tucson in the Santa Catalina Mountains in the [[Coronado National Forest]]. Outdoor activities in the Catalinas include hiking, mountain biking, birding, rock climbing, picnicking, camping, swimming in mountain stream pools, sky rides at Ski Valley, fishing and photography. In winter with enough snow the sky ride converts back to skiing at the southernmost ski resort in the continental United States. [[Summerhaven, Arizona|Summerhaven]], a community near the top of Mt. Lemmon, is also a popular destination.

The [[League of American Bicyclists]] gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007. Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States. The ride called "[[El Tour de Tucson]]" happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. [[El Tour de Tucson]] produced and promoted by [[Perimeter Bicycling]] has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world, annually. Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the [[League of American Bicyclists]]. The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities, with teams and riders from around the world spending a portion of the year training in Tucson's year-round biking climate. Popular mountain biking areas include Tucson Mountain Park, Sweetwater Preserve, the Tortolita Mountain trail systems, and Fantasy Island. Road cyclists take on Catalina Highway's steep climb year-round.

In general, Tucson and Pima County support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], as opposed the state's largest metropolitan area, Phoenix, which usually supports the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Congressional redistricting in 2013, following the publication of the 2010 Census, divided the Tucson area into three Federal Congressional districts (the first, second and third of Arizona). The city center is in the 3rd District, represented by [[Raul Grijalva]], a Democrat, since 2003, while the more affluent residential areas to the south and east are in the 2nd District, represented by Republican [[Martha McSally]] since 2015, and the exurbs north and west between Tucson and Phoenix in the 1st District are represented by Democrat [[Tom O'Halleran]] since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feds give OK to new Ariz. congressional maps|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/feds-give-ok-to-new-ariz-congressional-maps/article_47106c7c-84df-11e1-8c06-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=2013-02-02|newspaper=Inside Tucson Business|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Postal Service]] operates post offices in Tucson. The Tucson Main Post Office is located at 1501 South Cherrybell [[Stravenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/tucson-1501-s-cherrybell-stra-rm-205-tucson-az-1439539|title=TUCSON Post Office™ Location|date=March 9, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=July 7, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309221357/http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/tucson-1501-s-cherrybell-stra-rm-205-tucson-az-1439539|archivedate=March 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City government===
{{see also|List of mayors of Tucson, Arizona}}
Tucson follows the "weak mayor" model of the [[council–manager government|council-manager]] form of local government. The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).

Tucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64¢ per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.

Mayor [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E. Walkup]] (R), who took office in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|title=Mayor Bob Walkup - City of Tucson Web|date=February 13, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=July 7, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101425/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|archivedate=February 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walkup was preceded by [[George Miller (Arizona politician)|George Miller]] (D), 1991–1999; [[Tom Volgy]] (D), 1987–1991; [[Lew Murphy]] (R), 1971–1987; and [[Jim Corbett (politician)|Jim Corbett]] (D), 1967–1971.

===Primary and secondary schools===
{{Main|List of primary and secondary schools in Tucson, AZ}}
Primarily, students of the Tucson area attend public schools in the [[Tucson Unified School District]] (TUSD). TUSD has the second highest enrollment of any school district in Arizona, behind [[Mesa Unified School District]] in the Phoenix metropolitan area. There are also many publicly funded [[charter school]]s with a specialized curriculum.&lt;ref name='schoolsurvey'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/special/schoolsurvey2009|title=www.azstarnet.com ®|date=August 22, 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=July 7, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822160136/http://azstarnet.com/special/schoolsurvey2009|archivedate=August 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===
Tucson's primary electrical power source is a coal and natural gas power-plant managed by Tucson Electric Power that is situated within the city limits on the south-western boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force base adjacent to Interstate-10. The air pollution generated has raised some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 and is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanderpool|first=Tim|title=Polluting the Poor:TEP's southside coal plant keeps on pumping out noxious gases|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/polluting-the-poor/Content?oid=3596947|publisher=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Solar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of sunshine climate. Federal, state, and even local utility credits and incentives have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems. 
Davis-Monthan AFB has a 3.3 [[Megawatt]] (MW) ground-mounted [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) array and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array, both of which are located in the Base Housing area. The base will soon have the largest solar-generating capacity in the [[United States Department of Defense]] after awarding a contract on September 10, 2010, to [[SunEdison]] to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on the northwestern side of the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=050910 |url=http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |title=D-M awards solar photovoltaic utility contract to SunEdison |publisher=Dm.af.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929230631/http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global Solar Energy]], which is located at the University of Arizona's science and technology park, is one of the planet's largest [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS]] solar fields at 750 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020145116/http://globalsolar.com/en/press/press-releases/77-global-solar-energy-opens-landmark-manufacturing-plant-sets-full-scale-production-capacity-records.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uatechpark.org/|title=Tech Parks Arizona-research park and business incubator|website=Uatechpark.org|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainability====
[[File:Snowy Catalinas.jpg|thumb|right|Snow in nearby Santa Catalina Mountains]]
Perhaps the biggest sustainability problem in Tucson, with its high desert climate, is potable water supply. The state manages all water in Arizona through its Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The primary consumer of water is Agriculture (including golf courses), which consumes about 69% of all water. Municipal (which includes residential use) accounts for about 25% of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona's Water: Uses and Sources|url=http://arizonaexperience.org/people/arizonas-water-uses-and-sources|publisher=Arizona Experience|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability issue. However, with over 300 days of full sun a year, Tucson has demonstrated its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer.

====Light pollution====
Tucson and Pima County adopted [[Dark-sky movement|Dark Sky]] ordinances to control [[light pollution]] in support of the region's astronomical [[observatory|observatories]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Light Pollution – Tucson/Pima County, AZ |website=The Public Good |date=January 12, 2009 |url=http://www.ilsr.org/rule/light-pollution/2466-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Last amended in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pima County approves changes to lighting ordinance |website=KVOA.com |date=March 13, 2012 |url=http://www.kvoa.com/news/pima-county-approves-changes-to-lighting-ordinance/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105113819/http://www.kvoa.com/news/pima-county-approves-changes-to-lighting-ordinance/ |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the City of Tucson/Pima County Outdoor Lighting Code establishes maximum illumination levels, shielding requirements, and limits on signage in "continuing support of astronomical activity and minimizing wasted energy, while not compromising the safety, security, and well-being of persons engaged in outdoor nighttime activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 City of Tucson/Pima County Outdoor Lighting Code |url=http://www.dsd.pima.gov/Building/Codes/OLC.pdf |publisher=Pima County Development Services |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172124/http://www.dsd.pima.gov/Building/Codes/OLC.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Less than 100 years ago, the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources.

In 1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|title=About Tucson Water|website=M.tucsonaz.gov|accessdate=December 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329083415/http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|archive-date=March 29, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucson currently draws water from two main sources: [[Central Arizona Project]] (CAP) water and [[groundwater]]. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water to some customers that was referred to as being unacceptable due to discoloration, bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused some customers' plumbing and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed with groundwater.

In an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060703194522/http://www.ci.tucson.az.us/water/heritage.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional study is scheduled to determine the amount of water that is lost through evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer. The City of Tucson already provides [[reclaimed water]] to its inhabitants, but it is only used for "applications such as irrigation, dust control, and industrial uses."&lt;ref name="Reclaimed Water"&gt;{{cite web | title = Reclaimed Water | publisher = City of Tucson | year = 2012 | url = http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | accessdate = March 22, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120505110418/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | archivedate = May 5, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources have been in place for more than 27 years, and deliver to over 900 locations.&lt;ref name="Reclaimed Water"/&gt;

To prevent further loss of groundwater, Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts, shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation, consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use, and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer, northwest of the city. An allocation from the [[Central Arizona Project Aqueduct]] (CAP), which passes more than {{convert|300|mi|-1|abbr=on}} across the desert from the [[Colorado River]], has been incorporated into the city's water supply, annually providing over 20 million gallons of "recharged" water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |title=Clearwater Frequently Asked Questions &amp;#124; The Official Website for the City of Tucson, Arizona |publisher=Cms3.tucsonaz.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105141442/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |archivedate=November 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/water/docs/coloradoriver.pdf |title=Tucson Water's Long Range Water Resource Planning |publisher=City of Tucson |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===

====Public transit====
Tucson's [[Sun Tran]] bus system serves greater Tucson with standard, express, regional shuttle, and on-demand shuttle bus service.  It was awarded [[American Public Transportation Association|Best Transit System]] in 1988 and 2005.&lt;ref name="TDOT-1Oct2009"&gt;{{cite press release |title = Federal Transit Administration Gives Approval to the Tucson Modern Streetcar Project |publisher = Tucson Department of Transportation |date = October 1, 2009 |url = http://dot.tucsonaz.gov/news/details.cfm?id=604 |accessdate = 2010-03-12 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213837/http://dot.tucsonaz.gov/news/details.cfm?id=604 |archivedate = May 27, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3.9-mile [[streetcar]] line, [[Sun Link]], connects the [[University of Arizona]] campus with 4th Avenue, downtown, and the Mercado District west of [[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]] and the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]]. Ten-minute [[headway]] passenger service began July 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.azpm.org/p/bus-econ-news/2014/7/25/40393-tucson-streetcar-debuts-to-crowds-hot-weather/ | title=Tucson Streetcar Debuts to Crowds, Hot Weather | newspaper=Arizona Public Media | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | date=2014-07-25 | accessdate=2014-10-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006111811/https://news.azpm.org/p/bus-econ-news/2014/7/25/40393-tucson-streetcar-debuts-to-crowds-hot-weather/ | archivedate=October 6, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The streetcar utilizes Sun Tran's card payment and transfer system, connecting with the University of Arizona's CatTran shuttles, [[Amtrak]], and [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] intercity bus service.

====Rail====
[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to [[Tucson station|Tucson]] three times weekly in both directions, operating its [[Sunset Limited]] between [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; and [[Texas Eagle]] service between Los Angeles and [[Chicago, Illinois]].

====Airport====
[[Tucson International Airport]] {{airport codes|TUS|KTUS}}, is located {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the city's center.  TIA is the second largest commercial [[airport]] in Arizona, providing nonstop flights to 15 destinations throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alaska Airlines to launch Tucson-Portland nonstop |last=Wichner |first=David |date=June 27, 2013 |url=http://azstarnet.com/business/local/alaska-airlines-to-launch-tucson-portland-nonstop/article_d73c4e5a-debc-11e2-9bb6-0019bb2963f4.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to passenger and freight service, TIA supports the [[162d Fighter Wing]]'s fleet of seventy [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] stationed at the [[Tucson Air National Guard Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.162fw.ang.af.mil/resources/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11853 |title=162nd Fighter Wing Fact Sheet |date=July 3, 2012 |publisher=162nd Fighter Wing Public Affairs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152813/http://www.162fw.ang.af.mil/resources/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11853 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 2 general aviation reliever airports in the area. The city of Tucson operates [[Ryan Airfield]] 13 miles southwest of the city center, and the town of Marana operates [[Marana Regional Airport]] 15 miles to the northwest. [[Pinal Airpark]] is also within the metropolitan area.

====Roadways====
There are two [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] in the metropolitan area. [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] runs southeast from Phoenix through Marana, passes west of downtown, and continues east toward El Paso. [[Interstate 19 (Arizona)|Interstate 19]] leaves the I-10 south of downtown and heads south to the Mexican border.  [[Arizona State Route 210]] is a shorter expressway that links downtown with [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] and Tucson's southeast side.  Tucson does not have a [[ring road|beltway]] system, and relies almost entirely on surface streets.

Freeways and state highways in Tucson include:
* [[File:I-10.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]]

====Cycling====
Cycling is popular in Tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate.  Tucson and Pima County maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes, signal crossings, on-street bike lanes, mountain-biking trails, and dedicated [[shared use path|shared-use paths]].  [[The Loop (Tucson)|The Loop]] is a network of seven linear parks comprising over {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} of paved, vehicle-free trails that encircles the majority of the city with links to Marana and Oro Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New segment of The Loop trail opens Saturday with a fiesta |newspaper=Arizoan Daily Star |date=April 28, 2015 |last=Kreutz |first=Douglas |url=http://tucson.com/news/local/new-segment-of-the-loop-trail-opens-saturday-with-a/article_9a16985c-3d80-5a8f-9a3a-b9bafaf3565f.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014_loop_report"&gt;{{cite web |title="The Loop 2014 Annual Report: The First 100 Miles" |publisher=Pima County |url=http://webcms.pima.gov/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6/File/Government/The%20Loop/Annual%20Reports/1386%20-%20Loop%20Annual%20Report_web-ready.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tucson-Pima County Bicycle Advisory Committee (TPCBAC) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation, transportation, and safety.  Tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by the [[League of American Bicyclists]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bikeleague.org/media/press/042406_press.php |title=League Names New Bicycle Friendly Communities |accessdate=2010-03-12 |date=2006-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315212042/http://www.bikeleague.org/media/press/042406_press.php |archivedate=March 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh. Táhirih and Bahíyyih, in particular, held strong leadership positions and are seen vital to the development of the religion.

Several women played leading roles in the early days of the Bahá'í Faith in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=93 |title=Women in the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=2 |title=Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/finch_unclipping_wings |title=Unclipping the Wings |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are: [[May Maxwell]], [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Corinne True], and [[Martha Root]].  [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and a mix of male and female [[Hands of the Cause]] formed an interim leadership of the religion for six years prior to the formation of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Later prominent women include [http://www.bahai.us/node/80 Patricia Locke], [http://www.creativefilms.com/Pos.html Jaqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt], [[Layli Miller-Muro]], and [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Dr. Susan Maneck], who herself wrote books documenting the role of women in the Bahá'í Faith.

== Jainism ==
The status of women in Jainism differs between the two main sects, [[Digambar]]a and [[Svetambara]]. Jainism prohibits women from appearing naked; because of this, Digambaras, who consider renunciation of clothes essential to [[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]], say that they cannot attain enlightenment in the same life.&lt;ref name="bbcethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics - Women in Jainism |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetambaras, who allow [[sadhu]]s to wear clothes, believe that women can attain moksha. There are more Svetambara sadhvis than sadhus and women have always been influential in the Jain religion.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-jain-faith/ |title=The Role of Women - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Östersund''' ({{IPA-sv|œstɛˈʂɵnːd|pron|Sv-Östersund.ogg}}; {{lang-sma|Staare}}) is an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] ([[Stad (Sweden)|city]]) in [[Jämtland]] in the middle of [[Sweden]]. It is the seat of [[Östersund Municipality]] and the capital of [[Jämtland County]]. Östersund is located at the shores of Sweden's fifth largest lake, [[Storsjön]], opposite the island [[Frösön]], and is the only city in Jämtland. Östersund is the region's cultural and economical centre and by tradition a city of trade and commerce. Östersund had one of the most extensive [[garrison]]s in Sweden prior to its closure in the early-21st century. The city is the [[Mid Sweden University]]'s largest campus site with approximately 7,000 students. With a total population of 44,327 (2010) Östersund is the [[List of cities in Sweden by population|22nd most populous city in Sweden]], the [[List of cities in Scandinavia by population|46th most populous city in Scandinavia]], and by far the largest inland city in [[Norrland|Northern Sweden]].

The city was the only Swedish city founded and chartered in the 18th century. Östersund was founded in order to create a trade monopoly over Jämtland whose inhabitants' lucrative trade annoyed the Swedish crown. The intention was to persuade the local farmers to deliver merchandise to middlemen in Östersund, but the population opposed this economic philosophy, and Östersund long remained small.&lt;ref name="found"&gt;Jacobsson, Hans (1992). "Östersunds tillkomst" (in Swedish) in Sten Rentzhog: ''Jämten 1993'', p. 140-145&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the end of the 19th century for Östersund to truly become a city, after the arrival of the [[railroad]] and the [[economic liberalization]] of that time.

Östersund is situated in inland Scandinavia and connected to [[Sundsvall]] in the east on the Swedish coast, and [[Trondheim]] in the west at the shores of the [[Norwegian sea]]. Östersund is located in the middle of [[Scandinavia]], in the middle of Sweden, in the middle of Jämtland County and in the middle of Östersund Municipality. As the most centrally located city in Sweden, the city credits itself as the ''[[Geographical center of Sweden|centre of Sweden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/OV/OV0904/2007A01/medelsvensson.pdf|title=Familjen Medelsvensson - The average Swedish family] [[Statistics Sweden]|author=|date=|website=scb.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.12127904107dc154d7c80007355/%C3%96sdbroschyrENGELSKA.pdf |title=Östersund - Quality of life included |accessdate=2008-02-29 |publisher=Östersund Municipality |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409082949/http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.12127904107dc154d7c80007355/%C3%96sdbroschyrENGELSKA.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Östersund is marketed as ''Vinterstaden'' – Winter City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vinterstaden.com/ Vinterstaden] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.7fd417de1179c5aa17980005589/VISTAD_EN.PDF |title=Östersund - Winter City |accessdate=2008-02-29 |publisher=Östersund Municipality |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409082944/http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.7fd417de1179c5aa17980005589/VISTAD_EN.PDF |archivedate=2008-04-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter City as a project is run by the Municipality together with city [[Business|enterprises]]. Östersund has had a long history as a centre of outdoor activities with a modern [[cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] [[stadium]] and an actual [[piste]] in the city itself. Östersund has also hosted several [[World Championships]] in various sports such as [[biathlon]], [[speed skating]] and [[Orienteering#Ski orienteering|ski orienteering]] along with Swedish National Championships in cross country skiing and [[snocross]]. The city has been the applicant city of Sweden for several [[Winter Olympic Games]], but has yet to host one. The precursor to the Winter Olympic Games, the ''[[Nordic Games]]'', were however held at several occasions in the city, due to lack of snow in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/2002/OREXXVII43/OREXXVII43zu.pdf |title=The Nordic Games: Precursor To The Olympic Winter Games |accessdate=2008-10-24 |year=2002 |publisher=[[LA84 Foundation]] |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Frösön and Östersund WorldWind.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of Östersund and [[Frösön]].]]
Östersund is the only city in the province and it is located on the shore of the fifth largest lake in Sweden, [[Storsjön]]. The area surrounding this lake is commonly referred to as [[Storsjöbygden]] and this area has been described as the World's northern-most located genuine [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[society]] in the inland with [[continental climate]].&lt;ref&gt;Nils Åsling (2004). "Ostlandets historia - från fäboddrift till Milkoland" (in Swedish) in Henrik Zipsane: ''Jämten 2005'', p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city sprawls along the eastern slopes of lake Storsjön and most of the city and the city core itself is located on the mainland, facing the non mainland part of the city, the island of [[Frösön]], which for a very long time was the actual centre of Jämtland. Today, a sizeable part of the city's population live on the slopes of the island that face the city centre. Östersund is a bimunicipal town because a minor part of it with roughly 400 inhabitants is actually situated in [[Krokom Municipality]].

The city spans across ''Östersundet'' and the city was named after this strait. Östersund can be directly translated from Swedish to English as "East [[Sound (geography)|Sound]]". The name of the strait derives from an older [[Jamtlandic|Jamtish]] name now present in the form ''Åstersånn''.

===Climate===
Östersund has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Dfc) and is located in the far north of the north temperate climate zone. The cold [[Arctic]] winds that occasionally find their way to the city are called ''nordvästan'' (''the north-westerner'') or ''kallvästan'' (''the cold-westerner'') locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.5764b86e110de7481f780003160/%C3%96stersund+2007.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214614/http://www.ostersund.se/download/18.5764b86e110de7481f780003160/%C3%96stersund+2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-11 |title=Välkommen till Östersund |accessdate=2008-06-22 |year=2007 |language=Swedish |publisher=Östersund Municipality |pages=2 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Östersund from Frösön.jpg|thumb|left|Östersund and Frösön]]
However the winter climate is much warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. This is due to the [[gulf stream]] and the many passages in the mountain range, bringing warmer [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] winds to the city during winters. This somewhat [[Maritime climate|maritime]] character also makes the summers in the city rather cool, in comparison to other towns in inland Scandinavia, which all have a more continental climate with cold winters and warm summers.&lt;ref name="clim"/&gt; It contains a strong influence of the [[humid continental climate]] courtesy of its mild September lows extending the mild mean temperatures.

Though Östersund is in fact affected by the gulf stream it lacks the high frequency of [[rain]] following the currents. This is due to the Scandinavian Mountain Range acting as a natural barrier, receiving most of the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], giving Östersund and the surrounding area a rain deficit.&lt;ref name="clim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smhi.se/sgn0102/n0205/artikelserier/s10_jan07.pdf |title=Jämtlands klimat |accessdate=2008-06-22 |author=Vedin, Haldo |year=2007 |work=Väder och Vatten 1/2007 |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |language=Swedish |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214549/http://www.smhi.se/sgn0102/n0205/artikelserier/s10_jan07.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that has to be taken into account is the higher elevation of Östersund compared to the weather stations in [[Ångermanland]] farther east. For example, [[Sollefteå]] at a similar latitude {{convert|130|km|mi}} to the east but at sea level, albeit inland, has almost three degrees warmer July days.

Östersund has a high exposition of sunlight and was the most sunny city in Sweden in the summer of 2007 (1 July to 9 August) with 654 hours of sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_252509.svd |title=Östersund vann sommarens solliga |accessdate=2008-10-24 |author=The Newspapers' Telegram Bureau |date=2007-08-10 |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet|SvD]] |language=Swedish |authorlink=Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in comparison to east coast locations, sunshine is relatively low.

==Cityscape==
[[File:Draak Östersund 22jul2006.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Storsjöodjuret]] (the Great lake monster) is a [[cryptid]] said to inhabit lake [[Storsjön]]. This figure has often been used as a symbol for Östersund, along with the moose (see above). The city core is seen in the background.]]
Östersund was laid out with roads spanning from north to south countered by several [[alley]]s from east to west, which is why an alley in Östersund is synonymous with a road leading down towards Storsjön. From the inner city one may gaze upon Storsjön, Frösön and the Jamtish [[fell]] region with snow-clad mountains. This was made possible due to the [[topography]] and the [[grid plan]].

The regularity in Östersund's road system and the slanting alleys leading from higher altitudes down towards Storsjön have created the "windows to the west" characteristic and unique to Östersund as a city.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; The alleys, often seen as rather steep, have created the illusion that the houses in the city core are climbing to higher grounds. These houses were conformed upon their construction to fit with the slopes.
[[File:Östersund badhusparken.jpg|thumb|left|Badhusparken]]
The first city plan of Östersund was made with several large segments in the core being reserved as [[green|green areas]]. Östersund was thus planned as a green city and special lots, e.g. ''kryddgårdstomter'' "spice [[garden]] lots" were created along with construction lots. These lots shifted with a construction lot alternating with a spice garden lot. The garden lots are no longer existent since they too have been constructed upon. Many of the fences that separated each lot from another with trees and verdure were left intact. The large green areas are still present, with [[park]]s such as ''Kyrkparken'', ''Österängsparken'' and ''Badhusparken'' being the most prominent. Badhusparken was once the location of a large [[Public bathing|bath house]] (hence the name ''Badhus''-) though it was torn down in 1881 when the [[railway]] was constructed. A new larger two-storey pompous bath house was later built on poles a few metres from the shore, enabling the population to bathe in the waters of Storsjön during summers. This house was also torn down, when a new bath house with heated water was founded in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Östersund winter festival.jpg|thumb|250px|The national romantic Sparbanken building illuminated during the Winter Festival.]]
When Östersund started to grow as a city in the late 19th century the houses consisted predominantly of wood, though stone had become popular in the central parts. These houses were heavily characterized by [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothicism]] and [[Neo-Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; A very common feature of these houses were [[tower]]s, some even resembling those on old [[castle]]s like the one on [[Hotell Grand]] at the main square. In the early 20th century a new age had come and in the main road, Prästgatan, the new age came fiercely. The wooden houses were replaced by stone buildings, because a city's well being was measured in how many stone buildings it had. At the same time [[military barracks]] were constructed in connection to the older settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jugendstil]] became popular too as an addition to the [[National Romantic style]] [[architecture]].
[[File:Storgatan in Östersund.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Storgatan in Östersund with an alley, a window to the west, down towards Storsjön.]]
In the 1930s, the [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic style]] made itself apparent in Östersund's outskirts, which were growing. In the 1940s, the city was made more car-friendly and the city was first and foremost planned for cars.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the sanitarian issues was brought up, which resulted in the construction of a [[sewage treatment works]] and the waste water was no longer flushed directly into Storsjön. Östersund was also affected by the [[Million Programme]], though to a lesser extent than other cities. During the same period older buildings such as Hotell Grand (to make room for ''Storsjöteatern''), Cellfängelset (a [[jail]] located at the beginning of Prästgatan), Flickskolan (the girl school next to the city hall, where the current county library is located) and Västra stationen (at Badhusparken) were torn down. The local media described it all as e.g. "demolishing madness".&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Good Templar house was threatened in order to widen Rådhusgatan the city's inhabitants had had enough and the building was saved.
[[File:Storgatan Östersund.jpg|thumb|Storgatan with a "spice garden lot" to the left.]]
The buildings along ''Storgatan'' (literally: "the great road") with entire segments intact since the 1880s are considered one of the best preserved city settlements in Sweden. The wooden [[façade]]s are rich with details and the house are relatively low, short and slim. A great amount of work was put down on creating a balance between details and entirety. Parallel with Storgatan lies ''Prästgatan'' – "the [[priest]] road", Östersund's main shopping street. The buildings between the two roads are often connected and the roads create small rooms mostly inaccessible for keen winds. These so-called rooms also stimulate the social life on the streets.

''Stortorget'' – the main [[town square]] in central Östersund is one of six "closed squares" built in Sweden, the others being the ones in [[Uppsala]], [[Karlstad]], [[Vimmerby]], [[Piteå]] and [[Haparanda]]. It was created through indentation in four different blocks to deliberately create an open air room with openings to every direction. A style deriving from how cities were planned during [[the Renaissance]]. However the town square lost its original shape when it was "opened up" and expanded towards the lake. Stortorget has long been the city's main market place and core, it is also here that the thousand year old market ''[[Gregorie market]]'' is held each year in March. The city festival ''[[Storsjöyran]]'' has Stortorget as its main centre.

===Districts and housing estates===
Before Östersund was established the population in the area was very scarce. In [[Odensala]] and [[Torvalla]] older settlements existed, the name Odensala can be derived from the Viking age and the Halls of [[Odin]] (though Torvalla means "dry wealds" with no reference to [[Thor]]). These two villages were later incorporated into Östersund and are today two major urban districts. Besides them the urban districts of [[Odenskog]], [[Odensvik]], [[Odenslund]], [[Karlslund]], [[Erikslund]], [[Lugnvik]], [[Lillänge]] and [[Söder, Östersund|Söder]] along with the new district [[Stadsdel Norr]] are found on the mainland. On Frösön, recently included into the city are the three urban districts [[Hornsberg]], [[Mjälle]] and [[Valla, Östersund|Valla]].

The central parts of Östersund are a part of the urban district ''[[Staden, Östersund|Staden]]'' – "the city", which has become synonymous with Östersund for many people living in the nearby villages and towns. As Östersund is the only city in the area and nearest city for many it is common to call it ''Stan'', though the [[dative case|dative form]] ''Staa'' has increasingly grown unusual. The residents of Östersunds are referred to as ''östersundare'', though local ruralists call them ''stassbon'' "towners", and ''stassbo'' "towner", in [[grammatical number|singular]].

===Landmarks===
[[File:Ostersund city hall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Östersund City Hall]]]]
The most well known landmark of Östersund is the national romantic [[Östersund City Hall|city hall]]. It is 51 meters tall and contains 136 rooms. It is the greatest constructional symbol of the National Romantic architecture in Östersund.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; The city hall looks almost like a fortress and affiliates especially to the local art of Jämtland. The [[bell tower]] is of typical Jamtish design shaped like an [[onion]], the local sculpture [[Olof Ahlberg]] made most of the sculpture details and the ornaments are made from Jamtish [[limestone]]. [[Frans Bertil Wallberg]]'s city hall was seen by contemporary colleagues as the best of modern Swedish architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Pentén, Gudrun (1986). "Så byggdes Östersund" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The main part of the building is accentuated by a grand tower and a monumental stairway. It is accompanied by only one wing, the north wing, as the second, south wing, was torn down in the 1970s.

A recently built landmark is [[Arctura]], named after Jämtland's provincial star [[Arcturus]], a large hot water accumulator tank. Due to its appearance it is referred to as ''Termosen'' (''the [[Vacuum flask|Thermos]]''). At night the 65 meter building is illuminated with various lights like [[sunrise]] and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]].

The large church is a monumental feature in Östersund's cityscape. It is a [[basilica]] made of bricks with clear distinguished aisle. The [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] is three-sided and the large [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] is facing the west: Storsjön and the fells of [[Oviken]].

==History==
[[File:Frösöstenen.jpg|thumb|The Frösö Runestone is situated on Frösön in Östersund.]]
{{Main article|History of Östersund}}
Lake Storsjön's shores have long been inhabited. Though the area where Östersund is situated was for a very long time Frösön's link to the east mainland. Frösön, the island of the [[Norse god]] [[Freyr]], was originally the centre of the region and it was here the only inland Scandinavian [[hill fort]], [[Mjälleborgen]], was built around 300 AD. The ancient [[Thing (assembly)|Scandinavian thing]] [[Jamtamót]] was held on this island, the christening of Jämtland begun here and it was here the World's northern-most raised runestone, [[Frösö Runestone]], was risen.

Plans regarding the foundation of a [[Stad (Sweden)|Swedish city]] or ''[[köping]]'' (market town, "Chipping") in Jämtland existed among governmental officials already after the previously Norwegian province was ceded from [[Denmark-Norway]] in 1645. [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] demanded the establishment of a [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]] on [[Andersön]] shortly after the province became Swedish, this sconce would together with [[Frösö sconce]] secure the Swedish control over Jämtland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.z.lst.se/z/amnen/naturvard/Skyddad_natur/Naturreservat_sok_AO/anderson.htm County Administrative Board of Jämtland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216030700/http://www.z.lst.se/z/amnen/naturvard/Skyddad_natur/Naturreservat_sok_AO/anderson.htm |date=2008-02-16 }} (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; Christina's intention was to locate the "Jamts' city" within this [[fortification]]. In order to construct the sconce the local inhabitants were coerced into [[forced labour]] 1651 but after protests and lack of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] the project was ended in 1654.
[[File:Old Östersund.png|thumb|left|Östersund in the mid-1800s, the church in the picture was the first church in Östersund. When the houses were smaller it dominated the cityscape.]]
In 1758, the plans were brought back up through an initiative from the [[chief financial officer]] [[Pehr Schissler]] and the proposition did however initiate a new debate whether or not a city was to be established in Jämtland, in order to counteract the trading and ''[[Jämtland#Provincial character|faring traditions]]'' of Jämtland's farmers.&lt;ref name="found"/&gt; Several other attempts at constraition had previously been taken, and deemed unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Rumar, ''Historia kring Kölen'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Östersund was founded and given its charter by [[Monarch]] [[Gustav III of Sweden]] on 23 October 1786, shortly after the outskirt of the Odensala farmers' lands were bought for the purpose. Several other places had been suggested, like [[Huså]] the then-largest settlement in Jämtland along with [[Krokom]], [[Sunne (Jämtland)|Sunne]] and Ede outside of [[Brunflo]]. Frösön was also a candidate but the lot fell on Östersund, as it was deemed most favourable.&lt;ref name="found"/&gt; The only thing actually located in the area at the time was the main road and the bridge to Frösön. Östersund was upon foundation freed from taxes during a 20-year timespan and completely liberated from trade regulations and [[guild]] order.&lt;ref name="found"/&gt; In other remote locations of the [[Nordic region]], similar cities were founded, like [[Reykjavík]] on [[Iceland]] the very same year, [[Tromsø]] (1794) in [[Northern Norway]] and [[Tampere]] (1775) and [[Kuopio]] (1782) in the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[wikt:inland|inland]]. Östersund is however the only city in present-day Sweden to have been founded in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rumar, ''Historia kring Kölen'', 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Östersunds järnvägsstation.jpg|thumb|This railway station was built in 1879.]]
Just like any other city founded by state officials miles away, the city developed extremely poorly and had to struggle in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Rumar, ''Historia kring Kölen'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The State tried to pursue the Jamtish traders on Frösön to migrate to the new city but they had no intentions of leaving such a rich [[parish]] with fertile soils Frösön consisted of in favour of the swamp and marches across the strait. During its first 50 years the city's population only grew (on average) with eight people per year.&lt;ref name="Rum"&gt;Rumar, ''Historia kring Kölen'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The city did become the capital of the newly founded county consisting of the provinces Jämtland and [[Härjedalen]] in 1810, meaning that a county residence was built and a county administrative board was located to the city.&lt;ref name="Rum"/&gt; Though Östersund remained as a [[de facto]] farmer village with less than 400 inhabitants in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Sundin, Bosse (1986). "Folkrörelser och kulturliv" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; An upswing occurred in the 1850s, as trade was liberalized and the [[logging]] process developed.

[[File:Gamla teatern Östersund.jpg|thumb|left|The world's largest order house is now a hotel. The Good Templar movement began declining after the [[Swedish prohibition referendum]] of 1922.]]
It took until the construction of the railroad in 1879 before Östersund became a real city and actually gained the status as Jämtland's centre, at Frösön's expense. Thanks to the "farmer chieftain" [[Nils Larson i Tullus]] the railroad came to pass through the city itself instead of outside it, as planned. The railway from coast to coast across the then union between [[Sweden and Norway]] was finished 1882, connecting Östersund closer to [[Trondheim]] and Sundsvall. Östersund then came to grow faster than any other Swedish city. After ten years it had passed 20 Swedish cities in population.&lt;ref&gt;Sundin, Bosse (1986). "Folkrörelser och kulturliv" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The city attracted immigrants, a slight majority from the Jamtish countryside, though still with a high number of settlers from Southern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Walentin, Hans (1986). "Människors vardag" (in Swedish) in Jörgen Björklund: ''Östersunds historia III'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; While Östersund was in its most intense state of growth [[social movement|popular movement]]s emerged among the inhabitants. In Jämtland and Härjedalen the [[liberalism|free minded]] [[IOGT|Good Templar movement]] (a part of the [[temperance movement]]) came to dominate completely. In 1883, 700 of the city's total population of 3,000 were organized Good Templars. The greatest symbol of the movements grandeur was the Order House constructed 1885 in the city, ''Östersunds-Goodtemplars-Ordenshus''. When one of the most prominent leaders, [[Joseph Malins]], visited the city he announced that it was the world's largest order house.&lt;ref&gt;Sundin, Bosse (1999). "En medborgarskola för framtiden" (in Swedish) in Sten Rentzhog: ''Jämten 2000'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the leading people behind the popular movements in Östersund saw [[industrialization]] as a significant threat towards the native districts and the old village and farmer community. The work from the movements made the city and its [[centre-right]] governance extremely rejective towards industries. Instead they wanted to portray Östersund as a centre of [[outdoor activity|out-door activities]], culture, [[education]] and [[tourism]]. Industries were not allowed to threaten the good environment, and the [[social history]] traditions.

In 1917 when the Great War was fought on the continent and with the [[February revolution]] in Russia, starting the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] also affected Östersund. Rationing led to lack of supplies and a revolution was feared. Some of the citizens, primarily soldiers, went on hunger strikes and at the first of May that year 4,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the city hall demanding lower prices on [[milk]] and [[wood]]. The year after the [[Spanish flu]] spread like wildfire across the world. The city doctor in Östersund noted that "Östersund ought without objection have been more haunted by the flu than any other Swedish city", which is why Östersund was referred to by locals as ''spanska sjukans huvudstad'', "capital of the spanish flu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.op.se/parser.php?level1=10&amp;level2=625&amp;id=651714 |title=Under hösten 1918 är Östersund staden med högst antal döda. |accessdate=2008-10-24 |author=Nolervik, Stefan |date=2006-04-01 |publisher=[[Östersunds-Posten]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131174257/http://op.se/parser.php?level1=10 |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stora kyrkan Östersund march 2012.jpg|thumb|The large brick church was built in front of Österängsparken 1940, during WW2.]]
Despite the [[great depression]] and several crisis resulting in a very high [[unemployment]] rate Östersund continued to grow in the [[interwar period]]. The [[municipal community]] Odenslund was incorporated into Östersund in 1918. The business world remained largely unaffected and Östersund continued being one of the least industrialized cities in Sweden. Instead Östersund continued to focus on [[wholesale]] trade and became a centre of this in northern and north central Sweden. The city's central position was strengthened when [[Inlandsbanan]] was constructed through Jämtland from the north to the south. During the interwar period the car and the bus became common. The first scheduled bus route was created in the 1920s between Östersund and the nearby town of [[Brunflo]]. In the next decade well over 40 bus routes were functioning in Östersund. The dairy was located west of the bus square, ''Gustav III:s torg'', at the shopping mall Kärnan's current whereabout. This square naturally become a central part of the city.

Östersund continued to grow after the [[Second World War]]. Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and Östersund was just like the rest of Jämtland affected by the [[Rehn-Meidner-model]], though not in the same way. The Swedish [[Keynesian]] politic was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force. Jämtland was struck hard by this when the people moved from the countryside to cities, from inland to coast and from the north to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Westlund, Hans (1999). "Visionerna bakom avfolkningspolitiken" in Sten Rentzhog: ''Jämten 2000'', p. 190-196.&lt;/ref&gt; As an urban area Östersund was affected by the [[Million Programme]] and urban districts like [[Körfältet]] were created.
[[File:Unofficial Flag of Jamtland.svg|thumb|left|Östersund became the capital of the Republic of Jamtland. Its [[Flag of the Republic of Jamtland|flag]] can be seen throughout the year at the main town square.]]
The negative view towards industries were changed when the Social Democrats came to power for the first time in the city's history in 1952. Industries were enticed to Östersund through the national localization politic and industrial areas were created in Odenskog and Lugnvik. The development wasn't, as already mentioned, as good in the rest of Jämtland as it was in Östersund and as a counter act towards the governmental politic the [[Republic of Jamtland]] was established in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Ganman, Jens (1999) "Storsjöyran, Gamlin och republiken" in Sten Rentzhog: ''Jämten 2000'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Östersund became the republic's "capital" and the home to the freedom festival [[Storsjöyran]].

Östersund continued to grow and in 1970 [[Frösö köping]] was made part of Östersund. In the year of 1971 a major reform occurred in Sweden creating large municipalities replacing all the older institutions and the new large municipality was named after the city. Just like in the rest of Sweden the public sector greatly expanded at this time. In 1960 the public sector of Sweden constituted about 30 per cent of Sweden's total [[gross domestic product]], in the middle of the 1980s the number had grown to 65 per cent. At the time it was here the jobs were, in the county board, the state and in the new municipality. The main reason for the large expansion were the expanded [[transfer payment]] to the [[household]]s that occurred, along with growing [[interest]] and public consummation. Everything was founded by large tax raises. The entire 1970s was an expansive period. Besides the new industrial complex the [[Frösö bridge]] was constructed, a new police house, Z-kupolen (burned to the ground in 1989), ''Storsjöteatern'', [[Folkets hus]], urban district churches, malls etc. The County Administration board and the hospital expanded and large housing estates were constructed in Körfältet, Lugnvik and Odensala.

The city tried to acquire a "[[humanism|humanistic]] college of higher learning" on Frösön already in the 1940s. A large tension existed between the cities in Norrland and [[Umeå]] left the struggle victorious 1962. Östersund however required a "social college of higher learning" in 1971. Östersund is since 2005 one of the main campus sites of the [[Mid Sweden University]] (Mittuniversitetet). A number of governmental offices have also been located to the city in recent years.

==Garrison town==
[[File:F4tva).JPG|thumb|180px|[[Hangar]] on Frösön]]
Östersund became a garrison town when the [[Norrland Artillery Regiment]] (A 4) was founded in the city 1892, followed by the upgrading of [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment|Jämtland Ranger Corps]] to [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment]] (I 23). This was done with the growing fear of a Russian assault whereas Jämtland-Trøndelag and [[Norrbotten]] became the most prioritized defense-regions. The [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|dissolution of the union Sweden-Norway]] contributed with enhancing Östersund as a military city strengthening its presence, the Jämtland Ranger Regiment was located in the city 1910 and the [[F 4 Frösön|Jämtland Air Force Wing]] (F 4) came to Frösön 1926.

Östersund's importance as a garrison town grew when the city was connected to the [[Boden Fortress]], following the construction of Inlandsbanan.

After the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the destruction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991 Sweden had lost its national threat and the demand for a strong defense organization was deemed unnecessary. The issue was debated throughout the 1990s and the final decision came in 2004 where all military presence in Östersund was ended. Upon delivering the message the [[Minister for Defence (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for Defence]] [[Leni Björklund]] was publicly [[Booing|booed]] by the city's inhabitants.

The ending of Östersund's status as a garrison town has however created a larger enthusiasm regarding the city's future as the [[private sector]] has grown larger and more companies are being established, much of which is due to the financial compensation the State offered. The older areas reserved for military activities have been opened up and two more urban districts were made available.

==Politics and governance==
[[File:Stadsvapensflagga framför Östersunds rådhus.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Östersund Municipality is governed from the city hall.]]
{{Main article|Östersund Municipality}}
Östersund is the capital of Jämtland County and thus, the county governor [[Britt Bohlin Ohlsson]] reside in the city.
Bohlin Ohlsson is the head of [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|Jämtland County Administrative Board]] (''Länsstyrelsen i Jämtlands län''), an administrative entity appointed by the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish Government]].

Östersund is also the seat of [[Jämtland County Council]] (''Jämtlands läns landsting'', located on [[Frösön]]). The County Council is the elected assembly of Jämtland County. The County Council's responsibilities lie primarily within the [[Publicly funded health care|public health care]] system and transportation between the municipalities.

Östersund is the seat of [[Östersund Municipality]] (''Östersunds kommun''). The [[legislative]] body of the municipality is the 67-member municipal assembly (''[[kommunfullmäktige]]''), elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The assembly appoints the municipality's main governing body, the 15-member executive committee (''kommunstyrelsen''). The executive committee is headed by the [[Mayor]] (''kommunstyrelsens ordförande''). Östersund has historically been dominated by [[Moderate Party|the Conservatives]], [[Liberalism and centrism in Sweden|the freeminded]] (later on [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]]) and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]]. Though contrary to Sweden on a national level Östersund's [[centre-right]] parties long remained in majority. The situation changed first in 1952 when the social democrats were included and they received an own majority in 1962. In 1966 the [[Nordic Agrarian parties|agririan and rural]] [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] entered the scene, along with the minor [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrat]] and [[Left Party (Sweden)|Communist]] Parties. A new centre-right government was appointed and the Centre Party became the largest party in that coalition 1970. However, since the 1980s the Social Democratic Party has been in power (excluding a term in the 1990s) supported by the communists (now simply Left Party) and occasionally the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] (entered in 1982).
Jens Nilsson from the Social Democratic Party is the mayor of Östersund and has been so since 1997.

==Transport==
[[File:Åre östersund flygplats.jpg|thumb|[[Åre]] was recently included in the airport's name in order to make it more appealing to tourists.]]
[[File:Frösöbron från badhusparken.jpg|thumb|Frösöbron and Östersundet.]]
The airport is situated {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city core, on Frösön. [[Åre Östersund Airport]] (previously named Östersunds flygplats) is an [[international airport]] and the ninth biggest in Sweden with roughly 390,000 passengers in 2005. The airport is one of few Swedish airport with incoming foreign charter traffic and the only one with considerable economic growth in that sector.

The [[European route E14]] runs through Östersund from Trondheim to [[Sundsvall]] and briefly merges with the [[European route E45]] (referred to as [[Inlandsvägen]] locally) coming from the north. The two roads are later split in [[Brunflo]] where E14 continues heading east and E45 turns south again.

Östersund has also railway communications. [[Norrtåg]] operates [[Mittbanan]] from [[Storlien]] to Sundsvall. [[Inlandsbanan]] runs in the same direction as Inlandsvägen. Östersund is connected to Stockholm, [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]] through long distance [[SJ 3000]] (high speed trains), [[InterCity]] and night train. Local company Stadsbussarna i Östersund (literally: the City Buses in Östersund) has nine routes in the city.

As Östersund is located at shores of Storsjön, (English: "the great lake"), it also has a [[harbour]]. There is also a harbour on the Frösö side of the strait. Several bridges span across Storsjön connecting Östersund with communities nearby, [[Frösöbron]] across Östersundet, [[Vallsundsbron]] from Frösön across Vallsundet to ''Annersia'' "the other side" and [[Rödöbron]] from Frösön to Rödön in Krokom Municipality.

==Trade and commerce==
[[File:Ostersund.JPG|thumb|Prästgatan]]
Like the rest of Jämtland Östersund is heavily dominated by many [[small business]]es. The city is the centre of trade and commerce in Jämtland County and has well over 300 different shops. The [[retailing|retail trade]]'s [[revenue|turnover]] is 30 per cent higher than it ought to be, given the number of inhabitants the city has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelhult.se/uppdrag/FVT%20nr%201-2009%20s32-33.pdf |title=Jämtkraft växer med Östersund |accessdate=2009-09-08 |work=Fjärrvärmetidningen 1 2009 |language=Swedish |publisher=adelhult.se |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718121434/http://www.adelhult.se/uppdrag/FVT%20nr%201-2009%20s32-33.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade in the [[central business district]] (''Staden'' – the City) is mostly concentrated to the shopping and pedestrian street Prästgatan where large local shopping malls such as ''Kärnan'' and ''Mittpunkten'' along with department stores such as [[Åhléns]] are located. Large [[clothing]] companies such as [[H&amp;M]], [[Lindex]] and smaller like [[WESC]] etc., approximately 50 [[restaurant]]s, shoe stores, sporting goods retailers like Stadium and [[Intersport]], several [[supermarkets]] (Östersund has rather few [[convenience store]]s) and much more. Storgatan, the street that runs parallel with Prästgatan is also lined with shops, restaurants and coffeehouses. Unlike Prästgatan this street is not a pedestrian street. Östersund is the city in Sweden with the most square metres of window display per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naboer.se/pdf/en/st_olavsleden_16-17_en.pdf |title=Östersund - the city in the centre |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=Naboer AB |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409082958/http://www.naboer.se/pdf/en/st_olavsleden_16-17_en.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent figure in Östersund's business life throughout the 20th century was the car salesman (started out selling horses) [[Sven O. Persson]], founder of [[Persson Invest]], [[Byggelit]] and [[Bilbolaget]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Nowadays the most distinguishing businessman is [[Maths O. Sundqvist]], owner of several [[real estate]]s in Östersund, including the entire urban district Stadsdel Norr through his real estate company [[Fabös]] (together with [[Peab]]). {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

[[File:Storgatan i Östersund.jpg|thumb|Storgatan in late [[afternoon]].]]
Östersund has had a long history as a [[marketplace]] with the already mentioned ancient Gregorie market, tracing its lineage back to the 11th century, in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turist.ostersund.se/parser.php?did=55%3A1081&amp;searchString=travelling&amp;x=1&amp;y=1 |title=Gregorie Market |accessdate=2008-10-24 |publisher=The Östersund Tourist- &amp; Conference Office }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However banned in 1914, it continued to be held a couple of years. In 1950, the market was reborn shortly and was completely resurrected in 1986, when the city celebrated its 200th anniversary, and has been held yearly since then. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 1948, when the markets were non-existent visions to restore Östersund's market traditions, in a modern version, were brought up. The result was the [[trade fair]] [[Expo Norr]], initiated 1950 in order to strengthen Östersund as the leading the centre of trade in the northern parts of Sweden. The trade fair is an annual event just like Gregorie market, though Expo Norr is held during the summer and not during the winter. Expo Norr is usually attended by 30,000 individuals every year.

Just like many other County capitals in Sweden the [[Jämtland County Council|County Council]] and the Municipality are among the largest employers.

Besides trading and [[public services]] Östersund has some larger companies such as [[Solectron]], [[Cybercom AB|Cybercom]], [[Svenska Dagbladet]]'s [[customer service]], [[Volex]], [[Husqvarna AB]], [[Swedbank]]'s telephone bank and [[Telia (company)|Telia]]. Companies such as the dairy cooperation [[Milko (Swedish cooperative)|Milko]] and [[Inlandsbanan AB]] have located their [[corporate headquarters]] in the city.

A national survey done by the [[Confederation of Swedish Enterprise]] show that out of every company in Östersund Municipality 52 per cent are "very positive towards [[globalization]]", thus ranking Östersund at number eight in Sweden as the most globalization friendly Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svensktnaringsliv.se/regioner/ostersund/article32457.ece |title=Hur globala är Jämtlands kommuner |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=Svenskt Näringsliv  |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The city has many cafés, [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[pub]]s and [[nightclub]]s. The city has a long café tradition, as they were important early on for the rich association life that came with the popular movements. It was natural for visitors from the countryside, the military and tourists to spend time with each other and the towners at a café. At one of the city's cafés the [[Smörgåstårta|sandwich cake]] is said to have been invented. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Cultural arenas===
[[File:Thomée.jpg|thumb|S/S Thomée moored in the harbour.]]
Östersund is the cultural centre of Jämtland County and home to the prize winning museum [[Jamtli]]. The museum has both an enclosed exhibition area and an outdoor area which contains a number of historical buildings from all over the county, depicting the old lives of peasants, the early city of Östersund and the Scandinavian inland herding. The museum exhibition hosts an interesting set of tapestries, the ''[[Överhogdal tapestries]]'', showing a rich imagery of both Norse and Christian origin from the [[Viking Age]]. The mythical [[Storsjöodjuret]] (Great Lake Monster) has an exhibit of its own. Another remnant from the Viking age is [[Frösöstenen]], one of the world's most northerly rune stones located on Frösön, the island of [[Freyr]].

The county library, ''Jämtlands läns bibliotek'' is located in the city. It is the oldest county library in Sweden, being founded in 1816 by the will of professor [[Carl Zetterström]]. As the library grew it was moved to a bigger facility. The older building is now situated beside the old church in Kyrkparken.
[[File:Moose Zoo Östersund.jpg|thumb|left|Moose Garden]]
Lake Storsjön has been trafficked for a long time and the [[steamship]]s [[S/S Thomée]] and [[S/S Östersund]] are still in operation every summer. Unlike most boats, they are seen as male and not female. S/S Thomée is the only one that sets sail from Östersund's harbour. S/S Östersund sails from Arvesund, located at Storsjön's western shore but makes visits to Jamtli's steamboat [[jetty]].

[[Frösö Zoo]] is one of Sweden's largest [[zoological garden]]s with [[exotic animal]]s. It has roughly 700 different animals like [[Siberian tiger]]s, [[lion]]s, [[polar wolf|polar wolves]], monkeys etc. Frözö Zoo also has a [[tropic house]], a [[biological museum]] and an [[amusement park]]. Outside of Östersund in the village of [[Orrviken]] there's a Moose Zoo, called ''[[Moose Garden]]'' allowing close encounters with tame moose.
[[File:Färgfabriken norr, Östersund.jpg|thumb|Färgfabriken Norr]]
[[Färgfabriken]] ('the colour factory') is a culture experimental centre based in Stockholm, that perceive itself as a laboratory of contemporary art.

==Sports==
[[File:Östersunds skidstadion Biathlon WC 2008.JPG|thumb|left|The ski stadium of Östersund]]
Östersund is marketed as ''the Winter City'' and has a long history of winter sports. It is internationally perhaps most known as one of the regular [[Biathlon World Cup]] hosts and was also hosting both the [[Biathlon World Championship 1970|1970]] and [[Biathlon World Championships 2008|2008]] [[Biathlon World Championship]]s.

The cross-country ski stadium is located two kilometres ({{convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the city centre and is one of the most well-equipped and spectator friendly ski stadiums in Sweden. The stadium is also internationally renowned due to the topography of its ski tracks, the compact track-system and the fact that Östersund is usually quite a reliable locality for snow during the winter months. A number of [[biathlon]] world cup races have been held at the stadium as well as several national championships in cross-country skiing.
[[File:Vy över Östersund från Gustavsbergsbacken på Frösön.jpg|thumb|Östersund seen from the piste Gustavsbergsbacken]]

''Nationellt Vintersportcentrum'' (NVC, Swedish Winter Sports Research Centre) is a research and training project run by the sports movement, the university, the municipality and the county council. The [[Swedish Olympic Committee]] (SOC) use its lab for various tests.

Östersund, in association with the neighboring municipality of [[Åre]], had plans to be the candidate of Sweden for the organization of the XXIInd Olympic Winter Games, the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], but the candidacy proposal was rejected by the government. It would have been the fourth attempt of this city (after [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] where Östersund lost [[Bids for Olympic Games|the bid]] with the score 45–39 to [[Lillehammer]] in the final round, [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] and [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]]).

Östersund has a [[basketball]] team in Sweden's highest division ([[Ligan (basketball)|Ligan]]), [[Jämtland Basket]].

Östersund's Fallskärmsklubb is the oldest of Sweden's drop zones and was formed in 1958. The very first civilian parachute jump was done actually on the ice of Storsjön in February 1956. The jumpers were officers from the Swedish Parachute rangers regiment that also wanted to jump on their spare time. Östersund's Fallskärmsklubb is today localized to Optand's airfields, approximately {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} south from Östersund where one carries out education of students and sky diving for the experienced jumpers all year around with the exception from late autumn until early winter.
