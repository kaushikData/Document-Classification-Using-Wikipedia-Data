'''Astra 1KR''' is one of the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] [[geostationary satellite]]s owned by [[SES S.A.|SES]]. It was launched in April 2006 as a replacement for [[Astra 1K]], which failed to reach orbit on launch in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=November 28, 2002 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2002/4436301|title=ASTRA 1K satellite stabilised |accessdate= January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of Astra 1KR was the first attempted by SES since the Astra 1K failure.

The craft launched to 3.4° east for testing, before moving to [[Astra 19.2°E]], where it replaced [[Astra 1B]], which was effectively decommissioned, and [[Astra 1C]], which was then elderly and running beneath full capacity. It was expected to also replace [[Astra 2C]], which was under-utilised, and to allow that satellite to return to [[Astra 28.2°E]] to join [[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2B|2B]]/[[Astra 2D|2D]] to provide additional capacity. However, SES stated that [[Astra 1L]] would replace Astra 2C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=June 17, 2003 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2003/4418814|title=SES ASTRA PROCURES TWO SATELLITES WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first signals from the craft at 19.2° east were direct replacements for four transponders on the failing [[Astra 1E]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The '''Banks Association of Turkey''' (sometimes referred as, the ''Turkish Banks Association'') or '''''Türkiye Bankalar Birliği''''' (TBB) is an organisation for banks in Turkey. Membership is compulsory for commercial and investment banks operating in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;TBB, [http://www.tbb.org.tr/en/about-the-association/the-association/11 The Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include conducting policy-related research and collecting statistics. As of April 2016, it has 47 members.

TBB has a General Assembly, which consist of representatives from member banks. General Assembly elects Board of Directors proportional to banks' year-end total assets. 8 members are elected by top 10 commercial banks, 3 members are elected by following 8 banks, 1 member elected by others and 1 member elected by investment banks.

Participation banks, which operate as [[Islamic banking]], are not obliged to be a TBB member, but obliged to join a similar association, ''The [[Participation Banks Association of Turkey]]''.

'''Beikthano''' ({{lang-my|ဗိဿနိုး}}, {{IPA-my|beɪʔθənó|}}, also known as '''Panhtwa city''') situated in the irrigated [[Magway Region]], near present-day [[Taungdwingyi]]. In the era of the [[Pyu city-states]] it was a city of considerable significance, possibly a local capital replacing [[Sri Ksetra]]. Today the modest village is noted for its hot springs and archaeological sites. Beikthano, [[Hanlin, Burma|Hanlin]], and [[Sri Ksetra]], the ancient cities of the Pyu Kingdom were built on the irrigated fields of the dry zone of the Ayeyawady River basin. They were inscribed by [[UNESCO]] on its [[List of World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia]] in May 2014 for their archaeological heritage traced back more than 1,000 years to between 200 BC and 900 AD. 

Beikthano with direct land access to the well-watered [[Kyaukse]] plains to its northeast, is the oldest urban site so far discovered and scientifically excavated site. Its remains—the structures, pottery, artefacts, and human skeletons—date from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], the city may be the first capital of a culturally and perhaps even politically uniform state in the history of Burma. It was a large fortified settlement, measuring approximately 300 hectares inside the rectangular (3&amp;nbsp;km by 1&amp;nbsp;km) walls. The walls and fortifications along it measured six meters thick, and are radiocarbon dated to a period between 180 BCE and 610 CE. Like most subsequent cities, the main entrance of the walls led to the palace, which faced east. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been excavated within the city walls.

[[File:Pyu sites.png|right|upright=0.6|thumb|Map of the most important [[Pyu city-states]]]]

==History==
Beikthano is traditionally believed to have been founded some 2,400 years ago by Princess [[Pan Htwar]] descended from a still legendary dynasty of Tagaung in [[Upper Myanmar]]. The fall of the city is attributed to a mightier king, Duttabaung of Sri Ksetra, who sacked the city, subdued the princess, took her captive and eventually married her. In the present stage of historical research in this country the personalities characterized in the legend are beyond authentic identification. However, the existence of an ancient city called Beikthano (Vishnu City) is testified by the ruins which stand to this day and indicates that the legend may have sprung up from a nucleus of true facts.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gomyanmartours.com/beikthano/|title=Historical Sites in Myanmar / Beikthano|work=Go Myanmar Tours|date=|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myanmartravelinformation.com/2012-03-20-05-40-54/myanmar-lost-cities/41-about-myanmar/myanmar-lost-cities/115-beikthano-vishnu.html|title=An Ancient Center of the Pyu People of Myanmar|work=Myanmar Travel Information|date=|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO inscription==
In October 1996, Beikthano, [[Hanlin, Burma|Hanlin]] and [[Sri Ksetra]] were proposed to be inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]]. This proposal was approved by [[UNESCO]] in the 38th session of the World Heritage Committee held in May 2014 in Doha, Qatar.&lt;ref name=City&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/89711/myanmars-3-ancient-cities-now-on-unesco-world-heritage-list|title=Myanmar's 3 ancient cities now on UNESCO World Heritage list|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=15 May 2018|publisher=Philippines News Agency, Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Khinbe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myanmargeneva.org/pressrelease/20140624%20three%20cities%20in%20unesco%20list.pdf|format=pdf|last=Khinbe|first=Aung|title=UNESCO: Myanmar’s first site inscribed to World Heritage List |accessdate=15 May 2018|publisher=The New Light of Myanmar}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UNESCO report, the Pyu Kingdom prospered for over 1,000 years between 200 BC and 900 AD. All three sites are inscribed under Criterion (ii), (iii), and (iv) covering an area of {{Convert|5809| ha}} with a buffer zone of {{Convert|6790| ha}}. The integrity assessment by UNESCO of the three sites is: "The completeness and reliability of dated archaeological sequences from the site, with the radiocarbon dates derived from intact architectural features dating back to 190 BCE, provide scientific proof of the entire one-thousand year period of occupation of the cities, and reinforces [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] dates provided by inscriptions in Pyu script on artifacts excavated at the site"&lt;ref name=Pyu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1444|title=Pyu Ancient Cities|accessdate=15 May 2018|publisher=UNESCO Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bilozerska coal mine''' is a large coal mine located in the south-east of [[Ukraine]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]]. The mine was put into operation in 1954 with annual production capacity of 1 million tons. Bilozerska represents one of the largest [[coal]] reserve in [[Ukraine]] having estimated reserves of 80.4 million tonnes of [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cmop/docs/ukraine_handbook.pdf |title=Coal mine methane in Ukraine |date=January 2001 |publisher=epa.gov |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408220448/http://www.epa.gov/cmop/docs/ukraine_handbook.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 the mine produced 898.9 thousand tons of coal. The extent of underground workings is 82.6/80 km (1996/1999). 
As per 1999 data, number of employees was 2632 persons, including 1615 underground workers. 
The annual coal production is around 975,000 tonnes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">A '''Border Security Zone''' in [[Russia]] is the designation of a [[Border zone|strip of land]] (usually, though not always, along a Russian external border) where economic activity and access are restricted in line with the Frontier Regime Regulations set by the [[Federal Security Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&amp;nd=102451178|title=Приказ Федеральной службы безопасности Российской Федерации от 07.08.2017 № 454 "Об утверждении Правил пограничного режима"|last=|first=|date=|website=pravo.gov.ru|publisher=Официальный интернет-портал правовой информации|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For foreign tourists to visit the zone a permit issued by the local FSB department is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://og47.ru/2017/12/14/V-pogranzone---novye-pravila-1495|title=В погранзоне - новые правила - Общая газета Ленинградской области|access-date=2018-03-19|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restricted access zone (of {{convert|7.5|km}} width generally, but e.g., running as much as {{convert|90|km}} deep along the [[Estonia]]n border) was established in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1934, and later expanded, at times including vast territories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In 1935–1936, in order to secure the western border of the Soviet Union, many nationalities considered unreliable ([[Poles]], [[Germans]], [[Ingrian Finns]], [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]]) were [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|forcibly transferred]] from the zone by forces of [[NKVD]].&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{en icon}}{{Cite journal

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the borders of the new Russian Federation were dramatically different, but the zone was not corrected accordingly and hence effectively ceased to exist. In 1993, the Law on the State Border was adopted and reestablished a border strip with restricted access, which should not exceed {{convert|5|km}} (although in fact it became much wider in some places).&lt;ref name="lo"/&gt; In 2004 the law was amended, the 5&amp;nbsp;km restriction was removed, and the FSB was legally authorized to draw the zone's limits on its own without coordination with local authorities.&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;{{ru icon}} {{lang|ru|[http://www.around.spb.ru/guide/steelcurtain/steelcurtain.php Пограничная зона и пограничный режим на территории Ленинградской области и Республики Карелия]}}. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fz"&gt;{{ru icon}} {{lang|ru|Федеральный закон от 01 апреля 1993 г.

'''Butterkäse''' ("butter cheese" in [[German language|German]]) is a semi-soft, cow's milk cheese moderately popular in Germanic Europe, and occasionally seen in the rest of the cheese-eating world. Although primarily produced in [[Germany]], some Butterkäse is [[Wisconsin cheese|produced in Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hintz, Martin and Pam Percy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=waPVq7au8NsC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=wisconsin+butterkase&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VDcbVbLrO8W9ggSO-YFQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wisconsin%20butterkase&amp;f=false ''Wisconsin Cheese: A Cookbook and Guide to the Cheeses of Wisconsin'']. Guilford, CT: ThreeForks, 2008, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Janet. [http://www.sfgate.com/food/cheesecourse/article/Mild-Bodensee-Butterk-se-a-buttery-delight-5414008.php "Mild Bodensee Butterkäse a buttery delight"], SFGate.com. Published 18 April 2014. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

As suggested by its name, Butterkäse has a [[butter]]y flavor and appearance. It is often described as mild, partly due to its brief aging time. The softness and mildly salty or acidic flavor is reminiscent of [[Muenster cheese|Muenster]] or [[Gouda cheese|Gouda]] cheeses. Butterkäse first appeared in 1928 as a variant of Italian [[Bel Paese (cheese)|Bel Paese]]. The texture of Butterkäse is smooth and creamy, sometimes nearly spreadable depending on the firmness desired by the cheese maker. Butterkäse is often sliced and added to rolls and sandwiches or melted for cooking.

Butterkäse is light in color, ranging from white to light yellow-orange. It is commonly found in a loaf shape convenient for slicing. It can also be found in a smoked variety.

The '''''Carta Pisana''''' is a map probably made at the end of the 13th century, about 1275-1300. New research suggests that it was made a century later.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pujades i Bataller, Ramon Josep, (2013), [http://www.lecfc.fr/new/articles/216-article-3.pdf ''The Pisana Chart. Really a primitive portolan chart made in the 13th Century?''], [http://www.lecfc.fr/ ''Comite Francais de Cartographie''], No. 216 (Juin 2013), pp. 17-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in [[Pisa]], hence its name. It shows the whole [[Mediterranean]], the [[Black Sea]] and a part of the [[Atlantic Ocean|atlantic]] coast, from the north of present-day [[Morocco]] (down to roughly the [[33rd parallel north]], with the town of [[Azemmour]]&lt;ref name="Harley"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Cartography|editor1=Harley, John Brian |editor2=Woodward, David |publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, London|year=1987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJaP4i7-_MIC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;dq=%22carte+pisane%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=une9S_ZZhL42nr3IzQc&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carte%20pisane%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the present-day [[Netherlands]], but the accuracy of the map is mostly limited to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey Wallys|author2=Winius, George Davison|title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis|year=1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22carta+pisana%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=GRW9S4LANKHWNI-6lNoK&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carta%20pisana%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest surviving [[nautical chart]] (that is, not simply a map but a document showing accurate navigational directions).&lt;ref name="Foundations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riddle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aczel|first=Amir D.|title=The riddle of the compass: the invention that changed the world|publisher=Harcourt Books|location=Orlando|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFcNHc6lu24C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22carta+pisana%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=GRW9S4LANKHWNI-6lNoK&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carta%20pisana%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[portolan chart]],&lt;ref name="Riddle" /&gt; showing a detailed survey of the coasts, and many ports, but bears no indication on the [[topography]] or [[toponymy]] of the [[wikt:inland|inland]].&lt;ref name="Geografia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brancaccio|first=Giovanni|title=Geografia, cartografia e storia del Mezzogiorno|publisher=Guida editori Napoli|location=Napoli|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxIn0_nDhiIC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22carta+pisana%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=GRW9S4LANKHWNI-6lNoK&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carta%20pisana%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the map, North is on the top, in contrast to other maps of the same period such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] (ca. 1300), where East is on the top.

== Origin and content ==
Possible places of origin for the map include [[Pisa]],&lt;ref name="Riddle" /&gt; where it was found, [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], and [[Genoa]],&lt;ref name="Geografia" /&gt; which is the conventionally recognised place of origin.&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt; The density of the ports referenced on the map is the highest for the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and the lowest for that of the [[Ionian Sea]]. This is possible evidence that the map is of [[Genoa|genoese]] origin, since [[Genoa]], at this time, was a major power in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].&lt;ref name="Geografia" /&gt; Additionally, the first textual reference to the use of such a detailed maritime chart, in 1270, is in relation to a Genoese ship.&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt;

The inaccuracy of the Atlantic part of the ''Carta Pisana'', especially when compared to its Mediterranean part, can be exemplified by its depiction of [[Great Britain]]: an irregular, rectangular shape, lying on an east–west axis. Only six place names are indicated for Great Britain. ''Civitate Londra'' ([[London]]) is placed in the middle of the southern coast.&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt;

As to the date of the map, it is partly indicated by the mention of the town of [[Manfredonia]], which was founded by king [[Manfred of Sicily]] in 1256.&lt;ref name="Geografia" /&gt;

The sources used in the making of the ''Carta Pisana'' are difficult to determine. The use of several dialects in the place-names indicated on the map would tend to suggest that several regional sources were compiled to make the map. Other possibilities include a hypothetical earlier, no longer extant portolan chart,  or [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] cartography. However, there is absolutely no evidence supporting the existence of an earlier portolan chart, and the fact that the map's most glaring error concerns Italy would undermine the theory of an Ancient Roman influence.&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt;

== Navigational aspects and relation to the compass ==

The map encompasses almost all of the [[Mediterranean]] inside two circles, one for the western Mediterranean, one for the eastern. These circles are divided into sixteen parts, providing the map with sixteen corresponding [[wind direction]]s. Furthermore, it comprises a two-directional [[scale (map)|scale]] subdivised into several segments corresponding to 200, 50, 10, and 5 miles.&lt;ref name="Riddle" /&gt; The exact value of these "portolan miles" is difficult to calculate in present-day units, given discrepancies between geographical areas on this map and others; but it is conventionally accepted to be around 1.25 kilometers.&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt;

The '''Casablanca Group''', sometimes known as the 'Casablanca bloc', was a short-lived, informal association of African states with a shared vision of the future of [[Africa]] and of [[Pan-Africanism]] in the early 1960s. The group was composed of seven states led by radical, left-wing leaders largely from North Africa - [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Libya]], [[Mali]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afdb.org/about-us/history/group-evolution/ |title=Group Evolution |publisher=African Development Bank Group |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict and eventual compromise between the Casablanca Group and the [[Monrovia Group]] lead to the establishment of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].

==History==
[[File:Place-Unite-Africaine-Casablanca.JPG|thumb|left|African Unity Square (Place de l'Unité Africaine) in Casablanca]]
The group first met in 1961 in the Moroccan port city of [[Casablanca]], hence the alliance's name. This conference brought together some of the continent's most prominent statesmen like [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]] of [[Egypt]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of [[Ghana]] and [[Sékou Touré]] of [[Guinea]].

What united them was a belief in the need for African political unification or federation. They believed that only significant, deep integration, as has since occurred in Europe through the [[European Union]], would enable Africa to defeat colonialism, achieve peace, foster cultural dialogue, increase the continent's geopolitical influence and promote economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Englebert &amp; Kevin C. Dunn (2013), ''Inside African Politics'', London: Lynne Pienner, p. 320 - 321&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they believed in the transfer of many powers from national governments to a supranational, pan-African authority. Nkrumah even argued for the establishment of a pan-African army which could be deployed to fight colonialism or white minority rule across the continent. His famous Pan-Africanist slogan was 'Africa Must Unite!'&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Nkrumah (1963), ''Africa Must Unite'', London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Casablanca Group was ultimately unsuccessful. Most other African leaders did not support such radical change. The ideas of its rival, the so-called [[Monrovia Group]] - which also believed in Pan-Africanism but not at the expense of nationalism and independent statehood - prevailed. In 1963, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was established. All the members of both the Casablanca and Monrovia groups joined, putting their differences to one side. The OAU, now the [[African Union]], has only achieved limited integration and unity of its member states. It is a reflection of the values of the Monrovia Group and a repudiation of the ideas of the Casablanca Group.

As well as disagreeing on the nature of African unity, the groups also took up conflicting positions on the then conflicts in [[Algeria]] and [[Congo Crisis|Congo]]. While the Casablanca Group's members pledged to support the Front de Liberation Nationale in its efforts fighting for Algerian independence from France, the [[Monrovia Group]] backed their enemies, the French.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Englebert &amp; Kevin C.

The '''Democracy Movement''' ({{lang-is|Lýðræðishreyfingin}}) was an [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[political movement]] that was established in 1998. In the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 Icelandic parliamentary election]] it received 0.6% of the vote and is thus the second largest party not in parliament.

== Post-mortem ==
The party has ceased to exist after the 2009 election. On 29 January 2013, spurred by the ruling made by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority v Iceland|EFTA court]] in the [[Icesave dispute]], the founder of the party helped to start a petition calling for the [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s previously having supported the ''Icesave bills'', now to withdraw from the parliament. At the bottom of the petition a note stated it had been powered by the domain of ''Democracy Movement''. The party however no longer exist as a party, as they no longer gather to yearly congress meetings - and also stopped running the website of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/01/29/vilja_ad_thingmenn_segi_af_ser/|title=Want MPs to resign|language=Icelandic|publisher=Mbl.is|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC''' is an [[EU Directive]] relating to [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and chocolate products. Most notably, this directive allows chocolate to contain up to 5% non-cocoa vegetable fats. 

The [[Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs]] has attempted to resist the effects of this directive by introducing the [[AMBAO]] certification scheme, which certified that chocolate carrying the AMBAO mark was produced without vegetable fat substitution.

The '''flag of [[Mon State]]''' depicts a [[Hamsa (bird)|hamsa]] in the centre of a red background. The current flag was approved by the [[Mon State Hluttaw]] and officially adopted on 8 June 2018.&lt;ref name="bni8618" /&gt;

In local legend, the [[Bago, Myanmar|city of Bago]], which was founded by the [[Mon people]], was established on the location where a hamsa sought refuge during a massive flood, hence the adoption of the bird on the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kuipers |first1=Ludo |title=Mon State {{!}} Flag {{!}} Myanmar {{!}} OzOutback |url=https://ozoutback.com.au/Myanmar/flags/slides/21_Mon_State.html |website=ozoutback.com.au |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former flag ==
Mon State's former flag, used until the adoption of the current flag on 8 June 2018, depicted a hamsa on a dark blue background and had "Mon State" ({{my|မွန်ပြည်နယ်}}) written underneath it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mon State (Myanmar) |url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mm-mon.html |website=www.crwflags.com |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flag of Bago Region]] is very similar to the former flag of Mon State, but its hamsa and text have different proportions and designs.

'''Franceville''' (present-day [[Port Vila]]) was a municipality located on [[Efate]], or Sandwich Island. It was established in 1889 in order to gain basic legal status, during the period when the [[New Hebrides]] was a [[neutral territory]] under the loose jurisdiction of a [[Anglo-French Joint Naval Commission|joint Anglo-French naval commission]].

In 1878, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] declared all of the New Hebrides to be [[neutral territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vanuatu.usp.ac.fj/library/Online/Texts/Pacific_archive/New%20Hebrides/1.Agrrement%20between%20Britain%20and%20France%20respecting%20the%20independence%20of%20the%20New%20Hebrides,%20January-FEbruary%201878.PDF|title = Arrangement between Great Britain and France, respecting the Independence of the New Hebrides Group|date = Jan–Feb 1878|accessdate = 2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the protection of the French and British citizens in New Hebrides, a [[Anglo-French Joint Naval Commission|joint naval commission]] was established under the Convention of 16 October 1887. However, the convention claimed no jurisdiction over internal native affairs.

The lack of a functional government led to rising discontent among the colonists. The French were especially inconvenienced because French law only recognized marriages when contracted under a civil authority (the nearest one being in [[New Caledonia]]), whereas British law recognized marriages conducted by local clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Le Gouz de Saint-Seine|first = Jean|year = 1897|title = Notice sur les Nouvelles-Hébrides|work = Mémoires de la Société bourguignonne de geographie et d'histoire|volume = 13|pages = 413–414|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KLIKAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdiol |first=Julien |year=1908 |title=Condition internationale des Nouvelles-Hebrides |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZN81AAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1889, Franceville declared itself an independent commune under the leadership of elected [[mayor]]/[[president]] [[Ferdinand Albert Chevillard|Ferdinand-Albert Chevillard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelatan |first=Louis |year=1889 |title=Lettres calédoniennes |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_AVAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', Aug 26, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Commune' of Franceville," ''North Otago Times'' (New Zealand), Sep 5, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; and with its own red, white and blue flag with five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Imhaus|first = E.N.|year = 1890|title = Les Nouvelles-Hébrides: avec une carte et sept gravures|pages = 154–160|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t-gVAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Colin (1955), ''Islands of Men: A Six-part Book about Life in Melanesia'', p 133&lt;/ref&gt;

This community became one of the first [[self-governing]] nations in recorded history to practice [[universal suffrage]] without distinction of sex or race.&lt;ref&gt;"Wee, Small Republics: A Few Examples of Popular Government," ''Hawaiian Gazette'', Nov 1, 1895, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although the district's population at the time consisted of about 500 natives and fewer than 50 whites, only white males were permitted to hold office. One of its elected presidents was [[R. D. Polk]], a native of [[Tennessee]] and relative of [[James K. Polk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Wee, Small Republics: A Few Examples of Popular Government," ''Hawaiian Gazette'', Nov 1, 1895, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Some Little Republics," ''New York Evangelist'', Feb 20, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new government was soon suppressed, and by June 1890, Franceville as a commune was reported to have been "practically broken up."&lt;ref&gt;"Latest Cable News: Australian News," ''The West Coast Times'' (New Zealand), June 28, 1890, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; An 1891 census reported 29 adult Europeans, making it the largest European settlement in the New Hebrides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=VILA—THE TOWN THAT JUST GREW | journal=[[Pacific Islands Monthly]] : PIM | publication-date=1969-06-01 | volume=40 | issue=6 | pages=95 | issn=0030-8722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the naval commission was replaced by a more structured British-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">The '''Garda Mounted Support Unit''' ({{lang-ga|Marcaonad an Gharda Síochaná}}) is the [[Mounted Police|horseback mounted division]] of the [[Garda Síochána]].

It is part of the Operational Support Unit which provides specialist support to Gardaí nationwide. The Operational Support Unit also includes the [[Garda Water Unit|Water Support]], [[Garda Dog Unit|Dog Support]] and [[Garda Air Support Unit|Air Support]] units.

==History and Formation==
Historically, the predecessor to the Garda Mounted unit was the Dublin Horse Police which was part of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]].  This was disbanded in 1913 due to a lack of suitable horses for military requirements in Britain. The Garda Mounted Unit was formed in 1998 when the [[North Yorkshire Police]] disbanded its mounted unit allowing the Gardaí to acquire its horses and equipment. It became operational on 17 May that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipaireland.com/IPA%20Journal%20Feb%2008/Fingal%20Feb%2008.pdf International Police Association ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052615/http://www.ipaireland.com/IPA%20Journal%20Feb%2008/Fingal%20Feb%2008.pdf |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Operation==
The unit has its base in the [[Phoenix Park]] with stables at [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] and not at the Garda Headquarters. The Unit has a strength of Two Sergeants and Sixteen Gardaí with fourteen horses with plans for expansion to fifteen horses. The [[Irish Draught]] Horse is the preferred breed for the Mounted Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishdraught.ie/index.php/garda/RID-Geldings-and-the-Garda.html Irish Draught Horse Association ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0665/D.0665.200810230104.html Oireachtass reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609200548/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0665/D.0665.200810230104.html |date=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Units general duties are high visibility crime prevention and include:-
*Community Policing.
*Event Policing.
*Support to mainstream Garda operations.
*Crowd Control &amp; Public Order.
*Searches for Missing Persons in inaccessible Areas.

==Operations==
The Garda Mounted Unit typically attends at large public gatherings such as sporting occasions and concerts as well as other events such as the [[Ballinasloe Horse Fair]], the [[Dublin Horse Show]] at the [[Royal Dublin Society|RDS]] and [[National Ploughing Championships]]. It also attends the Dublin [[St Patricks Day]] parade and other State Occasions on a ceremonial basis. The Mounted Unit also attended the  2009 [[All-Ireland Hurling Final]]

== Timeline of introductions ==
{{Main|Coverage of Google Street View}}
Service in Japan was introduced on August 4, 2008. Japan's coverage was initially concentrated in five areas with a total of 10 camera icons. The service has faced criticisms from bloggers in Japan of cultural insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2008-special-coverage/japan-and-google-street-view-2008/ Japan and Google Street View], special coverage page at ''Global Voices Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2011, Google announced that, in India, capturing of Street View images in [[Bangalore]], the capital of the state of [[Karnataka]], had started. However, Google Street View was banned from Bangalore on June 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/175795/google-street-view-blocked-bangalore |title=Google Street View blocked in Bangalore |work=[[IT World]] |date=June 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2011, Google has revealed that its Street View feature will be introduced to the country in association with the Tourism Authority of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2011/09/02/thailand-set-to-get-google-street-view/ |title=Thailand set to get Google Street View - TNW Asia |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2011, Google started to collaborate with Tourism Malaysia to record Malaysian locations to be featured on its Google Map Street View.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Science%2Band%2BTech/Story/A1Story20110903-297503.html |title=Malaysian streets on Google |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2012, Google Street View was launched in South Korea starting with imagery from the country's capital, [[Seoul]], as well as South Korea's second largest city, [[Busan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sun-Gi Hong |author2=Product Manager |author3=South Korea |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/01/take-tour-of-south-korea-using-street.html |title=Google Lat Long: Take a tour of South Korea using Street View |publisher=Google-latlong.blogspot.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Street View in Jordan]] was launched in November 2015 which included 43 archaeological sites. On the announcement day, Queen Rania wrote on the announcement and praised tourism enhancing efforts in [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/jordan-street-view.html|title=Official Google Blog: Discover Jordan&amp;#8217;s past and present in Google Maps|publisher=googleblog.blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As in other places, there has been controversy surrounding plans to bring Street View to various Asian countries.

In [[Israel]], there have been concerns that introducing the service could increase the risk of terrorism to which the region is prone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/22/business/la-fi-google-israel-20110222|title=Some in Israel warn against Google Street View|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|date=February 22, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], the Government rejected Google Street View. Official sources said the rejection came after a detailed analysis by security agencies and defense forces which feel that allowing Google to cover India would compromise country’s security interest. Security establishments became wary of allowing such image capturing given that planning for the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai is believed to have involved photographic reconnaissance of targets by Pakistani American David Coleman Headley. The Indian Government had plans to talk about Google street view in India, but in March 2018 Government of India finally rejected the Google Street view plan citing that this will compromise the country's security as India is constantly targeted by terrorist groups from Pakistan, especially in Kashmir valley.  

Google had to reshoot all images in Japan because the camera cars that took the original photographs were originally too high, leading to [[Google Street View privacy concerns|privacy concerns]]. Japanese houses are generally built quite close to the road. Roads are also narrow, often without pavements. Such factors led to privacy concerns with the original photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8049490.stm|title=Street View under fire in Japan|date=May 14, 2009|work=BBC|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police in [[South Korea]] raided offices in that country in order to determine if Street View was legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20013156-83.html|title=South Korea raids Google over Street View|last=Whitney|first=Lance|date=August 10, 2010|work=CNet News|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, people in Tambon Sa-iap village, [[Song District]] in Phrae Province, Thailand, mistakenly believed that the Street View car was surveying the village for the [[NIMBY|unwanted]] [[Kaeng Suea Ten Dam]] project and blocked it, not allowing it to take photographs. They also arrested the driver and interrogated him to determine if he was working for the dam project. He was released after swearing on the [[Buddha]] that his work was not related to the dam project. After confirming his story, the village's leaders apologized for the misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/easy/364735/what-google-street-view-worker-stopped-for-spying|title=What's Google?

==Background==
In '''House of the Wolf''' [[Ezzat el Kamhawi|el-Kamhawi]] deals with the lives of four generations of the Wolf (Al-Deeb) rural Egyptian family for more than one hundred and fifty years, monitoring the Egyptian and World history through the history of the family.

A novel of 272 pages of medium size, and thus is considered the biggest work for [[Ezzat el Kamhawi]], a writer known for his intensive language. In the novel, history remains a reference in the background, while man stands unwavering in the face of history and his personal fate.

'''Hulsig Church''' ({{lang-da|Hulsig Kirke}}) is a church located in the village of [[Hulsig]], {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], Denmark.

==History and description==
The little church which stands alone in the sand dunes close to the main road was completed in 1894. Designed by [[Vilhelm Ahlmann]] in the [[Neo-Romanesque]] style, the red-brick building consists of a triangular chancel and a nave. At the west end, there is a small bell tower with a spire. The painting on the [[altarpiece]] is a copy of [[Joakim Skovgaard]]'s ''Hyrden finder det bortløbne lam'' (The Shepherd finds the Lost Sheep). The organ from 1972 was designed by Peter Bruhn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkehistorie.dk/hjor/ki1450.htm|title=Hulsig Kirke|publisher=Danmarks Kirkehistorie|accessdate=29 December 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreign-language radio broadcast from KBS (before its restructure into a public broadcaster in March 1973) was started as "The Voice of Free Korea" in 1953. It officially became a part of KBS in July 1968. The station was renamed Radio Korea in March 1973, and then Radio Korea International in August 1994.

In July 2003, KBS World, an international television channel aimed at Koreans abroad, started broadcasting. In March 2005, Radio Korea International became KBS World Radio. Majority of the drama has their own subtitle depending on the country such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

It is a specialist channel serving children aged 5 to 16.

Since 1 January 2016 KiRaKa has broadcast 24 hours a day via [[Cable television|cable]], [[satellite]], and [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] in Germany, as well as worldwide on the Internet. Its programming at 19.05–20.00 daily as well as at 7.05–8.00 and 14.05–15.00 on Sundays is [[simulcast]] on [[WDR 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stundenplan zum Ausdrucken 2016|url=http://www.kiraka.de/fileadmin/user_upload/KiRaKa-Stundenplan-zum-Ausdrucken-2016.pdf|website=www.kiraka.de|publisher=Westdeutscher Rundfunk|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of children's programming is broadcast between 6.00 and 21.00 daily. Outside these hours KiRaKa plays music aimed at the 11-to-16 age group in a segment called ''Nachteule'' (Night Owls).

==Reception==
Originally, KiRaKa was a single programme slot in WDR 5's daily schedule. However, on 29 May 2009 KiRaKa took over the distribution channels formerly used by [[WDR 2 Klassik]]. Today, the service is available across Germany via the [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellite network, [[cable TV]] and [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] radio. It is also available internationally via the Internet and WDR's radio applications for [[smartphone]]s and tablets.&lt;ref name="Hoeren_app"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiraka.de/info/b/wie-kann-ich-kiraka-hoeren/|title=Wie kann ich KiRaKa hören?|publisher=WDR KiRaKa|language=German|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In September 2014, KiRaKa and another of WDR's radio stations, [[Funkhaus Europa]], jointly won the award for Best Innovation at the 2014 German Radio Awards.&lt;ref name="radiowoche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiowoche.de/deutscher-radiopreis-2014-die-gewinner/|title=Deutscher Radiopreis 2014 – Die Gewinner|last=Munder|first=Stephan|publisher=www.radiowoche.de|language=German|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was given to presenter-producers Tuba Tunçak and Mirjam von Jarzebowski for their collaboration on ''Kelebek im Konzert / Kelebek Konserde'' (Kelebek in Concert), a project aimed at introducing children to music from other cultures, starting at school level. It culminated in a live concert hosted by one German and one Turkish presenter, during which a variety of Eastern and Western music, as well as a fusion of the two, was played.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2686">The '''Lagos Plan of Action''' (officially the '''Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa, 1980&amp;ndash;2000''') was an [[Organisation of African Unity]]-backed plan to increase [[Africa]]'s self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="uneca"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uneca.org/itca/ariportal/docs/lagos_plan.pdf |title= Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa, 1980-2000 |accessdate= 2007-02-02 |date= April 1980 |work=  |publisher= Organisation of African Unity, republished by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] |pages= 104 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070106003042/http://uneca.org/itca/ariportal/docs/lagos_plan.PDF |archivedate= 2007-01-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

It was drafted in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] in April 1980, during a conference which included a variety of African leaders.&lt;ref name="africaaction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/aaf2.htm |title=What Africa Really Needs |accessdate=2007-02-02 |work=African Alternative Framework |publisher=[[Africa Action]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120205806/http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/aaf2.htm |archivedate=November 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been characterized as the collective response of African states to the World Bank's 1981 [[Berg report]].  The plan blamed Africa's economic crisis on the [[Structural Adjustment Program]]s of the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] and the vulnerability of African economies to worldwide economic shocks, such as the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref name="Eyoh 1998, pp.281-306"&gt;Eyoh, Dickson - ''African Perspectives on Democracy and the Dilemmas of Postcolonial Intellectuals'' in African Affairs, Africa Today , 45(3-4), 1998, pp.281-306: p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The report claimed that development in Africa could be achieved by a decreased reliance on raw material extraction, industrialization, global equality in trade relations and an increase in development aid from the international community.  Africanist scholars noted the absence in the report of any blame on, or calls for reform of, domestic governments of Africa.&lt;ref name="Eyoh 1998, pp.281-306"/&gt; This contrasts significantly with the Berg Report, which apportioned blame solely on the Africa leaders themselves, with the international community taking no responsibility for their part in Africa's demise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">The '''Leontovych Bandurist Capella''' was a male choir whose members accompanied themselves using a Ukrainian folk instrument known as a [[bandura]]. It was established in the [[displaced persons camp]]s in [[Germany]] in 1946 and had an active performance schedule until 1949.

In 1946 [[Hryhory Nazarenko]] together with the [[Petro Honcharenko|Honcharenko]] brothers left the [[Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus]] and started working on establishing a new bandurist capella. This new capella was formed in the British zone in Germany in the city of [[Goslar]] and was called the Leontovych Bandurist Capella after the Ukrainian composer [[Mykola Leontovych]].

The Capella consisted of some 18 members taught and later directed by Hryhory Nazarenko. They played on diatonic [[Kharkiv-style]] [[bandura]]s with the newly developed mechanisms designed by the Honcharenko brothers. Nazarenko busied himself writing out arrangements and repertoire from the works performed by the [[Poltava Bandurist Capella]] teaching Kharkiv-style playing. He coached the choir and taught the members to play the bandura, including many of the technical devices developed by [[Hnat Khotkevych]].

Each of the members required instruments. The Honcharenko brothers set up a workshop in the DP camp where they were made and taught some of the members to make banduras.

The establishment of the Leontovych Capella was a very successful experiment. In the 1930s Nazarenko was the concertmaster of the Poltava and later [[Combined Bandurist Capella]]. In this capacity he also was in charge of the music library often writing on the orchestral parts for all the performers. Because of this, Nazarenko was able to restore from his own memory a number of works by [[Hnat Khotkevych]].

After successfully touring Germany with numerous concerts, many of the members joined up with the [[Ukrainian Bandurist Capella]] when they emigrated to the United States in 1949. Others migrated to [[England]], South America and Australia where they were able to share their knowledge with the Ukrainian communities established there.

This page provides lists of '''best-selling comic book series''' to date. It includes Japanese [[manga]], [[American comic book]]s, and [[European comics]]. The series are listed according to the highest sales estimates as reported in reliable sources.

This list includes [[comic book]]s that have sold least 100{{nbsp}}million copies. There are three separate lists, for three different comic book publication formats ([[Trade paperback (comics)|collected comic book]] volumes, periodical [[Glossary of comics terminology#Comic book|floppy comic]] issues, and [[Comic anthology|comic magazines]]).

== Collected comic book volumes ==
[[File:One Piece, Volume 1.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''One Piece'' Vol. 1 (1997). ''[[One Piece]]'' is the [[List of best-selling fiction authors|best-selling comic by a single author]] and the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga]] of all time,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-%E2%80%9Cone-piece%E2%80%9D-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/118397-most-copies-published-by-a-single-author-for-the-same-comic-book-series&lt;/ref&gt; having sold the most [[Tankōbon|collected comic book volumes]].]]

This list is for comics printed in a traditional [[book]] format ([[paperback]] or [[hardcover]]), typically with a similar number of pages as [[novel]]s. The list includes [[graphic novel]]s printed exclusively in this format, and [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback/hardcover]] books which compile periodical comic chapters/issues into larger collected volumes. This list includes Japanese manga [[tankōbon]] volumes, American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], [[graphic novel]]s, and European [[comic album]]s.

These comic series were originally serialized either as chapters (typically 15-30 pages each) in comic publications (such as [[Comic anthology|comic magazines]]) or as single-page [[comic strip]]s in non-comic publications (such as newspapers), before being collected into a larger comic book volume (which compiles either multiple comic chapters or numerous comic strips). For comic series originally serialized as chapters in comic magazines or [[manga magazines]], their estimated circulation figures in those magazines are given in footnotes.

== Periodical single-issue floppy comics ==
[[Image:superman14.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Superman'' issue #14 (1942). ''[[Superman]]'' is the best-selling [[American comic book]] series, having sold the most periodical [[Glossary of comics terminology#Comic book|floppy comic]] issues.]]

This list is for single-issue [[Glossary of comics terminology#Comic book|floppy comics]], also known as the [[American comic book]] format. Unlike the paperback book format, floppy comics are thinner [[periodicals]] and stapled together. Each floppy comic issue is typically 20-40 pages, and usually consists of a single chapter (as opposed to a larger comic book volume that typically includes multiple chapters). A floppy comic is comparable to a [[Comic anthology|comic magazine]], but is thinner in size and is dedicated to a single character or group of characters (whereas a comic magazine is thicker and serializes multiple different unrelated series). Floppy comics are the most common publication format for American comics.
This list also contains periodical publications from other countries that are similarly dedicated to a single character or group of characters.

'''Morison KSi''' (previously Morison International &amp; KS International) is a global association of professional service firms (accounting, auditing, tax and business consulting). The association has 158 member firms in 88 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KSI, Morison merge|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160220/business-news/KSI-Morison-merge.603070|accessdate=4 August 2017|publisher=Times of Malta|date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morison KSi's status as an association is in accordance with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) audit code and the EU Statutory Audit Directive 2006/43/(EC) (“the 8th Directive”).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efaa.com/files/pdf/Audit/Directive%202006_43_EC.pdf EU Statutory Audit Directive 2006/43/(EC)]&lt;/ref&gt; Morison KSi is ranked by the International Accounting Bulletin as the 9th largest accounting association in the world. In January 2017, the combined revenue of all member firms was USD1.002 billion.&lt;ref name="atcom" /&gt;

== Morison International ==

The association is the legacy of [[Walter Morison]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5209332/Flight-Lieutenant-Walter-Morison.html Flight Lieutenant Walter Morison - The Telegraph, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; (26 November 1919 - 26 March 2009) a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who became a prisoner of war and was sent to [[Colditz]] for attempting to steal an enemy aircraft during the Second World War.

Following the war, Morison qualified as a chartered accountant at the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales]]. He was articled at Morison Stoneham, a firm established by his great uncle. Morison then worked at Coopers Bros, the firm that became [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], before returning to his family firm, Morison Stoneham. He led the firm as a senior partner through a period of great change from 1960 to 1981 before retiring. Morison Stoneham was the founding firm of Morison International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vrl-financial-news.com/accounting/intl-accounting-bulletin/issues/iab-2008/iab438/morison-international-appoints.aspx Morison International Appoints New Chief Executive - International Accounting Bulletin, October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217002846/http://www.vrl-financial-news.com/accounting/intl-accounting-bulletin/issues/iab-2008/iab438/morison-international-appoints.aspx |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate Governance==
Morison KSi is run under the direction of an international Board with 5 sub-regional Boards - Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America. Liza Robbins is the CEO of Morison KSi.

The main island of Puerto Rico is the least extensive but the third most populous of the four [[Greater Antilles]]:  [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], and Puerto Rico.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] often call the island ''Borinquen'', from ''Borikén'', its [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Taíno]] name.&lt;ref&gt;Allatson, Paul. Key Terms in Latino/a Cultural and Literary Studies, p. 47. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4051-0250-0}}.

Retrieved: February 21, 2008. (Based on the encyclopedia "Clásicos de Puerto Rico", 2nd. edition. Ed. Cayetano Coll y Toste. Publisher: Ediciones Latinoamericanas, S.A., 1972.).
&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''boricua'' and ''borincano'' derive from ''Borikén'' and ''Borinquen'' respectively, and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage. The island is also popularly known as "''La Isla del Encanto''", which translated means "The Island of Enchantment."

'''SES Platform Services GmbH''' (previously ASTRA Platform Services GmbH, now [[MX1 Ltd|MX1]]) is a subsidiary company  of [[SES S.A.|SES]] (owner and operator of the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites) based in [[Betzdorf, Luxembourg]] . From its headquarters in [[Unterföhring]] near [[Munich, Germany]], SES Platform Services operates a broadcasting centre, providing a wide range of services, including content management, [[playout]], [[encryption]], [[multiplexing]], [[uplink|satellite uplinks]] and other [[digital TV]] media broadcast services for the [[broadcast industry]].

Following completion of the acquisition by SES Platform Services of global digital media services provider [[RR Media]] in July 2016, the name of the merged company was changed to [[MX1 Ltd|MX1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES |date=July 6, 2016 |url= http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2016/22329451|title=SES ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF MERGER OF RR MEDIA WITH SES PLATFORM SERVICES|accessdate = July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before changing to MX1, SES Platform Services distributed more than 300 digital TV channels (including [[High-definition television|HD]])and radio stations, interactive services and data services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Platform Services GmbH |date=July 1, 2013 |url=http://www.ses-ps.com/15564899/01-07-13-sky_go|title=SES Platform Services takes charge of multiscreen encoding for Sky Go | accessdate = August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, SES Platform Services won an international tender by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], starting November 2013, to provide playout for the broadcast channels, [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], [[Cartoon Network (Germany)|Cartoon Network]], [[Glitz* (Germany)|glitz*]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[TNT Film]] and [[TNT Serie]] (in both SD and HD) for the German-speaking market, digitization of existing Turner content, and playout for Turner [[Video on demand|on-demand]] and [[Internet television|catch-up]] services in  Germany, Austria, Switzerland the Benelux region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Platform Services GmbH |date=August 28, 2013 |url=http://www.ses-ps.com/15889196/30-08-2013-Turner |title=SES Platform Services wins international tender by Turner Broadcasting |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130902173713/http://www.ses-ps.com/15889196/30-08-2013-Turner |archivedate=September 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally called DPC (Digital Playout Centre GmbH), SES Platform Services was founded in 1996 by Kirch, a German media company. The German Pay TV provider, Premiere (now [[Sky Deutschland]]) was part of the Kirch group and DPC provided (and, as SES Platform Services, continues to provide) Premiere/Sky Deutschland, as well as other private and public German broadcasters, playout, multiplexing, encrypted satellite uplinks and other media broadcast services. In June 2004, SES announced that it had bought the controlling interest in DPC from Premiere with the intention of launching an "open" pay-TV platform for Germany using Premiere-compatible digital set top boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=June 28, 2004 |url= http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2004/4441809 |title=SES ASTRA acquires 75.2% stake in DPC (Digital Playout Center) from PREMIERE| accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AstraPlatformServicesLogo.jpg|120px|right|The pre-2012 logo for the company before the change of name to SES Platform Services]]
In December 2004, a requirement for regulatory approval from the German Federal Cartels Office ([[Bundeskartellamt]]) meant that the deal was changed to 100% of DPC, to give SES sole ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=January 4, 2005 |url= http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2005/4413219|title= SES ASTRA completes acquisition of  100% of DPC digital playout center GmbH | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPC was later renamed to ASTRA Platform Services GmbH (APS), and in April 2012 to SES Platform Services.

In February 2016, it was announced that SES Platform Services had agreed, subject to regulatory approvals, to purchase [[RR Media]], a global digital media services provider to the broadcast and media industries, based in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=RR Media |date=February 26, 2016 |url= http://www.rrmedia.com/pages/latest-news---february-26-2016|title=RR Media to Merge with SES Platform Services|accessdate = February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
[[File:Parabolic antennas Astra Platform Services Unterföhring DE 2010-06-09.jpg|thumb|SES Platform Services [[uplink]] dishes in [[Unterföhring]]]]
The main services provided to broadcasters by SES Platform Services are Content Management, Playout, Encryption, Distribution and Interactive services. Customers include Sky Deutschland and [[ProSiebenSat.1]] in Germany, Top TV in South Africa, channels such as Home Shopping Europe, [[Deutsches Sportfernsehen|DSF]], [[Tele 5]], [[9Live]], and [[DMAX (TV channel)|DMAX]], and most German [[HDTV]] channels, including those from Discovery, and Anixe.

SES Platform Services' content management encompasses digitization of tape-based content, format conversion of video files, quality control, tape storage (now being superseded by digital storage), and a growing digital archive service with integrated digital asset management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES |date=April 8, 2011 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2011/4493190|title=ASTRA PLATFORM SERVICES OPENS NEW PLAYOUT CENTRE | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SES Platform Services uses the DIVArchive digital archiving system from Front Porch Digital with (as of mid 2009), over 1 PB capacity storing tens of thousands of hours of content. New material is added at the rate of about 1000–2000 hours per month. Although SES Platform Services still provides videotape storage, this has reduced by more than half since digital archiving was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;FP Digital [http://www.fpdigital.com/Products/CaseStudies/APS_casestudy_letter.pdf  ''Case Study: Astra Platform Services GmbH'']. Company factsheet. Retrieved July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

SES Platform Services undertakes the preparation and playout of content from tape or digital files according to the customer's supplied schedule.  SES Platform Services provides customers with visual quality control, the incorporation of on-screen branding and graphics (in 2D or 3D), [[EPG]] data and expandable services that range from automatic small channel start-up systems to high-end systems with full-time monitoring and support.

Where needed, interactive services can also be provided to broadcasters, including HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV). SES Platform Services also designs and develops broadcasters’ web pages, and has developed the Blucom interactive TV-service that combines broadcasting and mobile technologies to offer services such as programme announcements, weather, lottery and sports results, and further programme information. Blucom enables interaction such as voting, downloads, chats, and advertising. It also gives mobile phones the ability to stream live TV broadcasts. Blucom synchronizes TV content with the additional information in real-time. Content is sent to a set-top box via satellite, then to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, or directly to the mobile phone via [[UMTS]]/[[GPRS]]. The return channel operates from the viewer’s mobile via [[SMS]] or UMTS/GPRS.

For pay-TV broadcasts, SES Platform Services provides channel encryption for subscription and pay-per-view protection with [[Conax]], [[Cryptoworks]], Irdeto, [[Nagravision]], and [[NDS Group|NDS]] [[conditional access]] systems using [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] simulcrypt operation for broadcasts using multiple conditional access systems in parallel, this being a common practice in "free-to-air"(FTA) satellite TV broadcast markets such as Germany. SES Platform Services also provides Microsoft or Flash digital rights management for Internet streamed channels.

Although the majority of SES Platform Services broadcasting traffic is digital television channels in SD or HD uplinked to the Astra satellites, SES Platform Services can also distribute programming to mobiles as on-demand content, and as live or on-demand video over the Internet using Windows Media Player, QuickTime or Flash.

In April 2011, SES Platform Services opened a new playout centre at its headquarters in Unterföhring to handle expansion of the company, and its client list. The new network operations centre is in a purpose-built new building with the latest technologies including air conditioning based on groundwater cooling, fully redundant power distribution system, and LED screens and LED room lighting in the master control room to minimise heat generation. The old premises are being retained as back-up facilities and the new centre is expected to cope with growth for the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;''SES Expands On The Ground'' TVB Europe June 2011 pp11&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 SES Platform Services launched its Fluid Hub managed cloud service for management, playout and distribution of video content for studios, content creators, broadcasting companies, telcos/platforms and other customers. By October 20, the service had 10 customers including Fox International Channels Germany and Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES |date=October 10, 2015|url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2015/21629284|title=SES PLATFORM SERVICES’ FLUID HUB PASSES 10-CUSTOMER MILESTONE| accessdate = October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1504">'''Solimana''' was a minor [[West Africa]]n state of the nineteenth century with a capital at the fortress town of [[Falaba]].  Situated on rich [[African slave trade|slave-trading]] routes in what is now [[Sierra Leone]], Solimana was visited in 1822 by [[Alexander Gordon Laing]] and in 1869 by [[William Winwood Reade]], making it nominally [[United Kingdom|British]].  

In 1884, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] conqueror [[Samori]] joined the king of [[Kaliere]] in attacking Solimana, then under the rule of [[Manga Sewa]].  After Samori's general [[N'fa Ali]] destroyed a number of surrounding villages, the Mandinka forces began a five-month siege of Falaba itself.  With the city's residents starved nearly to death, Manga Sewa gathered his family in Falaba's [[gunpowder]] magazine and lit a torch, simultaneously killing himself and breaching Falaba's walls.

The territory of Solimana was then briefly assimilated into Samori's [[Wassoulou Empire]].  Following Samori's own fall several years later, it was claimed by the British and incorporated into the [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Crown Colony of Sierra Leone]].

'''''The Dark Volume''''' is a novel in the [[Steampunk]] genre by [[GW Dahlquist]]. It is his second novel after 2006's [[The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters]].

==Synopsis==

The novel follows the ongoing adventures of the three protagonists of ''[[The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters]]'' and is set in what appears to be an alternative Victorian past in a series of alternative Baltic or Teutonic states.  The story began as a sequel to Dahlquist's earlier, complex fantasy novel, but eventually develops into a much larger work.

==Characters in ''The Dark Volume''==

===Major characters===
The action revolves around three protagonists. Celeste Temple, Cardinal Chang and Dr Svenson who represent three aspects of iconic Victorian characterization. Celeste Temple represents the archetypal headstrong young Victorian heroine. Cardinal Chang represents the violent underclass in 19th century society, but whose character is tempered and enriched by a private and introspective love of poetry. Svenson, a military surgeon represent superior intellect and moral development constrained by a bond of duty for an aristocratic master who fails to be worth of his respect.

The main action in the Dark Volume revolves around these three characters personal interactions and their attempts to achieve their differing goals while protecting each other persons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''''The Sushi Economy''''' by [[Sasha Issenberg]] is a nonfiction book about [[sushi]] and [[globalization]]. ''The Sushi Economy'' uses the booming business, culture, and cuisine of raw fish to examine how the integration of local economies through trade works in practice. The book takes the form of a global travelogue ranging from [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] fishermen in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Japan]]'s [[Tsukiji]] fish market in Tokyo, to tuna pirates in the [[Mediterranean]], to an [[Austin, Texas]] sushi bar, to the global restaurant empire of [[Nobu Matsuhisa]] and the tuna ranchers of Port Lincoln, South Australia . The book synthesized widely available information on the global impact of Japan's appetite for seafood.

'''Unity and Renewal''' ({{lang-ca|Unitat i Renovació}}, UiR) was a local [[political party]] in [[Canillo]], [[Andorra]].

==History==
Although political parties were not legalised until 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p153&lt;/ref&gt; the party contested the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1992|1992 elections]] in the [[Canillo]] parish, winning three of the four seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1992/04/13/pagina-13/33519070/pdf.html Government's argument wins absolute majority in Andorra] La Vanguardia, 13 April 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1997|1997 elections]], it was one of several local parties to ally with the [[Liberal Party of Andorra|Liberal Union]] to run in parish constituencies.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen D]] &amp; Stöver P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p162 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UiR won two seats as the alliance won a total of 16 of the 28 seats in the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council]],&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p165&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a government under [[Marc Forné Molné]].

The World Unlimited '''water speed record''' is the officially recognised fastest speed achieved by a water-borne vehicle. The current record is {{convert|511|km/h|abbr=on}} - achieved by Australian Ken Warby in the ''[[Spirit of Australia]]'' in 1978.

The record is one of the sporting world's most hazardous competitions. Two official attempts to beat the 1978 record have resulted in the death of the driver; but despite this there are several teams working to make further attempts.

The record is ratified by the [[Union Internationale Motonautique]] (UIM).

==Before 1910==
[[File:Jsj-110-feiseen.jpg|thumb|right|William Cogswell's steam yacht ''Feiseen'', which set a new world speed record on 25 August 1893 of {{convert|50.8|km/h|abbr=on}}.]]

==1910s==
In 1911 a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} stepped planing hull, ''Dixie IV'', designed by Clinton Crane, became the first gasoline powered vessel to break the water speed record.
Beginning in 1908 [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and engineer [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin]] began experimenting with powered [[watercraft]]. In 1919, with Baldwin piloting their [[HD-4]] [[hydrofoil]], a new world water speed record of {{convert|70.86|mi/h|km/h|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} was set on [[Bras d'Or Lake]] at [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]].

==1920s==

In 1920, [[Garfield Wood]] set a new water speed record of {{convert|120.492|kph|mph|abbr=on}} on the [[Detroit River]], using a new boat called ''Miss America''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the following twelve years, Wood built nine more ''Miss America''s and broke the record five times.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Increased public interest generated by the speeds achieved by Wood and others led to an official speed record being ratified in 1928. The first person to try a record attempt was Wood's brother, George. On 4 September 1928, he drove ''Miss America VII'' to {{convert|149.40|km/h|1|abbr=on}} on the Detroit River.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The next year, Gar Wood took the same boat up a waterway Indian Creek, Miami and reached {{convert|149.86|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==1930s==
Like the [[land speed record]], the water record was destined to become a scrap for national honour between Britain and the USA. American success in setting records spurred [[Castrol]] Oil chairman Lord Wakefield to sponsor a project to bring the water record to Britain. Famed land speed racer and racing driver Sir [[Henry Segrave]] was hired to pilot a new boat, ''[[Miss England (Speedboat)#Miss England I|Miss England]]''. Although the boat wasn’t capable of beating Wood's ''[[Miss America (speedboat)|Miss America]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Robert E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |title=The Speediest Craft Afloat |date=June 1929 |work=[[Popular Science Monthly]] |via=Books.google.com |accessdate=2012-06-25 |pages=20–21, 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British team did gain experience, which was put into an improved boat. ''[[Miss England II]]'' was powered by two [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[aircraft engine]]s and seemed capable of beating Wood's record.

On 13 June 1930 Segrave piloted ''Miss England II'' to a new record of {{convert|158.94|km/h|1|abbr=on}} average speed during two runs on [[Windermere]], in Britain's [[Lake District]]. Having set the record, Segrave set off on a third run to try to improve the record further. Unfortunately during the run, the boat struck an object in the water and capsized, with both Segrave and his co-driver receiving fatal injuries.

Following Segrave's death, ''Miss England II'' was salvaged and repaired. [[Kaye Don]] was chosen as the new driver for 1931. However, during this time, Gar Wood recaptured the record for the U.S. at {{convert|164.41|km/h|abbr=on}}. A month later on [[Lake Garda]], Don got the record  back with {{convert|177.387|km/h|1|abbr=on}}. In February, 1932 Wood responded, nudging the mark to {{convert|179.779|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

In response to the continued American challenge, the British team built a new boat, ''[[Miss England III]]''. The design was an evolution of the predecessor, with a squared-off [[stern]] and twin [[propeller]]s being the main improvements. Don took the new boat to [[Loch Lomond]], Scotland, on 18 July 1932, improved the record first to {{convert|188.985|km/h|abbr=on}}, then to {{convert|192.816|km/h|abbr=on}} on a second run.{{clarify|date=September 2017|is this the second official record, or the second of two passes?}}

Determined to have the last word over his great rival, Gar Wood built another new ''Miss America''. ''[[Miss America X]]'' was 12&amp;nbsp;metres long, powered by four supercharged [[Packard]] aeroplane engines.&lt;ref name=BANG&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohnes|first1=Brian|title=8 Ton Sledge: Gar Wood’s 7,000hp Miss America X Boat Owned The World In ’32 and ’33|url=https://bangshift.com/general-news/videos/8-ton-sledge-gar-woods-7000hp-miss-america-x-boat-owned-the-world-in-32-and-33-video/|website=BangShift.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algonac, S.U.A. Gar Wood batte il record mondiale per motoscafi con 125,42 miglia all'ora|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcPYzUDrpUM|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 1932 Wood broke the 200&amp;nbsp;km/h barrier, driving his new boat to {{convert|200.943|km/h|abbr=on}}. It would prove the end of an era. Don declined to attempt any further records, and ''Miss England III'' went to the [[National Maritime Museum]] in London, where it remains on display. Wood also opted to scale down his involvement in racing and returned to running his businesses. Somewhat ironically, both record-breakers lived into their 90s. Wood died in 1971, Don in 1985.

==Boat design changes==
Wood's last record would be one of the final records for a conventional, single-[[keel]] boat. In June 1937 [[Malcolm Campbell]], the world-famous land speed record breaker, drove ''[[Blue Bird K3]]'' to a new record of {{convert|203.31|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Lake Maggiore]]. Compared to the massive ''Miss America X'', ''K3'' was a much more compact craft. It was 5&amp;nbsp;metres shorter and had one engine to X's four.

Despite his success, Campbell was unsatisfied by the relatively small increase in speed. He commissioned a new ''Blue Bird'' to be built. ''[[Blue Bird K4]]'' was a ‘three pointer’ [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]. Unlike conventional [[powerboat]]s, which have a single keel, with an indent, or ‘step’, cut from the bottom to reduce drag, a hydroplane has a [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] base with two sponsons fitted to the front, and a third point at the rear of the hull. When the boat increases in speed, most of the hull lifts out of the water and runs on the three contact points. The positive effect is a reduction in drag and an increase in [[power-to-weight]] ratio - the boat is lighter as it doesn't need many engines to push it along. The downside is that the three-pointer is much less stable than the single keel boat. If the hydroplane's [[angle of attack]] is upset at speed, the craft can somersault into the air, or nose-dive into the water.

Campbell's new boat was a success. In 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, he took it to [[Coniston Water]] and increased his record by {{convert|18|km/h|abbr=on}}, to {{convert|228.11|km/h|abbr=on}}.

==1940s==
The return of peace in 1945 brought with it a new form of power for the record breaker – the [[jet engine]]. Campbell immediately renovated ''Blue Bird K4'' with a [[De Havilland Goblin]] jet engine. The result was a curious-looking craft, whose shoe-like profile led to it being nicknamed ‘The Coniston Slipper’. The experiment with jet-power was not a success and Campbell retired from record-attempts. He died in 1948.

==1950s==
[[File:MOHAI - Slo-mo-shun IV 01.jpg|thumb|''Slo-Mo-Shun IV'' on display at Seattle's [[Museum of History and Industry]].]]
[[File:MOHAI - Slo-mo-shun IV Allison engine 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Allison V-1710]] aircraft engine that powered ''Slo-Mo-Shun IV''.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bluebird K7.jpg|thumb|''Bluebird K7'' on Coniston Water on the 14 December 1966. Photo by AE Whitham]] --&gt;
On 26 June 1950, ''[[Stanley Sayres|Slo-Mo-Shun]] IV'' improved on Campbell's record by {{convert|29|km/h|abbr=on}}. Powered by an  [[Allison V-1710]] aircraft engine, the boat was built by Seattle [[Chrysler]] dealer [[Stanley Sayres]] and was able to run {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} because her hull was designed to lift the top of the propeller out of water when running at high speed. This phenomenon, called ‘prop riding’, further reduced drag.

In 1952, Sayres drove ''Slo-Mo-Shun'' to {{convert|287.25|km/h|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|29|km/h|abbr=on}} increase on his previous record.

The renewed American success persuaded Malcolm Campbell's son, [[Donald Campbell|Donald]], who had already driven ''Blue Bird K4'' to within sight of his father's record, to make a further push for the record. However, ''Blue Bird K4'' was by now 12 years old, with a 20-year-old engine, and Campbell struggled to reach the speeds of the Seattle-built boat. In late 1951, she was written-off when it suffered a structural failure at {{convert|170|mph|order=flip|abbr=on}} on Coniston Water.

At this time, yet another land speed driver entered the fray. Englishman [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]], was hoping to reach {{convert|200|mph|order=flip|abbr=on}} in his jet-powered ''[[Crusader (speedboat)|Crusader]]''. A radical design, the ''Crusader'' reversed the ‘three-pointer’ design, placing the sponsons at the rear of the hull. On 29 September 1952 Cobb tried to beat the world record on [[Loch Ness]] but, while travelling at an estimated {{convert|210|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, ''Crusader'''s front plane collapsed and the craft instantly disintegrated. Cobb was retrieved from the water but had already died of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].

Two years later, on 8 October 1954, another man would die trying for the record. Italian textile magnates [[Mario Verga and Francesco Vitetta]], responding to a prize offer of 5&amp;nbsp;million [[Italian lira|lire]] from the Italian Motorboat Federation to any Italian who broke the world record, built a sleek piston-engined hydroplane to claim the record. Named ''Laura III'', after Verga's daughter, the boat was fast but unstable. Travelling across Lake Iseo, in Northern Italy, at close to {{convert|306|km/h|abbr=on}}, Verga lost control of ''Laura III'', and was thrown out into the water when the boat somersaulted. Like Cobb, he died of shock.

Following Cobb's death, Donald Campbell started working on a new ''Bluebird'', ''[[Bluebird K7|K7]]'', a jet-powered hydroplane. Learning the many lessons from Cobb's ill-starred ''Crusader'', K7 was designed as a classic 3 pointer with sponsons forward alongside the cockpit. She was designed by Ken and Lewis Norris in 1953-54 and was completed in early 1955. It was powered by a [[Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl]] turbojet of {{convert|3500|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip}} thrust. K7 was of all-metal construction and proved to have extremely high rigidity.

Campbell and ''K7'' set a new record of {{convert|325.60|km/h|abbr=on}} on [[Ullswater]] in July 1955. Campbell and ''K7'' went on to break the record a further six times over the next nine years in the USA and England ([[Coniston Water]]), finally increasing it to {{convert|444.71|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Lake Dumbleyung]] in Western Australia in 1964. Campbell thus became the most prolific water speed record breaker of all time.

At the time Campbell set the absolute record, the piston-powered propeller-driven record was held by the George Simons' ''Miss U.S. I'' &lt;ref&gt;http://missus1.com&lt;/ref&gt; at {{convert|322.54|km/h|abbr=on}}.  This record was set at Guntersville, Alabama in 1962 by Roy Duby and stood for 38 years.

==1967==
[[File:Lee Taylor, USA, Water speed record, 1967-06-30 (Lake Guntersville, on 'Hustler').jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Taylor (sailor)|Lee Taylor]] (USA), 1967-06-30, 285.22 mph on ''Hustler'' ([[Lake Guntersville]]).]].
Donald Campbell's ''Bluebird K7'' had been re-engined with a [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus]] jet rated at {{convert|4500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust. On 4 January 1967 he tried again. His first run averaged {{convert|475.2|km/h|abbr=on}} and a new record seemed in sight. Campbell applied ''K7'''s water brake to slow the craft down from her peak speed of {{convert|315|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} clear of the measured kilometre to a speed around {{convert|220|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Rather than waiting for the lake to settle again before starting the mandatory return leg, Campbell immediately turned around at the end of the lake and began his return run. At around {{convert|512|km/h|abbr=on}}, just as she entered the measured kilometre, Bluebird began to lose stability and 400&amp;nbsp;m before the end of the kilometre, Bluebird's nose lifted beyond its critical pitch angle and she started to rise out of the water at a 45&amp;nbsp;degree angle. The boat took off, somersaulted and then plunged nose-first into the lake, breaking up as she cartwheeled across the surface. Campbell was killed instantly. Prolonged searches over the next two weeks located the wreck, but it was not until May 2001 that Campbell's body was finally located and recovered. Campbell was buried in the churchyard at Coniston on 12 September 2001.

[[Lee Taylor (sailor)|Lee Taylor]], a Californian boat racer, in ''Hustler'' during a test run on [[Lake Havasu]], was unable to shut down the jet and crashed into the lakeside at over {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|-2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. ''Hustler'' was wrecked and Taylor was severely injured. He spent the following years recuperating, and rebuilding his boat. On 30 June 1967, on [[Guntersville, Alabama|Lake Guntersville]], Taylor and ''Hustler'' tried for the record, but the wake of some spectators' boats disturbed the water, forcing Taylor to slow down his second run, and he came up {{convert|2|mph|order=flip||abbr=on}} short. He tried again later the same day and succeeded in setting a new record of {{convert|459|km/h|abbr=on}}.

== 1977 ==
Until 20 November 1977 every official water speed record had been set by an American, Canadian, Irishman, or Briton. That day [[Ken Warby]] became the first Australian holder when he piloted his ''[[Spirit of Australia]]'' to 464.46&amp;nbsp;km/h (288.60&amp;nbsp;mph)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kenwarby.com/wwsr.htm {{self-published inline|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to beat Lee Taylor's record. Warby, who had built the craft in his back yard, used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the Spirit. On 8 October 1978 Warby travelled to [[Blowering Dam]], [[Australia]], and broke both the 480&amp;nbsp;km/h (300&amp;nbsp;mph) and 500&amp;nbsp;km/h barriers with an average speed of 511.12&amp;nbsp;km/h (317.6&amp;nbsp;mph). As he exited the course his peak speed as measured on a radar gun was approximately 552&amp;nbsp;km/h (345&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=gwr-warby-fastest&gt;{{cite web|title=Water speed record (fastest boat)|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/water-speed-record-(fastest-boat)/|website=guinnessworldrecords.com|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezl8Yb8idyY youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Warby's record still stands {{as of|2018|9|19|lc=y}}. There have only been two official attempts to break it, both resulting in the death of the driver.&lt;ref name=smh-40-years&gt;{{cite news |last1=Huxley|first1=John |title=Water speed record to be put to the test 40 years on as Spirit of Australia II takes shape |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/water-speed-record-to-be-put-to-the-test-40-years-on-as-spirit-of-australia-ii-takes-shape-20150212-13cq79.html |accessdate=7 August 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==
Lee Taylor tried to get the record back in 1980. Inspired by the land speed record cars ''[[Blue Flame (car)|Blue Flame]]'' and ''[[Budweiser Rocket]]'', Taylor built a rocket-powered boat, ''[[Discovery II (rocket boat)|Discovery II]]''. The {{convert|40|ft|m|0|adj=on}} long craft was a reverse three-point design, similar to John Cobb's ''Crusader'', albeit of much greater length.

Originally Taylor tested the boat on [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]] in Nevada but his backers demanded a more accessible location, so Taylor switched to [[Lake Tahoe]]. An attempt was set for 13 November 1980, but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable, Taylor decided against trying for the record. Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media, he decided to do a test run instead. At 432&amp;nbsp;km/h (270&amp;nbsp;mph) ''Discovery II'' started to become unstable. It has been speculated that it may have hit a swell. Whatever the cause, the boat's unstable lateral oscillations caused the left float to collapse, sending the boat plunging into the water. The cockpit section with Taylor's body was recovered three days later. The cockpit had not floated as intended and Taylor drowned as a result.

In 1989 [[Craig Arfons]], son of Walt Arfons, builder of the world's first jet car, and nephew of famed record breaker [[Art Arfons]], tried for the record in his all-composite fiberglass/Kevlar ''Rain X Challenger'', but died when the hydroplane somersaulted at 483&amp;nbsp;km/h (301.875&amp;nbsp;mph).

==Current projects==
Despite the high fatality rate, the record is still coveted by boat enthusiasts and racers. While a number of projects aiming for the record have been started, currently just those below appear to be active:

===''Quicksliver''===
The British ''Quicksliver''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quicksliver-wsr.com&lt;/ref&gt; project is managed by Nigel Macknight.
The design was initially based on concepts for a rear-sponsoned configuration by Ken Norris, who had worked with the Campbells on their 'Bluebird' designs. The design is of modular construction with the main body consisting of a front section with a steel spaceframe incorporating the engine, a [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] Mk.101, and the rear section a monocoque extending to the tail. The front sponsons are also modules, one of which contains the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Craft|url=http://www.quicksliver-wsr.com/the-craft/|publisher=Quicksliver-WSR|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Spirit of Australia II''===
Ken Warby is working with his son David on a new boat, powered by a jet engine taken from an  [[Fiat G.91]], to break the record.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huxley|first1=John|title=The Warby need for speed|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-warby-need-for-speed-20150110-12lnzh.html|accessdate=3 August 2017|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Warby hopes to claim his dad's world water speed record on Blowering Dam in 2017|url=http://www.riverinaleader.com.au/story/4380710/warbys-quest-to-claim-dads-crown/|accessdate=3 August 2017|issue=The Leader|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPIRIT OF AUSTRALIA II|url=http://warbymotorsport.com/Spirit_of_Australia_II.php|publisher=Warby Motorsport|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Jason |title=David Warby To Challenge Father’s World Water Speed Record |url=https://speedonthewater.com/in-the-news/5334-david-warby-to-challenge-father-s-world-water-speed-record |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2003, Ken Warby had built another boat, ''Aussie Spirit'' for a record attempt.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

===K777 Team for Great Britain===
The K777 Team is a combination of engineers, boat racers, boat builders, gas turbine specialists and Members of Windermere Boat Racing Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k777club.com/default.aspx |title=K777 Team |publisher=K777club.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built a controversial visual copy of Donald Campbell's ''Bluebird'' K7, though during its sole public appearance on Coniston Water in 2011 it failed to plane, partially sank, and ultimately collapsed its air intake trunking. A test on Loch Ken, in south-west Scotland, in October 2014 was also unsuccessful; although the boat did not sink, it was again unable to plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1967 Bluebird replica takes to the water at Loch Ken|url=http://www.itv.com/news/border/update/2014-10-29/1967-bluebird-replica-takes-to-the-water-at-loch-ken/|accessdate=15 March 2015|agency=ITN|publisher=ITN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dartagnan SP600 ===
Daniel Dehaemers is the Belgian challenger for the absolute water speed record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dartagnan-sp600.com/the-creator|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SP600 is of full carbon composite construction and is powered by a [[Rolls-Royce Limited#Aero engines|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour|Adour 104]] turbojet engine. The boat was planned to be tested during 2016. However, after finishing building the boat he died of cancer in 2018 before he managed to trial the craft. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uimpowerboating.com/NewsList.aspx?num=49&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uimpowerboating.com/Documents/Editor/documents/UIM%20Newsletter%20-%20June%202018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Longbow''===
A British Team, with a serving British Military pilot at the helm, are working together to build and run ''Longbow'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jet-hydroplane.uk&lt;/ref&gt;, a jet hydroplane, on lakes and lochs within the UK, for a British attempt upon the Outright World Water Speed Record.
